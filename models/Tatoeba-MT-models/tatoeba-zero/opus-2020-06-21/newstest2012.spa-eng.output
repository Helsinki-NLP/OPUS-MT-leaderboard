Parliament did not support an amendment to Tymoshenko
Parliament of Ukraine has rejected today the proposal to derogate the amendment of the section of the Criminal Code in which the leader of opposition Yulia Tymoshenko was condemned.
The amendment would open the doors to the excarcelation of the Minister's expression, but Parliamentarys rejected the proposal to reduce the penalties for economic crimes in the second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years of prison by the presumable signing of an agreement with Russia that was deceived for Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The sentence is not yet strong, the Court of Appeal has the obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was demonstrated that it was a political income of the regime, and even in the West, there have been doubts about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to be removed in paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code with which the former Prime Minister was condemned by 147 Members in the vote.
For its approval, 226 votes were required.
Libya's victory
The history of Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, has already losers.
Muammar the Gaddafi was entered in a secret place in the wilderness and without him there is no war.
It remains to define who the winner is
As it was already habitual in the region, Islamians win the elections, but now it is to dilute if it is moderate or radical.
The National Transition Council has entered into force the traditional law, the Sharia, which we already know in a certain manner.
Libya will become a country without crime, because the ladrons will be cut off their hand.
Women can already be forgotten to move to evacuate and posts waiting for their implementation and so on.
Instead of the person of the dictator, the society, composed of war tribes, will be joined by the Coran.
In Libya, a order will be established that we can't imagine and that we can't certainly.
However, our form of life is not the only or objectively the best, and I probably did not agree to those already mentioned libraries.
It is true that it is not surprised that Islamic fighters accept the help of the unfaithful dogs.
The only justification was that, from its view, the NATO attacks did not lead them to a United States general, but greatly, God, whose greatness had been held after each of the successful interventions.
When they are looking for winners in Libya, West is not among them.
We are assaulted in a shooting that is served by Islamics and our politicians to disfellowship a dictator in the person of a political partner without having guarantees of benefits.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not take care of Libya militaryly.
In this case, locals do not have a problem to exclude the "created" crowds
But, without occupation, will the oilers be made with the Libyan black gold only with good words?
It's quite possible, but may eventually western may presum the protection of human rights.
Always the followers of the share are not crushed.
Starting a new era of the crisis
France and the rest of Europe go to the castle of investors
A statistical torbelin has been extended by Europe
The individual States have published their data from GDP for Q3.
The Czech economy in the interquatorial period has been launched while France and Germany have grown.
However, the market of goods today has cut records.
Investors are not only fixed in Italy, but also in Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of Eurozone, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates on economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP increased by 0.5%, from France to 0.4%
Both countries have publicized the data of the second quarter, and in Germany there has improved more than expected (only 0.3 per cent, instead of expected 0.1 per cent), although in France there was a slight reduction of 0.1 per cent (original data talked about stamping).
Czech economy has grown a total of 1,5% in the third quarter of this year.
However, in the interquartery period, the brutal internal product (PIB) has been established and, according to the SUP, the tendency to gradual disadvantagement in the growth of economic development is complied with.
The results are even worse than the analysts' predictions.
Main events:
In the meantime, the Czech economy has grown in the third quarter of this year by 1,5%, but it has been quarterly established.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to the previous and statistically revised data, increased 0.5%.
The economy of the Eurozone and also of the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, increased by 0.2%, which corresponds to the expectations of analists.
The Greek economy has fallen internally at 5,2%.
The interest of their goods to ten years is 28.45%.
The interest of the Italian and Spanish goods has grown up to critical limits.
The problem began to affect Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
The interests of the cheeks to ten years are maintained in 4%, although the situation is in the area.
In Germany, votes are made to say that the ECB should grant funds at the latest time.
Cheques are classified for the Eurocopa.
They won 1:0 and celebrate the classification with a first 200 million.
The fatball team is completed with the most difficult committee of the whole time!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent śech and the brilliant port Petr Jiiraček, the victory was given for 1:0.
The Czech team, together with a good dose of luck in the second time, was greatly defended by the attacks of the local team, so it will not miss the quote of the European campaign.
IHNED.cz continued detailedly to the development of the party in a minute reporter.
There was almost no emotion in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the slaughter of the local team towards the end, and also to the excellent game of śech and the Jiiraček heroic, wined by 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrated his passenger at the Campeonato of Europe.
As a result of the Checa’s correct defense, the montenegrins did not press until the second half.
The two offenders of the party were Damjanovič and Vučinič, which let them pass two major occasions.
In addition, thanks to the Genial Petr śech, the 11th Czech will not miss the quote of the Copa of Europe, so that the ships of the national fatbol will reach a nearly 200 million corones.
Since the first minutes, a good game was given.
Both teams were played so only in maintaining the lines and playing nothing more around the center of the field.
There was no pressure of local players in the first half, patented to the other field in defence, just what the Czech defense would have to avoid.
Iranian students are ready to die for the nuclear programme of their country.
They formed a human shooting.
A number of hundreds of university students formed human sculptures around nuclear installations in Iran.
They want to express their support to the nuclear programme of their country before a possible Israeli attack.
Students began to pray on Tuesday at the middle of the installations and then dying Slogans to the United States and Israel.
Several hundreds of university students formed the march in the Iranian town of Isfahán human sculpts around the nuclear technological center in which they worked with uranium.
They intend to demonstrate that they are willing to defend the nuclear programme of their country with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a recent report, observed that Iran, according to all the indications, was disappointed to achieve nuclear weapons.
Israel speaks of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear installations.
Students began to pray at the average before the nuclear installations of Isfahan and then launched slogans of death against U.S. and Israel.
In the case of an attack, whose goal would paralyze the Iranian nuclear programme, would be achieved, according to Israeli sources, not only the center of Isfahan, but also the Natanz installations, where uranium is enriched.
Daymenu of a obeyed child: not swimming and buried dinner
More than a third of the children under the age of 9 to 13 years have overweight problems, where overweight affects 9 per cent of the school population and 5 per cent obesity.
Obedient children are conducted in most families with a lifestyle that is not healthy, according to current investigations.
There is again a demonstration of the importance of the environment where it grows to a healthy development of the person, as well as of the models that serve.
In the table, for example, obsessed children are feeded by embryos at least two times that children of family with normal weight.
To dinner, more than 19% of the obediences had fresh patatas on the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program "Assistance is not a possibility".
In children with overweight there is no habit of sporting, which is applicable to the majority of the current families, where only 15% of the children responded that their parents, at least once a week, find time for the physical exercise.
Inquisition carried out at 900 children
The survey was carried out at the end of the last school year and participated in almost 900 children of Base Education of Checa.
It was already the second edition of the programme "Obsiness is not a possibility", which supports the Health Society of General Health and the Unilever Company.
Together, they have participated in the project more than 12 000 children from 4 to 8th course.
A adequate and sufficient food in the family are decisive factors, which make a significant decrease in the number of children with overweight and even obesity.
" Only half of the children surveyed have responded to five daily foods according to the regime: breakfast, lunch, food, mere and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for healthy diet," collects one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast but with enbuted for dinner
Experts advise that, in a healthy development, the details are also important, such as have a fixed time for the family breakfast.
Nevertheless, only 23 per cent of school families are disappointed at the same time.
In most families, each one is alone.
But the worst was to find out that in 10% of homes there is nothing.
The breakfast, however, is the basis of a right daily diet.
The study shows that in the families of obedience children are consumpted more freshly.
Almost all - independently of weight - drinks at daily refrigerators (70%).
Normally, more than 40% of the children surveyed, however, these results are reduced by less than half, only 15%.
Manufacture your diet
The next stage of the study was possible to create their own foods from all possible offers according to their enjoyments and opinions.
"The food preferences of checa children under age between 12 and 15 years, from the view of healthy food, are very different from the ideal."
Between your favorite food, the pasta, the flesh and the tears are found
"It is over all alarming popularity of the sweet refresques," warns in the final report of the study.
As the main food, the palm takes the pasta and continues near the bird flesh.
Practically, children are always rejecting fishing and vegetable grain.
Change to healthy habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their food habits if they receive the right information.
"In the monitoring group of participants in the study, which filled the questionnaire after the end of the prevention program " obesity is not a possibility", in many cases, a significant change was made in favour of the principles of healthy feeding", is pointed out in the results of the study.
He calls attention, for example, regarding sweet refrigerators, where many children would begin to prefer normal and flowing water.
The children would also choose more frequently in the questionnaire of bird and fishing for the main food, and would be limited to the food consumption and sweet derivatives.
The stylelist must also be a good psychologist, support professionals
In the introductory article, how to learn the styles, I already asked some of the initial lessons were already loaded.
I had no idea how I would go to that.
Conferences of three ramo professionals, how to clothe to problems and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the world of the spectrum.
And it'll be worse.
How close the final reviews are, more information and practical tasks are waiting for us
And although the course is developed every Saturday and Sunday, there is no longer one alphabet.
We have once studied with the director, Alena, (in course there is no man) about how to clothe the woman who has no perfect symetry.
And that's it.
Someone is culinary, someone has a slighted figure without the appropriate curves and a person suffers overweight.
The stylelist needs to be able to swim some wide shadows, to expand a hair or to recreate the necessary curves
We have given some tricks about how to emphasize the body of women of the type of Jennifer López, of big but close skins, and at the same time you don't clothe it in a too disappointing way
If, for example, the difference between the cinture and the chairs is so much that the floor or the pants are not adjusted, it must be made at least one extra screen switch to measure.
Indeed, they will not be repented, because the smell that feels perfectly is implacable.
With a measuring floor, you will feel much better than with one that is not to move, get up, dance in the skin, etc.
The slighted body can be allowed to clothe with sweet, sweet, strip or dramped clothes.
There are certainly many types of different information and bodys, so I'm happy that I have all the week to order in my head all this information.
And even so, I am afraid that with the assigned task, I have more than sovereignty.
Each participant in the course has been allocated to you two famous people who have to design two clothes: one for the day and one for the night.
It must be taken into account the current aspect, the style of modality to the person concerned.
He touched me "walking" in Miranda Kerr, maybe you know the Victoria's secret campaign.
I shouted inside, it's much better for me than, for example, Briney Spears or Christina Aguilera, which will recently have shooted about hundreds of miles (sweet, take into account the exageration) or the youth Selena Gómez.
The clothes have to recover them from the magazines or find them on the Internet and print them, to then develop them graphically.
The moodboard, which is called the complete result, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with the graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of styliism.
The stylelist, therefore, has not only seen physically, but also, for example, the product pages in the magazines (of specific topics, such as trends, cups, boards, etc.).
For all this he spoke to us the styleist and designer Mario Kameník.
But it's all over Sunday.
The stylelist must have a global vision.
The three specialists encouraged the Saturday Conference with information on all types of bodies.
The Honza Pokorný stylelist, Jakub Polanka mode designer and the Ben Renč mode photograph.
Jakub recalled us that mode is an illusion and the styleist should know you to get out of this.
And a good stylelist can work with the same clothes of different forms.
The variability is, in this case, fundamental.
Thus, such a gabardine (or, as they say in English, trench-coat) can be clothed to the classic with vacuums and cakes, but also serves to clothe the body sweet with tacon shoes and to photograph it as if it was actually a clothes.
Or it's enough to revise it and up the hair to get a completely different image.
"Jugad with that," he stressed us.
What's more value is the following counsel: "To begin working, it requires you first know all the rules."
"You can break them already," said Jakub.
Finally, I am clear why we remember all these formulas, which is combined with why, why, if then results that in moderate magazines we find different results.
That's without talking about the disfiles.
Thanks to the Ben photograph, I know that a stylelist has to have more types of clothes in the reserve of which he wants to photograph.
So, for a mode history that has ten pages (for example, 10 outfits), there must be prepared, lists to use at least 15.
And more than the pictures of the clothes are in combination with other weapons, all of which are used in reality.
All of this must be taken into account at the time to design outfit.
Honza Pokorný assured us that the image and style are only, in many cases, half of success.
Look at Madonna, which is not exactly a extraordinary song, but the image and the marquetin have made it a world star.
There is no clear trend to use the styleists' services at the time.
Even the famous persons also find it inutility (I'm enough my skills, my physical aspect does not have so much importance).
And when someone asks us our services, it must be taken into account that it is very likely to show us a lot very different from its real (lower).
Then it's only to dig and find out if the newspapers of the heart have already written on the subject, if a certain celebration has engraved/addegated, etc.
Sunday, Honza and Mario stressed that the styleist was not enough to direct him in mode, but that he must understand outfit.
During your work, especially it must be communicated with people you see, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows appreciation for people, he does not make it less, defends their opinions.
"When a director contracts you to classify the clothes and complete it with pleasant takes, you could not cook and take everything I had and say, "It's a horrible."
"Those at least a couple of things you can consider and recommend that someone can put them up," said Mario.
He also showed us that everything should fall in the "placovka", i.e. the labour.
This is fixed around the skin and there are all the necessary tools.
They are tigers such as tigers, quitapeluses, or imperdibles. There are also nailon ices (which serves to the list during the session of photos of products such as cups or gorge), special shoes of shoes by front, if it is higher (the alphaes and other types of gangs are not allowed because they may damage the teeth), or a swimming game.
In order to not stay in the passive listening and put something in practice, we learned to reverse the sun of the skins.
Even during the photo sessions in the study, on a planned surface, the sun could be damaged and much more outside.
And we didn't do more than revesting and revesting.
We couldn't touch the shoes with the tigers so that we couldn't harm them for accident.
So I had to be very hard.
Mario gave me a joy to honor my work without reservations.
The truth is that it's not very good to me these skills.
This is only a small part of all we have heard during the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I have already understood that my dedication to the stillism at the professional level is not a rock path, but it gives me exactly what people say.
En Need for Speed: The Run works throughout America.
Reply
A travel, in principle unfortunate, is complicated because of a series of unexpected discounts of a rutinary journey during the morning tour.
In some measure, it was possible to cover the expectations, but it does not serve anything, if, in fact, it wasn't intended to do anything extraordinary.
The new delivery, which was added to the title The Run, took great expectations before its star.
I promised that I would give new ages to the old Need for Speed shop and, due to this shown, appears as a game that should not end again being a kind of action without any more.
We also wondered how to stay the inserted scenes, where the main character depends from the car and walks on their own feet.
As normally happening in the NFS series, the results did not vary much about what we expected.
There are carries that can be given for acceptable, but in the total engagement, they are lost points because of absurd failures, which are already appearing in the series for years.
In fact, it is not possible to be called errors, but it is better for the uncomprehensible desire of programers.
The adventure begins very well.
If you introduce you in a history, whose protagonist, Jack, has some personal problems; to solve them, you are offered to participate in an illegal career throughout America.
You sit the flight in the west coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to reach the first to New York.
The idea is offering something interesting.
The road is divided into ten stages and then over 50 cars.
This decreased that each cart has a different road, and the stages are located in different environments, which results very different and interesting.
Thus, one does not have the sense that the game offers the same always.
Some of the environments are even pleased to see, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to the previous delivery of the series.
So it's nothing of the other world.
But the passe through the desert, the autonic landscape or the high covered snow mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
Furthermore, the carriages are differentiated once by a typical element.
So, for example, in the wilderness you find a sand torment that reduces visibility.
Instead, the mountains have to be careful so that you don't hide a snake.
According to that, each of the carriages is very well developed.
There's only a couple of models, but it's enough.
During a moment, try to end up to a number of rivals required (which is normal in a classic car), then you tried to win time (Classic crazy) and then wait for you a duty against one opposite.
In the midst of all this appears sometimes the police, which does not only make it harder.
The newness is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when, in most cases, Jack has to get away from someone and you have to help him, always click the right button at the right time.
It's nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are enough less landscapes in the game what should be expected (in particular there are only three).
But the final result is positive, because this element does not begin to be mad and, in the context already mentioned, is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model remains the sheets of the previous episodes.
That means that today's no longer a great thing, but it can't be said that it's bad.
If you're looking for a realist simulation, you can already search for another part.
But to a fullly designed cart, this style of conduct should be enough, although we can find something better between competition games.
Even here, it's in order.
But the problems emerge after a certain time.
Unlike the correct conduct models, it does not happen anymore with the colisions.
From games of this type you can't expect to recruit complicated deformations and colitions, but in fact before a shoot against any object, you can't predict how you will react your car, with which it's not in order.
It is typical that, by making a very adapted advancement or driving the car with a normal traffic, there are only white rocks, but in other situations almost identical, your car has finished doing uncontrolled pyroutes.
Or even completely destroyed.
Thanks to the retreat system, they don't have great problems, but you can put them in bad humor.
The reservoirs are designed in such a way that, when you suffer a accident or get out of the track, the game returns you to the last rescue point on the track.
However, in each cart, only five residues are available.
If you consum them all, you must re-start the road from the beginning.
So it isn't more than a help if something doesn't go well, but it's not much to be trusted.
Sometimes, nor the retreat helps, only helps you to learn the given memory stage.
A great depreciation of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, there is a specific way to enter; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Another time you find you in some "civil" vehicles in some place always with the same configuration, although you are the first, five or five minutes ago or later.
This makes shocking mostly in situations, when you see that two cars that go to see in opposite addresses, you're going to be further contrary without problems, but when you find it, you should turn or swim well.
It is the same when you arrived, because it is planned for the "spring" will always happen before your natives.
The opposites also have more benefits.
During the whole game you will reach places where, without taking into account the moment, you will always advance the same opposite on the same site.
In addition, this happens at the end of the game, in a long bridge, which results even more shocking.
Your opponent must arrive before you, at the price that is.
When it goes before you, you are difficult to see the cars that come forward, so at the beginning you can pople the car.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum suspense and adrenaline doses, but execution is so apparent that you are certainly immediately deceptive.
And it's a pain, because although the model of the trip is simple, the game is diverted and with action, so it is often not possible to follow the details of what happens or where it happens.
And indeed, if the merit is taking the idea with 50 exclusive pistas or classification in the cart so that it doesn't cut the burning, or anything else.
Inhabited idea is the change of cars during the cars.
You should be careful of the gasoline surrounders on the road, because you must just have to change your car, although in the majority of the cases, you will be sufficient to what you have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Deportations are suitable for urban areas, American strong cars for rectangular cars and super-deporting exotics for technical driving, for example, by mountain roads with curves.
Furthermore, the main narrative ice also appears a ice of parallel challenges, i.e., there are carries in specific places that you will know for the historys.
Here you will get not only medals, but also experience points for your profile, which serves both for challenges and accounts.
When reaching the higher level, the driver opens a number of possibilities, starting through the car and ending with funds for the profile.
At the same time, a online autolog function is connected, which compares your results with other players and provides other Community functions.
One of the most difficult elements of understanding is how the last career is done in history.
With the car you get to the metro tunnel (pase), where the ponnes run to dark ways (pase).
The frequencies between 150 and 200 km/h (pase) and suddenly backwards the metro's shop and are carried on the front without any more.
In the edition we will certainly have a discussion about this for several days, on whether during the programing of the game no one even thought a little or if the authors of reality take us for a panda of bobos.
The technical part of the game is not nothing extraordinary, but at least general visual effects result in most of the pleasant cases, sometimes even sovereignties.
Because it's so regret that, at the most tensive moments, the quality of the image is reduced in a serious way.
This affects most of the accidents where many participants are involved, when the quality of image is not already valid.
The sound is good, and the sound band is a matter of guests.
To be pleased most of the young group, the sound band belongs to the category "year one of his father and mother," but it can be suggested that no one would buy the game only for its music.
The final sensation of Need for Speed: The Run is so confused.
If the game avoids absolutely stupid errors, we would have problems to claim that The Run is the best NFS game in the last few years.
It feels that the game is not finished.
The diversity is safe, but prepare because errors will shoot you in the eyes with the strength of a flight reflectors.

Ambassador to the EU, Vicenova:
Cheques have a reputation of negatives and eurosceptics.
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
"I didn't expect a war without quarter."
"The five, six years before the situation is a little stability, the new players will be calm and the new players will take place to their new roles," he began with conviction to convincing its conference in the Czech Ambassador in the EU, Millene Vicenova.
How it is not to take seriously its "class and openly on Europe", which said already in the first part of its conference, when it was able to describe each EU organ and its relations with such accuracy and clarity, because it would be the sending of many conferences from the United Carolina Law Faculty.
Vicenova also considered the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
"The first is the critics that, if it is insulin, a green official, able to take any role, but I say he left all unconcerned, because he takes their roles to perfect."
"He is a man who knows listening to the members of the twenty-five states, communicating with them and having a clear vision of where to go to the EU."
The new position of representative of the Foreign and Security Policy is explained by the question: "What is this EU? What number can I call it?", therefore, it is an important step to the unification and clarification of the political unity to States such as China or India.
No one wants to prohibit Olomouc's chest
Vicenova has also been occupied of the next agenda and will continue and continue to continue to the European Council in the next future.
The Czech Presidency has been a success two years ago.
Cheques were taken on the emergency economic crisis, solved the gas crisis and organized a Summit for Eastern Association.
The government's fall at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU has at the time many commitments.
In words of the Ambassador, "a good advertising," not only the Presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is now being treated.
On the other hand, the EU budget must be adopted for seven years, caused by the current economic situation, much more complicated.
If the budget is more simpler and effective, what sectors will be priority, which countries will receive more support and less? This is what will be present in the next meeting agenda.
The Ambassador also recalled its main sides, with which it came to Europe: "Account of Europe with clearness".
"The truth is that I don't like feast abbreviations, foreigners or gears that people don't understand."
"Why can a citizen understand that in Brussels the skins are not actually invented in Brussels, the curve or round skins, plates of different sizes, or that no one will ban us the shoes of Olomouc?"
It also intends to make more benefit from the EU's environment and draw closer to more Czech citizens to European institutions.
We're waiting for Europe of Speeds
According to the embassy, cheques have a fame of eurosceptics, and people understand the negative aspects of the positive.
He also regretted the low participation of the cheques in the European institutions.
There are many factors, such as modesty of our candidates, their incapacity to write motivation messages, but also the low support of the cheques.
In addition to the success of the Czech presidency, he stressed the force and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Cree me that when you add to me a Poland and a Hungary and is about me a Slovakia, a French to my side tells me, "What, have you already stayed, those of the Visegrad Group?", and it is seeing no grace to him."
In the future, the EU, according to Vicenova, is expected to expect new dualistic rules of budgetary policy for Member States.
It is a very real thing of the concept of the two speeds, if not more, in Europe, more than the new of "European Federation".
"We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone."
"We have the Schengen space and we have the strengthened cooperation procedure."
"It was said for the first time that they only co-operate countries who want and those who do not, that they remain out."
"This procedures will be increasingly and will strengthen Europe of two speeds," is expected Vicenova.
In this regard, he also highlighted the role of Checa and Herman van Rompuy in implementing the principle, according to which all the topics affecting the whole EU should be discussed between Member States, not only among the members of the Eurozone.
Brand stories:
Innovator IBM started on the second century of existence
If someone looked for a term that was very precisely defined by the IBM Strategy, the most closest would be "length."
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, an undertaking that is undertaken as current and, however, has been over hundreds of years since its foundation.
The basis of this long-level character put it the first head of the signature, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Mr.
He already condemned that many world problems have a solution if people are ready to think.
His "Think" word became turned into his seals, around which the life of the magnificent future will be built (he was also the title of a internal magazine that IBM began to publish in 1935).
Watson was also the basis of a carefully raised enterprises culture.
"For us, IBM implies a long-term thinking, a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and prosperated for hundreds of years because its basic principles were faithful, but without fear of changes around.
This has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We are waiting for further prosperity in our second century," said during his birthday, the current director of the company Samuel J. Palmisano.
A sophisticated system
Watson, already in the 30s, was worried about the care of his employees such as Baśa employee in Chequia (the employees of IBM were the first US operators who enjoyed vacation pay, safe, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated repayment system that was worth the best inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication maintains IBM in customer relationship.
From the beginning, the company was supposed to discover talents (when one of the first world enterprises to end with any kind of discrimination could be elected without problems).
On the line of the anti-discrimination strategy, IBM's current plan, which will replace it the year that comes to a woman: Virginia Romatty.
She's already working for thirty years in IBM, where she has been the head of sales, marquetin and strategies.
During the past few years, IBM has participated in the swimming virtual meetings, rain of online ideas, which are infinity of future strategies and innovations.
It is not surprised to overcome ideas, because there are almost a half million people working in the sign.
A institution with a good reputation
The business position provides an internal and external image to the company.
"Dead, IBM maintained a concept of institution than technological undertakings," states the Economist professor of the Harvard Business School and author of the IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter book.
"IBM is not a technological company, but a company that is trying to solve business problems for technology users," pointed out George Colony from the Forrester Research advisor.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the business and creating a business directly.
IBM - or the "Green Green" - as it is known in the United States familyly because of their logo, it has become one of the world's largest enterprises in the past hundred years.
The most powerful technological company (develops both teams, infrastructures and web accommodation services within a wide range of services from servers to nanotechnology).
The largest number of patents from all North America technological companies and five of its employees have received Nobel premium.
Among its invents are the automatic box, payment cards, financial switchs, bar codes and disks.
IBM will fail this year $220 million. This year has become the second technological sign for market capitalization (the first is Apple), when he was over the first time in 1996 to Microsoft.
View to the Future
Not all products and innovations are finally satisfied with the guest of customers and the time (IBM has not issued by its own operational system, OS/2, online prodigy services or IBM PCjr computers).
"If your business is based on progress, it cannot be emotionally enclared in the past," acknowledged Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM has no problem to build its bases on other platforms (and also, if not, leave them).
And that's the difference of competition, Microsoft, which is mainly maintained and always falls out with Windows.
Future technology
In the case of sales, IBM is primarily dedicated to services, which are about fifth part of programs and other fifth teams.
However, in 1990 the teams represented more than half of the share of suppliers.
Since 2000, IBM has sold income assets for a total of $15 billion, and in the same period, $58 million had invested in the acquisition of technology in future.
Investments have been followed since 2008, when the world's modern financial crisis was first shown.
IBM acts according to the premises of his first chief, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of 29 increased investment.
It seems that even now the IBM company has been able to understand the crisis.
The value of IBM actions since the beginning of 2008 has grown up to 120 per cent, and the net benefit of the company has not been increased.
The IBM distribution is changing it all, except on value.
It can therefore be expected that when the next crisis comes, this giant flexibility will be overcome.
IBM history: from the shoes cut to space flights
The IBM company (International Business Machines) was founded in New York for hundred years, being its original Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM is already adopted in 1924 - originally a mark used in the Canadian and South America sugars.
The basis that the IBM's birth results from the fusion of four enterprises that return to the decade of 1880.
It could be invented as the famous "first watch", which allows to control the entry and exit of employees.
The new company's architect was Charles Ranlett Flint's business man, who also chaired his supervisor advisor until 1930.
Flint left the chief of a competitive company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him with the company's management.
The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM (Watson’s ideas remain the strong base on which corporate culture and identity are supported).
Watson directed the company until 1952.
IBM, as indicated in its name, began with the production and sale of any kind of instruments for business, from meat cuttingers and cheese to register boxes.
During the first four years that Watson directed the company, the facturation doubled $9 million and began the great expansion of the company by the continents.
Watson was so crucial for the company that, nearly 40 years after the head's seat, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its direction, IBM began working in artificial intellectual development and developed the first programing language.
In the 1960s, the staff and computers of IBM helped NASA to drive flights to space (a Mercurio, Saturno and 1969).
While in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classical "peses" which set up the computer standard at that time, arrived in the market with the name of IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, for its part, purchased the part of the Price Waterhouse Coopers company and began offering a full advisory and high-value advisory services.
The IBM strategy that has paid over the past three years is the Smarter Planet concept, namely "a more intelligent planet".
Its aim is to make more rational use of technology, although the areas have not yet been planned and the circumstances, for example, have been improved in the field of transport and administration.
For the trade sector, IBM did not have long presented the Smart Commerce platform that allows minorists to manage the full trade cycle.
IBM has a long story in this country.
The first country in Central and Eastern Europe was already opened in the Czechoslovakia in 1932.
Today, the IBM śR also operates the strategic for externalization centre in Brno.
The Headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is in Prague. There is also a world's famous research team working with the voice recognition.
Rychtáova about his unfaithful husband:
I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rychtáova (53) said it ended!
After his husband Josef Rychtá (53) was converted to the only protector of Iveta Bartošov (45), but also his loved man, Darina continued to have the hope that Josef would get out of his red dream and return to his home.
However, it will not be waiting and has set clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can return home, but no longer like my couple," Rychtáova explained.
When Darina Rychtáova accompanied during the summer to Bartošové in his home, he could not imagine how to end her marriage.
Despite the request, Iveta had not been moved thirty days after the śíčany and Pepe did not leave the song.
He even declared publicly that she loved her.
With the time, Darina resigned, apparently accepted his husband’s relationship and even disappeared from him forever.
Rychytá is not important with whom his wife is.
If one day Rychtá would break with Bartošov, his wife would not wait for him at home with open arms.
It's the biological father of my children, and if you want to live the rest of your life in our house, no one will escape it."
"But here I would live not already as my loved and old bowl that was fair, but as a man who joins me a certain lazos," Rychtáova said and added that he had already dismissed his husband and insisted only on the mutual respect.
Josef doesn't matter until now that women have closed the door behind him.
"I accept my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and there's no possible change."
"My wife established this as a marriage on the role, and I respect it."
"The company continues to enter into force, I do house arrangements, regarding the garden, home, I will purchase."
"Darina and I talked to us normally, the only thing is that we do not share bed, said Rychtá.
If Rychtáova found a new love, he wouldn't oppose himself.
"We don't sleep together and she doesn't interest me, nor where she goes or if he's a girlfriend.
I know that it's my fault, I love Iveta and live all the responsibility," concludes Josef.
The worst vicies of women: Is it also referring to you?
If you ask men that they can quote some typical vices of women, each of them will generally be appointed without thinking.
Dear women, are you recognised in the following lines, where certain women's victories are referred to that they can herb the blood to men?
Acquisitions
Does you reprove your narrow media that has the dependence of the purchase?
Do you have to buy at least one trap in week?
Do you like to buy in the baths often?
Then in your case, you can say that go from purchase has become a vicious.
Some women are aware that their passion should be cut off by purchase, at least a little.
But seeing, what woman could resist the attempt to pass without more by the clothings, search for well adjusted and then test all of the prosecutor (ideally in all different colors)?
Although the majority of women go to purchase is a passing time, mans can almost become a hell.
Remember how many times you already told her couple that it's better to wait before the door.
Consistent insatisfaction
"I'm not too gorgeous?"
"It's necessary to spend at least five kilos - should it start to exercise?"
"Do I really like you?"
Don't you sound these phrases?
What do you mean?
Then it is one of those women obsesionate for their aspect.
It is not that you should stop worrying, but many men are allergic to listen to your couple to take the whole time of your physical aspect.
The strong sex is also agreed that the increase in the frequency of complaints, the more mourning women become.
Order and cleanness in the first place
It's like an infinite life.
Put the windows, pass the aspirant, frozen the floor, remove the powder, frozen the bath and all this at least two times per week.
Does your couple reprove you that you have stolen the clean ground with a sweet foot, your children who smell a new cleaned lavabo and a stair with glass doors that were so costly cleaning him?
If you suffer this "deviation", you know that nothing should be exaged and that order and cleanness should not be safely occupied as primary in the family.
This unfair desire of cleaning could threaten your relationships and family well-being.
Do unpleasant comments
"The calzocilles used are left with the suicide clothes."
"You want to put you too tomorrow those calcetines used."
"The smooth trap is not left on the ground!"
If you do these commentarys to your couple several times a day, I know that you can get him out of your boxes.
Of course, you don't want to say anything bad, you just want to get that everything's in order.
Maybe, if men know that, women, on their part, would not make so many comments.
Calumnias and chisms
Some women also get calumnies, chisms, but also abuses and conspiration against someone.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk together about the kind of thing, where, with whom, how and why.
Better to each of us sometimes a small and unforgettable chism is shocked.
With the hand in the heart, this is just of almost all women.
On the other hand, there are chismose women of those who are not controlled, who love the chismost and often do it, disrespect all of them and are dangerous for those who round them, especially in a women's work team.
Yagr and Voráček helped their assistance to win Philadelphia
Hockey Jaromir Yagr's department participated in NHL's meeting with two assistance that brought the victory on the Philadelphia 5:3 in the pocket of Carolina and returned to put the Cheques players in the competition guard.
In both cases, Claude Giroux used the 39-year-old star game, and he gave a step more and was declared the best player of the game.
Two assistance in the party and also the Yagr's partner, Jakub Voráček.
After the meeting, Yagr said to the supermarine journalists that Giroux had predicted a great night.
"And before the game I had told him that I would have trilete."
"I'd present him."
"Atimes they seem to be shocked," Yagr explained, after his action this goal in Giroux, due to the first trails of the Flyers.
A rat later also the second intervention of the team had a cheek raster.
Voráček was done with the disk behind the Hurricane port and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, which put gol.
One second before the first break, a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was released, but from the beginning of the second part, the Flyers were already dominated.
Concretely by Giroux.
After working with Yagr, he put the third gol, after his shoot was shooted in the room of Wayne Simmonds' gate.
"I like to play with him."
"I don't mean that it's the best player of the song, but without doubt it's between the three best", pointed Yagr to its center.
"I would never have happened that at the end of my carriage I would play with a sporter like him."
"I'm very satisfied of it."
"I want to play for him."
All these years in the NHL, my partners played for me, and that's now produced results," added Yagr.
Carolina still converted the game into a drama, with the Gol of Tum Ruutu, and then again from Dwyer, of Penal, until he turned into a distance goal.
Matt Read did not allow any more complications, although they ended over in number of two against one.
"Pronger had a good action in our field."
"After the disk, I took speed and read went to the most distant part."
"I tried to switch you to the disk and I am pleased because I get it", described Voráček the last goal of the game as he lived.
With its victory, Philadelphia was headed by the East Conference.
The Czech Defensor of Montreal, Jaroslav Špaček, did not play until the end of the party against Buffalo, in the second third of a lesson on the top of the body.
Canadians lost not only a player with a lot of defence experience, but also for a difference in two goals, 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec could not use one of the fires.
More than the lost points to the local trainer regreted the great number of lesionates in the last line, and playing the game only with five defense.
"This is bad."
"We play the game only with a veteran player, the rest was new."
"In the end, but it is that it can't be done anything, we need to do with that," said Jacques Martin.
"When the players turned back against us, we couldn't resist it."
"We had to simplify more the game, get out of our field disk."
"And so we leave shoes," said one of the defenders, P.K. Subban.
Ondśej Pavelect has contributed with thirty-first Winnipeg's interventions in the victory of 5:2 on the Tampa Bay.
Jet's goals were marked by five players so that they ended to a series of cuts that had already duration five games.
How travel prices have been developed since 1989
Up until 1989 in Checoslovakia, only five state travel agencies were authorised: śedok, Sportrist, CKM, Recrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies at that time were sold in most cases only to socialist block because travellers were very limited to the West.
Czech tourists, therefore, were vacations at the RDA Beachs (Alemanian Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union, (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (the both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when the Yugoslav regime was able to travel to Yugoslavia, however, after the Yugoslav rule moved to the west and the travellers of the Czech tourists were then quite limited.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that citizens of the socialist block (or even the Czech Republics) are not allowed to travel free and individually and even by socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed a invitation letter, if not, the individual travel was not possible.
The travel agencies offered in those times also travels to the West, but one had to put the colle with a cup of sleep and pass all night, or to have "good known" in the Agency.
It wasn't all wearing.
The named "change promise" which was the condition for travellers to the western, was not granted to the "politically unreliable gentle" which would thus not be able to travel in absolutely.
The checo-lovac currency was not a freely convertable currency and, without changing guarantee, it was not possible to obtain resources (the western currency) to travel to Western.
The large majority of the cheques passed their vacation in their own country, so there was a large number of chains and summer houses, which would buy the cheques.
The way to travel in the cheques has suffered a true revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 it was not going to pass the holidays in the RDA or Bulgaria, last year the cheques made 4,5 million vacation travels to countries around the world.
It is in the great paradox, which we are not yet conscious today, the fact that the present destination, Croatia, could not travel freely until 1989, because it was part of Yugoslavia at that time.
At the beginning of the 1990s the exemption of visa was imposed to travel to the neighbouring countries of Western Europe, which caused a huge oil of short-term visits, above Vienna or Germany.
The Checoslovakias, for a long time, did not see hearts of the excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it at least at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris the cheques groups were sleeping in camping parks, since our income from then did not allow us to pay a hotel or pension.
A typical characteristic of the cheques of that time was to take the food with you (conserves, embryos, etc.) to eat.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech Korea, so our tourists could finally, after decades, buy freely Western currency.
Our life level increased and with him also the average wages, which in about 1997 caused a increase in travel demand.
With the increased travel request, the Agencys regularly began to prepare travels using charter flight connections, which incredibly slowed the prices of travelling in comparison with the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts by the number of passengers.
At the end of the last 90th century, the cheques were already traveling without a view to almost all the developed countries, except the United States, which simplified our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism was already occurred in 2000, when it was organized, thanks to a wide demand, the first direct flight from Checa to an exotic country, and was in Thailand.
Since that year, the direct carter flights with checa tourists have made far away and warm countries. This winter will already fly directly from Checa to 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visiting them for about 100 000 Czechs per year.
Another interesting moment of this time, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States removed the visa for the cheek tourists, with which our country has been among the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, the cheques, for the first time in their history, have passed over half of their holidays in the foreign (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, have been paid in travels to foreigner more than 15.000 Czech Corones per head, including the costs of the residence site.
Invited to the General Assembly to elect the President, which could be done again in the deadline.
Since almost five months ago, the checa fútbol is without President, and it is likely that Ivan Hašek's successor as President of the Checa de Futbol Federation (FAśR) will not be known or after the convocation of the next Special General Assembly that will take place in Nymburk.
In fact, it has not yet been reached an agreement on the vote rules to follow.
Without the same, it may not even be voted to choose among the three candidates.
Czech fútbol is Jindśich Rajchl, Miroslav Pella and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek reaffirmed his office in June not soon calling his colleagues in order to find a strong person who seems to take care of the fatbol in the future.
However, after the end of the Year of Hašek, a debate was disabled between the two unable associations of the association to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This remained in evidence on 16 September when the new President had to be elected.
The delegations of the General Assembly were meeting in the National House (Národni dśm), located in Smichov ' s pragic barrier, because the discussions were blocked and not only about the election method.
There was no consensus or no consensus on whom in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only legal representatives or delegations with full power.
From that moment and because of this only point, a partial agreement was made, also supported by the recommendation of the State and Law Institute, which is not possible for the representation of full powers.
However, the debates on the electoral code are still open.
More light on the situation could no longer be found by the Executive Committee that, at its meetings, normal or extraordinary, was basically not resolved.
The opinion on the possibility of vote has already changed a few times, but the neutral point remains the same.
The question is: How do we go to the third round to avoid the dead point?
"The debate turns around to whether it should be done in accordance with the statutes or find another model," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three Vice-Presidents of the FAṣṭR, which, from the direction of the association, represents the professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, the third round will win the candidate who has a higher percentage of support in the Federation to which it will submit its candidate.
The Moravia region is disposed to reach a commitment to the candidate with a higher percentage of votes in both federations.
The Bohemia part, however, implies that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, should have the majority of at least two thirds.
"This would, however, leave him the meaning of the two previous rounds, and would completely refuse the concept of bicameral system," it is as Svoboda understands the objections of the part living, as it would be best not to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
This is a surprisely agreed by Tomš Paclík, although the electoral regulation established by the statutes of all candidates agrees more to Pella.
"I would like to vote to the maximum in accordance with the statutes."
"In order to not invent any tongue about representatives as in the last General Assembly," said the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is requested for the first time as a candidate and which directs their comments mainly against Pelta.
Pelta is still optimized.
According to him, Nymbuk will decide on the new President and he believes that candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
"All landscapes will be disappointed with the party today of our national team in the European Championship.
"The fútbol will be a protagonist, and so it will work more likely," states the representative of Jablonice, which three candidates have more experience in the management of the fútbol, both at the professional and regional level.
Rajchl is the most resident.
"I hope that there is an agreement, but, unfortunately, the situation is much more complicated."
"It is not the conflict between bohemians and morals, but there are intentions to adapt the rules to their own convenience."
"This can have a new block of the General Assembly as a result."
"In any way, I hope the common sense will be put into place," said Rachl.
There is no longer a long time for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be held in Montenegro, but who can know until the game starts if the fútbol team is complete?
The special aircraft, where they had to travel to Podgorica, among other Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not been out this morning for technical problems in Praga, and has to be seen a alternative to transport part of the Executive Committee to the place where the classification party will be placed.
We wish that the decision-making meeting, finally, might be the one that will take place at the ministerial level, which, in view of their account, will be held on Thursday.
Joseph Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sport, would like to include the shared parts of the sports organization in the country to reach an agreement.
There's a lot in the game: state subsidies, the credibility of the fatbol, and also the next General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czech Republic of Sports, which will try to provide a new direction to the Czech sport after the financial problems of the Sazka lottery house.
Pacific will fight for reaching the Presidency, because there is no suitable candidate.
If the Chief of Pilsen's Futbolists, Tomš Paclik, before the Special Assembly, would know the name of a appropriate candidate that satisfies all its ideas about the new Chairman of the Fútbol Federation (FAśR) or would not be submitted as a candidate to such a relevant post.
"If I had a suitable person, I would fight for her, and I would not be a candidate to the elections."
"But until the day of today there was no person found like this," Paclick said to the Checa News Agency.
This is the motivation to Paclik to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pella and Henry Rajchl, which is exactly the possibility of blocking Pella, the obviously winner of the elections, which opens the way to the Presidency of the Czech Federation of Futbol (FAśR).
Pacific also points out that, in the event of winning, he would remain in the office of the President until 2013 when the round of the ordinary General Assembly would be reached.
In that position you would like to see a good expert who is not too related to the futbolistic events.
"I talked to some people who could take into account."
"For me was a crazy hearing some say that at this time they don't even want to be identified with the checo fútbol."
"I would like to change that vision," adds.
What is more angry to Paclík at this time is the relationship with the President of the Pilsen Roman Berbr Regional Football Association, a man with a confronted past, known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegations at the General Assembly.
For Paclik is so unacceptable to see Pella sit down in the presidency.
"In the case of winning, the existing status and nothing in the fotbol will change."
" With the support of Berbra, a ambitious businessman, the fútbol will still be less useful," said Patrick.
It also mentions that some years ago the name of Pelta was associated with a telephone listening during the investigation of a corruption case, which Pelta came impunity.
"I don't know what's prestigious to the feetball could bring Pelta's victory."
"And with what eyes the EUFA and the FIFA will look at us", said Patrick, who also takes certain care of his previous statement that "if Pilsen would come to the Pilsen Club if Pelta become President."
In the case of the elections of Thursday, Paclik could be drawn up cooperation with Pella in the future.
Similarly, it is the other candidate, Rajchl, which has been supported by Paclik before the General Assembly of September, which ended in a fascination.
"Ell (Pelta) was the first to which I would follow."
"It's very powerful."
"I could imagine it, for example, as a leader of the representation."
"But not as a partnership manager."
"I do not put the narics there I am not able to do", added Paclik, which in September highlighted much attention to support the suspension of the Arbitres Commission chaired by Ludek Macel, replaced after Dagmar Damkova.
Palík admits that the association would be managed.
Recovery to its management capacity for private enterprises, since the past summer is also the Director of Pilsen, who has held the triumph in the first division in May.
"I have strength to change some things in the field of fotbol and contribute to their safe practice."
"To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably intend to influence the decisions of the Disciplinary and Appeal Committee, produced unpleasant situations, Patrick said without hiding their antipathies to the President of Sparta Daniel Kśetínskī.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between the Czech Olympic Committee and the Commission, with the help that he exerted pressure on political leaders in order to develop more money in the sports of lottery taxes.
"It is one of the key problems to which the new President should be dedicated."
"If they increase the taxes on the games of azar, as the political party announces, it would support their arguments, but, frankly, they must tell us where to stop all this money," states.
Indeed, Paclik does not even take into account his association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself claims that the President of the FAṣṭR must be "no party".
Pelta is your association with Jablonec and Rajchl with Ducla de Praga.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't see the fact that my actions of the Pilsen Club are hypocritically deceived to another person to return there after a year and a half", said Patrick.
Pelta promised the FAśR new statutes that would end with the dead point of the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Futbol Association one of the candidates to the presidency, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, in the event of being elected, would ensure that FAṣṭR would have new statutes that would endure to solve, in the future, the disputes on the electional regulation.
The representative of Jablonec is optimistic about the meeting of this youth in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-electoral conflict could go forward to a solution today with the possible victory of the fútbol team.
Before the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus on, in case they were elected, precisely in the representation and in recovery of funds.
He decided to participate in the last minute at the last general meeting, so that this posting of two months could go well to defend and to present its ideas on the management of the fotbol.
"The people of all levels are working on the fútbol for a long time and are expected to meet this Thursday to the new President."
"It feels that someone has arrived at the time of managing the association," believes the man who is mainly associated with the Jablonice Club, but who worked in the Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Association.
For this reason, I believe you have enough experience to manage the checa fotball.
It is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the Euforia ruling at Ivan Hašek time.
"Lamentally, in the June General Assembly, the statutes that were not so perfect as everyone thought were adopted."
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president since September," warned Pelta.
Exactly the readaptation of the most important document of the Civil Association was used as a senator to win delegates.
"If you elect the President, I'll take it as a personal challenge and I'm willing to answer if this falls."
"It's a matter of principles, without which we can't exist," says Pelta.
Furthermore, in theory, try not to put up with your opposers.
It had already been warned that he was working with Henry Rajchl, who respected his legal training, was conscious of that his opponent would also be his first vice-president.
He had a long time without attacking Thomas Paclík who, instead of Pella, didn't leave a titter with his head.
"He lives more than one year in the world of fotball, and has already achieved some success."
"Their attacks, but they were angry and many people were surprised by the election campaign."
"There is why many of them doubt their true nature," said to their opposer Pelta, who is still faithful to the statements already announced in September.
His most powerful weapons are, according to him, his knowledge of the fútbol, from the lower competitions to the tops.
This should be shocked from the fotball promotion.
"I would also try to solve all the scandales that occurred because of the Bohemians as a result of the corruption scandale last year."
"I would immediately be involved in negotiations with the public and private sector, to ensure that there is enough money for the whole fútbol,," said the candidate of 46 years ago to the ŠTK.
It also promised that his appointment as President of the Futball would not include any personal amendment of the template.
"I would first know the tasks of each employee," said referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, it implies an understanding nervousism.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that are vatikaned at the next General Assembly, he believes that delegations will not travel this juvenile to Nymburk.
"If the only problem is how to vote on the third round, we will, without doubt, be able to overcome it.
"The fútbol needs credibility, which will be restored only if he has a leader at the end," still two days before the most decisive day in his representative career, Pelta is still optimist.
Rajchl promises that under its leadership, the FAśR would start working with wins.
If in the fourth General Assembly the current vice-president Jindrich Rajchl is elected as a new Chairman of the Fútbol Association of Checa, many people would be safely recommended.
Rajchl promises that, if it is elected, it would work hardly.
He wants to implement a systematic change and to make members of the Executive Committee responsible for each area of the fútbol individually.
It is also committed to solve the case of the Bohemians, to improve the relationship with the EUFA and the FIFA, to get more money for the fotbol and to continue with the work initiated by the previous President Ivan Hašek.
"I like the President, I would like to devote me completely to the fotball."
From international contacts with the EUFA and the FIFA to the selection, through the professional fútbol or the training of young futbolists of high performance."
"I don't mean that I would do it all alone," said Rajchl in an interview for the ŠTK.
"I am a team player and I want to share the competences of the Executive Committee so that each member may be dedicated to a specific area."
"And I will allocate difficult tasks so that the football can continue with a lot of impulse."
"The many people will probably not like it, because they will start working very hard and not only criticize the work of others," he added.
Because of the atmosphere of criticism in the futbolistic movement, it has been said that it has been considered the possibility of not being submitted again as a candidate.
Everyone knows that work is 20 hours daily.
"But I need to know that this will be a sense and that there will not be people behind me that will prevent and hinder me every step," he explained the reasons of their indecision.
"My people have told me that I shouldn't be able to give me for the winning, because then they would also be given for winnings."
"It is to have faith to not leave so, without any more," said.
They say, it also motivates him to continue the work that has already started with Hašek.
"When these two years, there was a large part of the work that I don't want to be lost now."
"There are processes that had been initiated and that they would have been affected within a couple of years and I would not like anyone to see them," announced that, if they elected the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could be again as it was before Hašek era.
"I believe in the order, and it's something that, in my opinion, Mirece Pelta is not able to keep it.
"Dead of him is over all those people who would take care of the ball so that it is just a prize for some chosen."
"I can reprove a lot of things, but not the fact that I am for someone."
"I'm trying to be target."
"I want to do a fotbol for everyone, because only so they will feel well and not only the chosen ones," said Rachl.
He also rejects the idea that would only bohemi the President.
"After some people try to declare the other, I'm in mind to do the maximum for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to think about the fact to share the second division in a checa and in another living, whose winners were going to the first division."
"It wouldn't be given the current situation where we have only three Moravia's teams, which represents a problem for young moral players," said Rajchl.
While at the pugna of the presidential elections, Tomš Paclík, President of the Pilsner Club, was summoned, Rajchl did not believe in his possibilities to be elected.
"I'm still sorry to have strong support from the Checa Federation, which has chosen me as his vice-president and who knows that there are clear successes behind me," said Rajchl, whose successes include the shore of a few decades of millions of decades of deceased contract colonies, television negotiations and the negotiations on the lottery law.
On the other hand, it recognizes its part of guilty in which the Federation is not united.
And while proclaiming that Pella is "discalled to recover confidence in the Checa fútbol," it is considered to the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate that has something to offer to the fútbol.
"Nobody can refuse that he did a great job for Pilsen that year."
"In the case that it is elected, it will probably follow what Ivan Hašek started and would not change significantly the staff model in the committees."
"I don't want to use this to my favor," he evaluates his rivals Rajchl.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Salt to blue
for Julia Stanek
Piscinas from an amazing, solar bathroom in Budapest: Whose visits Europe can live its beautiful blue, and after a visit to the city or a shop, relax your feet in bubble bathrooms.
A book shows where the best well-being is found in the water.
When Iris Meder performed a research trip during the last and half years, there was something that couldn't miss in his team, a bathroom.
Steps on the water, looked at the cups art at the top, shocked to the marmol angels, waiting at the edge of the pool and shocked to the swimming pool renovated meticulally.
He liked the bathroom, took note of his book at the time of all interesting details on the style and the building's history.
The Architective historian Meder explored more than 200 pools in this way and presented them in its recent book "Badefreuden": the pools covered in Munich, the historic bath houses in the Black Sea, the "hormigon constructions" in Taunis.
He reacted its "releasing by the most extraordinary bathrooms of Central Europe" by 13 countries: more than Germany, Austria and Switzerland, visited places from Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This German of 46 years is a real enthusiasm of the bath culture.
You don't want to have anything to see with the sport, says Meder, the water is different.
Only the bathroom acids need to comply with blue and cloud blue blue, while swimming can breathe the fascinating odor of the sweet forests or listen to the triangles of the birds in the park.
"Another day I asked why the pools must always be so feasts," said this people in Vienna.
"I started collecting beautiful pools."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
The cappotheum in the pool and the eyelets of the sauna. The well-being factor in the pools is so large because all senses are acquired, according to Meder.
And if the constructor is striking, the covered pools can be a real gift to view: "Instead of ground, there is a water surface in the baths."
"For one part it is transparent, on the other hand reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is optically doubled: the high bowds, the color blue, the trampolines.
The book with small "Badefreuden" photos offers in 190 pages very interesting data about architecture and history of art in the historical oasis of well-being, but mainly, it has a wish to salt the blue.
Meder, the swimming pool collectionist finds the emulators highlighted in its investigations in Hungary.
Among the magnificent medical bathrooms such as the Szechenyi Bathroom of Budapest of 100 years, water with nitrates is found in a unique cavity cavity (cave baths in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as a term, the pools are alcalinum water and are situated in a bottle form (Városi Termalvordö in Yaszbereny).
Many discovery swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city puts the eyes in the Zurich tested pool, you can look at Arlberb, swimming pool, from the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton, and: In the Turkish bathroom there is a window from which you can see the practice on the ski swimming pools.
The most extraordinary design may be expected to customers in Longgenfeld: The Eastern water catedral seems to be a ovn that has just been shooting in the Alpes.
From three open sources upbow in winter, while the mountains of the East go down into the heavens.
Anyone in the Black Sea
Meder, the pool collectionist, did not invade it with clore oil in all the pools.
Many thermal bathrooms smell in the Arpád baths in Bekescsaba, Hungary, the gas pet is so strong that people believe that they have arrived to a healthy bathroom.
The oil comes from the medical waters containing bicarbonate and alcali and whose ligame is cut into the skin when entering the pool, a enjoyment of the well-being in a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in a place in his search for beautiful places for the bathroom when I wanted to visit discovery pools and solar bathrooms in the checo bathroom of Luhatschowitz, found with a blocked terrace.
The bathroom of the architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the swimming windows of the red, white and amazing modernist building, I saw the badness growing between the blue.
The decade was opposed in a charming pool in the Black Sea: the Termal palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three construction phases after themselves; not only can be found in neomanic elements of their construction in 1844, if not even an Arab style hall of Alhambra, added in 1900.
Since its early modernization in 1995, the Palacio Termal is the favorite bathroom of the Pool Collector, Iris Meder, and not only because it is natural from the Black Sea.
"It's very good to fusion different architectic styles in a so fantastic unit," Meder says.
In a palace so the emerging in the termal pool apparently does not have a lot of importance.
Agricultural speculation
The German Bank analyzes the business of primates
By Christian Teevs
Renumbers German Bank to its business with agricultural primary materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has taken a working group to check the consequences of the speculation for the poor world.
In January, the chief of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For the citizens, the issue is clear, according to a study, at 84 percent of Germans does not seem to be acceptable that banks split with agricultural primary materials such as trigo or maize.
Two thirds of the surveys reiterate the German Bank and other creditive institutions from this business because intensifying the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of an investigation in charge of the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch at Middle October.
The author Harald Schumann shows that the seats on global primary materials make up prices, and the banks are loaded with the responsibility of the global hunger problem.
The consumer defender's campaign is in particular directed to Josef Ackermann, director of the German Bank, although the large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, primary materials were thought to protect tradeyers from price shopping.
The main experts agree that players have disassembled the offers and demands, and winning from the costs of the poorest ones.
Ackermann reacted to the critics in a different way than the United States competitioners: I promised to revise the revisions and said that no business "mere to compromise the good name of the German Bank".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE information, a international working group is reviewing the revisions of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis must be finished at the end of the year, then the results will be submitted to the German Bank Directive together with the recommendation of how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the address of the bank shall inform the consequences.
Finally, a reduction in the business of primary materials could be reduced, or even its total abandon.
Ackermann tries to correct his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, celebrated the news, but reaffirmed its critics to the financial sector: "Food prices are particularly dramatic how disappointed banks are currently damaged to public well-being."
Ackermann is located as the largest banking captain, especially in the obligations.
"The German Bank must cancel all the investments of its cart in which it plays money for food prices", said Bode.
"Only if Ackermann addresses the topic of the people who are hungry or the famous German Bank."
Ackermann's inspection is surprising in the first view, but it is obvious that the chief of the consortium wants to offer a perfect picture a few months before leaveing his position.
On Monday, the German Bank published that the President of the joint Directive will change something different from what was not planned in the Administrative Board.
With the abandonment of the agricultural speculation, you can perfectize your image.
And it must only import possible losses, so its successor will take care of it.
Two thirds would cancel investment in primary materials
Foodwatch is striking to maintain high pressure on the manager.
At the time, more than 30,000 international people have participated in the organization ' s campaign.
On Monday, Bode published the survey for which the Force Institute had asked 1 001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only 10 percent considered legitimate that the German Bank offers investment in which food prices are allocated.
Many bank customers showed personal consequences when finding that their bank was involved in such businesses: according to the survey, two thirds would cancelle all investments from which money come from the agricultural speculation.
43 per cent would disagree a bank as well as its acquaintances, 49 per cent would request, after reflecting, to cancelle its account and to change to another institution.
The house 21 in Vienna
The translated pupil
By Ingebor Wiensowski
A history of architecture with altibajos and a happy end, the pavillon of the Austrian universal exhibition of Brussels from 1958 obtained prizes, was in Vienna for a museum, remained empty and dismissed.
Now it is reopened as an exhibition house.
The modern postgera architecture, the clear forms, the crestal halls, the courageous curves and the new building materials, the typical of the thinking on the technical progress, so the Austrian pavilion of the Architec Karl Schwanzer for the universal exhibition of Brussels in 1958 is an appropriate and known example.
The Schanzer Pavilion then obtained the Great Architecture Price for its light and floating construction of steel and vessels.
The construction is considered to the present contemporary heat of architecture.
He made the architecture so known that also built the shepherd of Austria in the next universal exhibition.
With its legendary four cylinder tour for MBW more the adjacent building planned in Munich, it was internationally known.
His patron, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions, led after the universal exhibition in the Swizer Garten along the Southern Vienna station, was reformed in 1962 and in the launch of a 20th-century museum, called the "box 20".
The building was suitable but lacked from the suitable spaces and technologies for a museum; without any wall to collapse art, nor a good environment.
Despite this, it was used until the contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building is empty since 2001 and declines more.
Today, Architec Adolf Krischanitz reformed the pavillon, now called it "case 21" and will be used in the future as a contemporary art museum.
On Monday afternoon the beautiful museum, which belongs to the house, with the first exhibition, a shock of luck in a certain manner.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of Austrian Belarus since 2007, has reached a new start.
Husslein-Arco, historical doctor with a considerable career, among other things, art patinator on ice in his youth, later in Sotheby, the Guggenheim Museum, and director of the modern art Museum of Salzburg, realized reforms with the emphasis of political and conservators of the monuments, provided private funds and patrocinators and established their use.
Except the contemporary art, the works of the Fritz Wotruba of the human foundation, should have a coffee and a library and will be built in a office building.
Strict control, budget below
Crischanitz was the best choice to do.
It was not only because he reformed Joseph Olbrichs' Section in Vienna, and it was extended and helped him, if not because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him a "important and wide pleasant shooting", in which he said "cause all the weekends" exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which was disappeared with his transfer to Vienna in its change of use with generosity and easyness.
In current reforms there are major problems, the building was "a energy defender", said Crischanitz.
The profile of the crystal box windows was changed, a islalante cristal was installed with glass fiber and was replaced by a special security cristal.
The thermal bridges and the steel lines were strengthened or replaced, and the amianto tissue was reactivated.
Two floors were used for the new use, a slow light panel between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge to enter the building nearly new, but still the ball of Schanzer.
Keep the original doors, the house is painted in old tons caoba and protected against oxygen.
And the movie room is exactly like it was before.
And all this is with a strict control by the monument office and a low budget.
"It often had to find material that was good, cheap and also like the monument protection office", says Crischanitz and warned a soil asperor on the ground.
Despite all pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and slight.
The pabellon "when from Brussels" has been difficult, said a typical "case appearance in the history of the city."
An architecture is "will be on the wrong place" and therefore I wanted to "disperse the appropriate conscience".
In this case, house 21 is not on the wrong place, has occurred a shock of urban happiness. The completely new and planned "barrio of the central station" with housing and offices is located near the Swizer Garten.
And perhaps another chance shooting: the house 21 could receive a relief from another building of Crischanitz, because the French Collector of Habsburg has purchased the Berlin temporary art room and, as you hear, it's negotiating with the city about a neighboring place in the Swiss Garten.
German Bahn plans a winter crisis package that spends to millions
The company has planned a crisis plan that would prevent winter trains.
The number of staff should be doubled.
What's going on for millions.
In the fight against winter trains and delays, German Bahn has been spent over 70 million euros this year, according to a periodic report.
The "Image" newspaper was informed, invoking a internal crisis plan of the group, of investments expected until 2005 from a total of EUR 300 million.
In order to achieve better availability of vehicles and rail networks still with extreme time.
Among other things, internal and external employees are planned to double to 16.000 positions to remove the nest of the ways and of the eyes.
The aim is to clean the nest and ice eyes for the functioning and 90 percent of the skins required for functioning within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, President of Deutsche Bahn, warned that in the trains also during this winter after a summit with the government and industry.
The past winter German Bahn suffered significant problems in the transport of travellers, as, among other things, there were no reservations for adverse meteorological conditions.
Many new regional trains have been awaiting an authorisation of the Federal Railway Office for years.
Furthermore, there is a delay in the delivery of high speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years in checking the axis of high speed trains with frequency on the tanker, after a high speed train would suffer the rotation of an eye in the central Colombia station.
German Bank pays thousands of dollars in the United States.
After the tortule of President Josef Ackerman, a new problem from the United States is coming, the German Bank must pay for a thousand there.
As if the problems were not sufficient for Germany Bank, their past in the United States purchase the sector's biggest, the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (106 million) in an agreement to end the condenses of five major credit cooperations during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of hypothetical titles.
CNUA financial market regulator recruits many large banks to lead credit cooperation with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimised risks.
These titles lost their value during the financial crisis and led to banks to depths.
"We are satisfied to clarify the topic without the parties to take care of the courts," said a German bank portal in New York.
The bank does not grant any fault with the agreement.
This is also applicable to the Citigroup, which obliged to pay $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, Chairman of the CNAS, celebrated the defence of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (National Credit Union Administration) is responsible for the U.S. Credit Cooperatives and provides support for the protection of customer investment.
CNUA is trying to reintegre the losses of millions of origin.
Currently closed agreements are its first type.
The regulator also requested accounts for other large banks and in the summer on JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of the doubts of hypothetical titles, it is the named hypothetic values supported.
These are based on living credits.
When the US real estate bowl was established in 2007, it led to a lot of financial entities.
In September 2008, the US Investment Bank Lehman Brothers was decreased in the alguide point of the financial crisis.
Although the results occurred a few years ago, it is currently a complicated wind for the United States banks.
Investor and inspection have incontaminated processes to receive compensation or punish faults.
The Federal Financing Agency (FHFA) has produced the largest number of demands.
The 18 major international banks reiterate that the two US Hypotec Agencys Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been used in a volume of approximately $200 million.
The German Bank also has a request from FHFA, it is $14.2 million for businesses from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires that the Frankfurt Institute responds to "the substantial losses" without a precise number.
German Bank rejected the debts as infunded and explained that he wanted to defend.
Warren Buffett contributes with 10 billion to IBM
Buffett's funding guru, Buffett, has strongly invested in the IBM Information Information Technology company.
Since March, it has purchased actions for a value of more than $10 billion.
Even now, the large American investor Warren Buffett has always declared not investing in computer companies or Information Technology as long-term development prognosis are negative.
But you read the IBM commercial report and changed its opinion on investment in the sector.
It should have understood a long time before IBM offers all services and searched for computer systems for other technology departments.
In the financial world, an investment in Warren Buffett is considered a honor.
The primary information technologies should therefore be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett has currently developed in the CNBC economy emission that has purchased IBM actions for a value of $10.7 million since March.
The Berkshire Hathaway's investment has soon risen to one of the largest IBM shareholders with a 5,5 per cent involvement.
Buffett said that IBM did not know until now anything of the commitment.
He reached the direction of the regular benefits in the economic crisis.
"He made a great job", Buffett stated on the strategy.
IBM has been established for a long time with the lucrative information technology services such as calculation centres.
The old computer pioneer over 100 years also offers software and advice as well as powerful teams for businesses.
Buffett avoided technology enterprises until date.
He said he was only investing in companies whose business would understand.
On the contrary, Buffett used the occasion at a good train, in a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
The Berkshire Hathaway has about 80 own branches, as well as part of a series of large consorts such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, anciently Munchener Back.
Buffett, 81 years old, was charged by the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and, with wise investments, expanded it to become one of the most valuable enterprises in the world.
However, his lifestyle is humility.
That's why it's an idol for innumerable inversors of the world.
His rapid and inflictable sense to win money has provided him the overname of "Omaha's work".
After discovering Buffett's investment, the IBM actions in the baths were up to a percentage.
"Blue giant," as IBM is known, has a valuable value of more than 220 billion dollars, and is, together with Apple and Microsoft, among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
With Microsoft, you said Buffett, you don't want to cooperate.
Bill Gates, his founder, is an intimate friend.
The threat is specific
After the discovery of "Zwickau cell", the Turkish media doubts the German law state.
A newspaper speaks of a "very ideology" which will be re-avid.
The murders of eight small trucks and Greek entrepreneurs between 2001 and 2006 have an extreme right background.
In Turkey and the German population of Turkey has reacted with fear and concern to this news.
For many Germans of the Turkish origin, a fantasm that was believed for a long time ago, since the atents with fires in Mölln in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993 had no longer occurred episodes of violence with extremely right to Turkishs.
However, it has never been questioned that there was xenofobia in Germany.
The ultra-direct network reveals a magnitude of which sizes weren't, not much less, predictable.
"Does the blood ideology come back again?", titled the edition by the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The "Sabah" newspaper highlights the contrary to the fact that one of the criminal authors was a informant of the Federal Office of the Constitution and is concerned that German authorities may be involved in the extra-directory panama.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted sensitively, and the weekend recorded the victims of racist violence with a surveillance to the Port of Brandenburg.
Two weeks ago, the Turkish community in Berlin together with German and Turkish politicians reflected in a solemn act of the 50th anniversary of the Turkish-aleman agreement.
Conviveness was put in scene with joyful colors, such as a story with a happy end.
The information arrived to some Turkish media as a bofetada: "The gift of German for the fifty-year anniversary," says the title of a article in the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", referring to the background of the murder chain.
The German "Christ" emission also not insists on bringing this mental connection.
"Come working bad," says the title of Ahmet Kulahci's column.
It highlights that murdered were persons who paid their taxes and made an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
In the Turkish German Internet forums, the police's conduct and their success in searches are very critically discussed.
The authors understood that the German authorities have not seen long before suspected in the ultra-direct circle.
Some are shown as less retoric about the media drastically: "Dead here, immigrants are not more than self-defence and weapons."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"Germany internal peace depends strongly on the quality of the clarification and adequate sanction of all the network.", writes "Selen".
That means that if the internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen will be raised in ninety years.
The image of the fire of Solingen has been recorded in German and Turkey's memory.
No other event has shown more clearly to the Turkishs who live here that there is a concrete threat and, in the Germans, that dis confidence and distance can be marked in violence.
Anxiety is the feeling of the Turkish part of the attack.
Do not repeat the errors of the past
In the Turkish press, mainly the deficiency of German policy after attacks was criticized, Helmut Kohl refused to visit Mölln's survivors.
After the attention in the fire of Solingen, he sent a pisagram to the Turkish President and Klaus Kinkel, his Minister for Foreign Affairs, replaced him in the Columbia funeral. Kinkel detailed in his speech what they contributed to the Turkish taxes.
It is clear how the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of its taxes.
The current information of the Turkish media is to show the deepness of many Germans from Turkish origin in the legality of this country since then.
In addition to the efforts of a comprehensive explanation and re-approvement of the terrorism of extreme right in Germany, it is not possible for franc words.
The Zurich Lake Scandal Bank
The most attractive European bank is not in Italy or France, if not in Switzerland.
UBS almost entered into the financial crisis and from then from a crisis to the next.
Now it leads a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber hadn't thought it.
After his spectacular outcome of the Federal Bank, in July, it was known that in 2013, it would begin in a new and almost spectacular work: the President of the Governing Board of the large Swiss Bank, an unexpected and lucrative step in his care.
Axel Weber is publicly pleased, swimming for his beauty and the UBS for his new purchased solidity and let us get friendly observations about his future partners.
"The USB has achieved a revitalization."
"I'm glad to cooperate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
In September, it was clear that everything would be completely different.
A USB financial operator in London avoided all bank security systems and frauded EUR 1.7 million.
Oswald Grübel, Director-General of USB, was a banker not only known in Switzerland.
The President of the USB Administrative Board was considered too touched since then, and everyone asked: When did Axel Weber arrive?
Weber should consult the bank since February 2012.
And the presidency of the Governing Council in May, not at the beginning of 2013, as the bank reported on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
It is not banker, but professor of economic and advisory, and has had a safely necessary adaptation period.
He is responsible for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved that it merees the title "the largest bank of Europe's scandale" for a long time.
For one part, the USB is a huge, even recently was the world's largest administer, and on the other hand, for years, it is disabled from a scandale to the next.
Nothing, so it looks like, it's so proud to the sweet swimming sweet swimming swimming swimming snack.
The financial crisis started.
The USB was famous until 2007.
The image of the administer of discreet and solid goods, but also mature, was combined with ambitious objectives, also wished to be a large number of investment banks.
For one thing, with $1.6 billion, USB manages more money from adherent customers than any other world bank.
And, on the other hand, it made progress as investment banks in the link of the large banks in the world.
This is impressive.
Hans Geiger, the former bank professor and later professor in Zurich for many years, explains: "Before my students, I have always qualified the USB as a model of a good bank."
"After the current point of view, one questions: How could I be wrong?"
I was in a great mistake.
In 2007, it came to the light that something was very bad in the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, director-General, who was until then considered a generous and very intelligent banker, was surprised.
Some months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank's investment fund was in losses of high risk and had to love thousands of dollars.
To load this, USB announced a capital injection of nothing less than 13 billion francs.
For this, he found inversers, of course, that some look with disrespect until a little before: a Asian state and opaco of Singapore and a Arab state fund, so discreet, which has never been heard of his name.
This was just the first shot.
In April 2008, it began.
The bank had to declare the loss of thousands, Marcel Ospel, President of the Administrative Council, in 2006, in the second best paid administrative advisory of Switzerland.
In October 2008, the disaster continued, in view of its wrong investment, the UBS was found in the financial crisis against the chief and had to be saved by the state.
The National Bank purchased problems to the UBS for many thousands, Helvética Confederation gave six thousands of francs for a obligationly transformable, which was converted into the bank compliance.
All Switzerland was affected, it was stated that it was the dramatic thing for a small country, if it was expenditure to banks so large.
Finally, the sum of the UBS balance in 2007 was more than five times greater than Switzerland's economic results (see graphic).
"We can't get back to UBS," said Geiger, bank expert.
The first disaster joined the second.
A few months later, the UBS captured in a fiscal conflict with America and was prepared to deliver the data of the adherent customers, which could have been defrayed taxes with the bank's assistance.
Furthermore, it approve a number of 780 billion dollars, reimbursed by injustified benefits of these businesses with a payment compensation.
In this regard, the UBS condemned more or less had helped in fiscal fraud.
Similarly, he lost something that had been his capital for the competitive for rich customers: the discretion seat.
After the scandale, the secret of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This followed the division of the President of the joint Directive and the President of the Governing Council.
And the shooting of the customers' funds.
Thus, in a few months, the bank lost its credibility in its two central sectors: the investment bank through false speculations and the administration of goods through tax fraud.
And just when I was back to be something more quiet, just when I thought that the UBS would get it again, it happens this disappearing history of the operator, a individual operator frauded EUR 1.7 million, before the bank was counted that something was bad.
And this has been developed, so this is not still well worked with risk management in the investment bank.
"In the case of Adoboli, risk controls have changed too little", says Martin Janssen, professor of economy and financing in the Bankage Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of a large German bank also is safe: "The problem of the UBS is that it is not dominating risk controls".
What happened to the precaution idea, with which Swiss bankers had been presented for a long time, be the guards of the world's largest goods: no too large risks, instead, money security wants to fall on the other side of the Alpine Republic.
The security deposits of Swiss banks were the symbol of incapacity, such as Lindt and Sprüngli of the true chocolate.
The UBS central in Zurich does not cover the click of the Swiss solid private bank, it's just a little more.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its main seat on the Bahnhofstraße Street of Zurich, which goes from the main station directly to the Zurich lake, marked by the swimming snow clouds of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are huge, households are one of the highest in Europe.
There are joyers like Tiffany's's traditional Swiss business, such as Sprüngli confidence.
There are many years ago the Swiss banks: from the national bank, passing through the Credit Suisse palace, to private bank elections like Julius Bär.
The UBS Reception room is entered through a heavy tour door.
Among the walls are revested from marmol, in front of the bank's logo, there is a large letter to indicate the "security".
UBS knows what the customer looks here: security.
The two large Swiss banks, the UBS and credit Swiss, at any time moved the idea of the large Swiss bank, or have traited it, as the President of a small private bank.
Do you prefer not read your name in the newspaper, at the end and at the end, as all Swiss banks, also with the business of both large banks.
UBS has been too large, especially in the investment bank, where Anglosajones have winned land.
There the suicide had nothing more than say.
"And they have been buried for a long time to the habitats of the anglesajones."
In fact, the UBS changed the English investment bank, delivered its first great wine and then came the disaster, no European financial entity had lost so much money in the jungle of high risk as the large Swiss bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was obvious.
"Their Monday, the government coalition of the small country of seven million decided the greatest rescue operation in the history of his nation," writes the author Lukas Hassig in his book "The UBS-Crash" ("The crash of the UBS" in Spanish).
Politicals granted up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros to save the large bank of the routine bank.
How can they happen?
It is talking to Swiss bankers, so you see the problem in the dimension of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks were fusioned in a powerful consortium.
There was a bank that was too big for Switzerland, and still growing.
It is therefore that the two different UBS precursor banks would be supplemented: a rich but sleeping bank with the centre of the ownership of goods in Zurich and a poor but stronger internationalization.
Unfortunately, internationalized investment banks arrived with a lot of money, with which they could roll a large financial bicycle.
There are two names related to this UBS submission: Peter Wuffli, head of UBS consortium from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then President of the Administrative Board.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team," says the bank experts in Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, which understands much of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive that could open up a step from learning in the bank to the top."
Finally, Ospel flew from Wuffli.
And at the end of Wuffli was probably a decisive error: "Think his models were a reality," says Geiger.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It is clear: The disaster came before the case.
UBS employees are clearly remembered of the guide meetings, where Wuffli, the Consortium Chief, always repeated the same subject: Down of the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
The "League Tables", the classifications that then documented the success of the banks.
The UBS wanted to be on the top.
Some steps made him good.
In the division operations and the negotiation of actions was higher.
However, enterprises advisers pointed out a weak point: In the business of international interest, "fixed income" bank language, there is a huge compensation for the large banks.
UBS has empty in American hypothetical products.
To fill these empty, UBS started an adventure that almost costs its existence.
The same bank as one of its high-risk funds created in American high-risk investments.
It was converted into a powerful machine to hold American hypotecary credits and to sell them below, maintaining certain risks at its own level.
And also, as other banks searched the low for a long time.
"In summer 2007, as the American real estate market was in calls, the UBS bought there", said Geiger, bank expert.
So big the Euphoria, so deeply falling.
A manager had to go, because the attempt to order resulted more complicated than they were expected.
The UBS posts became designable seats and are insecure until now.
Today, who is leading to a large bank, has almost impossible work.
There should be a strategy for a bank where all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, expert in banks, has an idea to finish the investment bank, focus on the administration of goods, return to Swiss roots.
The bank does not want to reach so far (all).
But the investment bank must decrease much, it is now clear.
The next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new President of the bank, will present its future strategy to the world.
In fact, only in Italian-Sustaining 51 years was considered a transitional solution, since the bank was surprisingly separated from its previous Grübel.
However, he was imposed: the UBS's business must be directed permanently, the Zurich bank reported on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return to the investment bank to its state in average from the ninety.
Delete 3.500 posts.
But this isn't enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What do you want to win money?
These are the security questions that Axel Weber is currently doing.
He's just saying he'll first find a living with his wife in Zurich.
The next year.

Intelligent grains are extensive in the cities
In many places, grains are considered "problemic places": they are not expulsed to these intelligent animals from the city for a long time, they claim the experts.
Some like them, others want to be free from them very fast, the grains belong to the image of the city for years, but in many municipalities the complaints of the neighbors are cumulated by the desire and the smiling of the animals.
Although it hasn't appeared any means towards the "problemic packaging" until now.
The grains are no longer out of the towns, claim the experts in the first symposium on grains in Leer, East Frisia.
There are experts in the whole national territory to discuss possible solutions.
Search for alternatives in towns
Echologists contribute to urban problems to migration of certain protected grains; chemical applications in the agriculture are visiblely completed with traditional vital spaces.
Caza, growing construction and fall of trees that hospitalize them are difficult to live birds.
The grains are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 players in Soest, West Falia, among others, northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Ahim in Bremen, and Leer.
There in 2005 was a conflicting project to kill the grains of the district in mass mass.
Critics have qualified the cast of animals through birds tramps and murder with balls as especially brutal.
"Expulsing them and helping them in a normal way you can't get anything," Warner Klöver, urbanist and Countryist of Leer expressed.
Disparing with water to the nests or cut the trees often be unwanted consequences, Manfred Kaiser, also states that the environmental experts in Lahr, Baden-Wurtemberg.
"The animals are disappeared, the great colonies of dividing and distributing in other places."
To help them only is imaginable as exceptions in hospitals, elderly or college residences.
"We must live with them, we don't take them anymore."
Without the surroundings, the problem is not resolved in the towns, so Wolfgang Kellner, the Chamber of Leer.
It is possible to combine the animals of sensitive residential areas and cereals in order to retreat in other places.
"Intelligent panes instead of chain sellers" Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and etnologist makes publicity against the purpose of treating the animals in a completely different form: "The best is that we can suffer a pico in the face with applomo".
Jürgen co-funded in Schleswig-Holstein the teaching circle on the grains of Ascheberger, where letters informed the life of the birds intelligent.
While so, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also have his own opinion on the critics by the smiling of the birds: "All are forms of communication, they have much to say."
Intelligence and ability of these animals are legendary, grains do not only use the resources to access low skis, if not making tools to use them as resources.
Recently, Ethologs of the University of Cambridge tested in four degrees to where the bird’s intellectuality arrives.
In a experiment, the birds learned rapidly that they had to leave a stone on a platform to achieve a polylla width.
Without a lot of training, they determined the size and the way that the stone should have to fall on the platform.
In a second test, grains should solve a complicated problem.
The researchers put a small cube with a polylla width in a vertical cylinder.
The birds couldn't get to their bag with the pico.
But the investigators left them a drunk.
With which the four animals formed a ring, with which they fished the cube in the tube shoot.
Three of the four grains made it in the first trial.

Personal Mask
The intense and generous new book of Peter Englind, The beauty and pain of the battle (The Beauty and the Sorrow): An intimate story about the First World War, "it begins with a long dramatic person of the kind that can make him shocked.
Here are some action advice: Start this page and convert it to your pages.
He will be very well known to these people in the novel quote of Mr. Englind, and this dramatic person will work as his GPS, a fake during these few moments in which, as one of its men and women, is confused and displaced in the nest of war.
Mr. Englind is a Swedish historian and journalist.
It is also the new permanent secretariat of the Swedish Academy, which grants the Nobel Prize of Literature.
What you've written here is a little currency book, which, obviously, describes as "a work of anti-Historical."
Contains some notable names, treated important or famous battles; almost no embassy, elegant journalists and discussions on tactics.
It is not so a book about what happened, as "A book about how it happened". It is about "sessions, impressions, experiences and states of humor".
"The beauty and pain of the battle " combines experiences in war times of more than 20 men and women at both sides of the war, from colleagues and botanics to scanners, doctors, ambulance and administrative conductors.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will be converted into war prisoners, or they will lose their members, or they will be crazy or died.
Your lives are part of here as vocative vessels in a church; some new ones are added to the mixture while others are removed.
The book of Mr. Englind is a division of standard history books.
It is also a correct idea that the First World War was only the war of trinkers in the western front.
"The beauty and pain of the battle" is expertly moved through other war theatres: the Alpes, the Balkans, the Eastern front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The troops in this book are above the pillars; one pass the Christmas in Egypt under the piramides; the tse-tse mosquies are an intraactive problem.
This is a comforting book, almost from the beginning.
The war involves the lives of these people as a natural disaster, a hurrican Katrina who is in a corditate manner.
When the artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you're a woman who is home with your children, are you staying or shooting?
Of all the ways, who comes?
Never understand what's happening, nor why you have to fight this war.
"Feace of facts," observes Mr. Englind, "he filled with conjections, suggestions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiration theories, dreams, pains and rums."
"The beauty and pain of the battle" continues to individuals such as Florence Farmborugh, a English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a German young marine of the high sea fleet.
His stories have been obtained in most of their memorys, letters and other materials already published previously.
The explanations of their lives can be atterrant or comfortable, but are more full of life in the accumulation of small moments, lost details of Mr. Englind.
Many of these are about privacy and resolve them with what there is.
It is about to telling the story of a German college said, "Seedane, for all parts of the event."
"Falmed coffee suite, false aluminium, imitation leg, paper sales, wood bottles."
He continues to talk about the event of food in Germany.
Describes "coated meat and presumed in meat grass (and covered with a false egg made of wood); smoking made of roots and skins of seed patatas; shoes with wooden steel."
There is, observed, "837 substitutes for meat in the production of salts, 511 substitutes of the registered coffee."
Some stories are about honor and value.
A American recognizes its own impulse to salvation and demonstrate about the war: "You feel that, after all, this is what men are designed and not to sit in sillons with a cigarette and a whisky, the newspaper of the late or a best seller, and to pretend that this barnis means civilization, and that there is no barbara behind that dry and tachoned skin."
On the contrary, a British soldier is aware that he will probably die, and that no one will know or importate it.
"When one resigned himself to the thinking of sacrifice, one would like to think that could happen before the public," writes.
Instead, it is horriblely seemed to be "a convicted being strangered in secret".
Other observations are about a old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has become more economic competition", writes Mr. Englind, "a war between factors."
Reflects the arrival of what he called "a new species in the teenage of the young century: The elocunt murderer in mass ideologically convincing with good-confection clothes that runs his carnicery while sit behind a desktop."
People are conducted in impressive ways; there are both innocent and heroic behavior.
Mr. Englind speaks of soldiers who actively tried to cover a veneral disease of prostitutees as a way to escape the service in front.
"The largest expression of this can be seen in the trade of genococies, that soldiers buy and engage with that with hope to end in the hospital," writes.
"They who are really unexpected are frozen him on their eyes, which often from place to a ceguere of life."
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Mr. Englind ágil, but not extravagant, it is perfectly adapted to his human task.
In decades of small scenes, the way the war to "exceptlessly uncontrolled forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hate".
People start to ask why their leaders are fighting them.
The best books about the First World War have often been indirect, such as The Great War and the modern memory of Paul Fussell, or news as No news in front of Erich Maria Remarque, instead of comprehensive stories.
The volume of Mr Englind is one of the little conventional pieces.
Your book has one of the most devastating finals that I can remember in a non-fiction work.
I won't find it.
But it's like if I had come from your book, launched from among your fingers this dramatic person page, and he was shooted with a cell.
After a false step in advance, a planned shock at minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them carrying anti-disturbic boxes.
It was elected on Monday night because the Zuccotti Park would be empty.
The operation was maintained in secret for some high-range officials, first say to others that they were joining to an exercise.
The police inspector Raymond W. Kelly was in the center, his presence stressed how the operation was struggling for the police department.
The recent week episodes could not be repeated, such as the pulvering of pyramids on the manifestants, infringing the department's standards and establishing a public sympathy Torment to the "okupas".
And so the police operation to remove the Zuccotti Park of Protestants was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
Agents had been prepared to see how occupation had been developed in other cities.
A larger catastrophic simulator was holding place in Randalls Island, with a eye looking at Zuccotti.
The agents increased the call for disorder training - contra-terrorist measures that implyed to move rapidly to a large number of police officials - to focus on the Lower Manhattan Lower.
The last training meeting was on Monday night, on the side of the Eastern river Manhattan.
The orders to enter the park arrived in the "last minute", said someone known with the commands, which refered to the mission only to "a exercise".
"To the little police I know that they were called for this, they didn't tell them that it was to enter the Zuccotti Park," said the person who spoke an anonymously.
"The only people who knew they were going to enter the Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the Department."
A reason for secretism was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, some agents wanted to dispatch the park, but they disappeared when hundreds of manifestants had occurred before they heard about the plans.
The march operation involved a number of police units, including special forces from the whole municipal district - decades of mobile agents who usually solved barriers with high criminality index.
Mr. Kelly said many people, like those traveling daily to work, were going and coming from the park during the day, making a good time to enter.
"It was appropriate to do it when I was the lowest number of people in the park," said.
Camions of the Emergency Services Unit with Focus and High Vows were gathered on the cross of Pike Slip with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan’s bridge, before leaving.
The pregnant lights and messages from the high voices appeared intimidating many manifestants.
The Community affair agents were at the park with their blue courts, many demonstrators simply collected their things and went.
No shop was touched until 1:45 p.m., said the police, giving time to protesters to collect their belongings.
Other agent teams were seen together in the perimeter to enter if they needed detention in the park.
The journalists in the park were forced to abandon it.
Paul J. Browne, head of the police Department, said that he was for his security.
But many journalists said that they were trying to prevent the police to act in the park, and they had been treated brushly by the agents.
Mr. Browne said that the mobile TV units in Church Street, along the west border of the park, could take images.
As the police moved to the western through the margin of the demonstrators' personal effects, including paper-based equipment and clothing platforms, teams of the Department of Limpieza followed them, recognizing what was left behind.
Some demonstrators who refused to move themselves were draught out, appearing on Internet pictures a few times later.
A central group of demonstrants took positions near the campsite kitchen area, near the center of the park.
Some were made a barrier, and the police went to arrest them metodically.
About 10 people in the camping epics were crowned by their arms.
And two people caught in trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency agents were called to cut the candes.
No arrests were held in the park until at 3:30 p.m., said Mr. Kelly.
The departure operation was completed about 75 minutes later, said the police.
Mr. Browne said some 142 persons were arrested in the park.
The majority of the arrests were "alterance of the public order and resistance to the authority", said.
The highest officer at the scene was Joseph J. Espósito, the head of the Department, the upper official uniformized in the Department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the department's detective chief, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, when I was present, "I was not directing the operations," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of agents was waiting around the east of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Streets, where they had to enter.
It was barried on the Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on the Pine Street, a block south.
From those positions, the police was seen by expanding the perimeter even beyond the Zuccotti Park.
At a given moment, a series of agents, many of them with echoes, were seen by pushing people out.
There were some 28 people in the northern danger.
Some of the night's most rude action was located south of the park.
About 5:00 p.m., on the south of the Pine Street, a demonstrant stood over the head of a police car, and others saw the air of a police car.
At a moment given, a piece of contrachapade came to fly from the multitude.
At the end, a agent and a demonstrator were hospitalized.
The workshop's workshop will request the city for dispatchs
The synagogue that represents hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to ask the city on Wednesday, arguing that disabilities were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their unproportional impact on schools to poor students.
The request may be the last weapons of the cluster of the municipal district 37 in its efforts to revoke the disappointments.
Sixty-third and two school assistants, parents coordinators and other employees who were among the worst payers of the city lost their work on October 7 in a movement that the sindical leaders described as a political wage for their negative injury to allow, the past spring, access by the city to health care funds for work groups to closure their budgetary frame.
The municipal authorities have dismissed the accused catalogically.
In a hearing last month, the education adviser Dennis Walcott said that dispatchs were part of the budget adopted in June.
One member of the Council agreed to say that nothing in the budget specificated that members of the school support staff would be disappointed.
The officers of the municipal district 37 said that they had submitted a written complaint by the Department of Education that it would be requested. A press conference will be held on Monday to announce the official presentation of the request at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The request will include Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education of the city as accused, and take into account eight employees as demanders, all of them black or Latin women, as well as most of the assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, port of the Legal Department of the city, said that the city had not seen the request and therefore could not make comments on his specific allegations.
According to a New York Times demander, the synagogue has focused on the number of dismissed schools in the poor areas of the city to support a claim for unjust treatment, saying that the poor schools lost more assistants, because they were inadequately subventioned in chronic form.
It is noted that even though there was no disappointment in State Island and a few schools in East Side or TribeCa, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in the 23th district in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were discharged in the districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
In view of the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by the Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 per cent of the students live in poverty, the question says, "This is not a barrier of adherent parents that can recur funds to cover the budgetary deficit."
P.D. The district 36 budget was 3.26 per cent of this year, and also lost money when the city changed the way to calculate the additional financing for each poor student in schools.
The synagogue also states that secondary school directors may have been inflicted by the language in a memorandum that authorises the dispatch of parents’ coordinators.
The memorandum used the word "excedente" to describe the action, although "excedent" often describes the act to transfer to a teacher of a school to a labour, whose wages are paid by the central office.
"Sixty and six parents coordinators were disappointed," the complainant said, "and not only in overwhelming."
Finished mission, the Congress prepared to reach an agreement on Libya
It seems that finally the Republicans and Democrats in the Capitol are willing to agree on something related to the resurrection in Libya.
All that was needed was that the rebellion had succeeded, that the Veteran Dictator Muamar the Gadafi was captured and killed, and the involvement of the United States came to the end.
On Monday, the Senate's Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution which is dealt with President John Kerry (democratized by Massachusetts), together with Senators John McCain (republica by Arizona) and Joseph I. Amorrman (Independent by Connecticut), applauded the libraries for his complete rebellion and the troops of the United States.
"This resolution is to honor Libya's courage, starting to rebuild their country," said Kerry.
"It's a statement of bipartid support for its democratic aspirations."
The language may seem unfair, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy until now.
This summer, both parties legislators were fighting between themselves and the White House on the drafting of a series of resolutions to adopt or reject the role of the United States military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution authorized by the limitated use of United States military forces in Libya.
The draft law was decreased in the House by a wide bipartidist margin, which has never come to vote at the Senate.
However, the same day that the law project was rejected in the House, the camera also rejected a measure that would have been funded for U.S. operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a type of legislative purchase - with the Congress it is quite angry to criticize the maneuver by Obama from the mission, but not so angry as to actually strike the herbal under his feet.
Next, the indecision of the Congress was overcome by the events.
Tripoli went into the hands of the Libyan rebellion in August, and Gadafi was killed on October 20.
The OTAN Mission has been officially completed on October 31.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The resolution of the Foreign Affairs Committee "healthes the people of Libya for its tremendous and extraordinary resistance to be released to themselves" and "rejoices the men and women of the United States armed forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary valuable and professionality".
The resolution also "declares the United States national interest in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya".
Will the new measure be fully supported by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, or will it share legislators as drafted by the June Act?
The last version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the principal Republic of the Committee.
Lugar's porter said the Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law project.
On the other side of the Capital, the House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment requesting a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all the Republican congresses and some democrats.
The measure, issued by the Republican Bob Goodlatte (republic of Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other item that actually reaches a vote of the whole assembly in the House or the Senate in this Congress.
Other legislators have not succeeded until the time to reach their amendments to the Assembly, but not because of the lack of intentions.
Goodlatte is only one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, which covers a wide range of topics.
Some are doubled - the same law project is proposed both in the House and in the Senate - and others with light variations between themselves.
There are at least 15 versions of the amendment of the budget balance as only in the House, and another "controlled the federal expenditure".
Some of these law projects are also identical among themselves, but give their patrocinators - especially every new Republicans who seek to restore their posts - the opportunity to shoot that they were the "auteurs" of that measure.
The Budgetary Control Act, which was adopted in August, requested both the House and the Senate to vote on a amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted for a non-combining resolution which supports the idea of that amendment.
Besides the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates that members of the Congress may carry out while the representative José E. Serran (New York democrat), wants to remove the limit of two mandates for the Chairmans.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrata by Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments to ensure the right to quality and health care, among others.
A amendment prohibiting homosexual marriage is a pertinent proposal, as well as one that prohibits the burden of flags.
Some legislators also want to allow the cancellation of federal laws if they are rejected by two thirds of the states.
Such an enthusiasm that have been members at the time of proposing amendments, they are not moved to a faster rhythm than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 amendments and submitted 66 in 110th.
The ritm is unacceptable in comparison with the 1990s when members regularly submitted more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they did not have much more success then than they have now.
The last amendment that was added - on 27 - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed by the Congress in 1789.
"Giffords speaks in his first television interview from the shoot.
Ten months after a gun shot him in a constituting act in Tucson, the representative Gabrielle Giffords (democrata by Arizona) appeared on the national television night of the Monday, sing together from Broadway's Melodia "The sun will come tomorrow" and said that he wanted to come back more than he wanted to return to the Congress.
In his appearance at ABC News "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords was fighting for prayers and needed help to walk.
The program documented its difficult way back of the damages caused by a ball that cut the crap to the left side of his brain, and passed from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he returned to the Chamber to issue his triunfant vote in the debt chain agreement.
In his first television interview from January, which killed six and smiled at 13, Giffords smiled, smiled and sing - and described its recovery as "facilial".
When Sawyer asked him how he felt, Giffords, 41 years old, answered: "Better good."
The interview with Giffords and his husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a special programme of "20/20" of a duration time, which was issued the hope of the publication of the new book of the couple, "Gabby: a history of courage and hope".
The special programme analyzed the recovery of Giffords since the shot of 8 January.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first weeks, it is seen in his hospital bed, with the sweet head and a long skin over the front.
She can only keep one or two fingers, while her husband's soul.
Means later, Giffords is seated in a round seat while the therapeutics taught you how to do these simple actions.
A head move.
A frustration of the lips.
And then, your first word, "What."
In a few days, Giffords proclaimed another word - "to this place", a request for change in his breakfast menu.
Videos distributed by ABC show that music has played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: it looks at the congressist, playing together with the therapy the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" of Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, which was two hours ago therapy every day, said that you don't remember the shooting day.
His husband said he was reading him to Giffords a newspaper about the murder of March 12 when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who died in the incident.
The suspected gun, Jared Lee Loughner, is guarded in a Missouri prison and is being meditated by the force while waiting for judgment.
"My people died," Giffords said to Sawyer.
"Dur, hard, hard."
Kelly said to Sawyer that at a moment of her wife's recovery, she said, "I'm broken."
"That, I said to him, 'Gabby, you're not broken," said Kelly.
"You've been shooted only.
And you'll get out of this, and you'll get back and you're going back with more strength than ever."
The troops make feeling more lamentable than I respect
The event was a Wall Street gallery that led millions to the veterinary veterinary in New York.
Kid Rock sing a ball on impotence, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundreds of soldiers, marine soldiers, aircrafts and marine children cut off in their posts around him.
The wide range of labels was put from foot and applauded.
"The men and women were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the recovery of spring funds.
A high-range military officer in the gala, also known as the president of the Conjunto State, Almighty Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops in a different manner.
"They shown them as a kind of orphan kid," the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But he wasn't respecting, really.
Markedly contradicting pressures illustrate the difficult relationship with military and a American public often distantly worshipper.
The troops are offered with joy for their sacrifices.
But loving has a price, they say the members of the service.
The public is more acting as if they are punishing those uniforms.
"We are not victims absolute," said the general bride Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But the only way that some show their support is to put us into the role of dispersed souls."
The topic is a very sensitive to the military leaders, who do not want to look unpleasant or disappointed with the public to whom they serve.
It is also understood that the angry against the troops returned in the past years of Vietnam war was much worse.
As a result, most discussions on the latest are conducted in silence and in private among war veterinaries.
After his two children returned to fighting with Marina's Infantry, the retreated colon Mark Cancian warned them that the people separated from the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some were looking at them with a fear because they faced insurance and traveled to exotic places.
Others would be asked whether there would be a "happy and violent veteran under the surface", said Cancian, who joined in Iraq and returned to a high-level work of the government in Washington.
During his employment search, he felt that some interviewers had asked him to be able to suffer under the pressure of a requesting worker from Washington immediately after their struggle.
"When you talk about your service, you need to face negative impressions", recalled Cancian by connecting it to your children.
The military concern is, in part, from the American indiference towards wars.
The achievements in the fighting field are rarely chosen to loめ by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees few direct benefits of Iraq and Afghanistan ' s wars.
"We, as a nation, have no longer appreciated military heroism in ways that were all common in the Second World War," said the general Tender David Barno, who commanded the US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the joy of the political and public is focused on the depth of a member's suffering.
The troops are recognised by the number of rounds they have supported, the number of friends who have lost or the extent of their lessons.
The army faces a growing pressure to end with violation
This week, a historical hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the army for their patience against violation.
If not, hundreds of applicants are organized for the following.
The first Elizabeth Lyman soldier had 25 and 11 weeks of pregnancy in the night in which she said that he was violated by a friend.
It was October 2008, and he was headed back to his quarter at the Air Miramar Base, north of San Diego, after the dinner with a friend when he was found with a colleague who brought a pack of 12 beverages.
He asked him if he could join her in her room to take a cup.
"I've been a alarm signal," Lyman says.
However, the native in Texas left her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"It's Texas," says.
"I would have heard my instincts."
In the few minutes of entering Lyman's room, the man closed to him back and took her down and violing it, he argued.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and other 27 members of the current and old military personnel are awaiting an judicial decision in a historic court that will be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the request that they have interrogated against the Defence Secretary of Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be judicial.
The request claims that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce generalized violations among military in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
In February by Susan Burke, a lawyer at Washington, D.C., the request was initially involved 17 demanders, but increased to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of them claimed that they were violated or sexually attacked by their companions, and that the army failed to investigate, process, or providing appropriate justice after the arrested attacks.
Burke says he's going to the largest army, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a structure upwards," says.
"Who are those who are able to eradicate the culture of reprise? The high command."
Burke also says that since February, some 400 survivors have been contacted with her, many of which could be part of future demands.
Your strategy: Instead of accumulating all demanders in this case, putting all the eggs into the same shoe, so say, it will present several cases, if necessary, to keep the pressure.
The Defence Team for the Department of Defence, headed by the Federal Federal Neil MacBride, presented a movement to dismiss the case.
The court documents obtained by Newsweek declare the Defence Strategy - in the essence that militarys cannot be requested by current or old soldiers by the injury suffered in armed forces.
By a sentence of the Supreme Court of 1950 called Dr. Ferres, the federal government is not responsible for the damages suffered by the staff in active service.
"Delegated damages are part of the military service of the applicants," said the documents.
The Department of Defence refused to comment on this article.
The things have changed since the 50s.
While women are still officially banned to fight, this distinction is only nominal: modern wars have rarely clearly the front lines.
Even in Iraq as in Afghanistan, military women ' s teams are playing more important roles, especially to reach local women in war areas.
The result: Among these two wars, 150 soldiers have died and two thirds of them in fight situations.
It's time that the army also modernizes, says Burke.
She's not alone in his fight, and three other demands are running, in addition to her.
In the Yale Law Faculty, the Veterinary Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four main military academys for the purpose of promoting a mixed environment.
Furthermore, the organisation of Vietnam Veterans of America is composing a request against the army focusing on the diagnostics of "personal disorder" assigned to the victims of violation to give them the high of the service - a common event, according to the activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women's Action Network in Service, a group of human rights.
His group submitted a request in December against the Veterano administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in order to handle the claims of benefits for persons who claimed to have been sexually aggressively in the service.
nine legislative projects were submitted separately in the Congress by a bipartideist mixture of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010 there were 3.158 sexual aggressions complained by the Office for the Prevention of Sexual Agression and Response of the Department of Defence.
However, aggressions are significantly infringed, and by the Pentagon's own estimates, which are about 13.5 per cent of the 19.000 estimated incidents that have occurred in that year.
The report, published in March, also reviews the processing indexes: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases complained in the army were judged - half in the civil justice system.
The applicants in Burke's case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, he condemned the predicted violation of the military police less than one hour after that happening.
On that night, he was asked to tell him the details of his violation 11 times different to a lot of police, doctors and commanders.
She was subjected to a kit of violation, and the blood of her aggressor - of a cut in his arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, in which he was asked about having sexual relations with her girlfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people declared as a witness of personality on behalf of the presumed author, which was finally absolved.
"I remember the day you read the verdict," says Lyman.
"I thought I would go to work -- I found me crying from the room."
"I was put into the psychiatrist unit, and when I went out, I remembered that I told him to my command officer, "It wasn't his judgment. That was my judgment."
Lyman was ordered to visit an military psychiatrist, which finally diagnosis a disorder of personality, which did not accept it for the service.
In January 2010, service was dispensed under less honorable terms, which prevented it from receiving any benefits.
With regard to if the case submitted by Lyman and its demanding partners continues, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, professor of law in the George Washington College.
However, notes, "In my opinion, they should be able to continue."
What is interrupted between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was published for the first time.
I've been a permanent criticy of the Doctorine Feres.
The army has been decades behind because he does not have the same incentive and dissuasion that poses responsibility.
And adds: "The possibilities are strongly against them, but it is important for them to try it."
These things are only changed when the good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing does not go on his way, Burke, lawyer of the applicant, will put the colle to his other hundreds of demandors for future cases.
"We will continue to fight army in this issue until the reform is produced," says.
"or until we die, what happens first.
The walls have eyes: How the researchers are studying you in Facebook
Before turning into the new face of the extreme right side in Europe, Anders Berring Breivik was just another type that had its online anti-immigration views.
On Monday, Breivik, who acknowledged a murder in Norway in July, who left 77 dead, was encountered to his first public court hearing.
While Breivik could have acted alone, it was far away to be only in the cyberspace: most of the time had passed before his attack against his computer, charlating with some of the millions of nationalists who support the rights groups in social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Facility - you just have to enter Facebook.
"We say that it was not so difficult to reach them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recently published report on the European digitalism by the British DemoS Center.
The Facebook personal information allies is so encyclopediatic, says Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic features with a scientific precision - the way the salers have been used for years.
The Bartlett team found a half million fans of the right groups throughout Europe and then directed them advertising, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, advertising invited users to complete an investigation that asked about their educational level, attitudes towards violence and optimism on their own future.
By reaching Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers of 14 extreme right games in 11 European countries - all without leaving the office.
"It's a completely new way to make an investigation," Bartlett says.
Some of the results are not very surprising: the online partys of the right groups tend to be young, men and angered by immigration.
However, in a kind of round, "they who combine their activeism online with outside line activity are more reasonable, democratic and less violent than those remaining behind the computer's screen."
The DEMOS work is only an example of how Facebook is converting into a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.
Scientific centres, medical researchers and political researchers are using the site to study all, from health problems to social trends as expressed in the "I like," messages in the walls and state updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding a average of three pieces of content per day, Facebook's "base data" is generating an increase in the research, stimulating the number of academic works with the name of the site in the title to almost 800% in the past five years.
For some researchers, Facebook's beauty is that it allows you to study people whom you couldn't close to you with a folder on the street.
"And when you tried to find people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You would have to go through the party, and they would never allow you access," Bartlett says.
"Facebook removes all this - you're going to them directly."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address social health problems.
A recent study carried out by Dr. Megan Moreno, the University of Wisconsin-Madison and its colleagues found that university students who spoke of their cups in Facebook had a significantly higher risk of having problems with drinking than students remaining silenced about the topic.
They suggest that student partners, such as residential advisers, could control the site and intervene to help a student who is publicly delayed state updates with their shoes.
"You can't handle a problem if you can't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, co-autor of Moreno and director of the Health Center, Conduct and Development of Child at the Child Research Institute of Seattle, said Washington Post.
"We found a way to identify children in risk that otherwise would not be diagnosed."
Facebook is also constantly "pinning" to his own population to get data.
The Site Data Team has developed statistics on the status of the relationship and the Day of San Valentín, the expectative election participation in half the 2010 legislative period, and a National Felicity Index (for example, using the information that can be accessed - the Defenders of Digital Freedom for a long time that the site should provide other large numbers of data for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching you, guests or not - the sacrifice to play the Scrabble with a friend to thousands of miles of distance is to allow the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users are being part of a survey that they don't even know?
While researchers have well defined guidelines about how to collect their data outside line, online is a free bar for everyone.
"I don't think that many users have even thought that a investigator could be reviewing their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologue of the London laboratory, about a 2006 study conducted with the public Facebook walls of students.
"In what they were concerned, it was just between them and their friends."
It's just war.
Even outside line, there is no guarantee that a research theme is completely honest.
In Facebook, it is impossible to know that part of the information on the profile of a user and the messages of the wall are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two very different things," says Selwyn.
That's why, despite its years as technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a subject and a boligraph are still the best research tools that nobody can use.
"There is no replacement to enter the real world and speak to the real people," says.
"Social research is supposed to be about the social - and a lot of social happens still out of line."
"Free and Inhuman: Anders Berring Breivik makes his first public appearance in the court
Anders Berring Breivik, the man who condemned being the brain of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has been described itself as a fighter of "resistance" during his first public appearance in the Oslo court.
"I am a military commander in the Norway resistance movement and the Norwegian Temple Chambers," said before a room fully filled with 500 people.
"I am opposed to the court, because he received the mandate of the organizations that support hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts but I don't declare guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologist, because "I didn't want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform to express their views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a written conversation with advance, to address the families of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for more than 12 weeks, prohibited access to communication media for four weeks, and said that the authorities should have a strict control over all visits and correspondance for eight weeks.
Around 30 survivors and families of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came with the hope to look at Breivik at the eyes, others to confirm that they are recreated under the key.
All attended the goal of progress towards the conclusion.
"I thought it seemed cold and inhuman," said a survivor of Utoya to the NRK's NRK.
"I was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and listening to the suspect."
In clothing with a dark and blue clothes, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked at the journalists and survivors when he entered and out of the building.
Despite the strange notion of Breivik to be part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge decided that it was not a mental nursing, and said that there are no evidence to act with compromises.
Some may consum that the attacks of 22 July seem to be an extremist instead of a root group.
But that does not automatically remove pain and confusion that the whole nation still feels.
"I would like to look like a monster, but it doesn't seem", said a family of the victim.
"I would be much easier if I looked like it."
7 Lectures of the lost interview by Steve Jobs, are shown in a theatre this week
After the death of Steve Jobs, on October 5, there were some who compared it with Henry Ford - distinguing the genius of technology such as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what the fans of Apple could find more revelator, in an interview on Jobs recently re-discovered, which has been played as a advancement of a series of special projections on the largest markets this week, is how much I understanded this creative mind about the commercial processes and the working flows of products.
He was uncertainly a designer, dreamer and hyppie authorized, but he was also a meticolous organizer and a yonki of the flow diagrams - a man who believed that many executives suffered "a disease that consists of thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the TV series The Triumph of the Nerds (The Triumph of the idiots) on the homes of the personal computer, and was sent for more than one hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
At that time they had been less than 10 years since Jobs had been obliged to walk from Apple, and she had already worked intensely in its new NeXT computer company, waiting for the popular Internet adoption.
While a small part of Cringely's interview was used in Nerds, he said that the original interview was missed during its transport.
It was only after the death of Jobs that was discovered a complete copy in VHS in the director's garage.
This file material, slightly revised, is the base of Steve Jobs: The lost interview of 68 minutes, which arrives to the Chinese Landmark this Monday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate interviews in depth, Jobs here seems awkwardly ready to exposure its technological philosophy and commercial strategies.
And that's very thinking.
In four different points along the interview, there are great silences between questions and answers - from 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, where Jobs is clearly suspecting their thoughts, looking for accuracy.
There are also moments in which the perfectionism of Jobs comes to the surface, where it seems unconscious because of Cringely's questions, encouraging him to go quickly to the topics or arguments of greater importance.
Filmed before Pixar's era, iPod or iPhone, there's something strangely prophetic in The Lost Interview, when Jobs evaluates what other companies do well and bad, and offers its own vision of the future of the computer.
One thing is reading poststumm evaluations of Jobs, but there's something cruel and inspiring in the Jobs we see here, the dreamer at the edge of the size.
He has a vision of how he can and must be things.
Not much after explaining everything here, it was and did it.
A rapid summary of seven remarkable sequences of The Lost Interview:
About how he learned to take a business:
"In the years of business, I always asked, "Why do you do things?" And the answers that you give are: "Oh, that's the only way to do."
Nobody knows why he does what he does, no one thinks about things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs provides details of your efforts to simplify Apple accountability.
Unconcerned by the way the costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard coast" that was done at the eye of good cube, and then adjusted with a "variable" - developed an automatized manufacture that ensured that they could determine commercial costs to details.
About the smile to Pope:
Jobs born the "Blue Cacha" which he himself built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allows people to effectively hack the telephone company and call for a long distance.
It has been widely written about the device, but the Euforia of Jobs here by describing the Blue Box as a empowerment act is contagious.
Describe how he and Wozniak tested the box through the use of a public phone, make a call, and then connecting from a AT & T network to another, while creating a ship with the most possible number of satellites.
"We were involveing things around the world a twenty-five times and crying through the public phone and returning a minute later to the public phone from the door by the side," says Jobs with a ride.
"We were young and what we learned was that we could build something that could control thousands of dollars in infrastructure throughout the world."
Our two, we didn't know much, but we could build a small thing that could control a magnificent thing - it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think I would have never existed Apple without it.
Jobs continues to describe a glorious brome that he and Wozniak almost abandon, calling the Vatican through the Blue Cache in half the night and asking to talk to the Pope, while his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
While several members of the Catholic Jersey were called in half the night to speak to the American diplomat, they were stolen in carcasses just before the mystery Pap was dispersed to go to the phone.
About rejoicing technology (and sale by phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12 years, at the box of repairs to build a frequencies container, Bill Hewlett searched for the telephone guide and made him a call.
Shortly after his 20-minute telephone conversation, Jobs obtained a part-time summer job in Hewlett-Packard.
"It was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company that had seen that age and formed my view of what it was a company and what they treated with their employees."
Jobs was then converted to one of the HP employees who visited the company's research laboratory in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first table computer never done".
It was so big as a fool, had a small catholic tube screen, and I'll love him.
I would make a trip to HP as adolescent and lose time with that machine and write programs for it.
About improvising innovation:
In several points of the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on walk.
Soon in his cart, as he was intended to sell a base plates pump, he asked him if he could mount the whole team.
Working with only 30 days of credit, I had to find out the mount and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, when I was in Apple, she recalls the struggles against which the development of a computer rat:
"I agreed to have dramatic arguments... they shouted me that five years would be needed [to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I had painted and went out and found a designer.
Twenty days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and that was completely reliable.
Over the major enterprises losing strength:
Before the Apple's renaissance, Jobs propheciously predicted how many of the industry's leaders would trope in their vision and lose their market share control.
"That you're working in IBM or Xerox, so you're doing better photos and printers, and what?"
You have the monopolie of the market quota, so the company has no success.
The sales and marketing departments increase the success, so that these are those who end up by directing companies and products are excluded from the forum for decision-making.
The genius of products leading to this monopolie position can be caused by persons who have no idea of good products vs bad products - the knowledge of the office necessary.
That's what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could have been administered from the whole computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, may have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They took the derogation of the victory.
About innovation as artistic expression:
"There is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as it evolves the great idea, changes and grows."
It is a lot learned about the subtilities of the same.
There are sacrifices you have to do - something you can't do to make the electronics, the video makes them, the robots make them, the manufactures make them.
You have to keep 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjust them all once...
Finally, it is low to try to exposure the best thing that a human team has done, and then try to adapt those things to what you are doing.
Picasso said the good artists would copy, the big artists rob.
We never had anger about robbering great ideas.
What in part did greatly to Macintosh was that people who were working in him were musical, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, which were eventually the best computer sciences in the world.
If you weren't on the computer, I could have done wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas cereals with the rivals of the health care law while the court accepts the case
The day on which the Supreme Court was gathered at the door to consider the politically controverted question of accepting the challenge to President Obama's health care law, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were assessed in a scene by the law of lawyers that would issue the case before the High Court.
The occasion was on Thursday last, when the nine judges met in a preliminary hearing to carefully study the review requests.
One of the cases in question was a request submitted by 26 states by dismissing the overall reform of health assistance adopted by the Congress last year, a law which has been a war cry for conservators throughout the country.
The judges agreed to accept the demand and, in fact, an historical allegation of 5 hours and a half of March was expected, and the result of the 2012 presidential career, which will be fully supported at the time when the Court's decision is known.
The lawyer that will be compared to the court and claims that the law should be dismissed is likely Paul Clement, whom he served as the general fiscal of the United States during the government of George W. Bush.
The signing of lawyers of Clement, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two decades of enterprises that helped to develop the annual dinner of the Federal Society, a group that has been dedicated to the defence of the conservatory legal principles.
Another sign that the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the commercial associations that defied the law, the National Federation of Independent Affairs.
Another patrocinator was the giant pharmaceutical Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the result of the fight.
The dinner was held in a Washington hotel, hours after the court's preliminary hearing on the case.
Among the assistants were, among others, Mitch McConnell, the most important Republican in the Senate and a declared opponent of the health care law.
Special guests at the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It is nothing new: The two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for years.
And it's not something in conflict with the ethical standards.
In fact, the judges are exempted from the Code of Conduct that rise the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they weren't, it could be said that they would fall under the Canon Code 4C, which says: " A judge may attend events to recruit funds of organizations related to law and others, although the judge cannot be a speaker, a guest of honour, or present in the programme of such event. "
However, the absolute nearness of Scalia and Thomas to two of the lawyers buffets in the case, as well as a company with a huge financial interest, was enough to alarm the ethics activists in the government.
"This impressive breach of ethical and indifference towards the code goes against the demands of several judges who act in the court by the same rules that are applicable to all federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause (Common Cause).
"The judges were charged in a recovery of gala funds with lawyers who have cases injured before the court."
Its appearance and assistance in the recovery of funds for this event faced any request for imparciality, and is inacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in the critics that say that they are too easy to mix the court's activities with the agenda encouraging by groups such as Federalist Society.
And Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a great conservator activista.
Moreover, conservators argued that it is the magistrate Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as a general advisor of the Obama administration when the first legal challenges were presented in the Court of First Instance.
His critics have stressed that Kagan would abstense of seeing the case, saying that I was too involved in defending the law as for now being imparcial.
Kagan hasn't given any indication that he's going to do it.
Boeing receives a recording request of $18 million
Emirates airline requests 50 double passenger flights Boeing 777, with option to 20 more.
Boeing also sell six Boeing Dreamliner flights to Oman Air, a valued operation of more than a million dollars.
Rara once is news when a company obtains a request of 50 units of its product.
But it's a great transaction when the company is the Boeing Co manufacturer and the sale price for the 50 planes is a record of $18 billion.
It is as large as the place where Boeing received the order: Middle East, a gold threat in growth of future aircraft requests.
In a study given to the Monday, Chicago company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need 2.520 planes per $450 million for the next 20 years.
Boeing announced during the weekend his most biggest request of history for commercial aircraft for $50 jets Boing 777 double passing.
The best request came from the Emirates Airport in Dubai.
The airport also has a option to buy more than 20 flights, which would increase the total sale price to 26 billion dollars, announced Boeing in the Dubai Airport Room 2011.
Then, the Monday, Boeing said that Oman Air had requested six Boeing 787-8s, the named Dreamliner, who presums a fuel shore and spectacular passenger services.
The sale price for six of them is more than a million dollars.
"This has clearly a huge positive effect for Boeing," said the analist of Morningstar Neal Dihora.
"The quality of these customers in particular is very strong."
Many Middle East airlines are ownership of their oil producers.
Therefore, they have not only the money to pay aircrafts but also a increase in the fuel prices - in general, harmful for airlines, because it is one of the largest costs - it is not so harmful, because the country is winning money with the increased oil price.
This is important because they have less likely to cancel or delay the flight commands when the fuel prices increase, said Exta.
"You have a natural protection," he said.
The request for Emirates solidates Boeing's leadership on the width flight market and helps to keep its Airbus SAS competitor's attempt to invade their domain with the A350 passenger aircraft.
Boeing's victory in the air feast is produced four months after Airbus said that it would delay the biggest debble A350, which is responsible directly with 777-300ER.
He delayed the debtor to add more impulse after the customers requested an increase in the useful and random load.
Boeing Co Action was 1.5 per cent to $67.94.
The sister of the President of Mexico, with the opinion derogated in the vote of Michoacán
Luisa Maria Calderon states that the drug traffickers helped their opponent of the PRI, Fausto Vallejo, in the container.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon seems to have lost her candidate to the Governor of Michoacán during the elections of the violent state, and she stated the Monday that drugs helped to switch the car for one of its opposers.
Previous results gave the front in the car to the Western State Governor to Fausto Vallejo, the institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of the crime organized throughout the election process and, above all yesterday, it is alarming not only for Michoacán but for the whole country," said Luis Maria Calderon in a radio interview a day after the Sunday's vote.
"Amen our candidates, our electoral workers... they supported the urns, installed barricades... and ordered the people who would vote" for PRI.
PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until he lost the Presidency in 2000.
However, it is the scene of a return, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
PRI has the hope of winning the presidential elections in July.
The Vallejo seems to have overwhelmed a little in Calderon, who had led the surveys before the elections.
Calderon, a candidate of the Conservator's National Action Party of his brother, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvan Aureoles, the left candidate by the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who is currently employed by the ruler's office, remained in third place, a great decline for the left shared and unfortunately before the presidential elections in 2012.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the preliminary results.
Vallejo, exalted from the capital of the State of Morelia, refused to link drugs and urged other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has been dominated for a long time by specialized drug cards in marihuana, heroin and metanfetamines.
It is the birth state of President Calderon, and he elected Michoacán to launch an offensive military offensive infringement against traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence has continued.
A PAN alcalde was killed a week before the elections were held by Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates left local candidates for fear.
Although for the PRI, for disappointable electorals of Michoacán, a victory will help to stimulate the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential elections, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, welcomed Vallejo and said, "I think that this victory should be very encouraging, in the face of the next year."
The BAsD encourages Asia to help save the euro zone
The Asian Development Bank (BAsD) has called for India and China to be prepared to help save the eurozone of its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would prevent Asian economy growth.
Rajat Nag, Director-General of Asian Development Bank in Manila, said that the two larger growth economys in the world had to "make all possible" to accelerate the recovery of the economic block already was through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against the BRIC [Brasil, Russia, India and China] countries that observe the difficulties of Europe in a "imperative" way and said that Asia's financial assistance together with European leadership and resources would help avoid a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all together in this."
"That anyone who can help Europe to get out of the crisis is useful," said the Financial Times in an interview in the framework of the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"This can be protected in a certain measure, but it can't be immunate."
"So if China and India can help, it's all the means."
The European Monetary Union has been severely shocked by a sovereign debt crisis in the last months.
In the last days, Italian debt costs have been shocked dangerously and the first ministers of Italy and Greece have diminished.
The current crisis of sovereign debt in Europe has increased the fears that the world economy could move to recession and have generated calls for the main emergency economy to help the euro zone to find a solution.
Mr. Nag predicted that any Asian support would be changing through the IMF, but he said that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of the EU rescue fund, the European Financial Stabilities Fund would offer a greater negotiation power for Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Indian Commercio Minister, said that "India will do everything possible" to help the euro zone as its own economy was now suffering the fall of exports and the extent of foreign capital entries.
"Nobody wants the euro zone to remain instable and turbulent," said.
"We have monumental challenges and we need to keep a high level of growth."
"It's not a choice, it's a imperative, because where we find job for decades of our young men and women."
Others argue that development economys like India are not responsible for helping rich Europeans when they face their own and deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, Professor of Brown University in the U.S., said that it would be very difficult to sell Europe's aid for the thousands of thousands of people in India, from which up to 800 million live with about $2 per day or at least.
"In some moment, the Greeks will be able to join at the age of 50 and go from vacation to the beaches, and that will not go well," said.
Lee Howell, director of the World Economic Forum, also asked why India's reservations should be used to maintain the numerous and well-employed workers of the Greek public sector, in jobs of unadministred enterprises, and loss generators such as rail.
Mr Nag said that the eurozone crisis was threatened with “important chain effects” throughout Asia.
The Asian Development Bank prognosis of 7.5 per cent of economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 is now faced with the "low risks" due to the threat of Europe.
He said that the vulnerable emergency markets needed to make "continence plans" to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outputs of their economy.
Series of the Pentagon about the possible defence remedies
The Defence Secretariat, Leon Panetta, calendared the Congress on Monday, warning that the automatic budget recovery that can be able to shoot national security and cause financial reactions in chain from the Pentagon passes to the Afghanian fight camps to civil mount chains.
The Pentagon is already saying the $450 million of reductions over the next decade, but now it is an additional reduction of 600 million or more in cash that may be imminent if the Congress does not reach an agreement on expenditure.
"The impact of these currencies would be devastator for the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senator John McCain, the Republic of Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, a Republican of Carolina del South.
He said that the failure of the Congress to reach a budget agreement and its consequent impact, the called “secure”, would take place to 23 percent of global reductions and a high higher to many new projects.
"A so large currency, applied in this uncriminated way, would make the majority of our naval and construction projects cannot be implemented - it is not possible to buy three four parts of a ship or a building - and seriously harm other modernization efforts," wrote Panetta to the senators.
"We would also be able to separate many of our civilian officials involuntaryly and because the reduction would be imposed so fast, it is almost certain that we should have to license civilians in order to comply with the goal."
"This changes would break the faith with those who keep our army and seriously damage the good arrangement."
The coarts with time would reach the fight troops, said Panetta.
"By though the financing for war time in the supermarine Contingent Operations accounts does not appear directly affected by the sequence, war efforts would be negatively affected by serious disorders in the basic budgets", warned Panetta.
"A staff contract would be reduced, which would lead to delays in contracts and the supervision of the contract that supports the war."
"A staff would be reduced, giving place to delay in the payment of suppliers in war time, and legal and political support would be interrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, requesting information on the possible impact of the automatic recovery in the Department of Defence.
"The consequence of a secular in the Defence Department would cause a rapid decline from the United States as the main military power of the world."
"We are firmly against this dracone action," the senators said in a communication together on Monday's evening when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is not a result with which you can live, and it is certainly not one we should put us itself."
"The sequence is a threat to the interests of the United States' national security, and it should not be allowed to happen."
If the Panetta letter and the recent warnings of the senators will increase the pressure for a budgetary compromise or intensify the calls to exhibit the Pentategon of the Corporates are to see.
Panetta has been more frankly about the possible currency, despite a work at the top of the Pentategon with years of experience in budgetary budgets in the Congress and the White House and knowing that it was difficult to address difficult decisions.
In a press conference last week, the Defense Secretariat painted a sweet panorama of what could be before - a army with a chat, but not a nucleus.
"It's a ship without marine."
It's a children's book, right?
"It's a aircraft without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, a army of quarters, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers trained to comply with the mission," said Panetta in his words opening in the Pentategon.
"It is a force that suffers the low moral, the deficit preparation and is not able to keep on the day with the adversary potentials."
"In fact, invites the aggression..."
In addition to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta reports new details about the "generate important operational risks: duration in response to crises, conflicts and disasters; we are seriously limited to our ability to be deployed and compromised in all the world; and is an unacceptable risk in future fight operations."
And Panetta said that some of the largest defence projects could face the hacha, including those already tried and some only in the first stages of planning.
This list includes the F35 Joint Stike Fighter ship, a new planned bomb, a new generation balistic submarine, the new litoral fight ship and the new struggle vehicle that the Army and the Marina need to replace, the Washington.
Stopping the development and additional tests of F35 could generate some $80 million over the years of age, but their parties say that it is the next vital step to improve and address potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A view to the most recent titlers shows how serious and all of us are the lie and lie in daily life.
The Republican president Herman Cain is occupied by interchanging accusions of sexual abuses with several women; each party accused of lie to the other.
The Administrators of the State University of Pennsylvania have been assaulted by assaulting reports that were said that a retired fatbol trainer was sexually aggressively aggressive to children.
Last week, the French President, Nicolás Sarkozy, was "played" with a microphone open by claiming the President of the United States, Barack Obama, that the first Israeli minister Benjamín Netanyahu is a liar.
Mentir has destroyed carriages and convulsionate countries.
The Congressist of New York and the exhibitionist at the Internet, Anthony Weiner, made the struggle with his slowly dismissed dismissed by the irrefutable test.
The former Chairman John Edwards has been accused of infringements in the financing of the campaign related to the coverage of an extra-military relationship.
And again, no one who lives in it will never forget the meditatic circle disappointed by President Bill Clinton when he lies during his second mandate about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends on tramps are very extensive in school reviews and university.
There were cases in which teachers gave the responses to students to be better viewed in their performance assessments.
Mentors who should be teaching the contrary are sending the message that lie and lie are acceptable.
How long do we find us?
In any day, studies show that they can lie you anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
That's sure, many of those lies are pious lies.
Another study showed that unknown men were three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting.
Detection of lies, or "the location of lies", is an essential ability that we must buy all, for both personal and professional reasons.
Instead of being a similar table game, for example, Charada, where the goal is to explain: "I have" is the detection of the library, a series of knowledge based on scientific data obtained during the past six decades in prestigious universities that have conducted research projects in deepness, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that old mitos about lie have been disrupted.
The liars look at the eyes.
Not always tartamudeans, balbuceans, if they rub or worry.
It can not be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or detect.
A trained lie detector can get to the truth learning about the statement structure, micro-facial expressions, questioning training and time.
I've been several years investigating the scientific discovery of the lie in the wide and always emergent body of knowledge, and I was clear that the detection of the lie is a modern technique that is easy to learn and help navigate through our complex world - especially if their professional responsibilities include contracts, interviews, or negotiations management.
Good liars have the ability to read the others well, make them feel pleasant, handling their own feelings and feeling intuitively how they understand others.
We know about the investigations that extraverted mention more than the introverted men, that men say more "mentioned lies to themselves," while women say more lies "oriented to the others" -- normally to protect the feelings of someone -- that marriages are less often less often than those who are not married (but the lies that are often saying to be "reasoned").
We also know that if you are understood as a malicious, others will feel less guilty to lie.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, observe the ordinary conduct of the subject.
This is called "Creation of a basic line".
Help provide reference points to measure after changes.
Observe the posture of the subject, rise and vocal characteristic.
It's better to know if someone normally shoots with the foot all the time to not make injust accusions when you see the feet shooting in half of the meeting.
Next, search for false, verbal and non-verbal behavior groups.
Consider these groups of behavior as alarm signals, not as a lie test.
Those who lie can frozen the top of the body when trying to remember their history, can shoot their feet to the door, switch up to an outdoor, change their postura significantly, or show a "post-interview disappoint" - that exaged suspicion of relief and post-change when all difficult questions have been completed.
In many cases, the questionnaires are failing to see that the interview has been finished only to find that post-interview relief.
It also takes attention to the vocabulary of the subject.
Scott Peterson put the ball to the background and used the past time while he said that his murdered wife was alive, launching a search for her at national level.
People who lie can also use a distance language: "I have no sexual relations with that woman, Mrs. Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question fully.
The most common verbal indicators are sutty.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when he answers a difficult question: "Good... to tell truth... until I... I understand."
This makes the response a perception instead of a fact and is often a warning signal.
There is no magic form to detect lies, but develop ability to discover the lie is possible.
These skills will improve the possibilities of any person to avoid being victimed by staff artists in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial oil plan deleted after the threat of the delay of the United States in its approval
Days after the Administration of Obama was threatened by delaying the adoption of an oil oil planned from Canada to the Golf of Mexico -- inflicting the syndicates, while he disappointed ecologists -- the company that seeks to build oil is ready to redirect the project to return to it.
TransCanada said Monday for the night he will move the oil planned outside the environmentally sensitive area of Sandhills in Nebraska, and trusted that the project will win the approval.
The company announced the decision at the Press Conference at the Headquarter of Nebraska.
TransCanada's director Alex Parabax says that the company maintains its confidence in the time that oil oil is approved, although it is true that with a different route.
This is the last week after the announcement by the State Department to delay the decision by a federal permission for the project until new potential routes are studied to prevent the Sandhills of Nebraska and the Ogallala Water, a wide subterranean water supply.
"This is a real progress route," said the representative Lee Terry, the Republic of Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the Department is possible to separate any decision until 2013, after the elections of the next year, although officials refused that the policy was undertaken in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the request of the Department of State, and expressed all its support.
Olive oil, from 1,700 miles from Canada to the Golf of Mexico.
It would take 700,000 barriles a day from the province of Alberta to the restaurants in Texas.
For that reason, it would be necessary to cross six states.
It is hate by ecologists, but loved by the working groups, which have assigned 20,000 jobs linked to oil.
But the lawyers of Nebraska opposed to the plan are suspicioning legislation to force a disappearance from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala Water, the largest source of potable water and irrigation.
The current environmental impact study of the Department of State found that the project only posed limited environmental impacts, but the source of the energy industry said that the Department's General Inspector ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is if the member of the TransCanada Lobby, Paul Elliot, who was a campaign advisor of Hillary Clinton in 2008, represents a conflict of interest in the programme.
The other is if a sign which was contracted to direct the original study was an inadequate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
The LaBelle Patts requested for promptly caused a child of fear
A family in New York states that it was a disappearing of the music, Patti LaBelle, being a shock in the shooting of the Manhattan building, shooting his little daughter up to the point that she was scared of fear.
The diatribe of "Lady Marmalade" assaulted Genevieve Monk of 18 months old, while suffering "First Cames, Sound Disorders" and "augmented his fear to the strangers", says his family in Manhattan's Supreme Court.
It was on November 10, last year when the tramoyist Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, professor of childhood garden, and Genevieve was preparing to go to a family trip.
While Kevin Monk took the car, Roseanna Monk shooted the castle of the Riverside Boulevard building with his team, bringing to Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said he was close to the door and put his daughter on the ground for a moment.
"Another closed behind and said to me, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said to her, "Yes, and I went to cut it," he said.
LaBelle showed angry to the pregnant woman.
"He said in a aggressive ton, "I shouldn't have left her daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I said, "I don't have any interest in what you say or think."
He smokeed and started using bad words - the word C and the word J in high voice...
I had a water bottle and began to get the water of the bottle over me."
He said Genevieve was historical.
"I told him to this woman, "See what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the girl.
LaBelle turned up on the mother -- which was still subject to Genevieve -- and he had to be contained by its environment and retired to a car that he expected her, said Roseanna Monk.
The little was smiling so strong that he smiled, agreed.
Later, the family sent a note requesting an apology from LaBelle, but I didn't get the answer.
The lawyer and representatives of LaBelle did not return the calls to comment that happened.
The request is looking for unspecified damage, but the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis, said that he took the case freely and that the family plans to give all the money that brings to a support association to children with cancer.
"The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct," said Davids.
"This type of conduct is completely unacceptable, especially when it leads to a childhood teacher that brings into arms to a child of 18 months of age."
Climate adversity slowed the economy
During the first year of the management of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa, increased the unemployment and informality, declined foreign investment and the economy
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, which is the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, self-designed by the change, which generated great expectations for economic progress, but given the climate adversity of starting year, it is not observed that growth is not observed, in turn a deterioration in the main economic development indicators.
The low temperatures of February, in addition to cause thousands of losses for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state economy to grow, caused a contrary to the economic activity in general of 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, which was mostly justified by the historical fall of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the ice effect report issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, 582 billion 835 hectares were damaged, from which 78.03 per cent suffered totally and the remaining 21.07 per cent had been partly damaged, the main circumstified cultures were the fruits, maizes and garbans.
The fall in economic activity has generated, until November, a constant increase in the unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geographic, the rate of unemployment during the first three quarters of the year was observed, while from January to March to March 55,053 syndicates were discovered, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the economically active population, for the second quarter the rate was 5.28 per cent, and between July and September continued to increased up to 6.19 per cent, with a rate of increased number of people to more than 74 thousands of unemployment, with a higher rate of 18.000 per cent.
Liver liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for the Economist Gerardo López Cervantes, Director of the UAS Economic and Social Science Faculty, the growth in unemployment can be explicit indirectly, due to the actions carried out from the public policy.
"What is seen is a growth in the unemployment that has to be seen with several factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market for the effect of a restriction of resources by legislation adopted at the Congress to fight money lavage, for people who acquire dollars illicitly is not easy to work them, invest them and use them in something," said.
Migration detained
López Cervantes noted that there is also a democratic factor in the unemployment increase.
"The number of people who go from the state of work in the foreign country has been limited, first by the difficulties to enter, and secondly because they have already had many difficulties to find work, this person remains and is asking work sources here in the state, which makes the unemployment comes", said.
Informality
The analysis of the Sinal Labour Market is encouraging to consider the high level of informality that is predominantly among the working conditions, according to NNGI, 60.38 per cent of the people employed in the state of work without being a worker at any institution of social security.
In addition to unemployment and informality, another of the workers of the state is low, the entity has the lower payment of the country, in accordance with the registers of the Institute of Social Affairs and the Secretariat of Work and Social Prevision.
The average month income of Sinaloensian workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 weights, very below the national average, which was 70,000 375 weights.
IED contract
Following the fall of economic activity and unemployment growth in 2011, the higher reduction of the Direct Foreign Investment in the past 10 years was recorded, according to the Economic Secretariat of January to June of the State IED $630,697, which represents a fall of 87,74 per cent of the $5,143,312 registered during the same period of the previous year.
The Government ' s Economic Development Secretariat accounts for a total investment of 17 billion 280 million weight in the year, which is mainly from the Territories of the Territory Sector.
The debt
Before the economic contraction scenario, the Government of the State requested in July the adoption of a credit for 3 million weight, which would be intended for investment in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the adoption of the local congress was a amount of 2 billion weight, and until November did not observe the benefits of debt in any State economy sector.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, the first year of Mario López Valdés shows a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Transformation Industry Chamber, expressed that during 2011 the harmonisation of wills of the various sectors, including the Government of the State.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa has been really very poor in this year, there is a need to work intensely to recover the land that we have lost in this year, in 2012 we have to reverse efforts, talked about the efforts of all and above all the good moves already synchronized by this new government team, we hope that the next year is much better", said.
Economic Length
Loredo López showed that events like the helmets of the year's principles defeated the state economy and restricted their performance and growth.
"The lower economic flow is the product of several events, including the heats, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that has not returned enoughly to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable flow level in processes, products and services, and therefore, at the end of the year we are closed very below the expectations we had", said.
Redefine vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the President of the President of the Republic of Mexico Confederation in Sinaloa, expressed that the state was required to be incarcerated towards higher productive activities of dynamism.
"In general we have noted that it has been worked, we believe that a long-term programme should be developed in which the vocation and economic rule of the state is refined, because it is important that all the potentials of the material and human resources with Sinaloa are depicted", said.
Work to do
The Chairman of Coparmex highlighted the importance of establishing a future vision that improves the efforts of the Government.
"In general, I would say that the Government has been striving to give good results in different matters, in the field of economic development there are some progress, but it is important that a long-term programme be developed."
He pointed out that the current administration has made progress in its way to conduct public policy.
" There are elements that allow to say that the Government is more comprehensive, I can say that there is work done and I think that the Government is aware of the work to do," said.
They condemn it for 8 kg of mariguana
Five years of prison and 100 days of silver was sentenced to a neighbor of Navolate for the possession of eight pounds of marijuana.
The General Prosecutor of the Republic informed that the convicted drug complainant was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, by the crime against health, in its variety of marijuana possession for trade.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican Army on 7 June 2010 in a supervisory operation on the Cyprian Street Valdez, against post 80, in the pool of El Castillo, Navolato.
The Narcomenduist circled on a type of pick up truck, white color, where he carried a black ball on the vehicle box and at the seat of the copilote a small mochile, where the military were found eight kilograms of marihuana.
For these reasons, it was assured to the Court of Second Districts and the sentence continued in the Executive Centre of Criminal Consequences.
Contributions should be paid to works
The works of social nature mentioned in programs such as Habbitat, Public Space Retail and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or seriously delayed because of the lack of economic resources, Miguel Angel López Miranda reported.
The Social Development Director pointed out that even now the work programmes have progressed, they are at risk when they have not fulfilled the Government of State with contributions to which they are subject to a resource exceeding 11 million weight in the three programmes.
He pointed out that in total investment in these three programmes, almost 50 million weights were in which the State corresponds to 25 per cent and that only the Federation and the Municipal has provided resources to work, so that the possible delay in the conclusion of this programme is coming.
"It's almost 12 million that touchs them and although the year is finished has not given us nor a fifth, when they had to give us a part since July," he said, "we have started the works and they are very advanced, but we need the money."
He mentioned that the last year, in the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State did not meet the contributions that were corresponding to them, so the Municipio had to request a credit to cover the 7 million but not brought the State administration at that time.
"And passed us in the previous sex because the State did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programmes continued to walk, and this year we had to access these programmes we had to get resources to cover what was left by the State," detailed.
Despite the engagement of the State authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, it pointed out that the request was made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to ensure the management to ensure that the percentages corresponding to them were reached as soon as possible.
"I'm almost 12 million that touchs to bring them, and although the year is over, they haven't given us nor a fifth."
Valid "Analogical Apollo" in Mexico in 2015
The substitution of digital analytical signals is one of the most important changes that have suffered the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the United Nations (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional controversies that interrupted the Senate and the Chamber of Members against the Presidency decree, which continued to be called "analogically" from 2021 to 2015, when not meeting the eight votes required to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderon was not exceededed in its assignments by issueing the decree that details the actions to follow to the transition to the digital digital television.
Consequently, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic was dismissed by not reaching the qualified majority of eight votes so that the Court should be expressed on the constitutionality or inconstitution of the decree, and it remains the future.
The draft sentence, drawn by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed to declare inconstitutional decree because the regulation of radio and television material is a power reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of Jeracic subordination and law reservation.
On behalf of the project, only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero.
With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Members promoted two constitutional controversies to imply the decree, and by accepting the claims, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all action available in it for the digital transition.
The full of Ministers also resolved the request made by the Chamber of Members, without entering the project discussion, as well as by Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In its intervention, the President said not to agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general standards the measures to prepare the public administration.
"I also believe that if it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and noted that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector correspond to the federal executive, which has by constitutional mandate, the State's rectification.
The substitution of digital analytical signals is one of the most important changes that have suffered the world in recent years, and is translated into a better use of the radio spectrum, a better quality of the signal and more channels.
Approximately, change would post the benefits of digitalization, which involves a decision of public interest, which is not only a technical dimension, "as it covers economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues stressed, "exige the operation of the entire system, in accordance with the principle of economic correction of the State, of a group of assignments which the Constitution leads to the power of the State Executive".
He recalled that a large number of countries throughout the world have already concluded digital transition, and it has done it through the Executive, although they were counting with high-specificized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, when issued the imputed decree, which is somewhat invaded in the field of competence of the Congress, is provided in the administrative area, the observance of the laws issued by the legislative.
Analyze the possibility of a "vote vote" account in Michoacán
According to the data raised by the PREP, the difference between the first and the second place of the ruler election is only 27 per cent, yet, without accounting of the votes related to 879 of 6 000 74 total acts.
The possibility of the " vote by vote" account is a reality regarding the election process this year in Michoacán, where, in accordance with the data raised by the Preliminary Electoral Results Programme (PREP) the difference between the first and the second place of the ruler election is only 27 percent, yet without accounting of the votes corresponding to 879 of 6 000 74 total acts.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Michoacán Electoral Institute (IEM), Mary of the Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that only a few days ago, on 9 November, the election body adopted a series of lines to harmonize local standards with the federal election reform.
As noted, Michoacán did not authorize its Political Constitution or its Electoral Code of State or its Electoral Justice, since the Congress of the State adopted the reforms shortly before the conclusion of the legal period to enable them to enter into force in the present election process and the Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel prohibited its publication in the periods laid down in the Official Period Act, with the argument that some objections had.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the United Nations (SCJN) resolved the Constitutional controversy promoted by the local legislative power and qualified as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the State mandate to constitutional reforms, although he had no right to "sancel them or to use them".
Interviewed about the possibility of the "stem vote", Mary of the Landeral Angels expressed that thanks to the approval of the relevant lines by the General Council of the IEM will be possible to carry out partial and total votes by the local election body.
In this way, the partial census of votes, of one or more election packages, may be given in the case of the fact that: the results of the acts are not matched; there is no scrutiny act and compromise in the sender of the box or not open in the power of the President of the same; or, if there are clear errors or modifications of the acts.
Furthermore, the total census of the vote received in all cases of the election may be performed when there is indication that the difference between the presumed candidate of the election to be treated and who has obtained the second place in the vote is equal to a percentage point; it is always or when the meeting is opened, the express request of the representative of the party and/or coalition requested by the second candidate.
The total census of the vote may also be carried out if, when the regular commitment is completed, the difference between the candidate presumably winned and the second place is equal or less than a percentual point, when and when the express request from the representative of the political party whose candidate was left in the second place, where the electoral packages that have been subject to partial census will be excluded.
It should be noted that in this situation, Morelia's election is found, where, according to the PREP, the difference between the first and the second place is only 0.16 per cent, although not accounting for the votes of 129 of the 923 total acts.

Wednesday, the new Italian government will be formed
The named Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will be meeting tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put to that country on the border of the economic disaster.
The named Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet the Sunday with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has been put to Italy on the border of the economic disaster and has put it in danger throughout the euro area.
A communication from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will be gathered with the President, Jorgio Napolitano, to confirm that it could form a government.
A office is expected to be presented by a majority by technocrats, although it is not clear when the task will be assigned to the new executive.
Monti said he would present the President the result of his discussions with political parties in his intention to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the capacity of our country to overcome this difficult stage," said the former European Commissioner to journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that it could form a government but the ton of his comments indicated that obstacles have been exceeded.
The "mark is now well delineed", added.
Monte has completed the process to form a government at least three days, while Italy fights a political and financial crisis that has stimulated its debt costs at unstable levels.
The new administration directed by the former European Commissioner Monti must adopt a hard pack of austerity required by European leaders to restore the shocked confidence in Italy.
The instability of the markets instaured the performance of the Italian BTP 10 years older than 7 percent, the level in which Greece and Ireland were forced to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian leader Confindustria, said to the press after meeting Monti: "We said we would support this government very much."
We believe that this government is the last opportunity that Italy will be out of this emergency situation.
Monte's success opportunities were significantly stimulated by the support of the Silvio Berlusconi PDL Party, whom the crisis forced to dimit the Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are intended to have a good result," said the press Angelino Alfano, secretariat of the Central Party.
The support of the PDL, the biggest party in Italy, is significant because, even now, many of its members had opposed the Government of a technological majority that is formed by Monti.
Parliamentary Support
The new Government of Monti must have strong Parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpleasant reforms of austerity.
Any block or delay in their efforts could cause a new and devastating attack on the financial market.
The Italian organization of foreign banks was joined to the pressure by warning that the failure of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began Monti's consultations with political, synagogue and business groups, as well as youth and women's organizations.
He will end your meeting tour on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed Sunday by Napolitan, which has enabled extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a short breath at the end of the last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi was dimitting, the costs of Italian debt have now returned to critical levels between the uncertainty about whether the new minister will be successful.
Saving Italy with a public debt of 1.8 billion euros would be too much for the current financial defence of the euro zone.
Monti said that his government should take the next elections, expected for 2013, despite generalized predictions on the only time for political reforms before the elections.
Monti said he would like to include political offices, but the major parties insist that it should be formed only by technicals, a indication of their repairs to a process required by financial pressure.
Political sources pointed out that mutual disregards and disagreements in the part of the parties are complicating the intention of include political figures.
The rock of the Spanish is higher than the twins
Of the 22 smokers called Spain, ten rebasses the 50 international games.
From Costa Rica only one of the 22 guests came to the 50 meetings.
A major contrast to Costa Rica, compared to the 22 calls by both countries for the friendship of today, at 3:05 p.m. in the National Stadium of San José.
While World and Europe's camps, one of the monthly FIFA's burns, contain a wide record of class A intersecting games, Tricolor has only the defender Michael Umaña as the only one that has the 50 international games.
This figure reached the past Wednesday at the Panamá Game (0-2), in the Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish footballists playing in the League of the Stars and in powerful clubs of the Premier Liga of England, hold an intense activity in the liga and home copy camps, and high-level chocolates in European cocks like Champions League.
The experience with the Spanish Furia is summarized in complicated eliminators from the Eurocopa and the World of Futball.
In contrast, Titican smokers have a limited international face in a area such as Concacaf, which is considered the lower level within the FIFA.
We see that the maximum record of the Spanish Selection is the Archer Íker Casinos, whose previous Saturday before England (Case 0-1 in London) was equal to the registry of the exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today before the Tricolor and put a new record for Spain of 127 internationalities.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona's brain flight, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi, including, were recognised the previous week by the EUFA together with the other hundreds of the Iberic team, the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the Schalke arriete, Raúl González, with 102.
Nearly about the hundred-year number is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
They follow the Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fabregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
From the Ticket side, and near Michael Humanña, they are the left side of Junior Díaz, with 48 presences and the artist Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five were over 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazola (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller appears with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The remaining is not about 20 hours.
While Nao Moreal has only four games and Jord Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolivar only has one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson are not debugging.
The historic Golelator of Spain is David Villa, with 50 dinas, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
By Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the registering more than nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Fifty-five included the country in his round of two decades of trayectory
"Go to Costa Rica is a real dream."
In an exclusive interview with Viva, the Bayist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said that the band is listed to offer one of its best conciers on Sunday in the National Stadium.
They have been more than 20 years waiting, but the band ensures that for them also will make the dream to touch in the country.
Thus the founder and founder Jeff Ament, who talked exclusively with Viva, Brazil, was the last week.
The grouping is situated in the South American area of its work tour of two decades, and Sunday 20 will make its only scale in Central America.
That day will be presented at the National Stadium, from 7:30 p.m, together with the angels The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is a extract of the conversation, whose complete translation is in The Nation on the Internet.
For its costarical followers, is a real dream that Pearl Jam goes to touch in Costa Rica, are you aware of what they are living in their fans?
Go to Costa Rica is a real dream for us too.
This is only our second time in South and Central America and until now it has been great.
I've been in Costa Rica only once and a vacation; it's a so beautiful country and I think we're going to be able to stay there a few days.
So it's funny to bring our music there.
I ask it because there is a kind of devotion to the band, the fans live intensely in the previous days.
What do you say to your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying on our side over all these years.
He took us almost 21 years to Costa Rica; thanks for waiting so much and we regret that we had taken so much time to reach it.
Some even refer to their conciert as the biggest show of the year.
Does this add some pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows that we have touched over the last 21 years have occurred during the last couple of weeks.
We touched a couple of gigantic shows in Sao Paulo and hoped that this has set us in the form for this conciert in Costa Rica.
Indeed, we're very grateful to touch there.
We love that country, we love overfire and joining; for both things, Costa Rica is among the best ones of the world.
How did they discover Costa Rica and their oils to overfire?
We have a lot of friends that are superfects and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the holes there are amazing.
My friends were always going to overcome Costa Rica and Nicaragua, together with Mexico, are great places to overcome; so it was how we knew, through people who love the surf.
When you see the round, they've been delivering huge shows with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never touched there before, then we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We'll try to give the best show possible with a good variety of songs; we'll try to touch a couple of songs of each album and give them to our fans a good and different repertorio.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What about this?
I think it's partly because we have nine disks and we can touch more than 120 songs and each one likes different songs, so it's hard to choose what songs to play each night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we rats not to touch, it keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because he remembers the reasons why we liked these songs and that we could forget us.
That makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think that it is also more interesting for people.
With this tour, they celebrate 20 years of trayectory.
When you look back, is it difficult to believe everything they have done?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I think no one of us is imagined that we're in a large rock band and have done it for more than 20 years that it looks like a dream.
We continue to account of our blessings and it is very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all want and like to create music.
We're lucky to go to the places of the world to whom we always want to go.
The things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean for you that it was the fundamental part of the ganging appearance?
It has always been a honor to be part of that group of big groups.
We are very friends of the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's surprising when a move emerges from a group of friends and it's something uncommon.
Sometimes when a band of a city is coming, but it is much more strange when five or ten bands go at the same time of a city.
We're proud and honored to be part of Seattle's group.
We still touched some of them once.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden in his tour, so we are happy to be friends of all them still and to be part of that sound of Seattle.
It is also very strange that a band as you keep together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which is, alone, much more time than many bands.
First, I think that we are all lucky to be still with life and, secondly, all of us are concerned about others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to this, also have opened musical adventures that give you free to each one to experience.
We trust each other with the music of each one and couldn't be better.
The relationship of you with the famous word has not been simple; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do what they want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier to find a balance.
We assure that you're not too round because it's easy to fall in that game of the great multitudes and people who love your music.
While one remembers that people are there through music, it remembers that you have to respect the music and what I brought it, without being famous and being a rock star, something which really interests anyone of us.
How do you remember your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we're writing very good songs and at the beginning was something great.
We were a band for almost three years and we never published a disk until they died Andy (Andrew Woods).
There were many frustrations because it was so long and the most important thing is that we are still very friends of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a thinking photo in the amazing person that Andy was and how I had to ry, it was always a joy to go to work, whisper us, talking about music and futbol and much more.
It was a surprising human being and we surprised it.
The national band Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Are you sure you know your work, especially Eddie Vedder, and why did you choose it for opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several proposals, and that was the band that most liked us, so we are grateful to see what La Robertas can offer in life and must be very comforted.
Why do you always change Yellow Ledbetter's letter in life?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He's sing her and I think he's doing it with the first thing that happens to him.
Like bajist, what are their influences?
It's too many.
In the first ones that happen to me are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
They're so much that I could talk all night about the bathists I like.
How has Pearl Jam been able to maintain the relevant grung, despite being no longer a mode?
I think we all always feel a little unconnected from the grunge word.
When I think of it, I remember the bands I mentioned before, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana, and all those who arrived at the same time, and, if there's a relevance now, I think it's something wonderful because it's a music that worth listening and bands like Mudhoney are doing now better music than ever.
At first, his music had a darkest content and now has become more positive.
What should this change be done?
It's interesting because I think there are a couple of songs in the new album that may seem more liviane, but there are also songs, such as The End or Just Breathe who qualify as very dark songs, although they can sound a little bit positive.
With both, when Ed touched them, I cry when I heard them and they are deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow and there's some trauma in your life and you're losing a family or a friend, these things start to influence your art, your music, and those two songs, without doubt, represent that for me.
Also, I think it can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is re-interrupted for medical examinations
The former President Alberto Fujimori was entered on Tuesday in a public hospital to be evaluated by the loss of muscular force presented in the feet, informed his head doctor.
Fujimori, 72 years of age, who complies with a 25-year prison for violations of human rights committed during its Government (1990-2000), suffers a number of pains, including cancer in the language for which it has been operated four times and maintained under control.
The Congressist Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, said to the TV N Canal that Fujimori will be evaluated during three decades in the National Institute of Neoplastic Nurse to determine the cause of pain and the loss of strength of his lower members.
Aguinaga noted that, in his view, Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of the indulgence for humanitarian reasons, however, he said he did not want it because it was unfair.
It was operated four times to cancer to the language, has a weight loss of 18 kilograms to which other pathologies have been reached, such as severe erosive ghostite, the chaste of the pncreas, the renal calculations, the arterial hypertension and the circulation problems in the feet, inhibited the doctor.
Fujimori is completed since September 2007 in the National Police Special Operations Directorate.
In April 2009, 25 years of prison was sentenced to the death of 25 persons to hands of an army shipping officer who operated in the first years of his government.
Music travels to Mexico to strengthen political lazos
A official committee, entitled by President uruguayo, José Mujica, and integrated by several ministers and entrepreneurs, will begin this Tuesday visit to Mexico in order to extend trade between two nations and address political issues in the region.
Music will be gathered next Monday with her by Mexico, Felipe Calderon, the highest point of an extensive meeting agenda with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the collective of uruguayo residents in Mexico, according to the Uruguay Presidency agenda.
The meeting between two Presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "approximate for the exchange of information in all the political matters between the two nations", says the President of the South America country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would try to support Uruguay in the incident with France when the French mandate Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country in a list of fiscal paradise, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy encouraged to exclude the international community to those countries that remain a fiscal paradise, a declaration that caused the rejection of Uruguay and the call to consult his embassy in the European country.
Mexico has been chaired since November by the G20, the group integrated by the world's most powerful and developed countries, and has a convention with the South American country, since January of this year, to exchange tax information in order to avoid double tax.
The Uruguay Government has tried in recent years to strike up fiscal exchange agreements with a view to the "green list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OCDE), which was formed by countries that have not implemented all international fiscal cooperation standards.
In the commercial, Mexico and Uruguay have been a free trade treaty (TLC) which has increased the exchange of goods between both nations since 2004.
The large source is the three sizes of "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario struggled, incansable, over 25 years by saving Prince Peach from the ships of Bowser, but never had done it in three sizes: "Super Mario 3D Land" will fight for the love of the girl in estreoscopic technologie.
The title, which arrives this month to the shops around the world, has been designed from a principle to use the features of the Nintendo 3DS portal console, which allows to play in three sizes without need to use data.
"Mari is the person you have to tell how to work the stereoscopia without dares," said Nintendo's specialized printer in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game of Nintendo originally thought for that support", since until now successes like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were existing title adjustments.
Nintendo's portal has supported that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and fluid game.
Alvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "single" to engage the less difficult users.
Once overwhelmed, the most experts can give a "second back" to the levels of game, which this time represents more difficulty.
Furthermore, users can choose in real time between a "agressive D" or one who only affects the depth of action, but will be necessary to play in three sizes to overcome the different challenges and "not to cause optical illusions".
This super Mario incursion in the three sizes also means the turn of the character to a portable console, since it was not produced since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo guides the followers of the saga and repeats the formula of the success of the previous delivery, consuming that the source of the bigot will need to recurre mine platforms of dangers in order to release Prince Peach.
Although the player will find news in movements, environments, disorders and enemies, and also a Luigi "jogable".
Colum opens the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced this March that it was transmitted to the extradition of Exercise Alfonso Porillo to respond in the United States for the conspiration for the lavage of $70 million.
This ends the process to respond to the request of the northern country that I requested Portillo to judge it there.
In the press conference, Colom stated that his decision obeyed the independence of judicial and executive powers, taking into account that a sentence court had already ordered the extradition.
He warned that during his mandate "not put the hands" in judicial resolutions and transmitted all extraditions that he had known.
In addition to Portillo, they will be extradicted by Sergio Ruano Marocchin, for serious murder and injuries, and Edgar Morales Street and Victor Street Paredes, both by drug drugs.
This was done by Colom is an executive transmittee after the extent of all the judicial and constitutional instances to process the embassy between 2000 and 2004.
In accordance with the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Court of Constitution (CC), Porillo should be extracted once its legal situation in Guatemala and guaranteed human rights.
Portillo was absolved by Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence when he was President, who was the process before the extradition, but the Public Minister appealed and reacted the case.
Trinijove has helped 6.000 young people in risk situations
The entity was born to avoid falling in the marginality of children without training
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social support unit is important: 6.000 young people in risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation throughout this fourth century.
This is added to hundreds of jobs currently achieved for this social group.
The birthday served yesterday to balance in an act celebrated in the former Fabra i Coats complex that attended more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella barrier in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, without work, with problems of dogling or in a position to fall in marginality.
The yesterday in Sant Andreu focused on a large number of entities and institutions who have cooperated with the association in these 25 years.
The various political representation, in full-time election, showed the unilateral nature of the work carried out by Trinijove.
With the President of Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jord Pujol, the Socialist Education Adviser, Ernest Maragall, and the extensive and current ecosocialist concept Racard Gomá.
They also accompanied the current Consulter of Social Benestar i Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of the Social Work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
But he stated that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current is also it, but he added that the work done until now "is a good basis".
The President put Trinijove as an example to know how to fight against bad circumstances and to give hope to people with difficulties.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work that is performed", he expressed.
Unfortunately a busy finish where macrofests were done
The invaders had fallen 11 of the 13 floors of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupied left the end the middle of yesterday without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the neighbors of the 51th Balmes Street have arrived at the end.
Twelve people left the mid-day volunteerly the immobile that were illegally occupated, and where they organized macrofests that desired the neighbourhood, judicially and without a police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the door circle was changed to prevent the situation again.
"There will be a access control from now," the Administrator stated.
The shoes, which had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are living - were carried out all the electrical installation and part of the water, in addition to drawing the walls and leaveing residues of all kinds of drunken, especially all sides of alcoholic drinks.
The first three floors were the scenario of the multitudinary festivals, which duration up to two days and deceived the pools.
On the side of the building there is a discoteca, Balmes 51, which has also been seen injured.
His owners, Maria Pantinat explained Europe Press that since the building was occupied, the business has decreased 80%.
The owner of the disco pointed out that the invaders of the end were unfairly competence, since they sold the coffees to three euros, while the disco is 10.
In addition, the propietary of the ocio local had to respond to neighboring complaints, while, as it pointed out, molesties did not cause them to the customers of the discoteca, but the people of the busy house and, above all, assistants to the celebrations that were organized there, which had increased their frequency and intensity in the last weeks, according to the neighbouring neighbors of the area.
The responsibilities of the disco explained that the mourns were so large that even arrived to an agreement with the immovible owner and nine months ago that "I'm sorry" the rental.
The Urbana Watch also confirmed that during the last few weeks more neighbouring complaints were received.
The President of the PP municipal group in the homening, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had requested the past week "immediately deplore the immobile to end with the problems of convivency and citizens that produce neighbourhoods, as well as the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that prior to the summer there was only a plant of the busy building, but during the last months the oceans had been entering all the plants of the building and almost all the floors, and that in some cases even robs were produced.
In that sense, he added: "It is necessary to end with impunity and to be consentable to the incisive that has been generated in the end".
Also yesterday, the Mossas desaconed a building in Nou Barris.
At 15:30 p.m. the police was addressed to 35 of the Montral Street, after receiving the call of a neighbor who had observed that four people had accessed to the building.
The four were arrested at the moment.
Park or mountain?
Architects correspond to the opportunity of the convocatory beyond polyemics on honorarys
The municipal competition on 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the early 80s, in full support of the already extensive Metropolitana Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this administration printed some Collserola's promoting passes.
The floor defined the mountain as the large park of the metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with the Neoyorquin Central Park.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park returned, in the imagination of many, such as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the catalan capital of the few that are not in the north-South edge but above (montagne) - Bayjo (Mar).
The qualification of Collserola as natural park revolves in this idea.
The reference was not already Central Park but Yellowstone, with the jabalians on the role of the Yogi hill.
This was until, in September, the assembly called a mega competition composed of 16 concours for other so many access to Collserola.
A door is sent to the park idea, without doubt.
Or that or someone wants to put the doors to the field.
The question is only: Collserola, park or mountain?
The complaint, both for its seatly organized, and for what is to reflect on the city, is the theme of conversation between all the barcellone architects.
There is almost a recurrent topic to escape when two members of this old castle of elections are recognised in an acensor.
And this fact is just one of the few matches between what three barcellones architects, and university teachers, which have been presented.
Michael Roldán, Daniel Mòdol and Marta Bayona: the competition is appropriate.
To Roldán, after addressing the litoral front, it is necessary to discuss "by the front of the mountain," while the talk of Ildefons Cerdá, the green balls, has not been carried out.
"I've been out of the basis that Barcelona's most extensive park is the beach.
Among other things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex, condemns the architect for whom the title of "Collserola ports" covers a "lexic tramp": there is no need to think about them "as access to a park, but the delimitation of areas where to act".
Moodol, as Roldán and Bayona experienced in the urban world, calculates the proposal for "Intelligence Network" with "also dangerous".
Peligers resulting from the "it is today designing public space" after the experience living in the 80s and in the Forum's area "skin of the cisne".
The first fear is the delimitation of borders where it can be built.
"Limit something is to fix the next step," namely, its overpass.
"I need to think on new urban instruments, of planning, because the current [in reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)] may be able to give a real disaster."
More enthusiasmed to the question, Modol thinks that simply, the right vallesana of Collserola "you can understand as a park, Barcelona, no," for a merly topographic question.
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Collserola Patronat that "Don't fall in shooting", although thanks the opportunity that the assembly offers its gratitude to intervene in this project "for the first time".
And further, I understand that the nearness of the mountain with the city is the safe drive that allows the architects to enter the debate, but "dud" about whether this technical profile is that must lead multidisciplinary equipment ("too a skin", aponta) which have had to be created: "The architectes should be just a tool".
Bayona understood that the answer to the question that has been referred to this piece is complex, because in the concours there is no global vision of Collserola: "16 cross-border concours have been called in the sense of mountain-mare, but there is no long-term reading, which sees and understands the area in its whole."
This results at least in its case, which has chosen to participate in the 16 concours.
On the other hand, a project for one of the doors can be shocked in program and defined by the door architect on the side.
In its opinion, that is true, the board should ensure that the shipment should immediately exceed the Dalt Round should preserve, in all its extension, a areas of equipment that would carry out a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgive Jonas Larrazábal and will get free
Then from 72 days of slaughter, the legally supported by the Red Casino gave forgiveness to the brother of the camp of Monterrey of the process that was followed by chatants.
After staying 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrazábal will be freed after the legally supported by the Casino Red gave him forgiveness to the Judge Second Criminal of District, which continues to be a process by chasing against the brother of the Alcalde of Monterrey.
After the attention to Casino Royale, the owner of the Red Casino, Sergio Gil García, made a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás presumably requested the payment of an economic share in the region to allow the clandestinian operation of the house.
After the public complaint, the State Prosecutor opened a criminal process against the panist alcalde brother and on 2 September was arrested and raised for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Ministry Agency 3 to Family Delites, it was transferred to the Arraigo House 1, located in the Ancient Capital Barrier of the State capital.
In that place, he remained in the 49 days following the statement of a second incentive order after the official of the Public Minister to discover the organized cohesion and crime crimes.
On October 19, Cadereyta was presumably transferred to the Criminal of Cadereyta by chasing with a million and a half weight to the owners of the Red Casino; however, only a few hours remained in the median security recruitment since there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to follow the internal judgment in the municipal cells of San Nicolás of the Garza.
On October 25, the secretariat of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that almost two months of notices had been tested sufficient evidence to determine the culpability of Jonah, such as the cover of 1.5 million weight to the representatives of the house of recruitment to allow the operation of the same.
This Monday, the legally supported by Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gómez, acknowledged the Judge José Luis Pecina to ask for forgiveness for the brother of the country's alcalde; so in the next hour, he could restore his freedom.
During the legal diligence, the officer of the Public Minister accepted to the Judge Ramiro Arias asked Garcia Gómez whether he had been reparated the damage and who of the partners of the house of apostate was that he granted for forgiveness, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
On the basis of the employer, 197/2011, the legal forgiveness of Jonas Larrazábal is granted, and in the following case, no complaint can be submitted around the process that was followed; otherwise it will not be requested for damage or punishment.
After listening to the legally supported house, near 15:50 was ordered the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Bretton.
The secretariat of the Judge, Jorge Yánez, was transferred to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás of the Garza to inform Jonah that he has been legally forgiven, and his poster will be archived.
He will also notify the order of immediate freedom issued by the judge.
Dionisio Pérez Yacome gives details of the air accident where he lost life the Gobernation secretariat, Francisco Blake, and seven more people
The Secretariat for Communications and Transports (SCT) reported that the results of the accident in which the Gobernation secretariat, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven more people, indicate that helicopter had been directly affected on the ground in full structural integrity, without that the pilot could try to be forced.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Yacome, secretariat of Communications and Transports, mentioned that before the aircraft was released, the pilot found that climate conditions were appropriate to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the asps had contact with trees to 25 meters where the unit lost the fire."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, so that it was accounting for the requirements required to transport staff.
He also said that in the investigations carried out in the impact zone, the appearance of pieces on the ground was not reported.
"In a search are reported that there are no parts or components of the ship on the other hand, the impact was structurally presented.
"The helicopter design was for 19 passengers, with adequate requirements to transport passengers.
The terrain presents a seven degrees of inclination at 30 degrees.
At the time, the secretariat assured that it is a priority to contain the results before possible; however, research may take several months, even for a year.
By its part, Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Airports and Auxiliares Services, assured that at the time of the impact, the Helicopter of the President-President State operated in cruise speed and that this occurred in a slow-spot field.
"This information strengthens the possibility of a normal cruise operation at the time of the impact," said.
In the press conference, Pérez Yacome's holder, introduced six relevant elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the airlines, the flight was performed under visual flight rules, this means that tripulation must be visibility during the flight and the terrain.
meteorological conditions:
The AICM reports placed suitable conditions for deployment, in accordance with the advanced aircraft to the border zone between the DF and the Mexico State.
Selected routes:
It is likely that tripulation has been searching for a lower higher zone and more visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of the impact.
The impact coordinates and the last record of the radar aircraft match, probably before the impact had no control loss or change in the flight tractory.
Dispersion of the rest of the aircraft in a reduced zone:
The information available is allowed to suggest that the impact occurred in a right and side trayectory.
The aircraft dispersion pattern allows to suggest that helicopter has been influenced on the ground in structural integrity conditions.
No evidence of fire or explosion has been detected:
There are still evidence on the rest of the ship of some type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that they could have had multiple contacts with the field.
During the field works, aircraft pieces have been found to a height of 90,000 feet above the average sea level, the land presents a dependant that goes from the seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photos show the sequence in which it was predictablely discarded during the recovery.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that helicopter could have had multiple effects on the ground.
After mining in a larger area than the agreed site, around the accident, there were no dispersive parts of the aircraft, which strengthens the pressure that the impact was presented in structural integrity.
MSS advertising protocol to find obesity gene
The Social Support guides a research to discover the gene of obesity in children and youth; it is supported by IDN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Welfare (IMSS) announced that a research leads to discover the gene of obesity in children and youth, called the Genetic Protocol of Child obesity and adolescent obesity, which will enable to contain overweight markers.
In a communication, the Chief of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemical Hospital of the National Medical Center of the 21th century, Miguel Cruz López explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by experts and postgraduate students from the National Public Health Institute (INSP) and the National Political Institute (IPN) Research and Research Centre (Cinvestav) of the National Political Institute (IPN).
In the research, it is invited to participate in the population or not in the right to live, with the participating sport units of the ISS in the Mexico Valley, where the tests are carried out to minors, all Saturdays from 8:00 p.m.
He stressed that the protocol was started in the Quauhtemoc Deport Unit (Ponente State of Mexico) and that from October 8 the activity was carried out in the Nezahualkoyolt Deport Unit (Occidental Mexican Statute).
After the purpose of meeting 500 or 600 children, the study will continue in the Deportation Unit (South of the Federal Division) and finally in the Deportation Unit Morelos (on the north of the Federal Division).
He explained that the purpose of this research was to know the components and the importance of genetics in developing obesity and to identify risk factors in children and young mexicans in order to prevent the appearance of chronic degenerative diseases.
When celebrating this November the World Day of the Diabetes, he required that the goal is to meet three thousand children and youth between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about the physical and previous physics of diseases, with a view to avoiding risk factors that defeat disorders such as diabetes or renal insufficientness.
He declared that Sabbaths apply to all participants anthropometric measurements (peso, tall, cintura circumference), taking arterial pressure, determination of the levels of glucose, triglicerides, colesterol and insulin and genetics (required to identify genes associated with child obesity).
Cruz López pointed out that this investigation obeyed the concern of health professionals by alarming weight increase in minors.
" Health Surveys 1999 and 2006 indicated that in the case of children, 77 per cent in obedience, and 47 per cent of the girls, and overweight has also been observed a dramatic stage," stressed the ISS specialist.
He stated that the justification for the search of markers is supported by the people of the country to disappear from others through their genetic history.
He reported that in the meantime, Mexico has 65 percent of American Indian heritage, 30 per cent European and five per cent African, and this condition reflects the genes associated with diabetes and excessive weight.
He explained that generally, the genetic of obesity is translated in the incapacity to burn the excess of energy that we consum (calories) and that it is stored in the form of fat.
The investigator explained that the direct benefit for participants is the integral assessment of children, which allows to detect whether they represent some level of overweight or obesity.
In addition, he said, the presence of dark color rings (anantosis) in cold and prebrace, which indicates the probability that there are metabolic changes and even prediabetes.
The information is being managed in confidential way, doctors provide it in writing to parents, which are explained by each of the measurements and changes in the lifestyle to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic losses: the sedentarism, which is lack of daily physical activity, remain the majority of the day standing before the television and use transport means instead of slow distances.
It should also be the high caloric instant, i.e. the largest consumption of sugar drinks, carbohydrates (tamals, pane, pizza, hamburgergea, etc.) with high content in fat and protein and the genetic analysis in this protocol.
UNAM asfalt would prevent baches
Rafael Herrera, researcher of the UNAM Chemistry Faculty, develop asfalts modified with polymers to produce a better performance mixture, independently of environmental and temperature conditions
If the swimming signals were expected, it would not be necessary to repair about 200 thousand rain rain swimming in the Metropolitan Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher of the Chemical Faculty (FQ) of UNAM, who ensured that if the construction and maintenance process of a asphaltic floor is adequate, the baths could be reduced in quantity or even fully removed.
In its conference, a technological view of the bags, referred to in the framework of the International Chemical Year, was aware that the laboratory to its charge developed asfalts with polymers to produce a mixture with similar features of asfalt, but with a greater mechanical resistance, both higher and low temperatures.
Mrs. Nájera estimated that this type of modified asfalts could be used in places where the climate is extremely warm, such as some northern cities of the country, to improve their performance and therefore the training of bags.
He explained that the asfalt, the weightest part of the oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, one of the molecule weight called asfaltens, and other of the lower molecule weight, called maltenos, which together gives it to the floor their visual behavior.
The visional behavior of the asfalt consists of the high temperatures near to 180 degrees is conducted as a liquid, to 120 degrees centigrated its viscosity is very high and 50 degrees of centigrated is almost solid, while at very low temperatures, the asfalt becomes broken, added.
The previous means that in the streets the resistance of asfalt is not uniform, but that it is changed during the day in accordance with environmental and temperature conditions, the specialist advertised in chemical engineering.
FQ researcher noted that the streets of the city of Mexico in its majority are covered by flexible paviment, which consists of six pieces of materials, of which the last three are involved in the asfalt.
Among the most superficial edges are the asfaltic folder, composed of small stones swimming in asfalt and then compacted.
Each of the stones that represents the folder, pointed out, is bathed with asfalt.
By transiting vehicles and generating efforts, this allows the forces to spread well on the floor.
If it would be treated with modified asfalt, it would still be better wide, he thought the chemical engineer.
On the asfaltic folder, it is a latest floor called a round folder, which is made of a stone material until, i.e., a sand that is also bathing in asfalt.
As this is the shoe that will be in contact with the vehicle rings, it must have more mechanical strength than the asfaltic folder and provide friction on the path.
When it is part of the landscape that will receive and disseminate the efforts, the round folder requires also to have the appropriate edge and should be careful of the material that it is done.
The climate, especially the humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor to consider, in particular the water, because it has significantly affected the performance of the asphaltic folder.
When the land is humbled, the water is divided inside the folder and it is difficult to get out, this happens to reboot all the floors of the floor and therefore, the training of bags.
In the process of training of a bache, he said, the first in disgaining is the rounding film and only afterwards the asfalt folder is affected, but damage does not happen immediately, but it is a process that should be attained to the first signals with appropriate maintenance programs.
The member of the National Research System also explained that vehicular load is another important factor in the training of baths, and therefore the speed of each of the floors should always be in relation to the vehicle load and ensure that it is achieved, to avoid shaping bags frequently.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to investigate and working on asfalt, for example, asfaltic emulsions, which are already included in other countries in the market and enabled to repair bags with facility and without need to use high temperatures.
What did you talk to the Chairman of the Valle to be the new colleague?
Analysis of the factors that caused Melina Ramírez Serna not reached the colony of Madam Columbia.
The Valle receives his title number 14 of Princess.
The Cauca Valley remains again with the winnings of the colony of Madam Columbia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to comply with being in the podium of winners, light the plate coron and the band that believe it as a new princess of Colombia.
With the results obtained in Cartagena, where Atlantic Mrs. Atlantic came with the coron and cetro, the department already 14 titles of Princesa and Melina was the legion of vallecacan women who were near the coron but who were princess among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domingguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leia Blanque (1988), Mónica Evern (1989), María Consuel Pinedo (1990), Romano Diana Isabelo (1993), Lorena Aljudes Aljudes (Allegal 2000), Catalina (Grèceal) (Stephania 2007), Aljue).
Today, the great question that many are doing is what he said?
Because the result represents the derogation of a great favorite that showed in each presentation that she had everything to be the new colleague, it was not in vano elected the Queen of the Police and Best Rostro Jolie de Vogue, titles that were obtained reigns such as Talyana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took place in the colony of Mrs. Colombia.
The first factor that is considered to be key in the decision to take the jury to appoint her First Prince, in which he did not agree with his answer to the question "What is the book that has marked you to and why? by Martín Murillo Gómez, from the Literarian Carreterate Reading.
The questionnaire answered:
"Let much, I think enough in literature, I think it's a way to cultivate, and I definitely think that the book that marked me of childhood is "The Principal," is a very deep book.
I now read "criminal and punishment" is a universal literature book that we should all read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called "The Ardor of the Blood".
An answer that was little enjoyed first by the term "culturalize" and second to not explain specifically how each of the books that quoted it.
But when finishing the ceremony, Melina expressed his feeling calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise, what needs to happen.
And for all people, please read a little, "The principle" is a great book."
Among the launched hypothesis it says that Valle slaughtered the favoriteism.
A Bogotán journalist instructed that when being the favorite, ovasionate and the candidate that was carried out all the pre-reward premiums (Oster gastronomy network, vote of the public by the best artsal dress, and Reina Madre), "he discovered the goals of the other candidates, stressed the Queen, and therefore he did not shine in the scenario".
And that was noted in his first presentation in bathroom on the Hilton Beach and his two disfiles in the coronation velvet.
Although both were safe, it was noted that it was lacking the strength and the impetus that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic showed themselves.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the RCN Canal, found that the fact that Melina was appointed to the princess "is checked that the candidate that more prizes won during the competition is not as a king."
Furthermore, Valle was shown to the last very slightly with the press, and there was a fault.
Another chance is that Valle has not able to convince the jury about his interest in social work, which is in the last time the essence of the National Beauty Concourse.
In some way, two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty showed that they searched for a woman compromised with the social needs of their parents.
"The only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, it must be looked out of the physical and focus on its social sensitivity, which before entering the Concours are already involved in projects," explained.
It is also spectacular that Valle had sinned for his defects in the dry and fibrosis that he was noted in his abdomen, but is contradictory because the jury exactly elected it as a candidate ' natural beauty' with the most healthy body, good food and responsible physical work.
The Queen preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina had no best body, "but her fibrosis problem in the abdomen, that the truth for me was not very nottory, slowed the points in the last day."
Among the journalist Guido Hoyos, the Kromos magazine considers that the error of the vallecocacan were the surgical interventions that were practitioned.
"The surgery are good, but Valle isn't supposed to do them.
His body was never his strong, and here they were covered."
By this prize, which first delivers the National Beauty Concourse, after the bathroom defilement occurred a cruel vaccine that was fulfilled last night, as it was said that this was the content that Raymundo gave him Melina to don't give him the favor of the coron.
Reality or not, it is true that Melina has started a year of reign, not as sovereign, but as princess, position that gives him the possibility of representing Colombia in one of the international certificates for the designation of the National Concourse.
However, she will pass to the story as one of the queens that, despite his roller step by Cartagena, he was heard the coron.
So was the work of the calendar identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lofoscopist from Cali passed to the story as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4, a CTI lofoscopist passed his history as the man who confirmed the identity of the top leader of the Farcs: "Alfonso Cano", through the cocktail of his digital eggs.
From the seven lofoscopists working in the CTI section this week, Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who was 21 years old working in the judicial research area.
When he started his car, González worked in chocho municipalities, where many times he had to enter over five days in the wild to reach the site where the chambers should be identified.
In 2000, it was transferred to the capital of the Valle, and after the relevant courses, it was specialized in lofoscopia, which is the study of the friction skin, i.e. the hand palms and feet palms.
The week of the operation against other Alfonso Cano to Eliazar warned him to take minimum clothes for three days.
I was waiting for her.
On Wednesday night he went to the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two chairs and was suspected that one of them was the man who led to the oldest guerrilla in the world, so they asked him to take the decade card of Guillermo León Sáenz (her true name).
However, when the research team came to the site where the body was found, he did not recognize it for its physical aspect, because it was very different from which he had seen in the media.
It was without barba, clothed as a campsite in the area, without dark and much more sweet.
But the legs don't lie.
Composed of a galtonian forgot, tinta, transplanter and a linner, Eliazar compared the doctile prints of the card with those of the card.
His eye failed: it was "Alfonso Cano".
On the same night, Puerto Tejada was the officer of confirming the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, who was the highest chief of the Farcs.
Search for the hole
For a doctilescoptor of the Cali City, the recognition made by President Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar González, in the press route by the operation against Cana, is very significant.
Many people don't know our work.
Dactilascopia is a precise, without margin of error, which can be key in the crime resolution.
In addition to the identification of victims, the lofoscopists support investigations by crimes as slaughter and murder and confirm the identity of arrested persons.
When they are captured, many criminals present false cedars or have no papers.
We take them the custom print and search for them in the database.
The investigator told him, in a case of hurry, touched him to remove a piece of wall from a house, because in that place the ladder had supported his hand to get a strong box full of joyas and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to get a doctile impression, but in that case we could get the wheel of the whole hand and identify the criminal who had participated in different cuts," remarked.
The sheets can also discard or reaffirm suspicion in cases of murder.
Shortly before they found a dead man with licor bottles around him.
The investigation was determined that a family could be suspected from the crime and, in fact, a bottle in the bottle matched.
Although this does not guarantee that the murderer has been, it is located in the scene of the crime.
A CTI doctilescopist explained that in the objects "wheels are cut off with chemical or physical reactions".
When appearing, a transplanter or skin is used to upload them.
Then, the pressures are sent to Asif, which is the base of criminal data, or the Registration.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," stated the CTI's experts.
He stated that it was not all the way it is shown in the CSI TV program.
So not all that shrinks is gold, not all that touchs turns out.
However, if it is possible to be used, if the respective kitchen is performed.
The "indigents" challenged the authorities in New York
Centenies of demonstrators were shocked before the Zuccotti Beach to camp.
A large part of the disappearing order was observed and was transferred to a nearby park.
The integrators of the Ocupa Wall Street movement disappointed this Monday to New York's authorities when they tried to enter again, under an judicial order, to Manhattan's place where they were disappointed from march and to employ another park of the Great Manzana.
Centenies of protesters were shocked in front of the Zuccotti Beach, where they wanted to access a judicial order that allows the "innocents" to go back to the place, while another part of the movement responded to the disastrous occupation of a park more northern of the city, where there were new detentions.
"Our idea is that, if the court does not allow us to go back to the place, we're going to install in any other place and we'll continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through peaceful seats and manifestations," said one of the portals of the movement "Ocupa Wall Street", Mark Bray.
Bray described that the response of the "indigents" to the disappearing of his camp in New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts where the judge Lucy Billings issued a order that prohibited the forced evacuation of the place and allowed protesters to keep camps.
In addition, the "indigents" took place in a new park situated in the confluence of the Canal Street centres and the sixth Avenida, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, New York and New Jersey, and the property of the Trinity Church parroquia.
At least one hour were able to take the place, but then the police listened and began to stop some of the protesters, although Bray couldn't confirm the specific number, while she assured Ephes that he saw several journalists who were also elected.
The organization ensures that hundreds of persons who had been installed at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already been moved to support the integrators of the movement and has tried to mediate the police.
Thus, the Zuccotti Plaza - which is a private ownership race - continues to be closed at the expectation of the celebration of a judicial view for the same March, in which the legality of the evacuation of this march should be analyzed.
Some of the displaced protesters took and retreated at these hours copies of this judicial order, and even delivered them to the agents who stood the place, which caused "also small faces", stated Bray, who claimed that some officials proclaimed shocks to the demonstrators.
The judicial order prohibits the authorities to disappoint the members of Ocupa Wall Street or to apply "letters that were published after the starting of the occupation or to prohibit protesters to access the park again with shops or other properties that were previously used".
The Alcalde Bloomberg pointed to the press that, due to that judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and the demonstrators, who, however, warned that local laws do not allow them to be installed again with camping shopping shops and slaughter.
The register personally defended the disadvantage carried out in the Zuccotti Beach, a operation in which about 200 detentions were carried out and decided because the protesters were "bowing the law".
Bloomberg explained that the order to evacuate the place because this was converting to "in a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate laws and, in some cases, to harm others," because "also some businesses have been threatened" and neighbouring have been "for their quality of life".
"The disappearing of this morning was awesome and shows that in the Bloomberg fund it is more interested in maintaining financial interests than those of the US workers," added the movement porter, who accused the chariot of "flooring respect to freedom of expression".
The responsibilities of the "Ocupa Wall Street" also indicated that they think to organize "great action" for the juvenile in collaboration with Community and trade organizations, to remind the two months of protesting, which started on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virginia of Mary in a special television ship
With Michael Bublé and other Canadian posters, it will appear in the TV program "It's Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December.
The Canadian Pamela Anderson has been the assistant of Tim Allen in "Home Improvement", supporter in "Baywatch", connected by "Playboy", the wife of the rock music Tommy Lee and now, the actriz and model will be the Virginia Maria in a special Christmas of Canadian TV.
The CTV private television channel announced today that Anderson, together with the "crooner" (baladist) Michael Bublé and other Canadian posters, will appear in the TV program "It's Russell Peters Christmas" next December, giving life to a very special Virginia Maria.
CTV distributed today pictures of the television program where Anderson, also known by the broad distribution on the Internet of a pornographic video where he appears together with his husband, the battery of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears to be clothed as Virginia Maria, supporting a munch that represents Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian conomist of Indian origin, who recently acted as a presentator in the "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour of Charlie Sheen, appears as José.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the special CTV shipping accounts with the Canadian Canadian songer Bubllé, who was cast in Buenos Aires at the end of March with the argentian model Luisana Lopilato, and that is not strange to the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called "zora" to the US Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan Renaissance after the earthquake
The GDP grows up to 1,5% thanks to the household consumption and ends to the shock of falls that began in March
Since March last, the Japanese economy was paralyzed, yet convinced by the devastating earthquake that comes to a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that the Nipan country had suffered from the II World War.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo have encrypted material losses in $300,000, a shock that, despite the difficult world context, seemed to have been shocked.
After three consequent quarters of falls, the date of the Bruto Interior Product between July and September served to pass page, finally: the GDP increased by 1.5% in comparison with the previous quarter and 6% in annualized rates.
The registered in the second quarter – for Japanese, the fiscal year starts in March 2012 – also suggests the largest growth ritmo from January to March 2010.
The recovery is, in part, explained by the reputation of the purchase of machinery to restore the areas of seismo and after tsunami.
In fact, enterprises increased their investment in 1.1 per cent, compared to 0.9 per cent in capital expenditure that was observed from January to March, the first return after six months of interruption.
However, the real reverse of the Japanese economy is not only based on the keynesiaan impulse that invites to use the crisis to strengthen - or to rebuild - the infrastructures are used from the shortages to grow from zero.
Japan has, in particular, discovered by the evolution of household consumption, which currently represents 60% of the Japanese GDP.
This variable increased 1% of expenditure by increased expenditure in vehicles, travels and ocean activities.
The estigm of the yen
Tokio has been commanded to the internal market, when the yen - nipona currency - has become one of the "refugied values" chosen by investors who flee from the debt crisis in the euro area and the turbic predictions of the United States, a privilege that weighs as a loss in the exporting companies' accounts.
With a stronger division, products are more precious in the foreign, a serious reverage for a country whose economic flow line is determined by the health of the major technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, raised their weak results between July and September to the quote of yen.
While the markets continue with their seat to the EU Peripheral countries, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not reduce the guard.
"The risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the inundations of Thailand and the rapidly appreciation of yen", said the secretariat of the Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa last night.
And indeed, the perspectives are not angry.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) required that most Member States have presented more demanding signs of economic ralentization in September.
The indicator that anticipated inflation points in the world economy showed that the main powers are broken.
Since he slowed four decades up to 100.4 points, in front of the 100.8 August.
The euro area, including, was located under the average, which is at the level 100, slowing eight decades up to 99.13 points.
Athenas returns to feed the doubts
Papadimos says that the adjustments will be adopted, but the conservators will not sign any written commitment
With the fired peripheral risks and the re-installed incertation in the parks, Greece continues to engage in the laberinto that leads to the exit of the major debt crisis.
The sense that the "consensus" of the new Dutch transition government is more taxed by the requirements of Brussels than by a real conviction of political forces begins to be confirmed with facts.
While the new Minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there was no alternative for structural reforms and that the period of hundred days agreed in his appointment may be short to apply them, the leader of the New Democracy Party, Antonis Samaras, ensured that he would not support new astericity measures in any case and reiterate its demand for new elections for the date expected, on 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to apply the decisions of the Summit of October 26," said Papadi, when we opened a parliamentary debate, which will culminate tomorrow with a vote to the new executive.
A package with 24 programmes to stimulate employment, the reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against fiscal evasion will be the first initiative.
Nevertheless, the message of Samaras did not disagree about his post: "We have committed us to help the transitional government, but we have not forced us to do anything more."
The conservator leader was a more far-reaching pass to the EU and the FMI, the bodies that should disbloke the 8.000 million Athene with urgent need, and clearly did not give them a good view to no adjustment letter.
But the European Commission, who was still chosen by the impact of the Papandreu referendum order, has reiterate last night that his demand is strong: he will not disbloke the aid if the new Government and leaders of the Greek large parties do not sign "a written compromise without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
The Economic Affairsport, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the troika inspectors will return to Athens to discuss with the new Government "what is needed to pay the sixth tramo" of 8.000 million, although there is no final date.
The Greek wood still has shoes for rats.
Doña Sofia: "It's instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen emphasizes Spain's "representative" position on this type of funding
Spain "having reached a world-wide-related place in the role of the Microfinancing."
The Queen Doña Sofia recalled last two decades that the country has become the second donor of the approach to this intrusion of cooperation, whose "essence" stated that it was a "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for the whole humanity, based on confidence in human being".
The Queen inaugured yesterday the V World Microrate Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that "no doubt" is that it is a type of operations " absolutely essential" to achieve the United Nations Millennium Goals with the hour of 2015, and, in particular, "in those who have the purpose of reducing half of people who live with lower income of a daily dollar, with the "humanity shape".
Spain "continues working" to extend the net of beneficiaries "to all the benefits of the planet, and take this task with "responsibility", said Doña Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions originating in the Summit, which will be extended until the juvenile, "garant the creation of new capacity and best opportunities for the poorests, and especially for women," main beneficiaries of these loans.
It's a lot of achieved successes and a lot of the challenges we face.
The Mikrocredit Summit is present not only as a forum of debate, but also the platform from which to emphasize "the basic objectives".
Thus, his Majesty explained that at the end of 2015, 175 million families who have accessed these financial services and that hundreds of them homes were out of the wealth of poverty in which they are summoned.
The impulse to the concept of microcrediters in Spain and the rest of the world "he has followed the launched sentence for years as a pioneer form" by Muhammad Yunus, emphasized by Doña Sofia as a "act of justice and recognition due".
And it was that he described the father of this tool as a "excellent idealist in the universal cause of fighting against poverty" whose work has been known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to know its loan policy.
A year later, the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as the celebrated in Costa de Marfil in 1999, Canada, and "in all I could see the continued evolution", explained Your Majesty, whose link with this project was worth the qualification of the "faming head" held in Valladolid by the "Backer of Poor".
Finally, the Queen of Doña Sofia concluded its intervention by encouraging the presents to participate in the debate and to find solutions to progress in combating poverty.
"Ethics"
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is a ethical imperative" for all democratic states.
In this sense, I expressed that it would be an error linking cooperation with developing countries at times of economic goodness, since it is a "permanent obligation".
Jimenez considered that microcrédits are “a serious and strict policy dedicated to eradication of poverty”, and now the governments of developed countries must work under solidarity criteria and do not let it be victims of recruits.
For Spain, the microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
The International Cooperation Secretariat, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed "the success" to give people "exclused to those who all close the doors"; and the Alcalde of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the presents to a city which "opens their doors from the solidary spirit".
The CDU proposes to select the European President for universal suffrage
On Monday 14 November, Leipzig, the first day of the Christian-Democratic Union's Congress (CDU) has transcurred without great difficulties to Angela Merkel, Canciller and President of the Christian-Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not initially included in the agenda, but the topic was put in autumn, in particular to satisfy the warriors who believe that government policy is currently too strict with Greek people and could be in a future with Italians.
The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the direction, was practically adopted by unanimity.
From the 1,001 delegations, only nine votes were registered against and ten abstentions.
The standing was several minutes winned, with its interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Migration Minister.
The key idea of the Canciller, and of the motion, is a subject: the response to the crisis is not less Europe, but more Europe.
It is not only because Europe has peace, but also because "9 million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the Canciller, "it has reached the time to open the way in Europe."
This could be shown in amendments to the Lisbon Treaty to enhance the control of the European Union on the budgetary policies of the euro area, although it could also be able to deal with the election of the President of the European Commission by universal subfraction to "a face to Europe".
In any case, this is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the Congress, clearly the idea of Wolfgang Schauble.
Unfortunately, it is unlikely that the twenty-third arrives rapidly to an agreement on this radical change: Great Britain is enemy before him, and the CDU leaders seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy also.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, delegations rejected the proposal to consider the weight of each country of the European Central Bank, based on the weight of each economy, which would obviously strengthen the weight of Germany.
The Canciller is concerned with calming the souls within his party, but it is not that he has tried to win its congress at the coast of the small European countries or the countries in difficulties to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe dedicates a paragraph to the importance of "the French-Patrimonia friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Safe of past.
Remembering that two centuries ago, a bloody battle was produced in Leipzig.
Indeed, it was one of the most humilious derogations for the Napoleon army.
The incidence of fraud in low disease
Following subsidies, UMP and the Government are injured against low diseases.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday, 15 November, to visit a box responsible for the family subsidies and to speak a conversation on the subject, which is already recurrent since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and assistant.
Furthermore, to accompany such abuse, which is part of the will to strictly smell, but still remembers an eye of the presidential campaign on right, most of them want to focus on low diseases.
First, to apply budgetary remedies: the Government plans to impose the workers in the private sector a fourth day of deficit before he can cut down.
Finally, unless there was a specific company agreement, a sick worker would lose four days of payment, i.e., at least 15% of its monthly income.
This is a measure that could raise a angry oil, but it would allow $280 million, according to the Echos.
Furthermore, it would be accompanied with a more symbolic range: paying the officials a day of labour without repayment in case of low labour (for the time, they have no deficiency, against the three days applied in the private sector).
While these issues are discussed, most of them also put on the table on the subject of fraud, which is directed towards the abuse of low workers.
"It will be significantly increased controls and, as a result, if someone is discovered with fraud, the amounts must be repaid", advertised Xavier Bertrand, speaking on Sunday 13 November in the RTL.
Like in other cases, the impact of the advertising seems slightly disproportionate for the reality of low workers fraud.
In fact, since 2002, a constant follow-up of this issue has been carried out and have been launched several offensive policies that have normally produced fruit.
French people are not sick than in the rest of Europe.
Let us first observe national digits.
According to the French Social Security Institute (CNAM) in 2006 more than EUR 237 million were accompanied in low-working benefits.
According to the French Institute for Health Research and Documentation, low subsidies represented in 2008 5% of the health expenditure, up to EUR 11.3,00 million.
From this sum, 46% corresponds to low maternity and labour accidents, while 54% are related to low illness, a number of EUR 6.200 million.
Consequently, 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the Frenchs collected a average of 14.5 working days before 17.8 in 2009, according to a study of the Alma Consulting Group.
A media, which, uncertainly, hides defactions: another survey, published in 2007 by the Siria of Professional Management Monster.com, showed that 75 per cent of the 40,000 insured French academics claimed that they had not seen or only one day of lowness for disease.
Another study, in this case of the assurance disease, indicates that 37 per cent of disease lows had been less than 8 days, 22 per cent between 8 and 14 days, 15 per cent between 15 days and a month, 15 per cent between one and three months and 11 per cent were longer.
If we compare them with our European neighbors, French workers are not more propens than in other areas to cover low illness.
A long study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall lack of work (and for health and other reasons) was 10 per cent to 11 per cent in France, against 20 per cent and 28 per cent in Denmark, a 15 per cent in the United Kingdom or between 16 per cent and 18 per cent in the Netherlands.
Fraud in low disease is not particularly significant in comparison with the un declarated work.
Fraud has a sufficiently limited range.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has caused controls of low disease over 45 days are systematic.
In 2008, from 1.5 million inspections, CNAM tested, in 13% of the 285,000, that short-term lows were "injustified or too long," namely 37.050 cases.
In the case of lower than 45 days, subject to systematic inspections, 11 per cent of the cases were "decisively adapted or unjustified; a figure that, having a total of 1,2 million income, was 132.000.
As a result, a total of 169.000 "injustified" cases were reached among several million workers who had been low in disease.
Uncertainly, a insignificant number in comparison, for example, with the work in black.
According to the Deputy of the Office of the Dominican Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent a loss of tax revenues from 9.000 to 15,000 million euros per year, i.e., more than the total cost of low subsidies and, without doubt, significantly more than fraud in this area.
Papdemous: Greece must apply a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to enhance its economy.
This is what he has declared on Monday 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papadeed before the Parliament; he also added that the hundreds of days that have been granted to his Government of unity would not be sufficient to achieve that goal.
"In order to make efforts to recover the economy, we need support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme", stated the Governing Chief, who expressed his first public talk during the debate on the vote of confidence to Parliament on Thursday.
The implementation of the decisions taken during the Euro area Summit on 27 October will be the "principal task" of the new government, since the country is in game" remains in the euro area, added.
Consequently, Papdeos expected that public deficiency of the country will be reduced by about 9 per cent of the GDP before the end of the year, after reaching 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
Right rejects new audience measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right-to-right group, showed its support to the measures already adopted to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party will not be compromised with additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote for new measures," said during a meeting with the deputy of his "New Democracy".
He pointed out that it was in line with the deficit and debt reduction objectives and the fight against derogation, but against any policy that prevents economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the FMI and the EU would not disbloke the loan of 8.000 million euros without a written guarantee of support of all parties to the measures expected, Antonio Samaras replied that his word would be sufficient and that it would not be signed because of the external pressure.
A expert committee states that it should be legalized by Ethania and the assisted self-assault
Canadians live rejecting death, as indicated in the report of the Real Society of Canada
In the field of paliative care, the Committee calls for governments, health assistance institutions and doctors to cooperate in order to ensure the best paliative care, not only in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives rejecting death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians are ready to talk to your doctor about the conditions where they want to die and take provisions to this effect.
This is one of the conclusions of an imminent report of the Real Society of Canada, which was involved in six experts in various areas, including ethics, laws and doctors.
The Committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code in order to enable the assisted self-assault and Ethanese, when the patient is presented this option and has been judged responsible to take the decision.
To begin, experts mentioned a recent survey of the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 world countries.
Although Canada cares for the tenth place, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to treat the subject of death".
With medicine or not, 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to paliative care, as indicated in the experts selected by the Real Society of Canada.
And despite the majority of Canadians want to die at home, 68.6 per cent of them have been missing in the hospital.
In general, the highest rate in this sense is registered by Quebec, where 86 per cent of deaths are produced in the hospital.
With regard to the delicate issue of Ethania and the assisted suicide, the authors of the report have reached conclusions that did not match the post of the federal government, which has already stated that they did not want to change the Criminal Code on Ethanese and the Assistant Suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or not a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they have not been considered a criminal offence has not caused a abuse of their application, i.e., the use of Ethanese or suicide assisted with non-competent persons or had not been granted their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-advisor of the report, declared yesterday by teleconference that, on the other hand, there were more exemptions in the countries where Ethanese or assisted suicide were not legalized.
"In Canada, Ethania is practiced, although it is clearly illegal."
"In Canada, the suicide is assisted, although it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians, favourable to Ethania
We recall that 85 per cent of Canadians have already been expressed for Ethanese, since they believe that they would allow those whose death is near to relieve their suffering, as indicated by an Angus Reid survey carried out in 2010.
In addition, 66% believes that the fact of legalization of Ethania will not give understanding that the life of older or disabled persons is less valued.
With regard to people who have experienced suicide, 41 per cent of the surveys believe that a process should not be initiated against them.
With regard to the maintenance or interruption of health assistance to a patient, the situation is not so clear, as indicated by the authors of the report.
In addition, among its recommendations, it suggests that the removal of health care, if legally rejected, is not a criminal offence.
The Committee of Experts also requests that health professionals be formed in the duty to respect the fact that a patient rejects the assistance at the end of his life without fear to face a complaint.
In the field of paliative care, the Committee calls for governments, health assistance institutions and doctors to cooperate in order to ensure the best paliative care, not only in cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to the Palestinian or Terminal seat, which is already being used in the health institutions of Canada, the Committee requests that, unless it serves for reducing physical pain, it is considered an Ethanese and is subject to the same procedures.
Other experts show reservations
Other health law experts have already shown their reservations with regard to the conclusions of the report of the experts of the Real Society of Canada.
Peter Deschamps, a health specialist, has qualified the post of experts signing the report, among other things because Ethania’s practice is not limited to terminal nurses.
"This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is smiling to live and has more than 18 years can ask for help to suicide", says Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr. Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report appear to give a priority to personal autonomy on any other value of society.
However, adds that "in society, there are labels and limitations".
The health specialist Margaret Southrville also expressed its "forest opposition" on the conclusions of the report, which was qualified by "manfiesto for Ethanese".
Margaret Saturville, who is also the Real Society of Canada, puts on a judicial screen the lack of abuse in certain countries where Ethania and the assisted suicide are legal, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
The king of Jordan urges President El Asad to abandon the power
Damascus declares a "complete"
Syria is increasingly isolated
The Party of Bachar El Asad was shown yesterday before the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Last night the diplomatic pressure on the Syrian Bachar El Asad was intensified that, with the support of Russia, resists and claims that there is a "complete" towards the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has strengthened sanctions against Damasco, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring Syria, have demonstrated for the abandonment of the power by President Asad.
King Abdala II of Jordan was yesterday the Arab first leader who requested President Bachar El Asad to "abort the power" in Syria, where there have already been a quarter of civilians and members of the rule forces.
"If Bachar really worried about his country, it should, in addition to establishing the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life," stated the king of Jordan, neighbouring Syria, in an interview for the BBC.
For its part, Ahmet Davidoglu, the chief of Turkish diplomacy, regretted that the mediation efforts that leads to Turkey from the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in a failure.
"They who are not in peace in the Middle East with their peoples and are not able to satisfy them, they will go," he stated by engaged in Syria, a neighbouring country for which Turkey is taking a more harder post.
Following the decisions of the Arab Liga and the European Union, the United States concluded that the agreement against Asad and the action of the Syrian regime has been strengthened.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab link and other countries, such as Turkey, are taking a more harder ton in respect of the repression in Syria, states Mark Toner, port of the Department of State.
At the same time, 16 civilians have already lost their lives and at least 19 members of the regime forces in the Dea region, in the south of Syria, reported the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Other two civilians have failed to "during bombs and shoots with weight ametrallators in Jobar" in the local city of Homs, as indicated by the NGO.
During a press route, the Syrian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid Al Mualem, considers that the country "before to the end of the crisis".
He also reacted firmly to the decision of the Arab League to suspend on the damass of his functions, which, in his view, is "a dangerous step".
Syrian would "no flake," he added, safeguarding that "the complexs tramped against Syria will fail".
After the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League currently studied a "mechanism of civilians" and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, means and military observers to the country.
The French Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alain Juppé, also expressed its support to the United Nations shipment of observers in order to contribute to the protection of civilians against the repression of the regime, which, in its opinion, is in the "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the Liga in Rabat is expected to be held in the morning to put on the implementation of the crisis output plan adopted on 2 November, which, in particular, provides the removal of the armed forces of the cities in the hand of the opposition and release of detented manifestants.
The Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Serguei Lavrov, has judged yesterday as "incorrect" the decision of the Arab Liga, while China urged Syria to implement the crisis outlook, although it did not demonstrate its support to implement possible sanctions against Damasco.
Italy
Monti requests time for Italian markets and sacrifices
The future leader of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has requested some time for the markets to form their team and to set up a program that will include "sancies" to recover the lost credibility during the last months of the Government of Berlusconi.
The former European Commissioner discussed yesterday with the political parties, and today he was meeting with the sindicates and the patronal.
It should be a relatively limited office, composed of external technologies to Parliament.
"Monte has spoken of a wide programme with numerous sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a deputy of one of the many small parliamentary groups who participated in meetings after meeting with the designated Council President.
For its part, the President of the House of Members, Gianfranco Fini, stated that it expects that Mario Monti requests a vote to Parliament to ensure that the new Government has sufficient support.
The consultations will be concluded with the presentation, by Mr Monti, of a limited list of ministers, to the Head of State, Jorgio Napolitano.
Monte has commented on the nervousism of the Burunty markets and the obligationists last night, requesting them time.
In the "democracy, there are certain periods" to form a government and to prepare its programme, he stressed that it is "certain that the markets will be patient and will understand it".
His appointment was initially obtained the benefit of the markets, but then the concern was imposed, in particular after a preventive fall of industrial production in the euro area in September.
The named Prime Minister should create a team mainly formed by technocrats, even if he has emphasized that he would like to include "politicals".
The new Government should operate until 2013, date of the following legislatives,.
According to the President of the House of Members, Gianfranco Fini, the new Government will obtain the vote of trust from Parliament before Friday.
Monti has been compromised that, when it takes the charge, he will work into account the emergency and aims that Italy "recupers its protagonism" in Europe.
A porter of the European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "including a new government will not change our diagnosis of Italian economy".
The EU, convincing that Rome will not achieve its goal to achieve a budgetary balance in 2013, despite the overseas plans adopted for the last months, requested new rigorous measures.
The "head of Chiefs" Italian Emma Marcegaglia, who will see the master, also stressed the need to stimulate the economy, "before a country that does not grow to comply with the requirements of deficit."
Monti, famous for its competitive and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), is a "time change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "other Italy", according to the editorialists.
The great innocent will be the long-term of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid previous elections, since Italy has to put about 200,000 million euros in State obligations before April 2012.
A Russian scientific has cooperated with the Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has cooperated with Iran in developing a detonator that can be used with nuclear weapons, as the Monday stated a specialized American NGO in the Atomic Risk.
For the identification of the researcher, the International Science and Security Institute (ISIS) is based on a recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and on other documents issued by the United Nations Agency.
The IAEA last week showed its "grace concern" for a "posible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, on the basis of the IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, had worked for three decades, since 1960, in a Soviet Military Nuclear Center in Tcheliabinsk (Oural) and had participated in the manufacturing of synthetic diamonds for explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, the centre would have been left to form a central company in the production of "nanodiamants" in Kiev.
The economic problems of your company would lead to contact him, in 1995, with the Ambassador of Iran in Ukraine.
Then it was believed that he had cooperated with the Iran programme between 1996 and 2002 before returning to Russia.
In its last report, IAEA said that there are "class indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the assistance of a foreign expert, which was not only well known for the technical, but also, according to the report of a Member State to the Agency, worked during the majority of its road in that technology in the military nuclear programme of its country of origin."
Muslim crimes and crimes have increased 50%
Muslim crimes and crimes have increased approximately 50 per cent between 2009 and 2010, while in the same period, the remaining types of racial and religious violence have reduced or slowly increased, as the FBI statistics published on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence against Muslim in 2009 to 160 in 2010 has increased from 49 per cent in the case of acts of violence against Catholics, a reduction of 4 per cent in Jewish crimes and a global increase of 14 per cent in the number of crimes and anti-religious crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has grown slightly up to 6.628 cases, of which 47.3% should be at racial differences and 20% to religious differences, as indicated by the FBI.
"Third a decrease in 2009, it is worried that they have returned to increased such crimes and crimes," stressed the organization of human rights defence, "the increase of acts of violence against Muslims is particularly significant", added the organization in a communication.
"Human Rights First has long been pointing out that violence against Muslims, as well as all kinds of hatred crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," adds a responsible organization, Paul Legendre.
"The United States Government can and must be struggled to end such abuses," adds, in view of the fact that such efforts could include a improvement in the police reports on "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in the US Federal Law was hered from the time of combating civil rights.
This legislation was adopted after Martin Luther King's death to punish acts of violence linked to race, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual inclination.
Twitter changes your platform and looks more like Facebook
The microblogging Twitter site modified Monday the presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of people to whom they follow, which causes their service a little more like Facebook.
A new "Activity" tab and another named "name" allows you to follow more legitimately and directly the activity of other "Twittos", i.e. those whose messages "tweets" remain on the Internet or which follow you.
This allows you to know whether you follow messages, if you are subscribed to new accounts, if you are qualified by favorite any message, etc.
This new Twitter form was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before spread it to the rest of the Sunday network, as stated to the AFP's portion, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, who was known for its low-instinct function, with slightly esterical terms (RT to send a message of another person, follow-up to recommend following another user) making the happiness of the initiated, is thus opened to a larger public with a more comparable manner to that of the larger Facebook and Google+ public networks.
In the network, users have discussed "tweets" with different views the interest of this innovation.
"It's inutile, results invasive and it seems too much to Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The function Activity will help me to continue better some elements of my Twitter flow," writes @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a budgetary "good rules" in the Constitution
The Government of great social-democratic coalition, which is in the power of Austria, has decided to include a budgetary "goat rules" in the Constitution to reduce public deficit and thus avoid a possible degradation of the Austrian sovereign note by the credit qualifications agencies (true A).
It was the social-democratic Canciller, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when Austrian public debt reached 74.6%, a very higher number of 60% fixed by the Maastricht Treaty but clearly lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency is reduced at a single level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay 3,000 million euros more in interest each year", stated the Democratic Democratic Vice-Christ for Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus responds to a request from the Brussels Summit to the Member States in the euro area of 26 October: in which the Heads of State and Government requested the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of the reduction of public deficit and of the recovery of public accounts in the Constitution or in an Equivalent Act.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian Government is close to the German model, since Germany was the first European country to adopt that type of "regule".
Before 2017, the structural public deficit should decrease each year in 0.75% of the bruto domestic product (PIB) and, from 2017, the structural public deficit of the federal State should not exceed 0.35% of the GDP, while regional and communities should present balanced budgets.
The objective is that, until 2020/2021, public debt is reduced under the criteria of 60% of the Maastricht Treaty.
It's a children's book, right?
No threat with a new intervention of the change market
The Japanese Prime Minister, Yoshihiko Noda, warned the march that the Nipon authorities would reiterate the marked change if the yen continued to grow.
"We will intervente, as we did last time, if we check that a excessive volatility is produced" in the type of yen change, Noda explained to the Senate.
On Monday, the yen was reaching a closer level to the maximum historical levels which produced the intervention of Japanese authorities on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo was massively sold yens per dollars to reduce the value of the nipona division, which had finished reaching a new record since 1945 compared to the US currency.
But yen has been backing paulatively since then, emphasized by the purchases of investors who are considered it a "value relief" in these uncertain times of global economic rhetorising and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar to return to be covered at less than 77 yens and the euro has descended under the symbolic bar of 105 yens, reaching a number of levels close to those who caused the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis 2008-2009, the dollar was counted around 120 yens and the euro to more than 160 yens.
This explosion of the nipona division harms the exports of the archipelago, since Made products in Japan and reduces the value of income obtained in the foreign country by Japanese enterprises when they convert them to national currency.
"Japan is fighting to rebuild" after the seisme and tsunami of 11 March, which destroyed the Tohoku region, emphasized Noda, which fears that the rebuilding of the yen court is the weakness of recovery.
The third global economic power has recovered growth in the third quarter (1.5 per cent in relation to the previous quarter) for the first time in a year, thanks to increased exports and consumption of homes affected by the disaster.
However, the Prime Minister believes that the high level of yen did not reflect the "economic bases of Japan".
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, requested the Japanese Bank (BoJ) to launch a meeting of two days of its monetary policy Council, which takes all possible measures to deficienze the yen.
However, the Adjoint Governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "the appropriate measures" and understood that a more monetary flexibility should not be expected on Thursday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the emission institute increased in five billion yens (47.000 million euros) purchases of the Tesoro letters, leading to the 55 billion yens (519.000 million euros) the overwhelming of the funds dedicated to the purchase of several financial titles in order to induce the liquidity market.
Euro zone:
the types grow, the bags flake
The risk of the debt crisis is still harming European indexes.
Despite the appointment of new Government Chiefs in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth rates in France and Germany, the types of the weakest countries continue to grow.
The stableness of the euro area has still been concerned, and the European bags are slower in the negative zone on March 15, November.
In Paris, at 10 hours, the CAC 40 lost 1,4% and is at 3.064 points.
Dax lost in Frankfurt 0.4% and in London 0.1%.
"Bearing in mind the new pressures regarding the income of the employees of the most affected euro area, the Burunty markets worldwide remain part of their recent profits."
"Inversors, nervous, are perfectly conscious of the risk of contagio", explains Terry Pratt, institutional corridor in IG Markets, quoted by the Reuters Agency.
Tokio's Bolsa has closed 0.7 per cent by renewing the concerns of market intervenants in Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, as the rest of the world, has a fixed look in Europe and exchanges will continue to be realized at a lower range of variations, so investors will have no evidence that the situation has been established", considered Mitsushige Akino, fund manager in Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The restoration of the concerns for the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to decrease on March.
The euro remains at its lower level since a month and half ago.
10 hours ago, the European division was $3570, a fall of 0.4 per cent.
According to the drivers, it has lost a value after the party of the Canciller Angela Merkel, the CDU, who was meeting the Monday in the Congress, takes a movement that, in particular, prescribes the option that a country in difficulties comes out of the euro area without abandoning the European Union.
Italian and Spanish types exceeding 6% with crops
The type of credit in Italy and Spain remains very concerned.
On Monday morning, the performance of Italian obligations to 10 years was 6.85%, while Spanish titles offered to the same period 6,2%.
These tensions relating to the types of interest of the Southern countries, although also from France, continue to produce the fears of interventioners.
The chief of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has requested time for markets to improve the situation in Italy, which is the risk of achieving its debt weight.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for its part, stated that the implementation of the decisions adopted in the Euro area Summit on 27 October would be the "clear work" of its Government.
Spain is at the point of view of the market, while the Sunday will be held by legislative elections.
The difference in the types ("expread") between ten-year obligations in Germany and Spain has reached a new maximum history.
The euro area's growth rates are expected.
From statistical view, France has registered an economic growth of 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, i.e. a more favourable number than 0.3 per cent expected by domestic consumption.
However, Insee has revised to low the number of the second quarter, with a decrease of 0.1% of the bruto domestic product (PIB) instead of stamping.
Furthermore, the fourth quarter is what really concerns economists.
Germany has registered an increase of 0.5 per cent in the same period.
The first forecasts for the whole euro area are prescribed at 11 hours after the European Commission has warned on the risk of a new receipt.
Energy policy:
the facts must be more than the dogmes
If there is a theme that can't be addressed by taking into account short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it is the energy policy.
Availability and costs of electricity are directly affected by the acquisitive power and the competitiveness of companies.
It is appropriate that a election meeting is the time to reflect on such issues and the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it examines the whole economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should based their views on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are 7,000 million people in the planet, the demographic evolution will have the duplication of electrical demand before 2050, unless there is a large part of the global population of a vital element.
At the same time, there will be a deterioration of the growing deficiency of fossil resources to continue to produce continuously electricity, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce emissions of winter gas to combat climate change, a subject that has disappeared from the environmental debate.
Fukushima's accident does not change any of these parameters.
Germany therefore remains alone in its decision to abandon nuclear energy.
This is not the case or Belgium, which puts its attention to the need to find a powerful source to replace it, or Switzerland, which only aims to build centrals of the last generation.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, by quoting some examples, continue to be determined with their projects.
U.S., after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, taking back the construction of an interrupted central after the accident of Trie Mile Island.
If the German model, based on renewable energy, is presented as an example, the reality will be against such a speech.
The Berlin election will propose an enhancement of the electricity price, an increased energy dependence on the increased gas needs of imported, in particular in Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions for the construction of gas and fuel centrals.
In some months, the harmful effects will be noted.
The case of Denmark should be meditate.
Europe's campaign in the electric sector, which obtains 30% of its electricity, is also one of the larger carbon and gas users because of the wind intermitting; therefore, their CO2 emissions and their electricity price are, respectively, 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to our energy policy, our neighbors have an electricity facture more than 40% of French homes.
While in a globalized economy the energy cost is a key factor for competitiveness and the guarantee of the maintenance of industrial use in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Therefore, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would have a strong decline of electricity price, which would remain realistic to the wonderful statements on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of our acquisitive power.
This is a price that the large majority of Frenchs refuse to pay, and in fact, they do not demonstrate opposition in principle to that type of energy, as shown in the surveys.
We remember that the energy policy of our country has lost the construction of an industrial sector with 125,000 directors and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Extensively directed to export, it covers a galaxy of pymes specialized on international markets and can create non-localised jobs.
If France decides to leave nuclear energy, it would be the sacrifice of large part of these SMEs and the loss of EUR 6.000 per year in French equipment and nuclear services exports.
What electricist would load a EPR designed to operate for sixty years when its manufacturer's manufacturer is expected?
In order to solve nuclear energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no miracle source of electricity production, as well as there is no diabetic source.
The development by the Area of Solutions with low CO2, nuclear and renewable CO2 emissions demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the maximum security level.
In France, we have a Security Authority that exercises a strict and transparent control on existing centres and on the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, of recognised professionality, are also obsessed by security.
In the middle of the century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, the Trie Mile Island, occurred in normal operational conditions; it did not cause consequences, nor for people or for the environment.
In Chernobil, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and to imperfect human failures.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of an unprecedented scale, which caused death of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as did the two previously.
Thanks to these progress and cooperation between security authorities, and French and German operators and constructors, the EPR has a powerful design to resist such phenomena.
While studying all the electric actors who want to build a central, the interruption of their construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for Areva and EDF competitors, since it would leave them free to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is essential and legitimate to search for the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsive to let emotions, dogmes and participants dominate a very important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a load or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy implemented by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized by several points of view: the saturation of the police, judicial and administrative services subject to the figure policy, the compatibility of this policy with the self-declared status of "the country of human rights".
Most recently, it is the slight administrative shock of foreign students who has shooted to the holders, with the Minister of Interior (see release of 23 May), proclaiming in past that France "no need for foreign talents, workers and careers."
However, it is rarely analyzed from the economic point of view.
The question is that, on this subject, there is a sufficient consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the orientation by declaring in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed people should not be a problem for a country that accounts for about two million immigrants", while on the left, the ton fixed it Michel Rocard, explaining that France "not can be charged by all the mercy of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both left and right shared the fear of the invasion of the national territory by a large number of Poland sources.
On both sides, immigrants are a load for the economy and French society.
The only difference is at the level of generosity with which they act with regard to immigrants.
In its programme, François Hollande is limited to include banalities, indicating that the code-road will enable to resolve the "immigration problem".
This idea of immigration as a load, a problem, may be electorally, but economically is very sweet.
As the Economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron pointed out in a recent work that resumes the most recent knowledge of immigration (Exceptive People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus between the experts on the positive impact of migratory flows in economic growth, salary and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
The limitation of immigration deficits growth and damages employment.
The fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace national workers, in particular less qualified, pressing to reduce their wages.
However, experience shows that immigrants are more complementary than the replacements of national workers and are primarily employed in sectors with lack of employment.
Unqualified immigrants work in sectors which do not affect national workers and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where training does not meet staff demand.
Positive effects on salary
Similarly, a surgery would have difficulties to work in a country that does not have an advisists, complementarity between national and immigrants causes that the arrival of these latters is positively influenced on the wages and employment of nationals.
Taking into account the previous, John Peri calculated that an increase of 1% of migratory flows had an increase in real long-term wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And without taking into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (which exists a large proportion of naturalized Nobel and enterprises such as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net income to social systems, as they provide a average of 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization, for example, calculates that a immigrant in Germany who has a 30-year-old age will carry out a net contribution of EUR 150,000 to public average budgets throughout its life.
At the beginning of his mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go looking for the growth points that were missing with the dentists.
These dentists, who dismissed the immigrants, had exactly the inverse effect.
Europe has invented democracy, only the lack of thinking about a European democracy
Democracy is a precious good, but also fragile.
The European continent should be able to remember that, although it was invented in Athene over two thousand years ago, during the 19th century has suffered the tragedy of the World War, totalitarisms, Holocaust, Gulag, but also in Spain, to Salazar in Portugal, the Coronels in Greece.
Some may have believed that, so that democracy would be finally triunphated about their enemies, it would be enough to exercise the vote and the most direct way possible.
We know, from Napoleon the Small, that was something thought.
The universal sufraction, although it is a condition necessary for democracy, is not sufficient for himself, and it can even become a "oppression instrument", as the formerly said the Republican philosoph Etienne Vacherot.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, Luces, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we live in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is at the point of become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinody of the true-false Greek reference had in this regard a double revelator effect: showed the need for a powerful return of the political area, but also the concerning feeling of its impossibility, of its incompatibility.
It should be reflected on this ambivality to overcome it.
The truth is that the lines in the front of the Democratic Battle have now been moved and, in many cases, the Republican soldiers have no longer progressed in the good sense.
We will not be able to win if we require national references, organized on the basis of the needs and in a decorative manner.
A white sign to the absolute European monarch or a high the empty of the nationalist anger: What options for the citizen!
No, we don't want to get out of effect, but a common exercise, full-right, peaceful and continuous, from options and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (we did not know where to end the list), because there is only a crisis, Europe's crisis.
Europe's entirety is the one that enhances the market orders and qualification agencies, which suffers their imposicy and lack of solidarity.
It's the whole of Europe who suffers humiliation in the international area.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is all Europe who lose sovereignty slowly and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent is that the popular sovereignty will recover the timon of the European project.
Because only Europeans can together reduce the weight of their debts, free from the markets and prepare their future through investment.
The outcome of the crisis will require European decisions that cannot be taken without a total democratic legitimacy, except to lead us to disaster.
After struggling for a long time against this proposal for socialists and Jacques Delors, the whole world now calls for European economic governance.
That's it.
But think of it without a greater political and democratic integration, and without being living like that by the citizens, it would be a new crazy and would lead us to a new dead point.
We must take a new stage of the European construction.
To build the Republic in France, "hacer" was needed.
The revolution motivated by interest would not be enough.
This lesson is still applicable.
We must build a more integrated Europe from the economic perspective.
It can only be achieved by building a more democratic Europe at the political level, a truly popular European sovereignty.
To build Europe, we do Europeans.
The cards with chip "no contact" are generalized
The world room of Chip cards begins march in Villepinte, near Paris, with a optimistic environment.
In fact, 2011 should end up to 11% in global card sales with microprocessors (bank cards, phones with SIM cards etc.), with a total of 6,000 million units, according to the calculations of the Eurosmart office.
The most powerful segment is the technologie without contact, which allows to subscribe common transport or purchase simplely by approaching the card to a reader.
This year, 460 million cards will be sold throughout the world with chip without contact, 320 million more than the previous year!
It should continue to increase in 2012 (before 580 million units) and represent about 10% of the world market of chip cards (6.925 million cards).
Europe, which has been long rewarded to the Asian-Pacific region, has winned fields in the field of non-contact payment sector.
About 26 million bank cards Visa are already available for this function, which is accepted in 75.000 pay terminals.
In France, its initials are more modest: 400,000 Visa cards are used without contact.
But the large surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has issued this year 2,5 million cards Pass MasterCard without contact.
However, to put the top path, the banks must put them to their customers.
"There are two large French institutions that have been able to systematically disseminate in the future, between their customers, bank cards with the system without contact," reports Gérard Nebouy, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test the payment by mobile phone
But that's just a first stage towards the future payment media: the mobile phone.
Currently, there are few devices equipped with NFC technology (Near Field Communication), necessary for operations.
"He's smelling."
"But it should finally try a true age the year that comes."
"We expect to be sold between 80 and 120 million units throughout the world in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the front.
The Agricultural Bank announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and June in Caen.
The iPhones will be equipped with about 200 customers and collaborators with a foundation that allows payment without contact.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marsella.
And the General Society has also stated yesterday that it is preparing the marketing of a offer that allows its customers to pay without contact through its mobile.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front goes to increase
Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Magreb and Boko Haram Sect.
The links between the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Magreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Section of Boko Haram, who have been suspected for a long time, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Argel Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even claimed that Argel “have the certidumbre”.
"The way both organizations operate and the reports of intelligence services show that they are cooperating", explained, without further details.
Paris seems to reach a similar conclusion.
The investigation of the two French sequence in Niger last January would have reanimed the pastures.
Rapted in a restaurant in Niamey for persons related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocor and Vincent Delory died next day together with several of its followers during a operation launched by the French special forces.
In the spots of the intervention, French and Nigerian researchers found several telephone chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorism eye
The study of the calls shows several interlocutors based on Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers have particularly captured the interest of researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who has remained long in Mayduguri, a city of the north of Nigeria, the coast of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who, likely, is near Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a progress, but without doubt we must expect to have more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We know for years that the section enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is still more active," says Kyle Amuwo, a Nigerian investigator.
These last months, the "assists" were increasingly clear in the evolution and speech of Boko Haram, or in its operational ways, which now implies the use of microkazes or explosive devices and the same style as they used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting by Washington, has since then been pressing Abuya to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, take time to consider the group as a community of illuminants that is not interested.
Quick success
Founded in 2002 in Mayduguri around a mix, a school and the fundamentalist Mohammed Joseph, Boko Haram (which means "the western education is a sin"), encourages the establishment of a Islamic emit in the northern Nigerian Islamic Muslim.
In this poor region, the association lives rapidly.
It is political and requires strict respect of sharia, while its warriors are launched against the wicked central government.
These are first directed to churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram warriors were particularly active and attacks were multiplied against committees.
The reaction of Abuya was, as normally passing, generalized.
The army attacked the city and recorded 800 dead.
Mohammed Joseph, arrested in life, received death in prison.
Since then, the sect is radicalized and leaves his fires from the north.
The past Navities revince a warning that causes 80 dead in Jos and then another in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram returned to attack Abuya, in particular against the protected police quarter, with a suicide attack, the first one of this guy.
In August the United Nations Local Headquarters becomes its first international goal.
The creation of a terrorist eye in Africa, which would ship from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, is concerned about all security experts.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and Al-Chaba's Somalians operating in Kenya, Boko Haram is a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned you against Boko Haram and said that he was willing to "depart all the information".
The world according to the Republican candidates to the Presidency
With regard to China, Iran and the help to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry revalue in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
A American weaknessed by the crisis, can you manage a complex world with simple ideas or even simplistic ideas?
Listed to the Republican candidates for the presidents, electors could think that it is.
Since a few days ago, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have made more struggling and attacks in the field of foreign policy, traditionally a strong point of the Republicans.
The weeds, often unfunded, are extensive about China, Iran, the aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best candidate located on the road towards the appointment by the "Grand Old Party", has threatened to bring Chineses to the WTO and declare "for the manipulation of their division", a key topic in an exacerbated America by the migration of all fragments of its sector to Asia.
At the same time, if that implies the explosion of a commercial war, he stated.
John Huntsman, the former Ambassador of Obama in China, and the only candidate who has a sophisticated vision of the external policy, is almost shocked to a attitude that "speaks" emotions.
He requested a strong but constructive dialogue with Pekin (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who is standing in the depths of the sonds, remains unaudious.
To Reagan's style
Romney has also promised a military intervention in Iran if sanctions could not interrupt its nuclear programme.
"If I'll be elected, I'll stop Iran," he said.
"If Obama sells released, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military assistance to Israel, accusing Obama of having failed with its obligations relating to that partner.
The Employer Herman Cain, the second best classified candidate, shows for its part an ungodly recognition of such themes.
Recently, he tried to oppose China's military threat because Pequin “through to develop nuclear capacity”, apparently ignoring the fact that China has already available the military atom since 1964.
The Teacher Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says that by its part, it is ready to deploy the United States army in Mexico to fight drug prisoners.
To torture against terrorist cases, prohibited by Obama in 2009, also recommended Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
Differences are considerable with the Republican candidate in 2008, John McCain, a weight in external policy.
The opposers of the current President respond that Reagan also had simple ideas and wins the Cold War.
They recalled that Obama himself was an affected and that he had to shoot the piston in the field of combating terrorism.
In fact, in the failure of its ingenuous dialogue with Iran, it is in the rapid outcome of the "boys" of Iraq and its landscapes in Libya, and it is weak.
But the attacks are not simple.
The population is more positively the national security balance of Obama, which ended with Bin Laden.
From Iraq, he dislooked the military interventions generating a hungry.
And, arguing that it is necessary to rebuild America in order to restore his leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more fair.
North Stream, new Russian Gas entrance gate in Europe
North Stream gas driver, which is directly communicating Western Europe with Russia through the Baltic Sea, has already been in service.
Gas should be provided to meet the needs of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian giant gas, wanted to celebrate the event with a great pump.
Last March, over 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated in the Baltic Oceans, between the Orchest music and a delicate buffet, in the inauguration of North Stream, the new gas communicated directly, under the sea, Russia and Germany.
Similarly, the German Canciller Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medveev, French Prime Minister Frances Filon and his Homologo of the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, have turned together the flight of the ball that controls the Russian gas in the Western Europe network.
With this new gas, each year there will be 27.5 million cubic meters of Russian gas to Western Europe through a first tube of 1.224 km that communicate the San Petersburg region with the country of Mecklemburg and Pomerania.
A second tube should be concluded at the end of 2012 which will allow to provide a total of 55,000 million cubic gas meters, i.e., enough to cover all French consumption.
Furthermore, it is already talked about the possibility of building a third tube for the same recycling.
For Gazprom, the finalization at time of this huge work presents trials of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries were strongly opposed to the project.
In fact, North Stream will allow gas to provide directly to Germany by avoiding the earthquake by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
In fact, these two countries lose something of their power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia by enable them to close access to Western Europe markets.
In the argued point of the debate, Varsovia did not duly compare North Stream as a "new German and Soviet Covenant" in terms of the Alliance between Hitler and Stalin to take place in Poland in 1939.
I mean, if the topic is politically delicate.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has obtained greater supply security.
But the price is a debilitation of Europe of energy, since the project has generated a break between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has learned, only five years ago, to triumph its vision of a direct partnership between Russia and the western countries, large gas consumers and with more limited reserves.
"This gasoduct is a component of our association with Russia, a new artery that is one of us organicly", confirmed François Filon during the inauguration of the gas, showing how large gas contracts are as political and economic.
All this explains the broad sounds in the faces of Gazprom's guidelines, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of gas.
The construction of this gas produces also a technical achievement.
The submarino tube is manufactured of cement steel to protect it against ships' angles.
A medium of 200 meters of depth is supported in the sea background.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid mines fields dated from the Second World War.
"It was necessary to remove or destroy a hundred of them, for care," says Jens Muller, a porter of North Stream society.
It was also necessary to enhance the protection of fauna and flower.
The tube is a long metal serpiant that weights like 242 Eiffel tours and is not interrupted throughout its length: nor by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
It was planned for a control platform in the Sweden waters, but the responsibilities of the project rejected the same when the Swedishs were not very disposed to allow a Russian State society to establish a permanently in the sea against their costs.
"In case it would have, we'll interrupte the gas pass in less than one minute," needs Jens Müller.
In the case of escape, gas shall therefore be released to the atmosphere.
But the constructors are not likely to be escaped, since they have planned junctions that, according to the predictions, they will be fleet every 100,000 years.
The state control of the gas drive is guaranteed by a submarino robot, drought by a ship, which carrys out external inspections, as well as by a device that circle through the gas drive.
With the form of a clean, it is introduced inside the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
At its arrival, after three full journeys of travel to a speed of three meters per second, you provide specific data on possible metal deformations.
The gas drive has been designed to operate for 50 years without any type of repair.
Gas movement is simply guaranteed by pressure.
At the beginning it is 200 bars and, at the exit of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined their forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which has 51% of the participations.
The Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French GDF Suez group (9% each).
These five companies have created a common company called North Stream, which is responsible for building and exploiting gas.
It has its seat in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxes are particularly favourable.
Then, Gazprom acquired this company, for a period of twenty-first renewable, the total of the gas transport capacity.
"Gazprom will pay you for the total capacity, independently of the amount of gas that is actually transported", needs Jens Müller.
The financing of the gas industry has been financed by 30 per cent with the contribution of shareholders and 70 per cent through bank loans.
The total cost of the work should be reached by EUR 7.400 million for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are certain that they will not exceed their investment, since Gazprom is only the risk of expenditure.
The gas producer emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, in a pine sand coast.
Some balls, with 4,5 meters of height, form the outdoor of the gas.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and the specific features of the gas to the arrival before transmission to German gases.
Since the past march, the terminal receives a million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
In total capacity, there will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a brand book.
Created half-century ago by a Italian company, Moleskine wants to return to people the favor for writing.
He has an adventure air, from hours of writing at the light of a vel.
The Moleskine book is easily recognised, with its black rectangular folders, its goma, its white color sheets, as old as for time.
However, the Moleskine books with the current aspect were born in 1997.
The Italian Mode company, based on Milan, decided at that time to start a design note book, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, who was then the company's advisor, was loaded from the launching of the new product.
The book is inspired in an ancient production technique, the skin mole (top skin), which refers to a barned ball that was used, among other things, to cover the bankets.
This type of book was very valued by writers and travellers.
"Moleskine has adapted to the current favorite an old and forgotten object, a icon of the guard artists to the XX century," accounts Maria Sebregondi, who has since then become responsible for the brand in Mode.
And it's the success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26 per cent, up to a volume of 12.7 million of units sold.
There has remained the confidential production of the first years, in which only 3.000 livres were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the profile of the buyer, since the note chamber affects both business men and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolites, open spirit and worship.
The small Italian company, who had twelve employees at its starts, now has about 100 and has two offices since 2008: one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes his bookshops, from the Fnac to the small commercials of the city center, and has been able to put their identity.
"We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the increase of the e-mails," Mary Sebregondi explains.
This cultural signature goes from hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has started the "Detour" exposure where architects or artists exhibit their own couader.
In August, he also launched a kitchen with leopards, due to the Locarno film Festival.
Using their success and this cultural will, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: balls, agendas, balls, computer foundations... The brand covers a wide range of supports.
Successful success: in autumn 2006, Mode was acquired by the SG Capital Europe Investment Fund, in the current Single Capital Syntégra, which is written in Moleskine's history.
Why is the percentage of disabled employees still so high?
About 19% of disabilities are looking for employment.
The XV week for the employment of disabled persons starts today.
Despite a resolved public policy, since 2005, the unemployment rate between disabled persons doubles the average rate: 19 per cent, against 9 per cent for the whole population.
Deceasing?
"No," said Eric Blanchet, Director-General of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of persons with disabilities.
"Progress achieved for 15 years are significant.
"In that time, the unemployment rate was not two times but three times higher than the average.
"But there is still much to do."
It should be mentioned that disabled unemployed people continue to hinder many obstacles to access to employment.
They often have a growing age: 37% have more than 50 years (a average 17%).
They have a low-quality level: 80 per cent has not been finished by the bachillate, and 2,3 million students in higher education are disabled only 10,000.
Finally, long-term party is very extensive among them: 53% for disabled persons, against 38% of average.
There are numerous issues that are particularly difficult to return to the work world and "constitute the rest of the problem", states Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, a association created in 1992 to help enterprises to contract disabled workers.
These are the objective obstacles.
Furthermore, there are those not mentioned; the mentality of people is advanced, but too slow.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Introduction Association for the City pointed out that the investigated directors had "a level of knowledge on disabilities low", with a "excellent representation of persons in the route, physical or intellectual disability".
The result: private enterprises with more than 20 employees are very far from the objective of contracting 6% of disabled employees, aimed at a law of ... 1987.
According to the latest available figures, dating in 2008, a relationship of 2.6 per cent is reached.
"We now reach around 3 per cent ", states Peter White, Director-General of Agefiph, the body responsible for recursioning the contributions of undertakings that do not respect this law.
The test is the number of "submitted to this contribution", as well as the payment rates, has decreased from 2007 to 2011, from 59.000 to 46.000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which increased the contributions, has generated a great pressure for companies", explains Peter White.
"But this improvement also reflects a real consciousness, especially among the major groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59 per cent of corporations who have 20 to 49 workers account for disabled employees in their plant, against 82 per cent of 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "A joy"
On Monday, the Bleus's night (20h45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the joy that they generate this friendly party.
We will not be able to say that it was noted conciliation among them, but the image is symbolic.
Sit one together to another, on the road of the State of France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really done peace.
Five months after the slope of his prior to Turkey, the Belgian selectioner has no more joy for him.
"I'm very pleased for Eden, for your progress and for being Belgian."
"I want to progress," answers Lille's front.
As regards the contrast between its presentations in its team and selection, "that is a set" has been justified.
"In Lille, I am all the year, which does not apply Belgium.
"I have to stay on me."
Inviting to play against Romania on Wednesday night, taking into account this party against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to, finally, "brillar".
Don't forget the placer.
He encouraged the Bleus since he had seven years, as well as during the winning campaigns 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been his fan," says.
Nevertheless, that will, in particular, strengthen the "particular" character of the meeting.
Especially because it will be addressed "a Matthieu (Debooky), Johan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ".
"We're over to face a few days ago.
"To play against them is always a joy."
With simplicity, Leekens made for its part reference to "gourn".
"Orgullo" to discuss a gala party.
"Orgullo" also by verifying, as "six", that France "does become a very high-level team", nearly one year after Knysna's traumaism.
"Laurent Blanc has done a formable work", said with entusiasm.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the technology would be pleased to share aircraft with the Blues to... Brazil in 2014.
"Their small Belgians are growing," he stressed.
"We're building something; players are ambitious, they're hungry.
"You can see it on the next games." Included the party against France.
Portugal shows a lot of confidence
Portugal, Paul Bento, is a great optimistic towards the Bosnia ' s back game (22.00 p.m.), which will celebrate Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the age party, I missed both teams.
"When these 90 minutes are over, we'll be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paul Bento is already seeing in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt; the Selection, which is leading since September 2010, will be qualified for the Eurocopa 2012.
Effectly, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there's a game to play and a rival, Bosnia, to ruin.
In view of the ida party (0-0), the Wednesday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the thing is not decided.
Portugal dominated the game for more than one hour, yes, but couldn't mark the valuable gol that he had given his peace.
"It's a good result, but it's at times a risk, because we didn't mark out of the house."
But at home, in the luminous Stadium of Lisbon Luz, the Portugueses are convinced that they will pass, before a public who should be equal to entusiasmed, even if it is clear that the party " is very equal ", digits a optimistic but luxury Benefit.
"We hope that the party is very equivalent, but we are completely convinced that we can take the front," said the Portuguese trainer of 42 years.
"We continue to have 50% of the possibilities to participate in Europe in 2012," however, it was relative to Carlos Queiroz's successor.
Wednesday quarters in Bosnia obligation portugues to mark and win.
Bosnians could reach a quarter, although they also need to mark.
"It's a good result, but it's once a risk, because we have not marked out of the house," regrets Bento.
"We're playing against a team that has a great technical quality and that has players with a great individual quality," added.
Like Zenica, the Portugals will have the intention to exercise, from the beginning, a maximum pressure on the bosnians to "don't leave them time to think".
A good idea, always that, this time, be realist.
