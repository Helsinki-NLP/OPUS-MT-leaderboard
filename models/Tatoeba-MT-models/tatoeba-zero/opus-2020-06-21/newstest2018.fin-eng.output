Camille Auer wanted to correct his sex, diagnosis, and now he makes an art of the subject -- "The man should have the right to his own body."
Decades of patients reports from the shooting project room gallery.
Each of them reads Cam's name.
The papers tell a multiannual history of how foreign people have written their comments from Auer and this identity.
They have decided who he is.
"I would like to tell someone about my history of treatment so that the violence of the process should be visible," says Auer.
He's referring to the sexual correction process.
It is often a sustainable study period with physicians, psychiatrists, physicians and physicians.
The process is starting in the diagnostic studies carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
The process was started four years ago.
He had already used through the Internet to place strogen and, however, was very long in his own correction process.
He tried to be a woman, but, according to the Finnish law, a person must be passed through the correction process so that sex may be corrected legally.
Translation, or transsequent transsequently establishment of the sex (563/2002), is obligation to transsome people to pack up so that the right sex is obtained, for example, towards the population recruitment and pass.
Clearly, each sexually correction requires psychiatric diagnostics and a proof increased deficiency.
People have the right to decide on their own body.
"This situation is insensitive and harmful of human rights," says Auer.
Translai has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The United Nations Human Rights Council has given eight comments, and the European Court of Human Rights has a predecision to bind the parts of the European Convention on Human Rights to comply with the self-determination rights.
The Finnish previous government has prepared law on amendment by the leader of the Social and Health Minister Susanne Huovise.
They came to the government and the fundamental Somalias.
Now, the change of law is back in the depth.
This is about internal political disputes that have not even been involved in this law.
"The issue does not want to spend it to the table, because the government has differences in change of law," says the director of the Finnish Division Frank Johansson.
The front part of the display is controlled by two large installations.
Another of these is the packaging and use of Auer’s medicines.
In patients reporting, each event can read, for example, from Auer’s psicological transpolie of the University of Tampere’s university.
Psycology met Cam to Auer twice and wrote a report that should be defined by Auer’s right treatment and help.
The reality of the research seems to be seen as a shock.
The consideration of the investigation itself appears in a manner of limited status, as a delicate and personality, is highlighted.
Auer didn't recognize himself of these descriptions.
"I was angry to hear that I was diagnosed as a mental illness," Auer says.
Another more confusion was when Auer was not granted to sexual correction.
According to the treatment personnel, his power was not sufficient to initiate the process.
He was forbidden by his own identity.
Then, 11 February 2015, Auer walked out to meet and shooted a transpoli's waiting television in the shock.
Later, from that television, the art theme was named Monument for the Excluded, where Auer reflects his experience of power and use.
"I'm awesome that every person defined as a woman can enhance its strike, but the removal of the rain requires diagnosis", says Auer.
Your body is not your own, if you try to be other than the amount of your generation defined in the birth.
Unfortunately, the experience of the sun is not the only quality.
The sexual correction process is for many more painful reasons than because of clean medical operations.
They will meet ten people who have to be found on their own existence and have the right to go on their sex work.
"I'm awesome that people who are helping and helping in need are being treated so that they do not have sufficient power to their power", says Auer.
Many of the processes have psychological symptoms: depression, disorder, possible relief tests.
In these substances, treatment may not be initiated.
"The prevention of treatment and assistance can eat humans to the worst situation than it was before the process started," Auer says.
The own show of the Sun also treats pain and thoughts of self-mortality.
Auer's exhibition text writes: "I have had selfish thoughts throughout my age and it's what people are usually hard to smell."
The masensis has been treated in medicines and when Auer began to use hormones, the condition was easy.
He was finally able to say the knowledge that had been already in the child and the teenage.
The reason why the wide shoes did not feel appropriate to their own body, and why the skin of the meats came to be slept instead of the skin.
The main thing to Auer was that he was close to people who see him.
It's a basic need to find out.
"It's got to be based on such a lot by talking, smoking, using the voice and movement," he says.
Today, Auer has experienced the future, and she is a woman.
However, at the beginning of the process, nearly hundreds of comments could have caused a lot of damage.
Most of all it hurts when closers of false defenses.
"They should know and they know who I am, but not agree or can't enter it," he continues.
However, all transisms do not want physical changes.
They do not suffer from physicians, such as body or parts of their body may cause pain and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and long study process cannot be officially confirmed by their own sex.
"These studies have no medical grounds," Auer says.
And it's true.
For example, in Denmark, in June 2014, the new procedure adopted for recognition of the judicial sex.
The new legislation is based on self-determination rights on the sex of the courts.
The full-year-old applicant makes a new request for a new personality, telling it his experience of being another sex.
After a period of consideration, the applicant confirms its application in writing and the Ministry gives the applicant a new personal identity.
This self-determination right is also required in Finland and is also grateful for the presentation of the Auer.
It has not been an artist's trial of therapy, but the exhibition is a political and artistic workshop.
I want to believe that art has still a weight and that it can make political changes during the time that policies have forgotten human rights.
Camille Auer's exhibition Antiphallic Dick 4.-28.7.2017 in the project idea accumulation in Room.
The National Rights Organization gave a passenger warning to Missouri
The African national NAACP citizens' rights movement organization has given Missouri a travel warning because they have disrupted practices and racist attacks there.
"Assing information on the NAACP is in force on 28.8.2017, and it is called for African tourists, visitors and local visitors to take particular attention and to respect the extreme care when travelling in the State where a number of events based on this race has recently been held", the organization is informed.
In Missour, the Law has made it difficult to export discrimination cases, and in addition, the implementation of the State law is relatively reduced. According to the NAACP, these aspects caused the delivery of travel warning.
"The human citizens' rights are blessed.
They are stopped on the basis of the skin color, and they are shocked or killed,” the NAACP President Rod Chapel stated to the Kansas City Star magazine.
"We haven't heard about a lot of cases in the same short time."
Missouri is the first warning of the United States of the United States.
The system mentioned, for example, the racist comments submitted against African students at the Missour University and from Tennessee to death of the 28-year-old black Tory Sanders.
Sanders died in the situations of this year, and he was driving through the state when his car ended the fuel, and the police arrested him, although he was not accused of a crime.
The travel information also refers to the Minister of Justice of Missour to which the police stops 75 per cent of the black driver is probably more likely than the white.
"The purpose of the information is to encourage people to be careful and to warn their tradition, friends and working partners to what can happen in Missour," said Chapel.
"The people must be prepared, for example, by taking money for payment of taxes or by telling their parents that they are planning to travel through the State."
According to the FBI, hundreds of vineyards were recorded in Missour in 2015, or one of the 16 most of the United States.
Travel warning is also a response to the new Missour Act, which is difficult to strive to struggle enterprises with the right to submit and working relations with discrimination.
The ACLU organization, which guarantees the fundamental rights of civil rights, recently provided travel warnings in Texas and Arizona after accepting immigration laws which are able to arrest the police of immigration agreements.
In general, travel warnings are published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other States, but recently, citizens organizations have been published as a response to certain laws and development plans in the United States.
General: Lithuania requested a report of the Additional Report of the Director
For the purposes of this Regulation, the Court of First Instance, the Commission, the Commission, the Commission, the Commission, the Commission, the Commission, the Commission, the Council, the Council, the Council, the Council, the Council, the Council, the Council, the Council, the European Parliament and the Council.
According to the Minister, it is conflicting with the State's will.
The additional rate of EUR 130,000 in this week, when Helsinki reported that the payment development of the leading companys was increased.
Finnish graphic news from Vauramo's Additional Letter in February.
Finnair reported that it was delayed by additional items in 2013.
The State has lined out that the additional items are not used for payment.
The government belongs to Finnaire over half.
According to the company, the decision is on line with the principle decision on the ownership of the last year.
Packages accepted the speech immediately
Another time ago, it seemed that the relationship between the United States and Russia is on the fridge.
The President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who met with the G20 industry meeting in Hampur, showed the future report.
This is why the tunnel has remained significantly.
In the last week of the United States congress and in the midweek of Trump, the new economic positions signed in Russia were sweetly reacted.
Another answer has been heard by the Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedevi, which states that the compulsory law signed by Trump means "complete trade war".
Although Russian reactions would only be referred to as a strict and overwhelming political restriction, the clergy between the United States and Russia is the fact that the election of Trump is a short month after the election of Trump.
In the United States, there was no simply transit of the compulsory law on Russia, Iran and North Korea.
Indeed, the Congress adopted a considerable harmonization of the law, but the adoption of the law to the President was significantly more difficult.
Trump also criticizes its signing of the Law "the lack of significance".
Mr President Trump has been particularly reasonable for the race of the Russians, although the adoption of the restricted law had to be opposed.
As well known in the United States, the Russian investigation is used as far as possible for the presidency of the Presidentships as well as the Russian contacts of the Trump campaign.
The clergy between the United States and Russia is true after a short month of torment.
When the White House's staff has changed to the strange and different scandale translations have been made to update, it is still clear that the foreign policy is not in the United States, but the President.
This situation is not expected in any of the names.
If Russia's relationship is a chemical in the United States, it is also the same as the European Union.
In addition to economic packaging, your security situation in the Union's nuclear zone was also encouraging the relationships expressed in the Eastern Sea.
The EU has apparently shown the situation of Ukraine in its Russian relations and requested the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has continued to remain in Russian policy at least the main part of the one, the attractions of the Member States are particularly different.
The economic packages, such as the Finnish, have been real.
The effects of the United States shipping law are still doubtful.
The EU has feared that the packages will be difficult for many European enterprises.
Finnish effects may, for example, feel in the North Stream 2-based gas project as well as in the possible Fenno-Fenno-Fenno force project.
The disappearance in Europe has caused the abandonation of fleet outside, for example, to the United States economy of an important liquid landgase ng.
Trade packages are a way in the world policy to demonstrate a bad way.
However, economic responsibilities must be a very consideration and attentive.
Otherwise, it is easy to handle more than benefits.
Isn't there anymore holy?
Trump in the white house has now a star of freedom
The lack of funds is a certain sign of the revolution.
Americans know it as well as others: the Iraqi people slaughtered with the American soldiers in Saddam Hussein at the opening of Firdon in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the main ideas of Trump's administration, knew well what was done in a slight statement with the CNN-channel Jim Acost. The freedomspause was the subject of Miller's attack in the sight of Miller's word, which slowly reduced legal immigration.
Miller, you don't appreciate yourself.
If he would have done so, he would have obtained the magnificent bands of the organizers of the Risk and the exciting of the Liberty.
His aggression target was to be shocked, and especially that in 1903, Emma Lazarus was added to his feet from 17 years after the preparation of the patsake.
This is what Miller said, "I don't want to go to his history, but the Liberty Pats is the symbol of the world's lighting American freedom.
Runo was later added, and it does not belong to the original Liberty Passage."
Miller wasn't wrong with you, but it's not just the story, as he himself said.
Only the words concerning Lazarus, the only quality in which the State does not call only immigrants but also "the poorest poorest": "Your tired, your poor, / Your hudded mass yearning to breathe free, / The wretched rejection of your theme shore."
Runo is more time than ever.
Miller did not have a literature criteria, and he made clear that "the poorests" are not welcome to the United States of Trump.
The importance of freedom is part of a broader political and cultural aspect of the importance of the United States.
Lazarus’s friends were camping after his death in order to be shocked in their feet, and they knew that the work was strongly political.
Patsa was the purpose of expressing contacts with the French and American Republic in classic comparison, women’s body of freedom.
Lazarus changed its significance: the nashihamm in his wheel is no longer abstract, but the voice of it.
And it gives himself a new name: the fleet mother.
The inclusion of the ruin was a nervous feministic revolution and a devastating attack against the American nationality.
Lazarus changed the significance of the throat, and the right has already wanted to change it back to the original.
Rush Limbaugh, a designer that can now be considered as a sign of Trump, said in 2010 that the freedom of freedom is not a call to anyone but is the preceding driver of new conservators who brings the United States to shoot the world with the darkness: "Lady Liberty is on the way.
He's bringing the freedom from the United States to the other world.
It doesn't look like a way to the United States."
I'm sorry, Limbaugh was in the right part.
The significance of freedom depends completely on the view.
Lazarus saw it as the poor and shocked, but the hopeless immigrants were on the side of the ship to be long and tried after the trip.
He saw the protection and the better life of people.
His freedom is comforted by giving hope and hope to be welcome.
And Miller and Trump aren't going to want any case.
They do not seem to be the way, but sweet the smilings of hair, their only source of power.
Surrounding MM competitive 2017: Neil Black overcome the skotlanian members of the skotlanian team
Illidh Doyle remembers the time when only two scotts reached the Ison-Brittanian country team
The resulting director of the Britannic Sport Agency, Neil Black, says that 16 scotic members participating in the world's majorities are "a strongness".
Thursday, in London, the MM competitors of general sport have been selected for skotlane sports.
Black says that "I'm going to happen a particular thing," which the general sport of the United Kingdom must learn.
"This is healthy, and we will continue to investigate it so long as we understand what the question is," says Black.
"I discussed with representatives of the Scotia Sport Institute, and they believed that it was involved in the operation of the institution.
Skotland's general sportunion reiterates that it is involved in the activities of the Agreement,
and the United States of the United Kingdom believes that it has their activities.
And the normal ruder believes that he must have something to do with this.
But there's something quite magnificent to what it's then caused."
Many scot Sports competite in London in reality, Laura Mur, and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farrah at 50,000 meters. Ilidh Doyle was chosen as a capital of the country.
"Elidh is unrequisite.
His captain's speech was unbelievable," Black says.
"Organists have been removed from the opportunity of proudly achievement and strongly motivated, unless they live and practice.
I've said Ilidh had true feeling and intoxicating the sport."
Illidh Doyle is a golden counterparty of the United Nations community at 400 meters per year, and these are his fifth world-wide competition. He thinks that it is "incomprehensible," that it has 16 skots in the country.
The previous spectrum was seven years from 1983 and 2015.
The Middle East drinker Laura Mur has been drinking for five years in Ison-Brittan and two European specimens.
He's competitive in London at 1,500 meters and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare walks in London at 1,500 meters, and also supports him with the eye: a man has a great time of winning in the British MM-carsines and Anniversary Games.
Doyle recalls his first world mastership, where the only skoke to the country was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the world is saying that there are so many scotts that are really competitive with their finances and metalls.
"The access is, however, great honor, but more specially it is because the members of the country team have voted to the Captain," says Doyle.
"I'm certainly very proud of all the skots that have come to the country team.
It shows how long we've been.
They are able to come together as sports that competite for rewards.
Captain's talk?
I think it's all right.
I thought how happy we were when we had homes.
It is important to enjoy the support of the household and that we are again in the Olympic Stadiums.
I'll get another opportunity to competite there and I know that the air clouds will be an implicit wonder."
Prevention of reviewers in Facebook: Don't be set to the public office if you don't be critical
Our country knew what's bad publicity.
Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers immediately began to appreciate him from all possible homes of political principles always to his political principles.
I'm sure that the criticism was a doctor.
But he didn't quit his appreciationers.
"If the freedom of speech is removed, we will be able to lead as empty and silent as sheep to torment", said Washington in 1783.
We also come to the head of Maryland to Larry Hogan, who should learn about Washington.
Hogan's staff has removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and prevented them.
The United States Citizens' Rights Alliance has devastated Hogan's right this week ago.
His staff is not based on the challenges, and the relationship was also reduced in the network.
"What's the matter? It's just Facebook." Many comments.
But there's a meaning in this matter.
Especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is a surprising representative of the Democratic State.
He's got the second best awareness of the 50-leading of his work.
Hogan isn't reacting to the hot.
He has been stablely conducted by the State and had strictly observed the principles.
He has also used the Facebook as the main contact channel of its voters and published the image in the chemotherapy.
Therefore, preventing users on the Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The general's page is a public and official forum that supports its staff with taxes.
Amelia Chasse, a reporter of the Hogan, defended the office of the Secretary at Washington Post's discussion, and he said that it was only about the comments of moderation.
However, it is too easy for comments to be tropical, swimming or hatred.
Washington Post discussed Hogan's Facebook users.
They proved to be normal people who wanted to discuss with the leaders of their choice, not trolley, but were, for example, teachers, attempters and pastors.
They told them that their comments were respectful, appreciative and interesting.
The shepherd read his comments in the Bible, and he wanted to take Hogan’s Catholic faith.
The questionnaire Lakshmi Sarma Ramani Maryland's Bowie was not enemy but asked about the winners.
"I was deceived by the committee that Hogan didn't have taken up to wine and other recent news", he wrote in the comments of Washington Post.
"I can't also accept that when more people comment on the same matter, they are immediately considered as an organised group and are set up as a large group of citizens concerned."
The Director's staff called comments "concentration of attacks" and someone else could call them to promote important matters.
It is easy to control in the Facebook period by preventing or removeing critical comments.
Before the old man, he had to send the staff to collect and smoke a newspaper that had been published in critical statements, or to arrest and detente the publishers.
However, it is really the same matter, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first public officer who was accused of defeating the Facebook and other social media channels.
The President Trump's Twitter users have seen him in the right.
The first important decision was given in Virginia last week.
According to the Court of Justice of Alexander James C. Cacheris, the Government of Loudoun has violated the first addition of the United States Constitution by preventing a voter in Facebook.
And the United States Citizens Rights Association was discussing the use of the Kentucky Republic of the Republic of the United States with Matt Bevin and Facebook.
This shouldn't be hard.
At Washington’s time, the predominant posts had similar effects as today on the Internet.
The number of newspapers from 1776 to 1800, and the unnamed writers moved to Washington.
It's been a trolley at that time.
The names of the letters Juricola, Valerius, Belizeriaus and Portius were written in the newspapers where they called Washington’s decisions.
The President's office was referred to by Jay's agreement, or between the United States and the United States of Cooperation, Trade and Sea Trade Agreement, which is reported on the documents of the George Washington Network project.
However, he did not silence his appreciatives.
Freedom of the Word, freedom of opinion and freedom of debate are fundamental.
The real leadership means accepting this fact.
Sounds of birds are a reason to stop right now.
The samples have come from about ten places, and also net notifications from the couple, three.
It has not been part of the Summit of South and Varsinais, but then individuals from Haapaved and Sieneja, specialist Marja Isomursu Evir.
Vierpeipot died for tricommonosis.
It causes scientist named Trichomonas gallinae.
It has previously been known to skins, and especially to the skin.
However, in the centuries of the 2000s, the diseases also began to be observed of pelipoleans.
In 2009, it was a good deal.
Then tricomonis was caused by the Finnish viar pocket of cycling, after which the species had been shocked down.
The sickness has now been, but not at least in a mystery, Helsinki University’s Natural Center Museum (Luomus) tells the museum Juha Honkala.
It is fearable that the previous epidemic of skins will be renewed if something is done.
What we need to do now is a very simple thing that can do every one: stop the sunfall of birds immediately.
Add the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes his benefit from home-basing in Renaissance Club
The former European Countries, Ronan Rafferty, hopes to benefit his home-based benefit for the next three days when Renaissance Club in Eastern Lothian is organizing 25th Skotlanian senior Open tour.
The Northern Law Rafferty led the past year in Archerfield Links in the neighborhood before the last round, but finally lost Paul Eales. Rafferty has been pleased in the new place and operates a tour for the founder of the club and director Jerry Sarvad.
"I observed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and after this event, it will be filled with its glory," Rafferty says.
"It's all right.
Jerry has done a great job with this place.
He's a joyful shipment, and he's proud of his dose here.
Turnance is a great state of presentation in this field."
The English Eaux is the first time to defend masterity, although it has been able to gain a 32-year-old urge as well as to the European and European disadvantage period.
"This is really a particular opportunity," says the player in Southport.
"I'm not allowed to defend my victory of Extremadura Open, because the tour does not belong to the round this year.
It's great to come back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Remembers have come back in the last few years: the shift was wonderful to me and my wife Sharon.
It was a great time we will always remember."
Gary Orr returns to the real work in his land, and he went to the rounds preceding 50 years ago.
This is his first event in Skotlandia since 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scotish Open tour.
"To play collected is always the most common one," says Orr, who lives in Helensburg.
"You want to succeed but you're also feeling more pressure.
I enjoyed playing again and playing time strongly.
"I'm satisfied with my game until now."
Third to follow the field of former Masters, Ian Woosnamin, and senior major tourists, Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
The tournate is six scotts: Orr and former captain Ryder Cup, Sam Torrance, and Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAlister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The car stopping is paying five pounds if there is only a driver, and ten pounds if there are at least two people in the car.
All the products are gifted to the UK Prostate Cancer Organization.
In the sample, the possible internal climate problems were identified.
In the sleeves of Pori prikate, the construction of the carriage company of the Communication Company has not been found at least one of the internal problems found, the pricks were reported in the tours.
The internal studies continue to be investigated.
The explanations began when a man stopped the health caused the care of his insurance because of the bad inner of the carpet.
According to Mika Holman, President-in-Office of the Forcessariat, there has not been any problems found in the health situation of other insurances.
It appeared that there was an individual status in this case, and other serviceers had no health problems.
Each report is seriously addressed and we wanted to develop this.
There's no information at this time that we have nothing in the internal problem, Holma says.
The precautional information states that, as a result of the arrival of July, the fishermen had to be transferred to the goods, so that the polarity has been able to be in a moment.
The air has been able to affect the skin, Holma says.
Poverty and death in Indonesian golden country
Bardina Degei doesn't use it in the food plant.
Even when he's cut, he's just useful.
Degei lives in the bottle in Enarotal, the capital of the Pania, located in the Indonesian province of Papua. When he is preparing daily, he generally sets a battle – locally "no" – directly to come.
After an hour later, the battle returned to the cart to eat swimmingly, unclean hands.
There are no rooms in the house of Dege, and he is sit on a different farm where he generally handles his daily steps, such as the nearby snake in the swimming pool in the swimming water.
The department of the age provides an unexpected snake in the room.
Degei is the four of his young husband's wife, and he has not been able to handle the games.
There's a general marriage here.
Labour may be dangerous: most of the villages are unemployed, and many drinks, and the soldiers must also be taken into account.
"No one's going to walk in the village after five nights," Degei says.
This is a rare decline in the tops of Papua, first in the Dutch movement, which was linked to Indonesia in 1969, and a Chinese reputation which was forced to vote for 1 026 village prices before the men's teams.
The Government of Holland has opposed a local self-respect quickly translated its hate to the government of Jakarta, which holds the region strictly in its governance and prevented the access of foreign providers and human rights assistants.
In 2003, the province was officially shared to Papua and the West Papua, and the east part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
Anarotale is distant and trick. The path begins from half an hour to flight from the capital of Jayapur, Province, to Nabir, and continues to swim five hours in the car hill.
There's no public traffic here.
About 19,000 people live in the city, there are wooden trees of bamboods with a swimming sweet smells.
Only rare Indonesians have come here without talking about suppliers and foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, Papua Mee Pago’s descendants worshiped the god of Uga Tamee.
Another change has happened.
"We didn't have such clothes," Degei says. He means a color, sweet hands, darkness, and slightly color.
"After we had just a newspaper in our guards."
Papua is the most poorest province of Indonesia, and 28 per cent of its populations live on the lower border of poverty, and children’s mortality and disorder are the highest of Asia.
But it's also the Indonesian golden country.
The pania is just a hundred miles (30,000) above the top area of New Jersey, with a population of 153,000. The Pania is the largest and most powerful goldcase of the world. It belongs to the Freeport McMoran company, where the home is Phoenix in the United States.
In 2015, the cow was produced to Freeport $3.1 billion from the value of the money and the coat.
Moreover, Papua has estimated 78 billion dollars of wood barriers.
However, these riches of Papua produce corruption, since they mean the shocking presence of the Indonesian army.
New York Times announced in 2005 that Freeport was paying the local military personnel and the military military units for almost $20 million in 1998-2004. The individual officers were even paid for $15,000.
The requirements of a larger self-determination rights threaten this source of income, and they are dealt with mercy.
According to human rights activists, the Indonesian army has killed more than 5000,000 priests and rape, punished and arrested thousands after 1969.
According to the Asian Commission of Human Rights, the tribes of Papua’s neighbouring families in the 1970s have resulted in the measuring proportions of the people's murder.
Last year, Indonesia’s police arrested over 3 900 people in peaceful exhibitions.
In Brisbane Archive Society report, We Will Lose Everything from 2016, there are reports of the statements of the previous year, such as the cases without the court, the complaint – the rape and the electronic companies are specially recommended means – and the regulation of attacks towards peaceful impressions.
"The calculation of the number of news is difficult because cases are last week," says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher of the Human Rights Watch Organization.
The pools have been covered when Papua’s natural resources are shocked from other Indonesians.
83 per cent of the province of 3,5 million people are Christians, but the population structure has changed when the Indonesian cities from Javan, Borneon, Sumatra and Sulawes are changing muslims to the region in hope of the better income of the muslims.
Javaian warning feeds are sold in the grain-gaga-profit record.
The locals are hard to competite.
"News have started to sell shoes and snakes with snakes than locals," says Abeth You, 24-year-old, who is home from Pania and changed in the capital city of Province.
"Time women lost their customers."
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo – his favorite Jokowi – allowed the lack of the injustices of Papua and human rights rape in 2014.
Papua consists of 29 regions, and this former forest wins a vote in 27 regions, including in Pania, traveling to the President of Jakarta.
But just a little has changed in Papua, and locals feel their arrival as a pleasant.
"We were shocked because we voted Jokowi in 2014 and we expected that he would fill our hopes and restore justice," you say.
The panies were tested only two months after the Western officials of Jokow.
The 11 children were sing of Christmas songs from Enarotal in Enarotal 7.12.2014, when the dark appeared from two Indonesian soldiers in motorcycles.
The scared kids told the soldiers that they should use driving lights.
One of the other wars had no comment, and the local pastor Yavedt Teba said that the man returned to the place with four soldiers.
According to the reports of the victims and the Witnesses, the soldiers slaughtered the children and slaughtered them in the slaughter.
So one of the wars shot the kids.
One of the 16-year-old children, Yulianus Jaimo, triggered the result of the painful depression.
A couple of hours later, the building of the government’s visa rail was established, and on the next day the event began.
About thousands of priests — young men and women and children — gathered together with a football toward the local police office and the military headquarter to require justice.

"We must defend when people are threatening to kill us," Padjo Sulistayo reported in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to the Human Rights Watch Organization, five young men were killed, and many were blessed.
The information about the murder took place on Jakara on the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi felt a conversation in Jayapur in which he expressed his parts to the families of victims and promised that Papua’s violence would be defeated.
"I wish the case will be immediately investigated so that it will never happen anymore."
In October 2016, Vianto, Minister of Security, said that he would start the conclusions of human rights crimes outside the legal system.
However, she began to get back to his conversation immediately.

He's still telling his life in fear, even though it's been a year ago.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I think the army's arresting me, I'm afraid we're gonna shoot me."
His brother Jacob confirms that the panians are not slow to discuss the event.
He tells me that the soldiers were worse to him when he helped to beat four victims.
"The soldiers are looking for me after the burning of the victims," he says.
The teams haven't finished.
In the meantime, Indonesian police shot villages in the Neighbourhood of Pania in Deiya.
One died and 17 was blessed between the leader of the villages and the construction company, which was starting when the leader refused to lose the hospital of a man.
He was 24-year-old Ravianus Dow, who was shocked by water when he was shooting in a nearby fishing area.
The hatred villages would like to be addressed in the construction country in front of the company's office.

Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), the rebellian army who defends the rights of the paapians in harmony attacks and in the struggles of the Indonesian army.
Some of the leaders of OPM are Pania, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.

Among the Papuaians, Pania is known as "smile, forgotten place".
Poverty eats unpleasantness.
There's only a little bit to sell in the economist, and it's too expensive to locals,
It's like a bread.
People grow their own food: in most cases battles and some of the fruits and lenses.
There are women's work, and one woman's responsibility may have four or five battle games.
The majority of the hundreds are to the family, and the ends are sold on the store.
10 battles are paying only 10 000 rupias (75 cents).
The differences in local and variable income have grown, and the number of changers have grown after opening new routes to the Nabire airport.

"The people don't want to stay in the village because there's no work and no money here," says President John Gobai, President of the Panya's home Council.
The disadvantaged Papua remains in the world with little attention.
Furthermore, the restrictions on international newspapers are still strict.
Preceding this year, French suppliers Franck Escudue and Basille Longchamp were disfellowshipped by Papuel, although they had been granted a rare description freedom.
According to Phelim Kne, President of the Human Rights Watch Organization, Jokowi has not had the freedom of warning, and he has not increased transparency and did not promote development by removing the limitations of the news.
"Indonesian unproliferated provinces from Papua and Western Papua news provides new risks: the extinction of the visa and the black list." Kine stated in its opinion.
The lack of the freedom of activity of the newspaper means that the Indonesian government only pressures the nearby Papua.
In March, six of the Pacific State — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Saars and Solomon Sacred – encouraged the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate the “breaks and wide crimes”, including the attack of Pania.
These States have also supported the freedom of Papua.
Arrmanatha Nasir, an Indonesian Foreign Minister, reaffirmed the accusions and reported to the employees in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of newspapers, so the fact that the evidence of human rights offences would be difficult."

"Another means good, but there are people around him who have been cut off to Pania's shoot," says President Gobai's home Council.
He wants Jokowin to know the situation of panians: they live under the low and unreasoned army in the lack of and in poverty, in practically low health care services and educational opportunities.
According to Goba, panians, like other papians, believe Jokow's voice as "privileges", which must be paid back.
"They don't want money, they just want the right." He says.
Despite threats and fears, the victims of the victims of Pania reacted again with comparison: they entered one victim against the country of the police and the army stations.
They know that they may never have the right, but at least they don't let the responsibilities forget their crimes.
"My family members were killed," Jacobus says in the press.
"What else can we do?"
Dereck Chisora shouted about the breakdown of the Robert Helena's renewal: "If the own fans don't want to see."
Robert Helenius and Dereck Chissoran, a pregnant series of pregnants, were intended to take place in the Hartwall Area on May 27th.
However, the battle was cut off for commercial reasons.
Chisora is driving in the IFL TV conversation for the reason why it is to flee fully to Helenius's hearts in the IFL TV.
My battle in Finland flew, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finnish, I don't want to sell bands there.
Because he was my Finnish opposer.
Before his fans, they don't want to see him taking, because he's crazy, Chisora's kidding.
Helenaus and Chisora first met in the Hartwall Area in December 2011.
Helenaus wins the battle with a shocked shock court.
The library of the renewal was shocked, and his promotor Nisse Sauerland reported to the night-zanomy in May that the fight has been moved to the syxy.
There's no new part of the battle.
However, the corruption of Chisor is no longer harmful.
The fight would, of course, be held to eliminate any case in Chisor's disease.
Torstaina, three days prior to the battle date, I was raised in pain.
My tiny was on the explosion.
In the hospital, it was said to have to smell me, Chisora tells me.
The UK's telling it's now about 45% of it.
It is not all about the interesting revision with Helenus, but the star is Dillia Whyte.
Chisora suffered for the death of him in December.
I came to repeat your government in Duba
In Duba's Sunday, the largest residential building in the world had been able to run 337 meters from the higher 79-century building.
This was already another fireball within two years of the building, a name that is to be a Torch.
The structure was empty, and no knowledge was blessed, and there was no reason for the fact that there was no idea immediately after the event.
"We were sleeping and we washed up with the voice of the fire and the crystal of people.
We're going down from the 50th section, which took ten minutes, ” said Reuters.
According to the Dubane Saviation Authorities, the slaughter teams received the fire shooting in four mornings and left the building.
The government reported to those who left their homes to organize their mastership.
The meeting can reverse questions about the security of materials that are used in the outside of high buildings in different parts of the world.
The Directorate-General of the Torch Building conducted an investigation after 2015, in which it found that the majority of the damages suffered from publicity and the disadvantaged disks used.
In Britain, the police believes that London Grenfell Tower was able to promote the rapid expansion of the pool in the fire, where 80 people died in June.
The Jeansuulair park place was stolen during the mopo night.
From the Jeensuulatic parking area, the mopo was stored between 21 and 21.00 p.m. and the average week of 5 p.m.
Mopo lost the same address from the Eclipsis 2.
Mopo was called Sky Team Monkey.
It's red, and the register is 27-REV.

In the United States more than 20% of the aircraft passengers take the prohibited objects in the machine, the questionnaire investigation shows
A flight survey shows that more than 20% of the passengers in the United States had been prohibited by information or without any information on the United States Transport Security Agency (TSA) control points. At least six per cent passengers had vehicles or other materials that they knew were not prohibited.
Not only one percent reported to their receipt that they were wrong to carry out weapons, ammunitions or explosions.
I answered more than thousands of passengers, and it implemented Stratos Jet Charters state company. The results also reveal that young passengers threaten other rules likely.
The TSA rules informally disrupted 19.7 per cent of passengers were representatives of the Y-school generation and less than 15 per cent of the X-school generation.
In general, the rules were crimed by bringing food and liquids to the airport.
More than three per cent of the farmed materials are informedly on the aircraft, and 2,2 per cent of women and 3,7 per cent of men reported their prohibited drugs to the aircraft.
The question of travellers from different parts of the United States was that the company carried out wanted to figure out how many of them had been carried out in a harmful security check and how many have done so informally.
It is not surprising that most passengers also have a secret transport resource likely to end up the security check — informally or without knowing.
But as a questionnaire states, the TSA's guidelines are especially complicated and incredible.
Travellers often don't know what liquids to take on the airport and how much.
As a result, it is not surprised that the largest part of the TSA’s back stocks are liquids.
Sometimes there was a power to believe that the airport could not take books to the aircraft.
They can get home to flights, but not to international flights.
Scott Pruitt, Director of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, decided to decrease emissions in the period of Obama
Thus, after 15 States have dismissed the EPA Director of the EPA Environmental Protection Agency, the Pruitt has revoked its previous decision to reduce the emissions of emissions in the Obama government period.
According to the PV, the change shows that the Agency of its leaders takes better into account the needs of decision-makers that respond to the environmental matters of States.
The Pruitt did not mention a sentence against his previous decision in the Court of Auditors.
Some States should begin to comply with the requirement of 2015 on the race of the earth from the beginning of 1.10.
In June, Pruitt reported that he would transfer decisions for the next year so that his Agency has more time to be made to the plan, as the Agency “does not want to miss local decision or to defeat the economic growth”.
The Pruitt was a general accusal of the Oklahoma State, before President Donald Trump appointed him as the director of the EPA, and the Pruits are known as a more strict of environmental rules.
After his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has twice tried to prevent or reduce chemicality and fossil fuel decisions on the opposition of industrial sectors.
The recent change of mind in the middle week is the last part of the Pruit plan to apply the provisions.
In the last month, the Court of Auditors of the Union in Washington adopted a decision which the Director of the EPA had overlooked its Governments in trying to delay the decision of the Obama government on oil and gas companies, and the decision imposed the companys to monitor and reduce the methane years.
In the second weeks' opinion, the Pruitt stated that its full translation was only strengthening the cooperation of the EPA with the States in a complicated process aimed at satisfying new requirements in accordance with the timetable.
"In the previous governments, EPA has often failed to comply with the deadlines, and then expected that the active groups and others are in the right to engage in the timetables of the Agreement", said Pruitt.
"We don't believe that the regulations that happens through the courts and we are seriously addressed to terms.
We are also seriously addressed to the regulation on our activities and to our Finnish powers."
However, in the EPA's opinion, the Pruitt could continue to use "involve its powers to reduce the impact of decisions as well as other legal powers" to ensure that the provisions are "based and based on the best available information".
The Republics are going on in the Congress on a more broader change in my holding rules.
The last month's legislative instrument aims to delay the action of decisions in 2015 at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted in the senate.
In this week of EPA, the general accuser Eric Schneiderman of the State of New York, who has led to the rule of law, told that the group will continue to press.
"The change of the EPA is the consequence of the winning of 6,7 million New Yorkians and more than 115 million Americans that are exacerbated in the community,” said Sneiderman.
In addition to New York, there were meetings in California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and district of Colombia.
The earth’s title, for example, was reacted to the aircraft in cars, power institutions, oil-based emissions and the emissions of chemicals.
This is also a part of thousands of years in previous deaths.
The national health providers and environmental protectionists welcomed the surprising project change of Pruit.
"I'm worried about how much pressure was required to use health reasons to our breathing boy", says Lori Ann Burd Biological diversity.
"We have to fight against Trump's governance, as its ideological goal is to operate in the conditions of the constraints and other groups of timely groups."
The Super-Agent Manufacturer arrived in the shooter. "It's happening in the Ferrari style."
It also intends to put the hybrid sports in the same way that it is trying to maintain its exclusive position.
This seems likely to happen, but it happens in Ferrari's style, the Vice-Chairman Sergio Margine said about the planned information in the middle week.
The details of the new strategy will be shown next year when the Italian super-auditor presents its new five-year plan, Automotive News News.

The manufacture should continue to occur in the fact that raw substances or aromatic substances that have been born in connection with their visit are clearly discovered.
According to the new law, drinks can make themselves as much as you want, and selfish alcohol can be a gift.
It's still not possible to make it up.
The smooth work is no longer a public health problem in Finland, it believes in producing.
The increased change occurred in 2004 when traveling imports from Viro and other EU countries were released.
75% of the use of alcohol in Finland are imported from Viro.
The Alcohol Act is now to be reviewed by the Ministry of Justice.
The Alcohol Act will be treated immediately when your accusation begins.

The law has been well prepared.
It's like the committee had already been taking a stand, it's a joy.

Literoid phone discussions show the pressure of the Trump to build the border wall
The literature of telephone discussions between the President of the United States Donald Trump and Mexico and the Australian leaders of the United States has taken place in Washington Post.
Trump invited President Enrique Peña Neoa at the telephone debate on 27 January 2017 to stop his public talk that he would not pay the proposed border wall.

Georgia blood finding: Aktivists will renew racist lynk in hope
Ford Mercury's car takes a population team in the small town of Monroe in Georgia and continues to travel to a small town of Moore's Ford.
There are four black drivers in the car and a white driver, four armed men shooted the way before the car goes there.
Somebody's chief, a medium-year-old man takes a deep life from his sigaret and strikes through the winter.
The passengers are scared.
"Roger, no-u!" The man's awesome.
Get out of the car!
Sounds break silence when a young black man gets out of the front.
This awesome event is only a re-examination proposed by 22.7.2017.
However, the disorders of the smoke are the realities when the shock is shocked to the "Roger".
Since 2005, human rights organisations have returned to Moore's Ford to re-establish the events in 1946. Then, Ku Klux Klan had two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom, and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
There's no one in charge of murder.
"I'm awesome that no one has been arrested in these years - although the murderers live among us and many have to know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who helps re-related arrangements.
"It's the horrible power of the history, but first, it's a strike that pressures our soul."
Brooks is a 71-year-old citizen rights activist and former Georgia Congress Deputy.
It also reminds the people of Monroe that wickedness has never been corrected.
"We want the guilty to come to the right, and we want that things are finally made a decision, and we want to smile, and we want to agree, but mostly we want the right," says Brooks.
"We can't join and make a reason before we get the right."
Dead investigators guard the victim's victim's 27.7.1946 blood in Georgia.
According to the NBC news documents, more than 50 men were suspected of the shortcut from Monroe and about the environmental circumstance.
But no one was accused of murder.
Although the accused persons have been free for decades, activists say that the reasons for lying have been in the whole time in local information: policy and sex.
In 1946, the neighbors of the Georgia State received the decision to vote on the first time in the presidency, and the High Law adopted its decision in April and the laws were held in the summer.
According to the FBI, there was a interruption in which a black farmer Roger Malcom missed white landowner Barnett Hester's battle that apparently cooked Malcom's wife Dorothya.
Brooks reported that Hester had a relationship with Dorothy and that Dorothy was waiting for this child.
According to the FBI information, an influential white earthquake Loy Harrison estimated $6,7.1946 Malcom's $600, which had been released from prison.
At the home, Malcom and Dorothy were their chief Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The little team stopped their car before Moore's Ford was shocked.
"I saw Harris's status and ordered the murders." The FBI reported.
"I also indicate that between the State and the local authorities were secret, and the authorities were part of murders and lost evidence and have not discovered the personality of the Witnesses."
Brooks shows that it's better.
"It was a vocabulary murder," he says.
"They were murdered, because the blackmans were wanted to report to them that if they wanted to vote."
Cassandra Greene has controlled the redistribution of Georgia's blood invasion for about ten years.
It is extremely realistic and imprisoning, and it is a descriptive of the race that many want to believe that they are already lost from the United States today.
It is hard to see but is still more difficult to see what Greene says.
"We don't want to talk about the slowness, because we should have met our dark sides," says the director.
"But I can't create a relationship with you if you don't hear me or you don't want to hear what I have been trying to experience."
In June, the practices of this year began, and the first day, about 30 demonstrators — a ten - black and a couple of whites — were gathered to listen to the slaughtered green.
Wade Marbaugh works as a Greene Aviation Chief.
He has presented the local leader of Ku Klux Klan for years, but the role is always as difficult and contrary.
"It's a bad condition, because I'm not my own." Marbaugh says.
"But it is important that the half of this story is being considered in order to never again."
On the other side of his dialogue, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester.
The story starts with Malcom's smiling and my sweet Hester, and he's laughing that Hester had a relationship with Dorothy.
I said, "You didn't hear?" I said, "I'm out of my mail."
Rascona is Hester.
Then let's go to the shooting.
And then all of them (also all black spectacles) are smiling in a smile.
Greene smile.
"What?" Rascona asks.
He's smelling.
"Have I been too excited in harm?" he asked.
"It's," Greene slows.
"I just don't believe that the whites used then the word n-u."
"Yes," the other black shower confirms.
"It's a slang, you need to use the lower version."
The issue of the presentation is unpleasant, but the room will control a friend's body.
Everyone wants to succeed, not only because of the statement, but they want to respect the memories of their murderers.
It's starting from the start.
Now, Rascona's words are weakening.
Nobody's smiling.
The re-examination ends quickly and violently.
Strikes, shocks... and silence.
Another shooting woman stands next to the body and sing Billie Holiday Strange Fruit.
His voice is smelling every other word.
A few ten meters away from twenty-five watchers shock their eyes with shoes and skins.
Of course, almost half of the level is black and white.
There is a couple that has come to see the presentation of the New York State, but most of them are local.
They've been in Brooks' instruction in the skins of the victims in Georgia’s painful coast.
The murders have changed the story to reality.
After the song, Greene calls the people's team to check the bodies.
Childs are able to look at the beauty and unmovable body and to smell each other.
"They aren't really dead," a little boy thinks like to remember himself.
A few minutes after Greene thanks the public.
The showers presented by the Lynncans strike up their references and smell the cylinders.
Bradshaw likes Marbaugh, the local President of Ku Klux Klan.
Nick Rascona has two showers, and then he was shocked after a French presentation.
"No, it's okay," a woman has been comforting.
"We know that you're not her.
You did this good reason."
Afterwards, the public and the showers are gathering together at night.
The white couple who arrived from the altar is discussing a very careful discussion with a black couple.
Denise Duplinsk is difficult to find words when he describes the knowledge of the presentation.
"I'm hard to listen to smell words and to look at the things that say and do people that look like you – just because they look like you," he says.
"I'm noting that the slows are still happening," he added. "It's just called arrests."
On the other side, Brooks reminds the development of citizen rights in the same table to hearers.
He's already talking about the planning of the next year.
"Re-examination is a powerful experience because it describes the fears we have experienced, but it is also a teaching experience," says Brooks.
"The message is that this can happen again if we don't take it to our learning.
Those who do not know their history are condemned to repeat it."
Exploitation of growth in trade depends on this comparison with the correctly restructuring of the "contingent parts"
Are you allowed to switch the blowing legs already before the red?
And how much is it going to take the ananax out of the jungle fabric?
Responses have strongly shared opinions: one of them is the quote of an extraordinary flow, and others do not want to pay for the pleasant parts of those who do not use and who, however, go home to the ross.
The appearance will be identified in commercials.
For example, Helsing Ruoholahde's K-City Market is found in bad boxes, because many, for instance, have discovered the newspapers.
The newspapers are carried out to the bio-residue.
According to the news published in the Talonomian, the young man is a wonderful trade.
But how much extensive parts of hate are removed before redning really regulating money?
How important is the smoke?
We tested how the price changes when ananacy, latva-arts, necklace, sweet list, and cake list takes legs or puts out.
Case: EUR 2.10 per bowl price of $1.80, when it deleted all leaflets.
Analysis: EUR 2,30 per euros paying the total amount of EUR 1,95 at the time that I put it away from your floor.
Latvia's article: EUR 2,60 was 2,40, when the short position was cut off.
Refrigerators: Two necklace amounted to 75 centimeters.
Without the prices, it's been 60 cents.
Parsacale: The mid-sized parcel estimated 1 euro and without 80 cents per cent.
Final result: If the newspapers and the fingers go to shoot, you will be able to control a few ten sentences in the best way.
As estimated in percentage, the price of skin was even 20%.
Thus, these purchases would have been a total of EUR 1.20!
Neymar was purchased out of Barcelona for abroad with the PSG agreement.
The Brazilian advisor Neymar has concluded that five-year-old agreement with the French PSG, reports the AFP Agency.
Previously, in the past night, the representatives of Neymar had paid their license from Spain to FC 222 million euros for playing FC Barcelona.

Middle payment 5 300 euros, education that is derived - "free and free"
The quality of investment has been discussed in the past few years.
The last reports of Helsinki reported Ritva, 68, to whom the bank movement investment rates talked to the full pump of investment products in sale.
In the beginning of the next year, the rules on investment investments and the sales of different investment products are limited.
The expenses are based on the new financial market directive which will be started to apply from the beginning of the next year.
Actually, the evaluation of the participation of employees in investors and investment products is based on self-regulation.
The law has not been defined in any part requirements.
Financial sector (FA) itself recommends that investment workers perform their own APV1 or APV2 research.
Financial studys of the APV projects have been authorized to the Oy Nomenclature, which is assigned to the Financial Monitoring Group (Fiva), universities and experts of the sector.
Studies are widely updated 12-15, and their tests prepared Aalto EE, or Aalto University Executive Education Oy, providers for movement development services.
In its online pages it is reported that, in general, both tents are "widespread in respect of requirements".
The study material includes 10-15 books and several other instructions and processes.
The Oy Markku Saviko reports that the rate of frequency of the tents is slowly slow to 70% of the evaluation.
The largest part of the bank staff is that all investment services offered have been carried out by the APV1 or APV2 research, as they are to be obliged to carry out their own rules in accordance with the company's rules.
Then there are smaller bank movements without the name of which staff affects the implementation of card surveys, Savika.
He said that such bank movements are "reverse."
According to Saviko, the APV1 study has been performed from 2000 by 13 000 to 14 000 and recommended APV2 studies for more investment.
Some banking movements consider the advantage of conducting the investigation.
In most of the other sectors, there are significantly more strict component requirements.
Savicco says that the recommendation of the financial sector requires the implementation of the APV studies, as it will be ensured in the case of the investment sector.
According to the statistics, the financial and investment costs are funded in a medium month of several thousands of euros providing, creatives and income payments, including.
The average rate of monthly salary work is around 5 300 euros.
In the mean month, men working in the workers have over 5 900 euros and the women correspondingly to over 4 500 euros.
The most interested tens of euros will be a average of €8,100.
The majority's tens of men will be paid for more than 9 000 euros per month or more, the largest tens of women who are aware of $6,400 or more.
In accordance with the Investment Service Rules, investment income may only be granted to an operative company.
The employees and tasks have been established in self-regulation until this time.
According to Fiva, the review was received by individual cases where investment professional and expertise were not sufficient on the basis of the adviser's activities.
In principle, the sales of investment products may also be operated, even though professional and qualification would be a heavy level.
The situation in this part has been fair and free.
In most of the other sectors, the Savicco states that there are significantly more substantive requirements.
According to Saviko, since the beginning of this year the new financial market Directive (MIFID II) will be obtained.
It requires that each enterprises respond that the staff offering investment services is sufficiently participating.
Financial supervisory is the amount of authority to be paid.
Fivan market supervisor Marko Hovi reports that one of the clearly amendments currently is the law on the part and experience of investors' sales and investment products.
Accordingly, new requirements relating to as well as to the personality of investment companies and contractors who sell products for some company.
Hovi reports that the Government's statement given to the Ministry of State Safety has the power to take part and experience of Fiva.
What they are precisely, it will be decided during the coming spectrum of these visions.
The company must also continue to care for the necessary education and, if necessary, monitoring and supplementary education.
All of this must be documented, and the company has the obligation to demonstrate that this is also done.
In fact, it is clear that the company in the practice should, for example, card on individual action.
This will certainly be different demands, depending on investment or sales of products.
The new requirement is also to work with a more experienced person, if it is not sufficient to participate or experience.
So if the company pays a new employee that does not complete the criteria defined, the employer must work with a person who is fulfiling a certain time.
According to the fact that the rules of amendment are struggle and concretely struggled.
The legislation on the sale of investment products shall be decreased at the beginning of 2018.

Everything's seeing it.
A few days ago an unknown soldiers producer.
So tissue snakes, kitchens, and wc snakes with the snake.
The unknown soldier refers to the movie of his first nights and to the marketing of Leff.
However, the combination has some particulars, and products have been cut into social media: When will the unknown product come?
I need to call the company and ask what is this question.
What does the Director of the Reserve of the Sinustoms say Aino What do you mean?
We're a film partner.

Sweden's new results of the age of safe-speed applicants were published
The newest results of the medical age of Swedish demanders have been published in Sweden, and the results of the tests carried out in the new evaluation method show that the tests are more than 80% of the age of more than 18 years, but all tests are not considered to be reliable.
Sweden's National Law Medical Medical Agency has initiated the test previously this year.
The tests may be assessed by the age of the security applicant, and the new test was taken after the Swedish Migration Agency was estimated that it had not been able to determine the actual age of the applicants who claimed themselves.
At this time, the Migration Agency has performed 6 880 tests, and the Legal Medical Agency has now published the results of 2 481 tests. The tests were tested between the Mediterranean and July end of 2017.
The tested 80 per cent, or the 2002 security applicant, was more than 18 years of age, and in addition, the Legal Medical Agency established 25 cases that the test was "earth or older".
432 cases were concluded to conclude that the security applicant is "equivalently under 18 years".
The test was only made in cases where the applicant was responsible for the age notified by the questionnaire.
The office of the Bureau of the Law Medical Medical Academy says that the results are harmonized with the results of the previous months.
"The slows are very harmonious, and the differences in the statistics of the last months are not available," he reported to The Local magazine.
Although a larger part of the applicants was defined for over 18 years, it is not necessarily meaning that the applicants would have lied for their life.
In May, the Agency publiced the results of the 581 test and reported that 442 cases were "references for the study of 18 or older."
When Svenska Dagbladet investigated the same results, it appeared that 243 cases were openly told by the applicant to complete this year in 18 years.
The testing method for the age of physician evaluation is taken from ringgen images of wisdom and magnetic pictures from pollutants and then analyzes pictures of dent doctors and radiologs.
One of the suspects is the endocrinologist of the Carilyan Institute, Claude Marcus, which belongs to the evaluation of human biological capacities.
"I have had a reason to think about this, and I agree that the method used is not the right thing.
The definition of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we're certainly not able to determine the age, we should not make it possible," he said to the same newspaper.
However, the Office of the Legal Medical Medical Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "That risk may normally be said that the risk to determine the child is small.
The risk is the biggest situation in which it is to be tested precisely 18 years, then the risk is about 10%."

Western Virginia's Chairman changes defence
The Western Virginia Democratic Secretary Jim Justice announced the changed defence in Trump's campaign in the evening.
"Democratics simply abandoned me," Justice said.
"I can tell you this after many prayers and fundamental consideration... today I'm telling the Western Virgins, I can't help you as the leader of the Democratics."
The university has succeeded in rare-screen recommendations.
"Hodiday as a member of the Republic of the Republic, registered", he added.
"I would say to you it's a new game time."
Trump had previously promised that in the event of West Virginia's campaign, a significant report would be made.
Trump wins in the West Virginia 42 points, since justice did not support the condition of democratic Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected as a director in 2016. Forbes said he is the only one of his states.
He's inherited his father's company and owns hydrocarbons in five Member States.
His property is about $1.59 billion.
The National Committee of the Republics (RNC) published a tour on the evening, which states that "the Defence of the Defence of Justice is again a new attack to the Democratic Party, which would like to build obstacles to better than the American".
"Democratics have only 15 leaders and less states than ever before. In this situation, the statement of Justice is the last month after the party who has no leadership and which is not able to find a positive, combined message," the representative of the RNC, Ronna McDaniel, stated in the statement that the news was given to the CBS.
Closed villagers - Towers in the arrival even a very long-term day
In the end of the week, there will also be more wheels for South Sue.
During the last week, especially in the Mediterranean and Northern parts, and in the Varsinais Suma.
During the middle week and the night of the tors, shells shocked several fires.
According to the meteorology, the tours may be a very long-term day.
Finally, the coasts have finally found Finland too.
During the period of the week, especially in the Mediterranean and Northern parts, and in the Varsinais Summit.
In the table of the secret attack on the row circle, it causes a small fireball.
The Reservation Office was reported about the shooting shock in the middle week of the night.
The electricity center was located in the sauna state on the row.
The Savior Office was shut up the shooting and the wall to find pillars and shooted the ball slowly.
Another single room left without electricity, but a person's injury was discovered.
In the afternoon, the shuttle resigned the outdoor building in Harjuland before midnight.
The building was already complete in the stage of the rescue, and the Savior Office could not be other than preventing the shooting.
A total of fivety square meters of outdoor structure flows into the earth.
At the edge of the cooking in the shooting again, the shuttle attack was in the home.
The villages of the land were outside the building and proved to be sweet shelter.
The Savior Office was on the scrutiny of the case, but this time the secret wasn't obtained by the slaughter, just a few slacks.
The movement caused problems between Sienej and Vasas, when the slaughter stripped the system of transportation.
The information about the swimming day was received between eight and nine, after which the junctions were replaced by line cars.
The problem could be corrected just a little before five nights.
Thus, your junctional vehicle has been able to continue normally also by swimming ratio.

This might feel a lot of a bit, but it has been compared to the wheels for this time, so he says.
In the mid - week, landscapes were 1,700 times, and there was even potential for the tours to be the harder birthday: about 16 a.m. at the plateau was 1.790 landscapes.
If the persecution is still on the beginning, it can take more than two thousand secrets, it will be prophecy.
The previous predetermination year was tested in 2015, when the year's salary was about 30 000 pieces.
By the mid-week, the number of secrets this year was about 18.386.
It is therefore unbelievable that this year would not be punished for two years.
However, it may be expected to continue.
According to the imports, Finland has also remained thermal and cosmetic during the final week, which is an individual birth environment.
The main costs are transferred from the northern parts of the country to the south, where there can be approximately 2 000 secret days, as well as Sunday and Sunday.

Coe exceeds Russia's "Overy" request for forgiveness from dopingscandale
However, the world's general sport Sebastian Coe exceeded openly to describe the request for for forgiveness by Russia for the dopingscandale, but Coe added that it was not yet time to stop Russia’s participation language.
The Russian general sporter Dmitri Shljaht said in the IAAF congress that Russia’s ban is appropriate and that he would like to fight for a periodic struggle.
He said he was sorry for all the sports who were brought into competition.
In spite of his comments, the IAAF congress voted for the continuation of the ban. Russians were closed from November 2015 after the World Antidoping Office in the WADA report to support the government from Doping in Russia.
"I think that his answer was very direct today, and it was a very open presentation," the President of the IAAF reported to the providers.
"All the Council and the Congress were satisfied that the Russian general sports Association was welcomed through the land by the difficult times and reported its work to reorganize all its activities."
Coe said it was "pleasant" also that Russia accepted the proposal for a prohibition.
"I think we had the right day to build and progress have been done, but the Congress supports the recommendation of the Working Group that there is no right time to stop the Russian ban," said Coe.
"We have to do in the past months to normalize the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep the clean sports different from the corrupted system," he added.
Nine Russian sportors competite towards neutral sports in London on Monday's MM general sports. They have complied with the strict criteria of IAAF.
Rune Andersen, director of the IAAF working group, said on Monday that Russia must still comply with many requirements before it was possible to return.
"The test is still unexpected, and the trainers received the calendar continue to operate freely", he reported to the IAAF Council on Saturday after their proposal in London.
Production company was cut off to the weakness of Tom of Finland.
Tom of Finland was not a success, as the factors hoped, reports Yle.
If it is honestly said, I'm disappointed, acknowledge the director of the film produced by Helsinki Film, Annika Sucksdorff Yle in the discussion.
I was afraid that the Finnish films could be conservative, and it seems like that.
The film took its next night in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had been targeted by 1000,000 viewers, which was the film budget, about a million euros compared to a few.
There is nothing to do with this, but it is now important that investors get back to their own.
If the movie had been better at home, they would have got their money.
Now you have to wait for small smells on the outside, Sucksdorff says.

How the economic rules of the football affect Neymar's transfer to Paris
The provisions limited to the use of European footballs do not prevent Neymar's movement from Spain from Barcelona to France to Paris, and it has a football transfer for all the times of players.
The possible consequences of Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) are to decide the EUFA regulated by the European football, which may prevent the participation of the teams.
The EUFA has introduced the economic rules of the game in 2011, as the PSG has to be able to demonstrate that the movement of Neymar has been financed without major losses.
It was paid to Barcelona EUR 222 million for the conclusion of the Brazilian Agreement, and Neymar’s annual currency is moved in ten million dollars next.
Neymar's transfer to France is involved in many economic aspects.
PSG has no difficulties to pay Neymar's transfer and link him to its stars, as it follows the financing of a rich governant in Qatar oil.
Securities can use large amounts of players for their purchase, but they must be balanced with real income sources so that transactions related to football are not missing.
The economic rules of the real game were designed as the EUFA president in 2007 on the initiative of the French Michel Platin.
As the former footballer of Platin, it was agreed that the achievement of success was deteriorated and caused serious problems if the banks or owners supported them.
In 2011, the economic priority of the game was moved from the speed of their losses.
The change means that Roman Abramovich’s first operational model in Chelsea was significantly difficult. Abraham obtained a promising team, used huge amounts of players and made a worldwide bridge.
The current third year-year evaluation period of the real game will continue until 2018. During that period the follow-ups can be made up to 30 million euros of loss.
Although Platin was forced to leave the EUFA president's tasks in 2015, his follower also wants to shoot the skins of the skin.
"The rules of the real game are still being used, and we will also apply them in the future," the economic rules of the game in EUFA, Andrea Traverso reported to the Associated Press News Office last week.
Although the PSG was outlined by the Neymar agreement by a simple reimbursement, it may be divided into the total of its new agreement to the holder.
Neymar has made a five-year agreement, so the transfer of EUR 44.4 million can be recorded after the following five years.
The first sanctions of the real game were distributed in 2014. The largest sanctions were imposed to the PSG and Abu Dhab to finance Manchester City.
The PSG has received the 60 million euros, which was reduced later to 20 million euros, and it was also intended to be limited to its 21 players instead of the regular 25 players instead of the 2014-2015 period.
The EUFA is checking the strikes that may try to turn its financial rules by increasing its income through companies related to owners.
If, for example, the Qatar company supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be greater than the normal level of the market, EUFA does not depend on the real results.
This occurred when EUFA concluded in 2014 that the Qatar Tourism Authority's support was overcome by PSG.
It has also been found that part of Neymar’s PSG could be funded by Qatar in 2022 football MM competitives.
However, the PSG and the Board have refused that Neymar would be the sender of MMM competitors, and the EUFA would be very easy to reveal such a arrangement.
Because of the former sanctions of PSG, the EUFA is most closely monitoring businesses with the rule of rules.
The sources from the statistics reported that the EUFA has not negotiated with the PSG transfer of Neymar.
The sentences gave a discussion to the Associated Press Research Office, provided that their personality is not reliable because they have no ability to discuss the situation of PSG.
According to the latest public account decision, the PSG trade change in 2015-2016 was EUR 542,4 million and the flow of EUR 10 million.
No recent accounting decisions have yet been published.
PSG expects new sponsors to be reached by Neymar and increased sales of other products and pelips.
Assessing that its trade change increases at least 30% of the Neymar Agreement.
From the exit of the best player in the world, Spain clearly ruined liga tried to move Neymar, as it was claimed to be the households of the real game.
"This is a clear economic case of doping as well as for the follow-up and the State," said the Spanish president Javier Tebas to the Spanish AS, and he refers to the PSG's Qatar ownership.
Arsenal's manager Arsene Wenger is also worthy to finance the work of the foot-capalose.
"It is the consequence of self-employment which has changed the activity of the football environment in the last 15 years," Wenger said in the tour.
"All is possible after the State owns a football team.
It is very difficult to comply with the real game's economics. There are so many attractions relating to the representative of the state."
Now it's urgent: Finnish MM sports trainer in Helsinki
Length Chief Arttu Pajulahde and third-party Christians as the trainer Suren Ghazaryan is in Helsinki, although he should prepare a general sport in London.
Christians may be competitive without the counsel of their trainer.
The shooting is condemned tomorrow in the swimming pocket and the Moke on Sunday in the three-million snake.
However, two trainers, the Belgian Ghazarian, have not received visions to Isoon-Brittan.
Ghazarya has tried to handle the results of the Great Britain.
The trainer has an invitation to organize MM groups as a document, but has not been valid to obtain a visa.
Is this the first symptoms of Brexit, or what, Director Jorma Kemphicle said?
He has always been able to handle the vision itself, but now there are some problems.
He's doing everything to get to the place.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finnish sportunion SUL for years.
That's not so great.
When someone looks at the stations, Arttu Pajulaht said to his trainer about the possibility of dismissing.
MM-metal for Finland requires miracles
The MM swimming swimming pools start in London on Monday and sustain the week end of Sunday 13 August.
The surgery, the landscape and the residue are the species of which the Finnish sports go towards an hostilely relationship with another year, the shock of success or not.
The success in the heart of the pink sportors is measured in metalls.
It's also other measurements.
A less attention to youth sportors remain the beautiful growth rates of the values of another, where the experience is able to obtain the performance of the sportor to the level that adult MM-meters can be infected.
Now there are no young sportors in the Finnish small team, and not really conkarries.
The MM-metal for Finland requires miracles.
Surely, the interest in the sport and surprisingness is that miracles can be shocked.
It spends sports on the side of the television swimming pool and swimming to follow the skins, although London's metalls are swept from the age of the evening.
In 2015, the previous MM swimming swimming swimming pool was received in Finland.
It took the artist Tero Pitkivuki.
The Ukrainians are waiting for the Middle East now, although others tell the results of him and the last time of his fellow believers and the remaining of the Pitchai in the last series of values.
In any way in these kitchens, Pitquitoki remains a great deal of Finnish sports.
Other Finnish sporters have access to the final competition or their own precaution to the Finnish Sporters is sufficiently good.
The realistic metall chain for the coming years of the Finnish general sport gives good success in international values today.
The dissemination of young donations and the financial support of its work is more important than maintaining the elite team of sports supporters.
Success is not at the time, but requires the work of the sports and the patientity as well as the peak sportors for years.
Finnish members also appreciate international sportors and enjoy their unique performances.
Unfortunately, the skins in London remain in the history of Usen Bolt and Mo Farah, and not because of the fear of terrorism or rape attacks.
I'm a second bed in Copper's great air, "But it hurts."

It's good, and the good fill is now, but it's really hurting that the last hyppy hasn't been great.
Yes, I'm going to try this from this time in the chairs, the wind of prayer.
The large air of the skin in the air of the cowboy swimming powder for the species.
Viking Line's new little ship to get in Helsing.
Reservation company Viking's new FSTR small ship is badly late from timetable.
The little boat had to get away from Helsinki to Tallinna at 8:00.
The ship had eight countries in the ship.
The ship came back in Helsinki.
At least twenty hours I've been waiting for the ship.
Now the car is a little moved, and John Rebane, who was expected to reach the ship at Helsinki, told at 19:30 p.m.

Small area of nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
The history also deceives the 80s and the ganging days of the 80s and the 90s (a few days of David Wain and Michael Showalter had made the glorious The State sketch of MTV) and its own period – 2001, before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and other series of stars moved to the most important cases.
Cultural production it is both parodi and the description of a continuous memories we've been cut in Facebook periods.
As a commercial product, it feels like it's already alive.
The First Day of Camp works well, and not only because of its absurd drugs (which was told by H. Jon Benjamin as a suburbane in the voice).
It is the point of view that the medium-year-old showers appear to be slightly approached to full-year-oldness, and it highlights the possibility of a part of the shocking of the past.
Ten Years Later, where adults appear to be adults, is less sensitive, and its parody is more devastating: it is a paradioid of steels in the 1990s, such as a horrible picture of your hands that are skilled.
One of the slightly specimens of Apple Powerbook, Inline Rolls and "Other round from 1991."
Many of the stories are the same as before.
Welcome Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but has not yet been reached over Katieta (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still kids.
And a crazy smile is with Ronald Reagan, a criminal partner George H. W. Bush (which is partly shown by Michael Ian Black).
Like always in these series, the best ones are the side pools.
The special joy is to see Paul Rudd, who has an abattue under the piece, or Matt Dillon's "soul patch" film Singles. Ruddin's showing Andy, the king of the lady, starts to be a old age.
The moments of sweet smell may be shocked into this series as a recursive Seven Up! - until it comes to its apparent decision: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years Later. On the last point, the friend team goes to the first day of the Wet Hot American Summer photo.
The Amazon Comrade Comrade Detective reiterates the second nostalgia: the Americans' spirit of the war, the Atomic Blonde photo and even the GLOW-series pressing the weather.
The comediate series have created Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, and it has managed Rhys Thomas. It has been a cryptical copy drama for the 1980s, where the Bukarest couple fights the truth, the athism and the markism.
In the main parts of Gregoria and idealist Iosefin are seeing Florin Piersic Jr and Corneliu Ulici. Their dialogs have been dubborn in English Channing Tatum and Joseph Gordon Levitt.
It's a great idea,
But there's nothing else.
There are some good visa smilings in the series. Polices have time to look at the shocking television as Americans look at footballs.
There are a number of popular audio players, such as Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny. They get a little fun game.
However, Comrade Detective remains too expensive to the follow-up of the socialist dramma of the pump – for example, a murderer behind the Reagan's namer, and it is often starting a series of feeling true from the propaganda.
Six long sequences are too long, and no drugs of the series are sufficiently fast and not rich.
It could be a better phenomenon as a phenomenon, even when Gregor and Iosef are repeatingly walking in the United States majority and in the garden, there are always two fleshy men in the hamburger.
A message to the imagination of the communist public is that the culture of the western culture can make all consumer resources and snakes.
The imaginative Cyprus creatures were not wrong: we were struggling our own neighborhood and their history.
The cowboys Toni Tauru is coming on Sunday in Macao - in response to the former UFC manager
Ton Tauru wants to keep the battle possible.
Ton Tauru receives a very sweet leg in Maca, because the Brazilian Leandro I was taken in the UFC organization last year.
Brazil also has the world’s black beach and the majority of the species.
I'll take myself up against my older.
It's fun, Tauru's 32-year-old.
The cowboys had to rise in the island in the last Sunday.
The fight was denied because of the logistic problems, but three campaigns were held in the short-term table of China's self-administration area Macao.
Tauru hasn't previously cut off the moon.
This was the first time when my battle was denied.
It was ridiculous because the preparation and my tree took a lot of time.
However, it is satisfied that there was a new time for the campaign.
Preparation of weekly weekly is not just an impact on preparation.
The movement isn't affected by the channel because it's not a week.
As long as you can go worse, if you're doing too much now.
Tauru is in a number of previous campaigns of opposers whose strength is possible.
This time, the situation is different.
Issaa is described as a typical Brazilian.
He's a very aggressive actor.
I'm going to get her in the first shock on the head and try to take the shoot.
He won the world's magic, so he knows the pressure.
The previous battle of the copper has not planned according to the plans.
Kevin Belingo, the Philippines, stripped Tauru into the eye, and the winning left the Philippines.
I've never thought so much, especially in the possible way: he didn't have any part of it.
When I was leaving to shoot, he bought my eyes.
It really hurted it for a long time.
New motivation
Some of the volunteers will take one year, a part is slower.
For example, the future opposer Issa took the last time in September.
It's got three battles last year.
Now, there's a second campaign in the past year.
I've been pregnant.
I've been trained over the last few years, and I've been fine all the time.
But I've just taken it because of taking it.
When a 32-year-old hearing about the future, he decided to change the country for a minute.
I was in Espo in the tree, and I was rejoiced.
We got very good trees when there was a friend of Sweden.
This was a great help, because the cowboy of the Sunday would be slaughtered into a physical campaign.
I have been training the same opposers and conducting the position.
It's just 32-year-old to take up.
I have to smell.
If it's a chance, I'm going to go to my own bag.
The lower shall not be freely given, as it is mostly consuming.
Macao has previously been shocked in China for Tauru.
It's the Chinese Las Vegas.
I think there's a great night before.
The UK Central Bank has a rate of 0.25 per cent
The British Central Bank is expected to indicate that it should be highlighted when economic growth has been unprecedented and inflation heavy has stopped speculations from highlighting.
The British Central Bank has warned that economic growth continues to be slow, and the bank has moved emphasis because the results of the family are higher pressures.
The decision-makers of the Financial Policy Panel decided to have a rate of 6 to 2 per cent, which has been less encouraged by the economic growth in this month.
In its fourth anniversary inflation, the bank was up to 1,7 per cent of its growth in 2017 and the 2018 prophecy was 1.6 per cent, and also warned that the income of households was higher, since inflation is still expected to be raised nearly three per cent of the weight.
However, the bank says that in the nearly years, emphasis is needed to smoke inflation by Brext, and the bank also reported that the costs of the wage could be increased in the more expected financial market.
Furthermore, the members of the Agency decided to abolish a part of the massive economic package which was started to be implemented for the next year of the Brexit national vote.
The bank will stop the Term Funding Scheme programme in February 2018, although it is expected to provide a benefited programme for banks to pay more than 115 million.
The Bank's High Decision protocol states: "In the prediction of the financial policy, the long-term development of the GDP is continued in the nearest years when the consumption rate of the reality rates of households is reduced."
In terms of rates, the bank reiterated that inflation is needed for the expectations of the market "speaking the financial policy" in order to smooth inflation.
The markets presently predict the first highlighting of 2018 on the third and second in 2020.
However, the bank emphasized that the possible highlights are "faceful" and "relative".
In May, the bank predicted the growth of 1.9 per cent in this year and the next year 1,7 per cent of growth.
Now it was 1,8 per cent of its growth in 2018.
The bridge was heavy to the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
At $0.5 per cent, and it was $1.31, and the euro was slowed by 0.4 per cent and the euro was EUR 1.11.
The decision should be highlighted after the expected weakest growth rates increased the expectations of higher higher rates, and the GDP increased 0.3 per cent in the second fourth and 0.2 per cent in the first fourth.
The bank expects that growth remains in 0.3 per cent of the third fourth, but a few years' ends.
The slight inflation overseas just a few hopes for the slow inflation and young households suffering from rewards, and the bank says that the situation is worse before it changes better.
The bank added that money policy could not "interfere" in the coming periods, but it expects that the payment development will be "required" at the end of the three-year predict period.
This will also strengthen the intense growth of British products as a result of a weak growth, and it decreases part of the impact of the private consumption.
The decision was made annually after 0.25% of the rate was raised after the EU-National Resolution results, which would eat red.
The bank estimates that the total effects of the decision are likely to be seen in prices and in the economy just four years later.
Before the decision-making of the Central Bank, the emphasis was started to continue to be more sounded when inflation of the pressure faced by the crystal households requires 0.5 per cent in July.
Inflation grew 2,6 per cent of June 2,9 per cent, but banks say that it was expected and inflation was recovered in the next months.
According to the bank, the overwhelming of the objective of two percent has resulted in a weak tree.
"When we take into account the last rate of swap rates, the competition on the household market would seem to be a crystic extent when creditors are looking for a lot of customers and want to stop yearly," says the director Andrew Montlake, President of the Council.
"The markets seem specially good to those who have been completed the existing agreement, and the new agreements are more recommended, their impacts are low and also offered inconsistent options."
NHS is estimated to 10 000 cylinders of HIV
From the beginning of the session, patients may be determined "transferable" HIV medication. In the highest right, the financing of the medicine in the public health care system (NHS) was decided.
The NHS reported that the examination treatment (PrEP) was estimated for about 100,000 people during the first third year of experience, which had been estimated to reduce the certificate rate of approximately 86 per cent of the major risk individuals.
The NHS agreed to finance the experience after the case of the case of the case of the last year of the Supreme Court, whereas NHS could be able to pay the PrEP, although claims that the local authorities should finance it.
The English leader Simon Stevens called for the tour the decision "when new intervention", and the national AIDS organization described it "in an important moment".
Sexual Health Clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are the first to take an advertising experience that extends to other clinics in October.
Previous pre-related treatment (PrEP) is to be connected to HIV medicine that reduces the periodics.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV tests in risk groups.
Before taking contact with the medicine, it means that in the body there are sufficient medicines that prevent HIV.
A medication may be taken daily or two hours before sex.
The treatment group belongs to homogenes, biological men and transfusions, as well as those with HIV-positive partners who do not receive effective treatment.
Clinics choose the proposal for experience comply with the applicants of men, women and transfusions, and those whose HIV-positive partner does not know their disease of antiretroviral treatment.
People who lived in England and who have been informed to the general doctor may also request an experience in their local sexual health clinic.
The program pays 10 million pounds, and the UK NHS signed this week with drugs after the international competitive competition.
The test is intended to evaluate the potential of the PrEP vehicle by collecting a wide clinical display of its objection, take-up and treatment.
"This significant new intervention should be supplemented and effective for already existing multilateral and more effective ways to prevent HIV", says Stevens.
"It is one of the major achievements that has been achieved for over 30 years in the struggle of the major health disaster of humanity."
"This is an important moment in the fight against HIV," says the director of the national AIDS organization Deborah Gold.
"If the PrEP is treated correctly with those necessary and risk-related groups, because it may have a translational impact on the UK HIV epidemic.
From the beginning of the year, risk groups have been funded by the NHS experience of a medicine that they can use yourself without the need to consult with a partner, because they have a strong impact that will improve a great number of people's lives.
This was welcomed the news."
"It is the important thing to ensure that the experience will be launched rapidly in the whole country, and no one of the risk groups remains outside it", says the director of the Terrence Higgins Act.
"PrEP has been obtained in the co-operation, and we can soon protect 100,000 people from HIV testing. "
"The launch of the PrEP trial has been welcomed by a event that has been struck over a few months because of the slowest government's government's health system," says Mr Sharon Hodgson.
"We have evidence that the medicine may have a transparent impact on our work, which we do to prevent HIV and stop this threatening disease.
The test helps us to understand better the real benefits of the PrEP.
Now it is important that the experience will be initiated as soon as possible in the whole country. This is how we can protect HIV exposure and get back to the nearest situation in which HIV spread has been able to stop in society."
Life quality: interface and slight income solutions have been made from the small house of Earl's Court
The former banker Joanne Leigh was inspired by the Knightsbridgen residence area in Erl's Court in 2014.
This is the first part of the house of Queen Anna in the time. Remont's success tells that Joanne has not yet cast out his camps and has changed.
"Here I lived with my former man in Knightsbridge in the greatest place," says Joanne.
"I didn't have any of the same way in my prices.
I went here at the accommodation, and I realized that the rooms were as high as in my siliness.
I enjoyed immediately and made a offer on the same day."
After that, about 90 square rooms have experienced a complete form change.
It was two in which the bedroom reached only from the kitchen. Joanne wanted to increase the condition of maintenance as well as the machine to ensure that the room height could be used.
"I wanted the universe, the great times and a lot of light.
They were my requirements," he says.
He rewarded the work of Erfan Azadin Notting Hill from the Duck & Shed Planning Office. Erfan was able to use nearly four meters of high rooms and to create a place that would not only be a remont and sell destination but a home.
It was not exactly sufficient to two substantive situations, so it was the challenge to build a machine that could be able to stand.
The solution requires a thinking of Erfan.
"The swimming buildings are time complex.
The shops had to be organized on the top so that they did not need a cycling.
The structures had to be amended so that the height is just appropriate on them and under them."
Erphan was able to place the condition on the top two full rooms in a slightly detail.
Retrouvir is opened in a cochronic window on a slight residence.
Small rooms, gold illnesses and Serge Mouille wintage lights create symptoms style.
The use of games is the theatreality, the situation of feeling and light.
The slights on both sides may be more effectively slowly affected.
The game between the kitchen is like a window opening a view to another room.
The income of the skin slippers has a condition of conservation for Joanne's foods and washing snakes.
Additional slightness is that the kitchen is hidden when it is not used.
The kitchens installed on the kitchen door do not have a new solution,
But in the kitchen, Joanne has the unique quality that the doors will be shooted as the door of the car.
"It requires a bit of planning," says Erfan about the thermal swimming door of the MDF.
"It's been balanced, or it's slowing up in a very easy way to its places."
After the deterioration and conservative planning, Joanne received 16 additional squares, another bedroom and an older basis solution.
"In the sale of the pinta area, or the value of the cognition, is resolved," says Erfan.
"In the basic case, the cooking interface is walking into the apartment and calculating the prices on the basis of the scale sector."
In the area of Joanna, the pinta area was added by using manufacturing materials that produce integrity in the state.
"The Sustainment is related to the materials of housing, and the tunnezide is born partly on their basis," says Erfan.
"No one was shooted on the walls to electrical guides.
They're also important but not in the same way."
Joanne's apartment is an example of good planning and additional instruments can make an exceptional wonder.
Then it may also be so that the residence does not want to change anymore.

The lawyers didn't shoot the floor, but they walked out.
In the kitchen's food sales to Panya Suamsri-Pentti, among the supports of Panja.
He didn't even share the Finnish, nor the Finnish were still part of the tea.
Because the people didn't want to eat, Panja offered free lands.
That's how he taught donkeys to eat the sharp snakes, who are sweet together.
He said to be a land.
I've left the shoe to the cook.
I've been more often, finally every day.
In June 1997 Panja opened the Lahda trade in its thauri fish.
There were two small tables, the customers might be under 20.
He taught us not only to eat the tharuga, but also to sit in his swimming garbage.

We met a little bit better, and we became friends.
Finally, I was sit in a shock with a word book learning from the Thaiki.
Two years went on the side of the trade management, but then the restaurant was to change because the self-profit powers that have been made were slowly in the government.
The end of the trade management is released a new place.
There's a place.
Now, we can be seated again in our own table, just in the shortest time we had to ask the guests whether there is a place near.
Mom knows his customer.
They're telling him the people where they've been used and who they've been seen.
He knows what to eat everybody.
He has seen how the life phases of customers change, and the food safety changes.
She remembers what he called me with a man I was going to eat my first sleeves.
He remembers me as skin and meat, and remembers what I was young.
It's glad to go lunch a little more later than others, sit on my own place to the door of the kitchen and change the belonging to the kitchen with Panja.
The food is not the most important thing we're getting from him.
He has taught sustainability and internationality a time of cyclicistics.
He's opened our mappings in addition to our thoughts and hearts.
Today, many are talking to him about the tea. Thank you for the growing favorite of the trip.
I like Panja.
Even though she's been hard, he's always friendly.
He's hard.
He's on the restaurant. He's in the hill and black.
Last week in the restaurant, two decades were celebrated.
We've got our customers as a shirt. We've got a shirt shirt.

The bonds are fighting for more than $500 million for the ownership
Two brothers strive toward Victoria’s most largest innovative imperium, which has more than $500 million, which is involved in their Italian tribes 40 years ago to establish a family company.
The former President of Karton's football, and Coin De Lutis, a counterparty developer, lives in the Tororak region only in three houses of his young brother Paul. The younger brother has brought a higher right to engage in the share of the cohesion and business economy between brothers and sisters.
Paul has wanted to leave a family company from 2014, but a distance is being shocked.
Brothers and their mother Anna shared 38 shares with more than half billion dollars. The family began to purchase a single property when they bought the Collingwood Smith Street in 1973.
The family found the Westco Jeans trade where 160 moved.
Trade chain sold by $85 million in 1999.
The money was used for funds, and the family is now owned by the activities, the regions in Brunswick and Sorrent, and the households in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as the shopping centres of the former cities.
According to the covenant of the family even with the father, Colin owns about two third parts and Paul is about a third party's ownership. Paul pictures his father as "familiar power and centrality".
According to the documents of law, the share of property means that Colin owns the funds of about $316 million and Paul's value of about $176 million.
Paul isn't satisfied with the share of funds and money.
"I think Colin left the best firms in his proposal," Paul wrote in the first light certificate in 2015.
The meeting was the first time on Thursday after a number of concerting companies.
Brothers now call on whoever controls existing business, and Paul claims that Colin has closed him from the business.
Colin says that it doesn't like her place, but he accuses Paul for some of the funds' malicious treatments.
Colin writes together on his first light testimony that he would like to make a solution in this matter.
"In accordance with our Italian traditions, the family is the most important to me," Colin states in its statement.
Consultation costs are continuously growing. Remarkable statements, emails and reports are hundreds of pages. The meeting is more than a hundred pages, such as Deliveten, Pitcher Partners and Charles Keck Cramer, as well as the best and most experienced lawyers, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and his husband, Luigi, were Italian migrants who found milk bars and retail sales at the end of the 1950s. In the beginning of the 1970s they buyed the market from Brunswick.
They were used insurance when purchasing the family from Collingwood, where Colin founded the first business of the family.
Colin tells his foundation of the trade "the last years of shipment, when Paul was still a child (e.g., ten years of age)".
Anna De Lutis tells us that he and Luigi died in 2012 wanted to transfer the funds to their sons with a depth.
"Luigi often said that he did not want to end up the right of the brothers," Anna wrote in his statement.
Another two sons, Mark and Luke, are no longer together in the De Lutis Congress. Colin said that Mark had $10 million and 26 million of dollars left the company.
Paul's said Luke and Mark are "equipment of their economic conditions."
Colin had had a low profile, even though it is a member of the government of the leg of Australia and television at Eddie McGuire, the best friend of this year, appeared in 2015.
Fairfax Media has contacted Colin and Paul De Lut and their lawyers on Wednesday.
Only Colin answered, and he told in a text message that it couldn't be able to comment on this matter because it was treated in justice.
“I'm so sad that my brother Paul has decided to deal with me with the right and to bring me into the court,” he wrote.
In the middle of 2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to accept his brother's requirements.
"Now our father wouldn't want to do this," Cole continued and told her hope that we would be able to solve.
Tonight, the hope looked like a shirt.
"We're going to be solved in the right in the next place," wrote Colin.
Trump's new Chief's staff will be limited to the use of the President's media.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly's finally successful.
First.
According to the Political Journal, the new Chief of the White House will restrict President Trump's media use and monitoring of news so that the commisse would not be so frequently difficult.
The employer Josh Dawsey reported:
"When the new Chief of the White House, John F. Kelly, met with a leadership in his first working day, he took the discussion of the key problem he would like to solve: he wants to restrict President Donald Trump's information session.
Kelly reported to the Employees of the White House that all of the information, as well as those heard in the situations of information, must be carried through him, because the President makes better decisions when he receives good information."
Kelly's saying is a reasonable, but others have tried to limit the use of Trump's media and failure.
President Trump has a relationship with the television for decades, and as President, he still looks like much television.
"If the President's scientist Trump was nervous of the unlawful news, he supported the instruments of the information showing that they treated things more balanced than that," the Council of Trump reported in February to the Political Journal.
The Political Provider Tara Palmerri then wrote that "in the management of the use of Trump's Twitter is essential that his personal media virus belongs to the fluctuation of the body."
All right.
But it's funny to say that Trump's use of Twitter would never have been controlled.
Maybe these campaigns know something that we don't know — perhaps the Twitters of Trump without their efforts were still worse.
Maybe we're never gonna get to know what messages from Trump left without sending.
If his staff has even several times been able to prevent her from caused problems, their work has not been angry.
However, no one has been able to hinder Trumpia's smell.
The problem is partly due to the fact that we have competitive groups in the White House that try to start with Trump information that supports their views, and that information may be reliable – or then not.
In May, Politicals wrote that the advisers intended to give the President this information.
The employee Shane Goldmacher told us about a case:
"The current and old workers of the Trumpe say that he can smile on the newspapers where he appreciates, especially if they are told about the harmful periods of information, and then he must be able to get to know what information is from.
This happened at the end of February, when a president was urgedly given a copy of the Net Prosecutor Charles C. Johnson's founder of the GotNews.com site, who was accused of the Chief of Aviation Officers of Katie Walshi of several several white house information periods.
Johnson was permanently removed because of Twitter's suffering, and he had previously distributed false accusions and dismissed them later. He also did not submit concrete evidence.
In spite of this, Trump was started to read about the personality of Walsh."
Goldmacher adds that then the Chief of Personal Reince Priebus and the White House's Officer Rob Porter "shoulded to introduce the system of management of the documents lost to Trump."
And what was the result?
Kelly's trying the same three months later.
Maybe he is a more efficient leader than Priebus, but Trump is still an impulsive one and his helper continues to work on his own matters.
These unchanged realities make Kelly's task very difficult.

The pressure went to blow when the serotonin drugs were stopped, they were mental pharmaceuticals.
Alcoholism helped me over the hypnose, which was also made in the aircraft, I win it.
I've been without alcohol 15 years now.
Alcohol comes from a man, a swimming writer says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Orane have traveled the same journey over 45 years.
I can be better than ever.
Jyrki Orane works on the riya and tourists have been together for more than 40 years.

The Currents returned over the "millionians" back.
The most economic employees in Western Midlands are again shocked with self-defence tours that were able to overcome the shock of the community and to return to the gate of houses.
The Currents stopped a couple of thousands of households near the street called Solihull.
They were taken away from the region in May, but they were able to overcome the ruler of the world as a trail, and they took together the army of children, horses and packaging.
The Currents were able to overcome the trail that had been abandoned without protecting the pole.
The pregnant populations have forced Solihul to “resolve a problem of complete incapacity.”
An unnownful resident tells the Current Sunday nights about Bentley Heath, where they were shooted shooters in the stone.
"The importance of action must be tried because it seems that it is fully incapacity to solve the problem.
The Currents were here in May, and then they went out, but they returned again.
They've come to the evening and probably more likely today."
Akais told that Birmingham had solved the problem by prohibiting access to the park.
"Asun Streetsbrook Road, and it's unbelievable to pay a gift tax when the community can't do anything to the matter."
According to the second unnamed people, it is ridicule that the circuiters return soon after they were displaced.
"They are more than they're, and they're even cutting the horse into the park."
According to the reporter of the Soviet Union, the community is aware of the unlawful posting near Streetsbrook Road. "We are taking the necessary legal action with the Soviet police to marry the partners as soon as possible.
It is very important for the collection of evidence that, as many locally possible, the police makes an advertising or criminal activity of the police.
It helps form a comprehensive image on the situation for legal processing."

In Portugal, men who are full of the beach have been in the court today.
As a result of the committee, two people died last night.
Two men who fly in the machine can get the guilty of the death production.

A small machine who flyed the man was able to make your technical reason last night for the fleet of Lisbon's nearby Sao Joao da Caparica.
There were hundreds of people at the time of the rain, who were part of a shocking machine to flee into the water.
The machine was counted with a 56-year-old man and a 8-year-old girl who died immediately.
The ship was first part of a man who was on the ship.
Soon afterward, the machine slowed up, and when it turned back, it bought on the head of the kid, Philip Janeira Journal of News told the beach to the newspaper.
Her murder had a little girl on the beach with her parents.
The girl's parents didn't hurt.
On the rain, the oilers have drawn up a small machine immediately after the struggle.
Her father and others went to the machine and began to shoot it, telling the case, Celia Rocha Correio da Manha.

It's wonderful that no longer people died.
Two men weren't injured in the ship.
His feet tragicly lost finnisher again wins the MM's currency: "I wouldn't be the world's master."
Matti Grand-Hamari celebrated early mid- Wednesday in Finland MM-cost in banked slalom in Canada Big White competition.
The big-Hamari wins before the box also the cross MM class.
All the MM tests have already been collected for three years.
Time unbelievable MM!
Two times was treated with gold, a good time in water, a telephone targeted big-Hamari rejoiced.
A 30-year-old child grateified his trainer and very successful preparation in Finland.
The major Hammer reported that the number of demandors in the species is growing to the whole time.
The whole paralysis has grown and really developed in recent years.
The differences are small, and there's a lot of new kids together.
I always thought if somebody's going to hold a black horse.
Everybody's feeling a different winner.
The large-Hamari lost his other feet in the motorcycle in 2009.
He was sweetly counted with friends until he was young, and an accident did not want to get to the roof.
That's the time I'm thinking of what my life would be without the accident.
But I've always been thinking that it's bad to get out of here.
The cards are playing the shared, the Great Hammer's weight.
It would be a serious accident and the loss of freshness, and the Great Hammer would not do it.
But he turned him into a dark to the front of the difficulty.
Yes, I would say that the situation turned out to the win.
I wouldn't be a third-wide world master without an accident.
Before the accident, the biggest shock of the Grand Hammer of 23, was already in the shock.
My duty went to the high point of visit by the fact that it was only after an accident.
I trained a young boy with a boyfriend, and we always shooted the X-Game.
But they were far-reaching shoes that smelled some time later.
After the accident, I found myself somehow from that start of X-Game.

The majority of Syrian volunteers does not believe to return to their home permanently, unless the war ends and Iss from the land
A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees was detected in Jordan and Lebanon’s opinions and positions.
The Syrian refugees fleet in the Jordanian flights.
The majority of Syrian adolescents does not believe to return to their home permanently.
They believe that the end of the Syrian war and the exit of the country are the most important matters that should happen so that they could return to their home.
Trump's administration does not see this change in the Syrian conflict.
The Burson-Marsteller's Communication Chamber identified the opinions and positions of young people in international investigation.
Burson Marstel has been investigating the opinions and positions of the Arab species in nine years.
This year, in the Avoice for Young Syrian Refugees, the opinions and positions of young slaughterers in Jordan and Lebanon were identified in the Avoice for Young Syrian Refugees.
In February 2017, over 400 years old from 18 to 24 years of age, half of the people were women and half men.
The pools were held in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of the young seculars do not believe to return to their home permanently in the future.
42 per cent of the employees may be thought of returning to their home and 4 per cent has not been said.
According to the study, the home decision of youth affects the main war in Syria as well as the presence of Dad in the country.
Nearly half (47%) of the war is the most influential factor for the permanent home salary, while again fourth thinking that Dad is important to go out of the country.
Only a ten-minute part of the majority of the decision is the factors of improvement of the economic situation or the exit of Bashar al-Assad from Syria.
Military actions do not solve conflicts
The Syrian youths asked what is the factor for the decision of the conflict.
The majority agrees that the end of the war is more important than President Bashar al-Assad.
The fourth presidential of Al-Assad is a stakeholder of peace agreement.
Nearly half of the experiment is needed to stop the Syrian conflict now, both political and military solutions.
To solve the conflict only through military action, it does not believe just the right fourth.
The majority of the Syrian refugees is seen in the past year when the five of them are reassured.
According to the respondents, the important battle of the Fathers, and normally against the terrorism is that the media would interact to people with the fact that Dad has nothing to do with Islamics.
Nearly one of them was a priority for military measures and for educational reform.
In the sense of the tens of reality, it should be important to create better salary for young people.
In response to the impact of the Trump administration in the Syrian conflict, 66 per cent of the respondents believe that conflict is not changed during the Trump administration.
Nearly every fourth believes that the Syrian conflict is the worst of Trump.
The men are shared in two regards whether Russia and the participation of Iran have improved or increased conflict.
Monty Widenius shipping half of its codes to keep net in order - its development of its databases are using, for example, Wikipedia and Google
The MariaDB Enterprise will develop the database of the open source code of the "width growing world".
Codifier Michael "Monty" Widenise's final product does not pay any users to any users, and it can be developed through web any other programs.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are the users of the Finnish database, but paying customers do not necessarily be them.
By the databases, the powerful databases remain in the order and fast available.
If you use Linkedin, Twitter or Booking.com, they use the MariaDB or MySQL database.
"All information that is not in the image will come from the database, and the images are linked there", explains Widenius.
Widenius, director of the MariaDB Technology, is providing some half of its codes.
The man who does the beautiful hands is to be worried about the use of the Internet.
Widenius developed the most recommended world's source code database with the Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, the Sun Technology company purchased MySQL with a million of dollars, and a year later, the programmer of Oracle was shocked by the Sun by 7.4 billion.
When the Oracle trade occurred, a large part of MySQL developers reported their source.
"They didn't want to do work to Oracle, which did not give certain promises to MySQL's future," Widenius remembers.
He was already established in this stage, a company that began to develop MariaDB.
He didn't want his life work to die.
I paid from Sun for a couple of best developers, and I assured that the continuity of the code will be secured by the same friends that were also exalted.
Since MySQL is the database of the source code, MariaDB has been able to develop it on its own side.
I just had to change my name.
The legislation was established to ensure the freedom to monitor the development of the MariaDB Code.
"In MySQL, these assurances have not been done", Widenius notes.
Although many have heard about Widenia and MySQL's milliardry, the Finnish knows nothing about MariaDB.
"In recent years, our growth has been about 50 percent in the year", reports the Director of the Employee Kenneth Paqvalen.
MariaDB, who focuses on growth, does not still win, and Paqvalé is a nine-passe company's signs.
In the same way, he realized that the cost of the consumption period, MariaDB, was evaluated in the front of the 20 million euros.
Since the database is free, the company has developed its services around which business customers are willing to pay.
MariaDB also helps the changing databases, which may be more than a year, if the customer has been using the closed database.
MySQL changing MariaDB is possible at the moment because they are versions of each other.
In other words, the largest Spanish operator Telephonic and Kaakois Asian DBS are MariaDB customers.
The most favorable pillar services, such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Alababhan Cloud, provides for their customers MariaDB.
In addition, MariaDB automatically expands new users in the distribution packages of Linux systems where MariaDB has long replaced MySQL.
Although we are a small company, we have contacts with the biggest pieces.
"Our Asian team has the largest teleoperators in the world, players, banks and even some of the central banks," the Paqvale list.
Data database markets are still enabled by waste databases such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP.
MySQL is also unexpected to the traditionally closed database of the company.
Although the majority of data database companies have lost their market share in the past few years, MariaDB's switchs are still unexpected, although rapidly increased.
About 50 billion dollars on the database market, the databases of the open source code do not even exceed the billion.
However, the weight value of the open source cannot only be measured in money because the majority of the users do not pay any of these programs.
The research company Gartner predicts that in 2018, the companies have already developed more than 70 % of their internal applications to the open databases.
Furthermore, more than half of the old databases would then be changed to open or transition.
Employment companies do not receive new customers because most of them choose the following source code.
This has resulted in the fact that the license payments of commercial databases have been delayed to the pillars.
The companies want to do so much as previously with smaller customers," Widenius pointed out.
Since the change of the closed database is difficulty, most of the customers have increased prices in their hearing.
"I'm a lot of customers to which the transition is really difficult because their old applications and others are closed on the database," Widenius says.
He still believes that the measure of customers is in full.
When the license payments are increased each year, the customer shall be transferred to the database of the open source code.
Price is 10-20% more than the previous, and service is better since the customer can easily change to another database.
In addition, many enterprises have large system changes when they move their operations to pillar services.
In addition, many changes the database program.
Lastly, MariaDB received EUR 25 million from the European Investment Bank from the EIB.
It was the largest growth financing ever granted to the Northern countries.
The firm has about 115 employees worldwide and the purpose of repaying now.
One of the reasons for the financing of the EIB was the impact of MariaDB on public loan projects.
The company has customers of the public sector, for example, in Britain and Germany.
The public sector in Europe will pay billions of euros annually from databases.
"Another country wants to transfer the open source code to solutions and use taxes more effectively", says Paqvalen.
The widespread deteriorates how money in Finland is made to the closed health care systems when open systems are more strict, and the conditioner is not one of the software company's funds.
Some say that the open source code is ideology, but I think it's the best way to make the code.
The community helps and does what is not designed or can be done.
Widenius, 55 years old, belongs to another Finnish, Linux developer Linus Torvalds, most known for the most known source code.
Widenius helps other enterprises to develop operational business schemes on the open source code.
I still like 4-5 discussions on this subject in the various parts of the world.
Italy considers its attitude to the savings of civil organizations
Italy has warned citizens who save their ships in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue to do so, unless they are able to comply with new rules on their activities.
"If citizens organizations do not have a new action, it is difficult to see how they can continue their work," Mr Marco Minniti said in the discussion of the Torino Journal La Stanpa.
The Minnite Warning came on a day after the Italian authorities slaughtered by the German Jugend Rettet assistant organization, and its men, in doubt, cooperating with human vessels who had been employed to promote immigration.
Only a year ago the assisting organization refused to comment on the accused Ambrogio Cartosion's detainees.
"We are very regretting that we are not able to operate in the search and salvation area at this time," the organization reported in the social media in its opinion.
"We can evaluate the decisions just when we took all the necessary information and we can evaluate the situation."
The Italian authorities were careful since the beginning of October from the Jugend Rettet Organization.
The man doubtless was taken on a boat by voluntary refugees directly from human vessels who had been re-introductioned.
One of these cases is claimed to be sold only a few miles away from the libyan beach, and the information will be found on the document of the accused person whose information instruments are published in Italy.
The man doubts that a threatened Italian coast station is controlled by salvation activities in the region, and it is considered to be helped.
According to the conduct of action, ships such as Iuvena must be joined by the Italian police that controls the activity.
Only three of the nine citizens organizations participating in research and salvation activities have been agreed to follow the activities: Save children and the Malta MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
which reported to the new regulations that it was unnecessary but acceptable because it does not cause the operations of the Organization of Saving of significant changes or obstacles.
In the groups who refused to comply with the action of Nobel, physicians have been paid without border organization.
Instead, the Minister stated that the number of transferers in Italy had been slowly calculated last week, as it was noted that the action to strengthen the Libyan Beach Watch and to cooperate with local cities leaders would start producing results.
"In the last days, I have started to see light on the tunnel," he said.
He realized that the plans have been to continue the discussions with Libya's city leaders on projects of economic development and on measures to reduce the number of refugees in Europe.
The murderer suspected his murdered offender at the Enon-Industry, the suspect found on the land... the case to the accused.
The uncertain crime happened in December last December at the Enon science Cuttas.
Police states that his 36-year-old man was suspected of murdering his 26-year-old skotlanian opening office.
It's been told before that both of them were a shooting workers.
The police's been telling you that the suspect would have run with two dogs to the ground after it.
The man was found to be cold from the land, and he didn't make the opposite when he took it.
There's a reason to get up in a few weeks.
The meeting is obtained in the Lap Lap's ruling rights for the period of August.
Robert Hardy, known about Harry Potter and all my friends, is dead.
The British observer Robert Hardy is dead for 91 years.
The spectator's death reported to this family as a tour.
In 1925, Hardy was born as a 24-year-old shower in the theatre.
During his long time, he also appeared in films and television.
Hardy is particularly reminded of the role of Major Cornelius Toffee in the Harry Potter pictures and its animal role, based on James Jeriot's book, of all the charming friends of my TV.
The recommended BBC series were described through all seven.
Michelle Carter was sentenced in prison of self-assaulted text messages.
The Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and half a year in prison for text messages and phones that she was considered to be murdered by Conrad Roy.
Michelle Carter, 20, takes 15 months in his prison and five years in the case.
Carter was sentenced to murder in June, and his boyfriend Conrad Roy made suicide 13.7.2014.
"My family has been destroyed," the father said at the tors' meeting.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter's got a change in the court and was waiting for a complaint processed in freedom.
He threatened 20 years of sentence, but, according to his lawyers, Carter and Roy suffered from mental health problems.
Carter, who was buried in the red shoes and a shirt color puzzle, listened to the courts in the crust as a shocked look at the land.
"Hither was killed Conrad Royn," the accused said to the court.
"He decided to improve Conradie's life.
He didn't take the responsibility of doing it." The accused continued.
"He hasn't shown a repentance."
Carter's lawyer said that the case was caused by "the deep situations that Carter is deeply deep."
However, judge Lawrence Moniz agreed that Carter did not have a significant impact on his work.
The guilt reads Conradi's mother's statement, Lynn Roy, where she told her, "I'm not going to smell my loved son to die.
I want that he may be proud of me, and of how I have survived all this, and I try to comfort his sister in this pain that we will always be slaughtered."
Conradia's sister Camdy Roy told the court that he's a "smuggling" thinking that he will never see his brother's wedding and not be a daughter of his children.
"The painful one loses a man who has been in my life since I was born every day, that pain doesn't ever be hell," Camdy said.
It seems to be a future case, since there is no law in the Massachusetts State, which does not say that self-assault would be a crime.
Carter was 17-year-old when Roy was found from the car to deteriorate death in 2014.
The meeting was awakened by Kingdom attention when it appeared that Carter was in the text message encouraging his boyfriend to make self - murder.
"I don't know how much it is," Carter wrote in many messages she sent to Roy two weeks before this death.
Just a few days before Roy's self-smooth Carter wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to start the generator, and you're free and happy."
The judge Moniz said that Carter was taking care of Roy's death, and the judge claimed that he wasn't able to benefit from the case by giving discussions.
The meeting has shared the opinions of experts.
There's only a rare defense of Carter, one of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30 who was sentenced to the murder of their British room partners in Italy in 2007, and he was released two years later.
Los Angeles Times published Knox's opinion, which states: "Miche Carter needs a delay and help, no prison."
National headquarters: You interrupted Russia's worst war on the worst
The military alliance between Naton and Russia has been clearly degraded, commented by the Director-General of Naton at the tour of the Nato.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in the Ukrainian conflict.
I think that Naton's relationship to Russia is now more difficult than ever after the end of the war, Stoltenberg said in the discussion of the CNN.
After the end of the war, we hoped that we could work closely with Russia.
However, in particular after the unlawfulness of Crime in 2014 and the continuing insecurity of the Russian Eastern-Ukrainian region, the relationship with Naton has been significantly deteriorated.
However, Stoltenberg says that Nato is still bound to act so that the shocks will not be scratched in their head.
So long as we are strong and so long as we are predictable, we can visit Russia's political dialogue to avoid the switch of the situation and the new cold war.
Before the comments of Stoltenberg, President Donald Trump, the U.S. President of the United States had even been able to show a dangerous weakness between the United States and Russians.
Trump invited the country to thank the bad congress that adopted the new Russian packages last week.
Audi makes changes because of the experience of car manufacturers in the 850 000 diesel engine
Day before Aud's notification BMW offered to update more than 350 000 car software.
The director of BMW said to the company that "no more options than the vehicle limits." He refers to European cities, including in the town of BMW to Munchen, which consider the limitation or prohibition of the use of the vehicles.
Daimler reported the changes in its work in the motors of more than three million Mercedees to reduce diesel emissions.
No company talked about the return.
European car manufacturers have significantly marketed the use of cell vehicles in Europe and in the United States to achieve the objectives of CO2 emissions.
The typical emissions of the cell motors are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The costs of installation of emissions neutralized devices are increased, where the cars are difficult to preserve competitively.
The German car manufacturers are carefully strictly, and the partnership officer Angela Merkel has been accused of the delay of large car companies and problems.
Companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen. Volkswagen installed cars of distortions that reduced emissions in the testing rules. In general, the emissions were larger.
several of the leaders of the Volkswagen have been assaulted in the United States, but the leaders are investigated both sides of Atlantic.
In the past month, the former director of the Aud Motor Traffic Office was arrested in Germany.
Zacheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so it can be able to be resigned to the United States for the possible judgment.
The authorities suspected that Audi had been installed on their cars, which could be able to resolve the European emissions requirements, and that the cause was based on the appropriate investigation in the United States.
The Aud investigation can significantly decrease the position of the Volkswagen: the percentage of the manufacturer of shipping car winners is insufficiently large.
From the vote of Venezuela, it started a villing study, the fathers' opinions in the approval
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities is at least a million than the real voters.
This is an unfair opinion from the company who does not have any role in the results, President Tibisay Lucenan said to the donors.
Maduro guarantees the end of the crisis
Venezuela was elected on Sunday by a substantial vote representative intended to change the Constitution of the country.
The opposition has criticized the vote strongly and has organized its views against its change.
The opposition that is opposed to Maduro has cut off its own feelings so that they would be launched at the time of the appointment.
According to the El Paz magazine, the national security teams began in the mid-week of the local time to take their desire to the parliamentation of the country.
The chicks are intended to ensure the security of appointment.
Air change threatens Provence Lavender
The Lavenant list has come to the symbol of the South-Lanska Provence region, but now it threatens climate change.
Lavenal was reduced because of the inhibitry and the diseases, and researchers and farmers are trying to find the problem with strictly resolving.
"Lavenl is directly in the Provence region because it has suffered the impact of the climate change over the past years, and in particular the numbers of skins have clearly reduced", says Eric Chaisse, expert of the CRIEPAM Institute of Agricultural Studies.
"This slows the lavender's lifetime.
Furthermore, the smoothness has produced a lot of small cuttings that spread microbacteria."
It's hard.
Lavenil oil is shocking to tourists, and it is also very desired in the skin and cosmetic substance.
"Instead of smaller stars and largest flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are weakly developed or slow or missed," Chaise says.
"In other words, the parts containing Southern oil are less less than."
The solution is made by enhancing the smell, shocking the density of the earth and smelling the vegetables by protecting the grain and water, and in addition, the swimming species of older sustainability are developed.
The killer's murder appears to growing threats in Mexico
Once a week, Riodoce analogy reporting is generally gathered in a medium-week to discuss how the newspaper addresses the most important cases relating to organized crime, corrupted authorities and the endless drug war in the Sinalhua State.
Today, however, it is discussed on security because of the recent tragedy.
The employees have been encouraged to change their daily rutines.
Two test providers are discussing who is more safe: leave children home or take them into the provision of the kranat attack in 2009.
The security reporters have written three words: opposers, neutralists, alliances.
They ask the suppliers name to each group. Proofs do not need, notices and knowledge are sufficient.
The tables are written on the names of drugs, politicians, entrepreneurs and suppliers who are suspected of the payment list of governments or drug cards.
The Poverty is unfavourable, and still more than the attacks are suppliers. According to the Protection Committee, at least 25 providers have been murdered after President Enrique Peña Nieto was held in December 2012. In the protection of the Member State, 589 attacks and threats, at least seven employees in the seven countries were killed.
The latest victim is Javier Valdez Cardenas, the founder, the supplier and the source of innovation.
"The big error is to live in Mexico and to be a supplier," Valdez wrote together with many of its drug violence writings.
He is deeply rounded, even though he is present over all. The publicity of the Riodoce building spends on a magnificent picture where Valdez looks at the medium. The image reads: "Reality". The three types of suppliers Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez have been shocked on the T-shots that correct Valdez's faces. Valdez has sights and sights formed in goods.
The assembly is held at least two months after Valdez’s death, and the employees discuss their common trauma, pain, unsoundlessness, and persecution.
In 2010, the advocate office of the Union was established for the treatment of cases of suppliers, but, according to the Protection Committee, only two sentences have been raised.
The murders of the employees are just a few of their rights, as well as thousands of drug trafficking and organized crimes in the year, only rarely ends to be treated.
The Riodox providers will continue to write violences in Sinaloa, although they are devastating and the situation is most dangerous.
Ibarra says that there is only a little benefit from the security meeting, because the killers are not in knowledge and there is no hope of justice.
"This meeting is directly known as a time-wheel," he says.
"We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know why it happened."
Valdez was removed from Riodoce, the capital of the state in Culiacan, morning 15.5.2017.
He was ageing in the red Toyotal only a couple of cards on the way when two men stopped him and packed out of the car and shooted twelve shocks.
Ampuja's driven out of Valdez's car and shoot it in some way.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was left to smell his wife and two adult children.
The smells move rapidly and swear freely in Culiacan.
But Valdez's death is a shock.
Sinalo has been more bloody fighter in Mexico since Guzman was arrested last year and was disfellowshipped in the United States in January.
On the streets of the synagogue, some or several people die every day, and there are shooting two-kerrows of drugs, which are larger than many households.
In the Raniko State, only one card controls hundreds and drug traffic routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, Riodoce founder and leader, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez feels guilty that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes leaded to the murder of Valdez.
In February, Riodoce published Damaso Lopez's discussion, and leads to a competitive group that goes to war against Guzman's sons.
It could have been shocked by Guzman’s sons: as a gymnastic guest guests have purchased each number soon when the newspaper came to the sell points.
Another error was that Valdezia was not forced to go out of the country after the second publications of the same thing were being the target of the attack.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and in the foreign countries, and his murder was considered a traductor of violence against the employees.
She had learned so many of his friends and colleagues have no longer shared fear for him.
He was done a long round in Noroest when he decided to set up five colleagues with Riodoce in 2003. The shares of the newspaper were sold at $50 at that time.
In Sinalogue, "I was unable to make journalism without drug problems", says Bojorquez.
In the meantime, the newspaper began to feel courageous and honest.
The employees appreciated the possibility of publicly investigating journalisms without fear of sensual sensation, and readers strive in the newspapers about which nobody else was shocking about the publications.
After eight years of its creation, Riodoce wind her appreciation for the news of Mary Moors Cabot in Latin America.
In that year, Valdez was able to observe the history of the Mexican drug trade without delay of the reward of the international freedom of newspapers.
He accepted his fear openly.
"I want to continue my life," he said when he obtained the payment of the Protection Committee of Providers.
Drug trade is in Sinalo "life mode", Valdez said Rompevento TV's discussion last October.
"The employee must take the task to shoot with him, or appear to be stupid.
I don't want anyone to ask me where I was when the death was dwelled here — why didn't I tell you what was going on?"
Reodox’s staff is going to take Valdezia — a slaughter who slaughtered as a hundred workers. They think of a friend who has always received pleasant and counsel.
They trusted in his rutines.
He's always used at the pants.
She went to the mission in the El Guayabo bar, and she was always on the same table.
Now they're wondering if the rutins were cut in his face.
The death of a colleague has also been able to consider how they can better do their work and remain in the spirit.
"In case we treat their women and children and their clean business, their secret thanks to their drug trafficking.
They were left outside the shops," says Bojorquez.
In the best case, it would mean strong self-defence and self-protection,
I want to trust my own bonds.
If it feels that everything isn't on it, you must stay out.
The problem is, according to Andres Villareal, the issue is that "the effects can be struck, and so happened in Javier's case."
Old rules are no longer low in Sinalo, nor are they in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerre and other states with dangerous networks: shuttle secret transport systems, weak offices and corrupted authorities.
The environment of action continues to change.
A few days ago, the telephones could not be imported into a room where Riodoz’s security education was held.
On the outside of the structure, two cops were forced to protect the tree from 40 degrees.
The Government of the State had decided to guard the offices of Rhodox, situated in the Mediterranean building in the Kalifornican region.
Some providers estimated whether these two police were only 50 percent of the team that the Governor of the State did not have to be trusted.
There were months later when the suppliers had been using drugs by dominating the mountain rural.
This week number, the Riodoce delivery was three times after the end.
Narcotics Summer Julio Cesar Chavez's brother was killed in Sinalo.
The newspaper also decided to find out that the use of the government’s money was focused on the city of the headquarters.
In addition, together with the most important restaurants of Queliacan, only in the case of the accused office, the group of people was disfellowshipped.
There was no official information about whom was defeated and how, so it was to be careful: all in the city knew that the restaurant was both for drugs and authorities for the recommendation of drugs.
The employee has found public documents that the restaurant was registered by the name of the policy of the institutional revolution Party (PRI) which has been registered in Mexico at nearly a century.
In cases of publicity, it has been sought to be denied for corruption.
Villareal requested the provider to write the best cases in the same place. Some of them "El Chapo" Guzman's son able to run and avoid military racist.
Several months ago, readers would have known to have received the reliable information from the Valdez column.
"With before we knew what happened," says the 46-year-old Villareal, who has been able to handle her body structure, "El Flaco", Oakano.
"These are all the contacts with our source of information. "
Valdez’s work room has been changed to a store in which it is maintained injuries to the persecutors. Workers of the newspaper have received a new, unexpected task: they have been temporary activers for free news.
In the following morning, after a few villages, Ombudsman Miriam Ramirez took his meeting to the representative of the local defence office, which was reasonable for the murder of the new provider.
Salvador Adame died in the Western Michoacan State three days after the murder of Valdez.
After the disappearing, a fuel body found based on the DNA tests of the authorities is Adame.
The employees have started protesting more and more in the whole country, and the texts "SOS Press" appear in the Mediterranean addresses.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington where he tries to obtain international support for the investigation of Valdez.
On the day of Valdez's murder, Ramirez met the Ombudsman of Sinalva and accused the authorities of stability and killing because they tell the truth.
He therefore has asked him to be transferred from the government of treating matters because he is concerned that it is not able to be objective.
Valdez had repeatedly demonstrated that the suppliers in Mexico have increased organized crime, criminality allows authorities and interim society.
In the latest book of the Drug Journalism Valdez writes that drugs are killing suppliers, but they are also killed by the command of political and security teams in the joint understanding of the criminality.
According to Article 19, over half of the attacks faced by the employees last year were the period of the police and the authorities.
"Where people are being silently killed," Ramirez says.
Murh has an impact on it.
Nobody forgot the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias to die in the northern Tamaulipan border six years ago.
His body was with the message signed by Zetas Kartel, "I'm because of my writings."
He left his head next to his computer's keyboards and hearings.
Some newspapers have decided to stop their activities, such as the same El Nord newspaper in the northern Chihuahua border country, Miroslava Breach, after the murder of the Morde.
Some of them continues to work, such as Nuevo Laredon El Manana, although the leader was killed in 2004.
In 2010 Diario de Ciudad Juarez published a message to the urinary article: "What do you want from us?"
Some providers have flew from their States or from the whole country.
The decision is difficult.
In the land, it is difficult to find work, and it must be safe for all the time.
Sometimes criminals are looking for the supplier's hands, such as apparently the photographer Ruben Espinos, who was murdered with four women in a residence in Mexico City in 2015 three months after her flying from Veracruz.
For those who continue to work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra — whose time had to be a smoker — admits that the writing of drugs is scared.
"I'm a translator because Mexico's on the way to hell," he says.
Some time ago, Riodoce suppliers sat on Monday afternoon in front of the delivery at a footnote when the new number had been prepared.
Among the competitive jewels and security forces, Mazatlan was 19 persons died.
The war was frozen, as the cartel messages found from the region were promised.
The employees set up the news on the Riodoce web sites on their smart cells.
The visit should be re-established on the next day.
The Syrians slopeed nearby... a new shooting attack.
Bojorquez shocked the guard police:
If they were scared, they were shocked it very well.
The Riodoce delivered the murderer of the magazine under this massive picture where a man appears to the whole Sinalo.
Bojorquez says that you can't even consider the end of the operation. "How can I stop the magazine when our practitioner asked to go to the street to do things still on the same day when Javier was killed?"
Hannu Man's Olympic Project began in the back of the powerful shooting. "There's a place."
In December 39, Hannu Man’s celebrations were short, since the professionals began to prepare for the Olympic period.
However, the precaution period began catastrophicly when a man was ill in the flun.
This began a long patient period that shipped nearly five weeks in measuring.
May was in practice in the whole hospital.

The World Meeting of 2007 has been practitioned in the second week of June, which appeared in the KIHU's high-speed testing centre of KIHU.
In the test, the sportor switchs with switchs with a switch that is growing speed for three minutes.
Each three-minute period will be stopped for about ten seconds, and the tester takes the ring of the sports with the milk test.

I have made aerobic practices that I have tried to normalize the elimination of the body.
Now it's really good for five weeks.

Dinosaurus protected its enemy by appointing
First, it looks like a horrible country.
Now, researchers have revealed the first research results of a Canadian cowboys body that had so much maintained that experts call it a dinosaur of Mona Lises.
It was so well that the researchers could even determine that their finish skin was a red skin and that had been "unfortunate past".
According to the Current Biology Journal, it is the most preserved dinosaurus of all the times and the best representatives of the world.
The fossil found slowly is nodosaurus, which is 110 to 112 million years ago in the middle of the second period.
The researchers believe that this amazingly preserving fossil is really important to find out.
According to the National Geographic Journal, panoramic plants have typically remained fossil in the best times of all times.
It was found from the Suncor Millennium Case 21.3.2011 located in Canada, and the founder was the name of Shawn Funk.
He took part of something that wasn't feeling a natural part of the environment, and decided to investigate his finding more accurately.
The fosil found from the callium was sent to the reign paleonological museum of Tyrrell.
There was a heavy crowd of 1 100 kg from the sleeves for six years.
A lot of job results are now visible.
"If you stop the eye, you can almost believe it was sleeping," says the scientist Caleb Brown, who works as an investigator at the king Museum of Tyrrell.
"The science remains in the history of Mona Lisana, one of the most beautiful and the best dinosaurs maintained.
In recent studies, it was likely to be an important threat to this grower, even though it was a panzer and remembered a walking panzer.
The red white panzer swallowed it from its lists, and also protected it from the head with a slighter and higher color, which continues to appear in many animals.
According to experts, it has been better able to defeat its environment and to defeat enemy, larger dinosaurs.
110 million years old nodosaurus increased in the titles in May, and it is now shown in the king paleontology museum of Tyrell.
Scientists have given the name of the Mark Mitchell museum in Borealop, according to Mark Mitchell. Mitchell was part of the team who took over 70,000 hours to a swimming dinosaurus.
Nodosaurus has remained so surprising that the teams of Mitchell and international researchers have been able to determine the pictures and forms of the body of the fingers and panzer.
They found that your protection in the animal world was still a general coloring, with a body more tighter and higher.
Nevertheless, it was surprising because Borealop has significantly greater than the current animals with corresponding color.
It can conclude that the flesh eating dinosaurs have received that evolution recommends survival instead of fighting.
Today’s animals, such as males, cepros, and armidiles, have the same color: they are significantly smaller and therefore more easyly, which indicates that nodosaurus was seriously threatened.
"Wow, strongly, the injury of pansaroid dinosaur tells how dangerous dinosaurs were the dinosaurs of association," brewn says.
The chemical analysis of the organic combinations of nodosea protein shows that the skin was red.
Scientists continue to investigate nodosea, to make the conclusions of their life, and, in other words, to find out what it eats with their last food.
The researchers believe that when they died, it was thought to be on the sea where it stood on the base of the sea.
At that time, Albert had the same warm as today in Florida, and the seas and the seas probably were much slower than now.
"This nodosur is really important because its finish key has been kept and has also remained in the third part of its original form," brewn says.
"Why it seems almost as in the early convergence period.
It doesn't require a lot of thinking: if you break a little eyes, you can almost believe that it was sleeping."
Your association was the time of the dinosaurs of the earthquakes, the powerful two-offs, the time of the dinosaurs.
Though their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, or millions of years ago, Borealope, his magnificent futures have been able to list the list of this overwhelming dinosaur.
Thus, for example, Acrocanthosaurus, about 11,5 meters long and six-one monsters.
The newest findings of Nodosaur’s researchers have been published in the Current Biology Journal, and they believe that Borealop has been cut from the sea after their death and that it was changed otherwise.
It was found from the Suncor Millennium Case 21.3.2011 located in Canada, and the founder was the name of Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it has remained the most panoramated dinosaurus in the world of skin and pantherine in the end.
The nodose was a average of five meters of length and weighed even 1,300 kg.
The ships of them were two and a half meters of pigs.
The researchers believe that this panoramated plants passed through the current Western Canada until the one came to the open sea.
The panzer has remained small details later in the sea dark.
The fossilised remains have remained so well that the key is still remaining in the shooting disks of the push.
Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic magazine that this maintenance is "that rare as loneliness.
Whatever it looks more accurate, it feels more incredible.
There are still folded skins in the mortal disks of the skin.
Its right front is in the village, five upwards.
I can also calculate the filter of the foot base."
How did one activeist learn to answer the question: Who are the streets?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply angry 9.8.2014.
She had arrived a day ago in New York, home from St. Louis, and sit in his airbnb bed with his telephone.
Then he noticed the message on the box:
"You've killed a 18-year-old young man, and his body's still on the street."
When he was awesome, she noted that nobody else had posted the same information to his feet. That's why he closed the Facebook and opened Twitter.
At his time there were several revisions from the user @TheePharoah.
The user name is St. Louis's resident, who tweeted the reality of Michael Brown's death, and a white police was shot in the 18-year-old black Brown Ferguson State in Missour's country.
The user also posted a picture from Brown’s life’s body on the street where it was left for four hours.
"This is unbelievable," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
When he returned to Twitter the same night, there were people who were collecting Canfield Drive.
Users posted pictures of the police's closure and smiling people, as well as Brown's self-declared man in the villages: "The police of Ferguson killed my unarmed son!"
Ferrell followed a real-time video film in which the police was standing in front of the sighter with the dog.
He also tells her a video where the other police shouted his shock and shouted, "I'll take you all... animals."
"This isn't normal," Ferrell remembers the facts.
"It wasn't the murder we've already done and could be typical.
Then I felt cold colors.
I was angry, and I was crying."
He stood the back home for the next day.
The machine was counted at one night, and Ferrell was looking for his six-year-old daughter to trust his father and decided that they would go to Ferguson next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in nearly three years later has been done documentation "Whose Streets?". It received his first night in film tests 11.8.2017.
The movie is a story of survival and mind, love and loss, and the strength and slightness of local people who went to the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell traveled to the wood of Ferguson and with her co-university slaughtered daughters, they went to the discussion "we lived in black and where we were". They talked about unreadless accounts before that morning.
"Remember, when I told you how black people have been struggled for the things they believe?" Ferrell remembers her daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy, and it's not true."
"I couldn't be with my daughter," Ferrell later said.
"The events of this day... are the great deal of the past events.
My daughter has the right to know it and to grow up.
He must be prepared to active and organize, but he must also know the different figures and circumstances of the black life experience. And he must know what we need to do to free to free us to free ourselves.
Even though I was happy to protect her from a weird race, he is even the same as other black girls.
I feel that I would hurt him if I protect him from the reality."
They were their first stops in Ferguson, South Florant Road, which was a police officer, and they became an activist office when they were waiting for information about the case and finally learned that the police would not be blameful.
From there, Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local trial that made lunch packages.
They flew dinners to the puzzles and shared them to the puzzles.
Ferrell began at least a new way to be treated with activeism.
"My act changed completely after the 9th August," she reports. When he studied at the Missouri University of St. Louis Ferrell was the President of the hospital organization of nurses in minorities, and then he focused on food laws and health securities in black communities.
"I didn't have any experience on organizing.
There's only one thing that happened."
A few weeks later, Ferrell met a nightmare advisor in Sabaah Folayan, a assistant document.
Folayan said he and the writer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar were "sharing to tell," what was happening.
Ferrelli's thinking was so suspicious. He asked, "Do you really want to tell me what's going on, or you want a story that you can use for good?"
Inconsistently, those unreadless times were when the local community had appeared, mostly white people who wanted only to benefit from their difficulties and skinness.
"We heard that in Ferguson's birth and grown there was no common voice," Foussan said, silently, "we wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already been connected to a visitor Damon Davis, who was known to act in the couples of deceived prisons.
According to Davids, Ferrelli went to his project together with six other locals, and the description group followed the attack of Brown in the following years.
"This is not a document where someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we're talking," says Davis.
"I was the important way local people are presented in the film because I was presented in the same way."
Folayan said that it was not focused on Ferrelli's experience, because it was wanted to show that the people "is not about the charsmatic leader, but of the community." Ferrell showed more open.
This is why the document is seeing a surprising private part of Ferrell's life, such as love and marriage.
"I knew myself time to be slow," Ferrell smile when she told him how to see the movie first time.
"But I understood this work and the human image of blacks require a certain deterioration."
Moreover, Ferrelli's story and re-enjoy the role of black girls in the largest black Lives Matter movement.
Once the police had shot a black son, Trayvo Martin, in 2012, and two of the three founders of the application were the same as Queer identity.
"That often, the leadership of Queer women had had the whole transport on the top," says Ferrell. "It is the cause of we're going to fight on a lot of strikes.
You've got a little kidnappers to keep everything."
Folayan has the same opinion: "As it really surprising black women who have a lot of Queer-Needs."
However, he stressed that Ferrelli has not been selected in the document because of its Queer identifier.
"He's got the energy movement," Folayan says.
"But it isn't a shock that he was in the front, but the sweethearts live many things in the operation, and they have a lot in the game.
His energy is interrupted through the white cake."
The new description groups have left Ferguson for a long time, but the between the Community and the police are still crying.
Ferrell has more than two and half years of rest of the United States, and he was sentenced to support motors in the press.
His description of his home tours of the social policy is short and slow, "Search".
However, he continues to trust in the explanation he learned outside Ferguson's streets three years ago:
"Our responsibility is to fight our freedom.
Our obligation is to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We can lose our coffee only."
Successful uniformity: Artist created pictures of the DNA of Chelsea Manning
In New York, the Fridman gallery has been removed in the midst of the faces — white, black and rusing faces, which can be seen in a closer sense of harmonity.
These 30 works are designed by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, based on the DNA images of Chelsea Manning and hair.
Manning sent samples from Fort Leavenworth's prison in which he performed his 35-year sentence. Manning was condemned to be secretized on the WikiLeaks page.
Dewey-Hagborg's resemblance was opened 2.8.2017.
It has two years of letter change between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines the work of technology, computer technology and art. Manning is transnatal and busy audience with the prison officer Barack Obama on the third day.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzed the DNA of Manning and made 30 pictures based on its genetics. They are awesome, even if a little theoretical stimulation of the revision of DNA data, multiculturality and reasonal relations with the background of the tube and identity.
Chelsea Manning, her born, Bradley Edward, has openly told her woman that she had already been murdered until 2013.
The sentence of Manning in prison was only one picture: a swimming, black, white self, where a swimming maning sits in the car where the driver is sit. He has in his head a swimming snack that became his sign.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg had the great recommendation of receiving Stranger Visions, which he implemented in 2012.
He made pictures on the basis of criminal information, and he received DNA information, for example, from tuberculosis and smoke, and made pictures of what people were concerned could have shown.
Then the artist got e-mail from the Magazine magazine.
"They discussed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of the story," Dewey-Hagborg told a new show in the information situation.
Manning's home wasn't allowed to visit, and he couldn't picture him in the prison, so the newspaper took contact with Chelsea and asked if he was interested in making the shape of a Manning DNA.
The artist and his prison, on the other hand, became surprised by letter-free friends, and they wrote to each other for a couple of years.
They even did a Superpressed Images manuscript, which was imagined by Shoili Kanungo, which was described in the future where the President would have put the trial of Chelsea, and he would be able to look at the exhibition.
In fact, Obama shorted the sentence of Manning only a few days after a series of books, which was happy after seven years in the military prisoner.
It is also effective that the exhibition will be opened right now when Donald Trump goes on his own war against computer years and transsocial soldiers and finds new ways on Twitter to strengthen the powerful two periods that he wanted to spend in this matter.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that "the thing has its purpose."
At the wall of Galleria, the opinion of an artist and the large name of Manning, which is the heart of the family name I. In his opinion the artist requires an end to "automatic division that has been based on sex, race, sexuality and culture".
At the lowest wall, the DNA period of Manning has been written in the long C, G and A books.
This 200 letters — or nucleotics, such as the scientific definition used by the artist — is part of the combination of Dewey-Hagborg wants to be aware of how similar we all are, at least from our biological.
"I hope to help people understand that we are the same values as we are, and that the genetics are very personal and open to the balls," Dewey-Hagborg says. The exhibition also shows its Spurious Memories video from 2007.
"DNA's telling about unreadable stories, there's 30 before them."
The last work of the exhibition is in its own room: from the series of pages of Manning and Dewey-Hagborg.
There's Maning's smell of the prison like King Kong, with the hand of the megaphone.
"If they get you silent, they've winned," reads.
"Don't worry."
"The text is of the letter that I received from Maning," says the artist from Philadephilian.
"It's so affected that I still get cold colors."
Instead of being described in the series, Manning has not yet seen a display. When Manning comes to the place, he welcomed his own geometrics faces as well as a number of mental publishers in the midst of the display.
It is useful, as all other in this display: for example, the DNA period of Manning is written in a slow height that is equal to its length (157.5 cm).

In the report sent by the Instituto Piston and Solorville College, it is said that "we have been connected to the police in the United States and we are willing to help the case by the authorities in all possible ways".

"We'll bring action to the next end of the decision in accordance with the WADA map" – Mr Vitaly, Minister of Russia, Vitaly
The Russian Headquarters Vitaly, but has not been said that Russia immediately takes the decision of the World Antidoping Office WADA's card, which can be re-employed by RUSADA.
"A few measures in accordance with the card have already been implemented, and RUSADA had the right to plan and test in cooperation with the UKAD of the British Anti-Downing Association.
The WDA card has been updated from these parts," said not as a tour.
The Deputy Minister has commented on the other part of the WADA card, which defines the conditions for the recovery of RUSDA's powers. The second part of the card was recently published on the website of the organization.
I don't think it's in no concern for Russia.
"All have been reported, and it will be done.
The results are presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA for the next."
However, one of the cards requires that the Russian antidoping authorities accept the results of the Canadian judge Richard McLaren's investigation.
Indeed, not it was said: "The importance is started because our antidoping system has admitted the failure.
All measures have been implemented.
The national programs weren't, and we can't admit what was not existing."
In many words, Vitaly Smirnov, President of the Russian self-double public anti-double action, was the opinion.
On the same day, Smirnov agreed that the Russian antidoping body had problems. "We have said a number of reports that the report has an encouraging encouragement and rules.
We don't want to accept the report, but he adds.
WADA decided to stop the Doping Control in Russia in November 2015 when the dimension of the doping candale was discovered.
However, in June, it was authorized to plan and coordinate the test in the monitoring of international experts and UKAD.
In July, Olympic Chairman Olivier Niggli visited the headquarter of RUSADA in Moscow, where he said that the organization was "weight on the right way" to return officials.
The British Organization skeptic about the lovely innovation of Finnish: "No proof"
The British Organization suspects the benefits of the Finnish mother packs.
In other words, BBC and Guardian reports that the Lullaby Trust organization, in the fight against handsome deaths, prohibits the use of his own mother-friendly in Britain.
The sharing of maternal packs to all pregnant women will be started in Scotia in this month.
The packaging is also shared in some regions in England.
According to Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that the maternal pack would reduce the risk of death.
The death of the skin means the unexpected death of the baby.
Lullaby Trust works as a expert of the British Health Authorities in the child's safe sleep room.
We no longer let our official presentations to them, since it would understand that we recommend this product, the organization has informed.
Finnish has one of the lowest children’s mortality in the world, only two thousand dead births.
According to Lullaby Trust, the Finnish good reading is the consequence of many different reasons, as well as the number of small teenergic diseases.
The present box for each family may be one of the factors.
However, it can't be sure that, Mr Lullaby Trust, director of the Francine Bates said.
We are concerned that maternal packs are marketed as products that reduce children's mortality and handsome deaths.
The mother's package is a Finnish discovery, and it has been provided freely to all mothers for 80 years in Finland.
The packaging contains various requirements, such as children's clothes.
This year, there's 53 products in the pack.
Indeed, the packaging is a bad box with a child to sleep.
According to the Scotland government, its shared boxes are satisfied with all security standards.
Lullaby Trust said that there is no security standard for bad bedrooms.
According to Lullaby Trust, the package may be the best option for sleep map time if you are not available with swimming or thickness.
The system recommends the packing only for the day and stop the use of it at the stage when the child is able to turn.
The system also recommends to keep the animals from the pack and take care of it not to be baptized or healed.
I'm going to smell a shock of the Japanese animal garden.
The Japanese animals' staff is looking for the darkness as a competitive.
The shipment has been surprised by the speed of the staff and has already been depressed in two weeks.
As a competitive, Shibuawa, located in the west of Japan, was shocked afternoon.
Safety cameras found that the snake was removed from the animal garden through the start.
It doesn't die immediately because it eats food around the animal garden, but we are very concerned, Yoshimi Yamane, who worked in the animal garden.
Carannut 35-year-old canna is a swimming, 55-kill and about a metro.
Yamane describes the carcase as quiet and sweet.
In opening time, the shoes will be freely walking in the area.
The animal garden has not been obtained from the skill.
The past shooting shooting was lost in other weeks.
Yamane found a swimming road over 150 meters from the animal garden.
I noticed it on the way to the animal garden.
I stopped my car, and I asked my colleagues to help, I told Yamane.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These starts help your company to avoid Uber's errors
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of the employees in the startup company, but the questionnaires did not work.
Responses were often inadequate, inutilable or even false drivers.
Although he convinced that the question is unnamed, the part of the employees was unlikely treated.
"The results were not simply coherent and non-objective," Errett says. As Madison Reed's hair management company focuses on the network trade. The company has 75 employees.
Errett decided to take care of the external help.
The market has continued to be more new startup companies for the staff management, which helps other enterprises to see how they can workers.
They are developing and authorised by programs which can measure the commitment of employees, which can ask and address them to certain teams and groups, and provide unnome reporting services to workers and, in some cases, to the more directly connected government.
"The health can be monitored by the applications such as Stravan and Fitbit, but where is Fitbit of the companies?" asks the founder of the Glint Startup in Redwood City and director Jim Barnett. Glint offers analytical programmes to measure the commitment of employees.
Errett has been using the Glinti program for three years, and he tells us about the thoughts and knowledge of his employees.
The program can make rapid questions and votes for certain teams, and it can also be loaded by a map that is seeing in one point of view, where the employees are less satisfied and whose leaders have received the weakest ones.
The enterprises have understood that they must be monitored by the work culture so that they do not come to Uberia.
Such disadvantages, such as the startups of the spring, are a detrimental ability to operate.
Administration, regulation and compliance of companies are a worldwide operation, which can be the value of the Let's Talk Payments website to increase more than 118.7 billion to 2020.
Convercent, located in the Colorado State in Denver, is the startup that helps enterprises to observe and prevent unnecessary use. Awareness towards the company has grown up this year when Uber is called a test.
Convercents have about 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It also made a covenant with Uber.
At the same time, Convercent gives firms the possibility to make detailed questions, to collect answers with confidence in reality and to cut the issues areas.
Furthermore, the employees may notify the non-exported use of the text message.
And if the leader has a cause for doubts, the complaints will go directly to the government of the company.
"A general opinion has been excluded by the authorities," says Convercent's founder and director Patrick Quinlan.
He recalls that if the company treats its employees badly or unfairly, the consequences may be calm, although the authorities are not missing. Consumers may begin to break the company, and it can also lose the employees and become a challenge in the right.
Ruby Tuesday has more than 250,000 employees in 500 operations. The company has used Convercent over a year, as it wants to ensure that the employees are aware of the principles and procedures and are easily connected to the main center.
Previous use was that if the employer wanted to report the problem, he had to first figure out the phone number or email address that could be made to the headquarters of the notification, and then he had to make an official election and hope that it is taken seriously.
"It was often a fearful and unpleasant experience," says Ruby Tuesday's Legislative Director James Vitrano. He said that the complaints of workers were difficult to follow.
Previously, problems remained hidden in the other city or in the state of workers, and the problems such as discrimination, distress and unjust payments can be identified and handled more quickly.
"I am more comprehensive and more delicate about the reality of the employee," says Vitrano, who leads to the Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"We protect the justice of our shareholders with regard to the labour relations."
According to Quinlan, the companies began to address their ethical, values and employees' commitment, more seriously after the accounting company Arthur Andersen, as a result of the unfair operation in connection with the Enron-scandale.
The social media has understood that they couldn't be able to prevent the public outcome of their likapy.
"The hope was used as a strategic before the technology came to the control of the ethics," says Quinlan.
Glint and Convercent provides their software as a service that is regularly speeded.
It is a business model and possibility approved by capital operators, and Glint and Convercents are supported by capital shareholders.
Convercent collected $10 million in February from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital. It has collected the capital total of $47 million.
Glint received 10 million euros from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and has collected $60 million.
Investment is not surprised when taking into account the contact between enterprises, business culture and risk capital.
In many studies, employees are expected to be more in their workplace.
Good payment on the markets such as the hidden range, and interesting projects are just starting.
The employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated, and that they give their time to the useful company.
"If they join the company and feel that they are listening and that their work is rewarded," says the director of the linkedIn Company, Nina McQueen, who is responsible for the payment of the employees.
Investorers will be produced when enterprises have succeeded, and enterprises will be successful when the employees are connected.
The third part's analytical instruments are allowed to strengthen the commitment of employees, so it is not wonderful that they are interested in investors.
According to the experts of the job culture, information on the linking of employees is important;
But it is not useful if it does not take steps.
If the company requests its employee to return, it may be marked as a change.
And if the change is not sufficiently fast or nothing changes, the deterioration may reduce the commitment of employees.
"If you ask for four thousand proposals, you must be ready to visit four thousand discussions", says the Consultant Kotter International Director Russell Raath, director of the Employee, who has seen a lot of confidence for the collection of information.
"If the company does not take steps, the employees start to think whether they were heard
And if they're thinking about anything they're interesting.
If the company does not care for them, why should they take care of the company?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed is currently making staff issues for months and is able to address the problem as reported in Glint.
When Errett had reassembled back to decision-making from disadvantaged employees of quality and communication, he was able to make changes to the teams and to organize communication education to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its employees better and hopes that more comprehensive understanding helps it improve the sustainability of persons in long-term operations that are known about the greatest variability of employees.
"If the company is not forced to create a culture of transparency, it will lose workers," says Vitrano.
"If it loses workers, it will also lose customers.
And without customers there are no firms."
In Swedish, a man of 20-year-old doubts about the encryption of her low-sized girlfriend, reports the TT news office.
A woman living in Göteborg had come home from the bed when she had noticed the window outside of his phone on the shooting shooting on the shooting.
The woman says I'm calling the camera to the house.
A woman who was swimming about the meeting was drunk into the other room to shoot.
When a woman had arrived to check the situation, the phone was first shooted up, but soon he was counted into the window again.
A summary man of a 20-year-old age has admitted his picture of the woman.
But he claimed his image only the face of a woman.
The video described with the phone was removed, and the police didn't have been able to return it to a proof.
In the hearing man has admitted the work, but he refused the crime.
His image was founded by saying he loved his neighbors "as a sweet man."
The TT Agency states that a man is injured by the case.
Teachers require more flexibility in the negotiations
The payment development could not be lower than for example by export sectors, but the difference should be covered, said the President of the OAJ as a tour of Olympic.
The interim surgery of the public sector has highlighted the difference, he notes.
We do not have the possibility to make agreements that wouldn't likely be able to comply with the loans made in any way.
The contracts in the field of the chain are only born when the papers of the private sector have been signed and the rate of higher rates are found.
Another prophecy is that, for example, OAJ's job conditions have been agreed in January.
The percentage targets have not yet revealed.
It is also the President of the public-sector-based negotiations organization.
Increased: Lomara diagnosis increases in demands of employees
According to the OAJ, statistics and prophecies show a deterioration of the payment force of the public sector when the private sector increases.
Accordingly, a periodic lomara process of time is to spend an extent of anxiety.
Finnish must determine how many students can have one teacher
It also notes that the compatibility of the basic education should be ensured, since the differences in the best and deficiencies are increasing throughout the time.
According to the system, the results of learning are decreased, and the differences between students and regions continue to grow.
Bruins players day my time when NCAA less daily practices together
On the other hand, some UCLA's football players have remained talking about the camp to the other set of new practice machines.
Some have been shocked with their peppers, and they're shocking from their shoes after the first day of construction.
Many time for them this negotiation support for a few minutes is a quarter of the mid-day.
In the summer seasons of the university, students return to the home after three hours of practice to read to the final trials. The next morning they gathered half of the seven feet of water.
"Search for three days the burdens will come to these friends," the trainer Jim Mora says a little before the earth changes.
The school sport organization reduced the number of two daily practices together, and the change was to continue the number of players’ jobs, but it has led to their days – at least after the birthdays, when the last tests were held.
Therefore, the first three UCLA practices began to be more than seven nights. The players already had a difficult timetable to find a place.
The limitation of the slaughter records in the whole day means that the workshops are more prematurely, which began almost weeks ago than last year, and this is the first time that Mora continued through six of the Westwood training period when practices are considered at the same time with Sunday courses.
Requirements are intended to hold 18 times before August 20, when you start preparing a precisely opening time: UCLA will meet the Texas syliopy in September.
Mora says that it supports the NCAA rules change, although it has made the timetables of players more closer.
"We really kill them a lot of three or four days, and it's very difficult," says Mora.
"But the players are ready to work, they're great friends.
I think that the situation will be easy when we get to the slaughter, then we have more time.
UCLA closes the practices after the external headquarters. It is not easy when it is taken into account the direct view of the practitional parking area and the Lusk Center, the level of a hotel that has already been bombed on a safe network over flights.
Bruins players are intended to move to the hotel in the next weekend, but Mora admits that problems may be born for a period when rooms are available for external use.
"We have security arrangements." Mora says.
"There is that people can store the room and describe the practices of the video, which has not been limited to concern.
I'm going to pay a lot of time on the video's description.
But we've got guards there and in the park area.
We'll do our best.
I'm not gonna worry about my head about it.
We have a plan."
Freedom in Ruanda
In Central Africa, Rwanda is organized on Wednesday, the President, whose winners are already obvious.
Paul Kagame officially tried for the third time, but in practice he has affected the lead of the earth since 1994.
Then the RPF captain stopped organized civil murder.
Kagame was the commander of RPF.
Kagame has been assessed, otherwise, of murmuring opposition and restricting the word freedom.
He has also been accused of misleading poverty statistics.
In the third time, Kagame has been able to try, since the Constitution of the Presidency has been amended by the Constitution for two years.
However, in Ruanda, Kagame is also the leader of the age.
During Ruanda, social reforms have been made in Ruanda, and international investment has been forced.
Furthermore, Kagam has been a major role in the combination of the people's murder.
The success of Ruanda has been made by many Africans to ask whether liberal multilateral democracy is the right model to African States.
However, the Kagame has promised to increase the freedom of his people after the earth has been raised to his feet.
Now it's a good time to start.
Facebook fights falsely by enhancing the verification of facts
Facebook wants to send possible valuables to uncertain facts as well as to present results under the original article. The largest social network of the world has reported about this as a tour.
The company has published its website an opinion that it starts to use updated machines to identify false identification. The possibility of lies is sent to the checkers of facts and results will be published under the original article.
Facebook has been deemed to be the largest lie publishers, and many agree that the liars have affected the result of the United States president in 2016.
The issue has been highlighted in a political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombarded in false voices before May and September, Germany supported the plan for the savings of social media networks, if they are not fully removed from enemy content.
Torstaina Facebook reported in its various opinions in Germany that the verification of facts is experienced in the United States, France, Holland and Germany.
"Many want to see what stories do not pass to the sole of independent investigators. They also want more information to make it possible to decide more about what they read and share," the Facebook newspaper's product head Sarah Su wrote in a company blog.
He adds that Facebook will continue to test an action items related to Aiheese and make other changes to its newspaper to reduce lies.
Number of scripts: The story of a bond
Small Scotney's hill in Kent's creature today is known for Squeeze music videos as well as Margaret Thatcher's hidden place in the 1970s and 1980s.
However, there is 700 years of angry history, and now on this incredible place in the Bewl River is a subject to the series of letters written by Jamie Rhodes, the oldest moppious writer.
"I'm good to get to study the text written by a person over 300 years ago," Rhodes says evilly.
"I know a personal connection when I put a letter in my hand."
Rhodes book, A Castle in England, tells the historys of the families in Scotney at the middle of the earliest time. Each story has been imagined by different artists, promised British series artists: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book based on Rhodes' Archives. In 2014, he showed Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories whose sources of innovation were the British National Library Documents. My project was sensitive.
"In my notice, in my letter of pockets, I had written a letter to the jakobite workers at the 2nd of the 1700s," says Rodes.
"It was his finger!
And the letters cut down from the skin, because then the light was used by the fire.
Three centuries later, the reader feels that he is on the place.
I love architects."
In the old documents, an encouraging writer lived in the bridge nearly four months with the support of the National Trust Act and the English National Art Council, which seemed to be too good to be true.
He conducted days in studying the victorian "new" birds, architects, artisans and rarements, such as strikes cut in the walls and centuries of balls in the wood.
He rounded the old trails and the beaches and discussed the forest guards, wood garments, and sometimes a book with imaging artists.
I'd like to say, "I'll take a whiskey and start to write."
The nearest history of Scotney is very unknown, since the shoes moved into the National Trust Act only to the last heritage, Elizabeth Hussey, died in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived in the place ten years later, the legislation staff was just going to start through the architecture. Rhodes describes that the architects had been held hundreds of years in the same way: carrying all the additional balls.
The archive had letters, letters from the time and cards of the British imperium. "If you can imagine that landmen are stupid," Rhodes says. "But this family had even struggled with one shock.
I was thinking that it wouldn't be already."
Some of the historic books continue to have a lie to the history of England, such as The Labourer. It tells us about a man who is soon joined after the preparation of a lion in the UK's home Chief in 1381.
“Nightly families of Kent and Sussex reported that there was a skin in 1380,” Rhodes says.
"In the same region, the Chief of England began, and it came to think that the castle could start from us.
Maybe these events are linked to each other?"
Other stories of the book relate to the history of a link — such as The Priest, the history of the priest, which Darrell’s family hided seven years during the English Religion.
The Smuggler again tells the secular driver Arthur Darrell's history in the 1700s. He is said to be slaughtered by filling the stones of the ark (which was observed for years after his castle was opened).
Darrells are the favorite family of Rhodes in Scotney.
Darrell's family men resolved their debt by marrying old women, and I see them grateful as friends who were part of the patriarch."
Now, Rhodes's going to get new writing tests.
He refers to two weeks in Finland by writing a series of books of Life in the beginning of the 1900 ’ s, a guarniture of which is still only rewarded ton.
Scotney's bridge has a special place in his heart.
"I've been painful to go from there," she says.
"I wouldn't have wanted to come back to this wicked ark."
You interrupted Russia's worst, then the fresh war.
The military alliance between Naton and Russia has been clearly degraded, commented by the Director-General of Naton at the tour of the Nato.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in the Ukrainian conflict.
I think that Naton's relationship to Russia is now more difficult than ever after the end of the war, Stoltenberg said in the discussion of the CNN.
After the end of the war, we hoped that we could work closely with Russia.
However, in particular after the unlawfulness of Crime in 2014 and the continuing insecurity of the Russian Eastern-Ukrainian region, the relationship with Naton has been significantly deteriorated.
However, Stoltenberg says that Nato is still bound to act so that the shocks will not be scratched in their head.
So long as we are strong and so long as we are predictable, we can visit Russia's political dialogue to avoid the switch of the situation and the new cold war.
Before the comments of Stoltenberg, President Donald Trump, the U.S. President of the United States had even been able to show a dangerous weakness between the United States and Russians.
Trump invited the country to thank the bad congress that adopted the new Russian packages last week.
Vladimir Klitshko stops - No revision against Anthony Joshua
The long-term pregnant series of worldwide master Vladimir Klitshko will stop his car.
The Ukrainian Klitshko, 41, announced its decision on Tuesday morning.
Atlantic Olympics in 1996, Klitshko took a professional 69 times to win 64 negotiations.
He was managing different MM-Tests in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitshko lost his back two last battles.
Tyson Fury found him in November 2015.
In April this year, Klitshko met Anthony Joshua in Wembley station and lost his battle after the struggle on 11th part.
Joshua and Klitshko were expected to meet a renewal in November in Las Vegas.
However, Klitshko did not find a motivation for the fight.
I used for a few weeks to make a decision so that I was able to get sufficient disappointment to the Wembleyn negotiation, Klitshko told him when he was informed.
I got an amateur and professional investigator of everything I've seen, and now I want to start my second ring after the sport.
I couldn't have imagined that I had so long and unbelievable success.
I'm very grateful about it.
Look at the foundation of Klitshko on the video.
Klitshko manager Bernd Bönte reported that it was difficult to stop the decision to Klitshko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to stop if he has no enough motivation.
That is why this is urgently the right decision, and it stated.
Klitshko has been seen from 2009 with a US shower with Haide Panettier.
There is one child in Paris, a daughter of Kaya born in 2014.
Klitshko’s grandmother Vitali is also the former world master of pregnancy.
In 2008-12, the brothers dominated different MM chairs at the same time.
The Finnish regulator increases the conditions of "Export from Fields"
Minna Niccane's head has suffered conditions during the foreign disaster.
Minna Nicass had problems with situations.
Wine and coldness have been sent out of a woman's filling.
Even in London MM, there are insufficient circumstances.
I'm Niccane's talking about it.
The circumstances have been this sweet sweet head against Mina Nicca.
I wouldn't want to blame it, but it was unconscious that I didn't even have a little bit of honour to move, Niccane said after Innsbruck's kiss.
I've been competitive and practiced here here as many times and I have never experienced the same wine in this place, Niccanne told Pavo Nurm Game.
At this time, the stabilisation of the hypy was very difficult, even when in practice there were so insecure stinks, Niccane founded in Kaleva's kitchen.
This talked at the tour in London.
It's time that it's been difficult to get technology in the castle... whether it's a cold smell or something.
It's been cold and smooth, and it's taken out of the fila.
There is no reason to consume energy in bad circumstances.
He got a 455-this of his government to the MM.
There's 445 out there.
The situation is not in London for all.
It's gotta be a bitch and wait for a better sweet.
The goal is to overcome the beginning of the Sunday in 460.
Why don't you get any more trees to the outside?
It's not necessary.
Last Sunday, I was in Italy and Germany.
I got a smoke and a technological switch.
I'd probably have to do the same now.
The normalist has been engaged in the control, and the government has now been locked.
What would be a nice kid?
25 degrees heat.
My little wind comes until it's stable.
The former officer has tried to put the politicians in General: "We have no shared resources now and not a lot of years."
In spite of the positive airlines of the economy, the Government of Juha Sipil must take the delay and causing the allocation of the State budget in the currency, warnings for decades prepared by Erkki Virtane in the Ministry of State Safety.
He said there's no shared resources.
It was generally discussed in 2015 the life of Virta in the United Nations Middle Week.
The next year's construction of the budget is just starting.
Recently, the proposals of the policy, otherwise, on the extent of the tax, on the calculation of car taxes, and on the support of the Virtanian electricity, have been able to call.
They are closely telling that the laws are close, because when 10 per cent of the State budgets are financed with additional duties, we have no shared resources now and not for many years.
I've even been talking about the widespread, when you have to take it, Virtanen said to Yle.
The office stressed that all the debts have to be made for children.
The Bureau has a long experience in preparing the budgets of the State: he started in 1978 as the Ministry of State Safety, and then worked as the Assistant Head of the Budget and the Budgetary Chief.
Recently before he stayed up, he works as the Chief of the National Office of Labour and Life.
The Bureau noted in the general debate that the economic growth of the three percent now predicted is likely to be temporary.
All prophecies estimate that this is a pic, from which the next year is coming to the alphabet, and Finland will wait for a percentage of the growth in ten years.
Washington changes permanent standards
President Donald Trump reported that the remaining standards of the Green Card are changed in the new immigration plan.
It is intended to reduce the amount of 50 000 legal immigrants in the year, clarify the requirements of temporary labour permits and limit family wages.
New rules have proposed the Republicans, and the President supports them.
The legislation has to be discussed in two rooms in the Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, increases payments and regulates billions of dollars of taxpayers by changing a way to grant permanent residence to other citizens of the country.
It also reduces the refrigeratorship and replaces the current programme.
The new search process benefits applicants that are part of the English and can live themselves and who have our economy's benefits," Trump stated, according to the information tools.
Danish Queen's Party doesn't want to be buried with the Queens in the same place
Prince Henrik doesn't want to be buried with Queen Margareth.
In the picture, Prince Henrik and Queen Margareet were described in April.
Danish Queen Margareta, 77, and this couple of prince Henrik, 83, will not be shocked in the wheel, says the Dutch.
Traditional government couples in Denmark have been entered into the same place.
The king's room has reported today that Prince Henrik did not want to be cut into the Roskil's Court Church, or she will be reported as a tour.
According to the BT magazine, this is why the prize is unpleasant in his role in the king's family.
There's no secret that the princess had been unpleasant to his role and waste in the Danish monarchy, Lene Belleby's head of communication, comments in the newspaper.
The princess decided that he is not slaughtered to the ring of the Queen, is naturally a consequence of not being treated as a balanced party.
The Queen has been a long time of knowledge about the hope of his partnership and understanding the decision.
A horrible shock on the road: Auto was going to be on the motor
Tom had an open copy and two little kids.
They didn't hurt in the accident, but they don't have the assurance of money if the other party is not targeted.
Turma took place at Vanta's Keimoport.
Archive picture of the Keha III construction area.
The Vanish Tommi tells his family who survived as a wonderful trade in car accidents.
Tommi, his opening partner, and his two little children of the couple, traveled to the direction of the Vanta Hermeenland motorway.
A long white car that was going to run to the village of the family, Tommi was talking about the 13th Headquarters of Hermeenland.
Without the traffic, the car would have come up with To もっと.
I turned the car at the same time, and it went out of the hand, Tomm tells me.
The family's car shocked a lot of speed.
Parents and backwards had two small children not hurted.
The second child is a little less than 3 years, the second is a year old.
It's apparently a good time when nothing happened to us.
No one's finger didn't even pass through us, even though there was a slight trail on the ground.
The accident occurred at 17.20 p.m.
On the other hand, no one stopped with them, and the family called an emergency.
They've got their own power out of the car.
The Ambulance and Saviation Office came to the place, and the time of the family was revised.
The car went to the breakfast.
Tomm tells her and the small income with the opener, and they got a lot of help to buy a car a couple of years ago.
Without the other car information, the family does not have the insurance of money.
Therefore, the family hopes the viewer’s views about the car, which is because of the family’s life.
We need a car every day.
It's hard to get your kids into the shock and go to work without it, Tommi says.
Tomm saw that the car was white, old car.
It was likely from the end of the 1990s or from the beginning of the 2000s.
He thinks that the start of the car record number was SIG.
If the guilt does not get captured, I don't know how we are financially, we will also have to count any voice today.
Tomm hopes that the events have been seen or something knowing about it are connected to the police.
The New Eastern Police Institute and the Mediterranean Relief Institute are confirmed that they had a mission on the last night.
Title and case corrected at 21.15 p.m.: Another thing was told at the beginning, the other car was not with Town, but was driving in the car of the family's car.
Lotta Jappis's guider's presentation relates to human relationships in the way of drug - the own speaker is seeing what? Thursday and Sunday in the theatre
Lotta Jappin, who's from the coffee home, brings his initial exhibition to the theatre.
It is a music testing of the past human relations and the inadequate inadequacy.
The manager Lotta Jappiss states that it remains a good idea.
We're going to be treated in the way we're hungry.
I've been able to be worthy of my age. He says.
The surrounding summer testing is carried out in a small budget and a large, young heart.
The name of the exhibition is to consider what humans will reveal themselves when they are known to the new humans.
Does he get some roles or close to another bag open?
Thursday, the presentation of the fact and fiction
It has been controlled and dramatised.
He also answers the light.
The report consists of the texts of the Working Group and there is no drink.
The manager believes that even though the exhibition of young people’s thoughts, it speaks all of them.
Indeed, it highlights that the Ombudsman does not directly tell his own or his own relationships with the working group.
Facts and physicians are shocked.
I'm sure that my own world's worthy is the exhibition.
I don't think human relations would be bad, but not even that human relationship, especially a couple, would be a happy condition.
Many have learned from different parents.
Indeed, he believes that his own speaker is designing a timely picture of young people living in Finland in hundreds of years.
According to him, many have learned many of their relationships with their parents, whom many have disappeared.
At least it's that you're likeing to listen.
You don't need to stay in the relationship.
The presentation shows Minea Lång, Niklas Rautée and Otto Rocca.
The working group also belongs to the publisher Ella Snellman.
The music agreement is Jappies and Rocan.
Love to the teater in Couvol
Lotta Jappin, 26, studys as a Teater show leader in the art academic art.
It's two years behind, and the other mocodi.
The continuous inspiration of the theatre has started during the years of Kouvola.
The growth of music cards has been assisted in the Kuuvola theatre and shown in the university layer in Helsinki and the last in the Linateatter in Turk.
I'm still interesting in safeguarding.
He's got the first week in Helsinki's showing Narr's last week.
At about 45 minutes of sustainable exhibition in the future, at least in the Jamaican School City in Turkey.
In the theatre 4.8 at 19:8 and 5.8 p.m. 14 and 19.
The Finnish Olympic Olympic driver took a warm year of motocrosslessness.
The hard sporter in Finland has the same untenable natural power as Janne Lahtela.
A hundred days of the year in the Kumble Lake, he was shocking the world and struggling his dreams on the Olympics.
Haave took place in 2002, but it continues to be the government's business.
He was not an unfortunate practitioner, but also the experimenter of new species.
There are no combinations on the earth that the chemical meat had not been experienced at least several times.
It's been excited to practice.
I'll always find something new, Lahtela tells me.
Finally, one shock was to stop the whole Law.
In 2014 Lahtela was an accident of motorocross.
As a result, his skin and both hands were cut off.
I didn't work anymore.
I've got snacks in my home year, Lahtela says.
The office had a bad luck.
He also admits that she could be a part of her mother.
You can feel like a smile.
You didn't get that line.
It's just as so hard that you don't make a sweet smell too much!
After the accident, the Law was a special situation.
His urgent life was stopped as in the wall.
It was a long snake to the Japanese freest-leading team as the principal trainer.
The office immediately began in the fisheries after the end of 2006.
The first time after I was 15 years old, I had to be on my place.
I just didn't do anything, Lanthela tells me.
Even during the preparation period, Lahtela often deceived its protection in the beach and physics.
Very surprised, stopping was a good experience.
I was physically and mentally so angry that my own thoughts did not feel reasonable.
They're not even in a couple of types.
It's good to be there.
I enjoyed it right, because I really had to be just once.
The compulsory board instead of serving the Finnish Headquarters.
Without stopping, he's afraid that he'd be back to the end.
It's easier to find places that have passed a bit than the wives!
Without an accident, I wouldn't have found that I had to stay so much.
The office began as a trainer to the Finnish freestyle team about a year ago.
At the same time, he found a more safeer shock in the state of the speeders.
Switch the motocross frisbeegolfie!
That's just going out of the baby right now.
In the worst, I had seven hours a day in the tent.
Although Lathel has always been a supernatural tree, he did not require his trainers to be similar to him.
I'm not going to run all of them in the same way.
Our species cultures have the ability to be their own and the way to become the best world.
Freestyle's free style, and mentality has always been satisfied with it, Lattel says.
Sex-robots will come and we have to be a reason to worry about it.
It's here: a report on the development of technology in the sex-robotic sector – just when you have started to feel that 2017 couldn't be more strange.
Yeah, it's just.
Sex-robots are a great thing now.
The corresponding Robotic Regulation (FRR) has published a silent report on the development of sexual robots in the following 5 to 10 years.
"We have to take serious attention to the publicity of sex-robots," says the legislation professor of the university of Noel Sharkey Sheffield.
Customers can select a robot's color, the form of the narrow and the type of the rings.
"Sexyrobotes are disappointed, but they are already sold, and we're going to see them more than that," Sharkey said in the public report.
Sexucles have developed as smooth robots that have the warmest sylicone age, as well as work-created designs that remember human use.
User can also adjust robot to his own preferences from the color of the eye to the form of nausea and the type and color of the rings.
It is also more concerned that robots have "privacy", which can women of Stepford show you the progress of your free leaders.
Sexucles have developed as robots with a silikon kid.
For example, RealBotix robots can adjust user's preferences, even if too much.
True Companion's Roxxy Gold robot has an exhibitional personality: Frigid Farrah affects the cot, Wild Wendy is a sculpture and continues.
"Roxxxy Gold's personality corresponds to the personality of the user as perfect as possible," is reported on the websites of the company.
Actually, the robot likes the same thing as the user.
There are also various opinions:
It may be shocked, shocked, or "in the wind".
In the generalization of sex-robots, there are many worried degrees that are replaced by gender relationships, but more dangerous is to reduce women and direct rape, for example, when the user is closer to a long and contrary robot.
True Companion compares the Roxxxy robot to the vibrator:
"There's a vibrator, why wouldn't a man have sex robots?"
However, sex-robots are not only fetis or new sexual illness.
The generalization and development of them relates to some of our dark and deepest cultures: the equality of sex towards sex, which has one option in other groups.
Of course, most of the men do not get sex robots, and their recommendation is still marginal, although the FRR report report reported about their increased recommendation.
However, marginal appearances tell a lot of time about life.
And many start to be strange or injured once the markets give it a license.
There is no awesome that sex robots have come to the same time when women's rights are threatened in different parts of the world and in the White House are a President who has disappointed women.
The Handmaid's Tale (Original) is not concerned about its powerful image language, for example, the images of the painted body and out of the eye.
The Republic of Gilead is far away from our reality, but now it seems to be a surprising short journey.
Sex-robotics are trying to do so much like real women (measuring percentages of portraits) as technically possible.
Robotes developers want that their skin feels sick and movements follow as well as possible human movements.
However, their "privacy" are far from reality.
Robotics can't get out of the relationship or situation.
They have no own desire and no history – no fantastics of selfishness referring to or perfectly advertising.
They're awesome servants.
Order.
Police suspect: Australia was designed for two terrorists, a group leaded by the Chief of Iss
The Chief of the Issu conducted a group of Australian employees, which is doubtably planned to transport Etihad Airways to the aircraft company.
The man of my father's leadership was Sydney Morning Herald sent also a bomb to Sydney.
Unexpectedly, the bomb was intended to take the aircraft on 15 July, but the company stopped before the safeguard.
The police don't tell me why the company stopped.
Another suspected terrorist plan was to build a tough colorless gas device and to put the device into the public place, for example on the public road.
Michael Phelan, assistant Commissioner of the Australian Federation, says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans that has ever been done in Australia.
Because of the unexpected terrorist plans, four men were arrested in the police Councils on Sunday.
One man has been able to be free, but he also continues.
Trump's good side?
You're gonna get Mitt Romney to show a healthy organization.
Throughout the time of Trump, there has already been a decline in the time that the strong channel of voters has also disrupted the families.
At Christmas and Thanksgiving Day, the American newspapers taught how Trumpi voted with the family.
We all want our clean information team.
The less attention has remained in the ability to combine the family of Trump.
I'm talking about this because my shock had a village in New York this week, and he's a shooter of the left shoes in Chicago, who has already been shocked with the Republics for a long time.
He recalled that a common enemy could have a strong combination of effects.
Now, when Trump is in the White House, I'm all shocking - also a sister who supports the Republicans whom he has struck about politically for decades - is equal and surprised at the same side.
It is a good thing in the day, but the more thought about it includes significant risks.
Trump has given a new power to the left, but his presidency is indeed to bring us all right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalising", we're talking about the horrible possibility that any day we're not going to be worried about him.
In the long term, Trump has even more likely to normalize the right extreme Republicans, which are equally rather affected by Trump.
Remember as a shocked version of Mitt Romney: dog on the car gate, 14% income tax (and his taxing has been seen). In comparison with the Trumpest, they affected very slowly from crimes.
When Trump's time is over, the next presidency of the Republics needs to be clear, and it feels soon a significant improvement.
When my shoes were in my home, we took our kids to the Discovery Center, and it's the biggest carsle and best in New York's park, which was getting in three dollars without coffee.
The horses of the shoes are powerful, centrally shocks — slow clovns and horror to see animals — are wicked, and the skilled music of the background is strange.
Many of New York's accommodations have been slowly disappointed: the visions of high buildings start to smile, the cities' cities will be too excited and the reality of the city does not respond to dreams.
And yet, 35 years later, I have been fully able to overcome that Swiss Cottage was not a Swiss cottage but a large business price in Northern London. Y Olde Swiss Cottage is actually the Swiss pub, but it is not counting.
Instead of the debate, it is still a wonderful animal — even though two years of age, one of the 12 and two quarters of women enjoyed it.
I would have given the smell complete pieces if someone had asked me to consider, but I'm glad that nobody came to ask.
Instead, I was requested this week in the goods office to evaluate "My payment trial" at one reference star before I set my credit cards to the counting law.
The same thing is in my home rounds, but there is also the opportunity to combine a 15% service money when I go to search for coffee from the coffee.
This emphasizes the archiving effects and presss the customer servant to put his person into a game in a situation where it does not need it.
The seller of the carriage regretted me as an unfortunate experience when I was able to give my credit card to five stars.
Shefki Kuqi was shocked from the Interior, "It wasn't in the leadership."
FC Inter today has released Shefki Kuq's post-advisory tasks from the training team.
Fabrizio Piccareta, which was previously operated as a supporter.
Another training group continues in the current tasks.
The Italian Piccaret has been a assistant in previously other parts of the English Sunderland.
In January, 51-year-old Piccarea has implemented EUFA Pro-lysis last year.
The FC Internal Government, President Stefan Håkans, regrets the event.
The variation of the trainer is never easy or satisfied.
However, Shefki Kuq had no longer been the confidence of the leadership, with no other option now, Hækans commented on the follow-up information.
The Piccaretan Agreement is until the end of the time.
He is together with the other training group in charge for the tomorrow meeting with HIFK.
According to the reports of the night Zonomy, the team has defeated the long tours.
Kuqi told the players that I follow the helpers of Piccare and John Allen have been moved to discrimination.
Kuqi and Piccareta took strongly together in the Intern fight against the PS Kemi last Sunday.
Linda Lampenus published a youth picture from the 80s.
Victor Linda Lampeius published in Instagram a youth picture.
The image has been added to several alarms, which can result in the 16-year-old student of Siberius-Actema.
The lamp itself wonders how serious a young woman looks at the camera.
For a long time, seriously, he's going to report.
If you don't see a picture, you can see it.
The lamp has previously published pictures of its past and spoken about painful subjects.
A year ago, he published in Instagram himself.
In the second picture, you see him 20 years ago, and in the second, she's now owned as two children.
In the illustration, Lampenus covered its growth as a human and refers to food disorders that he suffers as younger.
I'll meet 20 years ago and today...
I still look as much as that 26-year-old girl, but it's the difference that I learned to keep myself and what I look like, Lampenus wrote.
On the text he had added in English a challenge of life, food disease, insecurity, self-confidence, self-consciousness, love for himself, 1996, 2016, ageing, girl, woman, ageing is wonderful.
Lampenus has been openly talking about his eating phenomenon for the past years.
She was a 14-year-old hospital because of her anorsis and ororology.
Shortly later, he also sicked with a boom that finally revealed in 2006.
It's got a little silence to improve.
In addition to the treatment and comparison, the lamp helped new love.
Oscar Pistorius was delivered from the prison because of the pigs of the hospital.
This is the second time Pistorus was sent to the prisoner.
Last year, he received hospital treatment in the beaches of his injuries that he said that he was cut down in the shell.
Pistorism was sentenced by the murderer's original murder sentence.
He murdered in the early time of Steen Camp's friendday in 2013 by shooting several shoots through the door of WC in Pretoria.
Pistorus claimed that he was a girlfriend to be a skiller who hide in the WC.
The guilters have told their expectations to be valid again, because they believe that Pistor’s six - year judgment is too slow.
The Government's authority is intending to register the highest right of South Africa, and the election may be treated as possible this year.
If a complaint is approved, the Court of Justice of Pistor may expire for 15 years.
The death penalty is not used in South Africa.
Two boards were arrested by unlawful parliament in Greece
Two unlawful boards were arrested in Greece, reported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in accordance with the BTV Canadian.
The police arrested a number of people who were promised to be camped in Sitonia on 1 August morning, and there were two stations.
They were still released on the same day, but the investigation of the case continues.
According to the television channel bTV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs later reported the arbitrators.
The Greek authorities have decreased the rules on the explicit border zones and already granted to all those who are interviewed other than in the areas set out in the purposes.
The checks will be continued until the end of the time.
The Minister has reported that the right to be able to be able to make a cup.

Red meat, milk products and sweats may swim the symptoms of the cut-off
The red meat and sweat may feel like the paintings of the breathing system.
However, this study claims to be decreased: the use of food containing meat and milk products may facilitate the symptoms of the cut-off symptoms.
The symptoms of experience are an unprecedented disease that suffered about 1,3 million people in the United States and 3000,000 people in the United States.
However, the researchers at Washington sylipsi found that the necessary amino acid of protein includes triptophana helped organisms to develop immuno-cellular cells that confirm their integrity.
According to the director of the study, Marco Colonna, immune cells were protected and ensured that the disappearing microbits in the food will not be hidden in the body.
Equitable cells in future cells confirming the ability to protect the body without harmful fruits.
If the balance is too close to the flow, the consequence may be the symptoms of the symptoms.
The test was observed that the immune cells confirming resistance have been muscles with a certain bacterial list.
This bacterium requires triptophana so that immune cells start. Tryptophana is one of the protein construction substances.
"We found contact between the development of cells for the lactobacillus reuter and the steady capacity. Lactobacillus reuter is part of the normal microbiome of the product", says Professor Colonna.
"What more in the museum's food option had triptophana, more they had such immune cells."
If the same function is in humans, the combination of the feeds in the bacteria of lactobacillus reuter and strictly triptophana can strengthen the ability of the list and reduce the intensity of the tuberculosis.
While investigating the strengthening immunity cells, Luisa Cervantes-Brragan observed that although one of the mouse groups had such cells, they were not the same with the mouse mouse mouse that were considered different from another group.
He suspected that the difference was linked to microbiome, or normal bacteria, seed and virus community.
When the DNA of the mouse was investigated, six bakteries were observed in the museums with immune cells but not in other mouses.
When the lactobacillus reuter bacteria was given to the steroids growing muscles of microbiology and not developed immune cells, they began to appear in immune cells.
The researchers wanted to figure out how bacteria affects the immune system, and they increased the lactobacillus reuter bakteris and moved small liquids – without bacteria — to different muscles of immune cells.
Immuno cells have developed as a strengthening ability.
When active substance was cleaned from the liquid, it was demonstrated to the site of triptofhane substance change, known as indol-3-mato acid.
When researchers doubled the number of triptofaans in the museum nutrition, the number of cells confirmed was around 50%.
According to Cervantes-Brragan, humans have the same powerful cells as the mouse, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuter bacteria in our channel of food.
Nevertheless, triptofaan’s site products have been found in the lactobacillus reuter cells to develop humans in the same way as in the mouse.
"We certainly want to promote the development of such cells because they are regulating the incentive in the interior corners," says Cervantes-Baragan.
"In combination with triptofaanous lactobacillus reuter bacteria can promote generalization."
Jose Mourinho believed that Manchester United has received its "neron" lines with the Nemanja Matici
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United had a "neron" line with the Nemanja Maticin agreement.
Matic, who moved on the red 40 million, began by the winner of 2 to 1 in Dublin, the past battle through the United States before the EUFA Super Cup tournament against Real Madrid. He made an impact on the defence of the star like Paul Pogban and Andreas Perera.
However, Matic was not in the best, because he was not joining the Asian rounds before the beginning of the years. He did only 45 minutes in the field — according to Mourinho, it is a change before the start of the election.
"He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence and his way of thinking do him - he has the credible thoughtability of the football," Mourinho says.
"We'll help him to be ready more than later."
In addition to mathematics, Victor Lindelof and Rome Luke also began games in Aviva stadiums when Mourinho began to turn to the initial meeting for the beginning of the time.
Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants still three new players, even though the result has already done "good work" by obtaining three of his four priorities to set up his player.
"There are just four -- it must be thanks to you," he added.
"I'm more satisfied if I get all four, but they've done a great job."
The pilots ruined Germany for two years.
The Finnish airport team dismissed the fourth battle of MM-cars to Germany directly from 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
The routine of Germany's playing is high.
At once their game was in every sector, Finland's chief trainer buto Kangasniemi told in the information.
In the first two of the Finnish, he had the opposite, but in the third, a German was clearly stronger.
Germany's leads to illness.
When we were played patiently and in some places enough aggressively, it was possible to shoot with, Kangasniemi said.
Finnish effectively was 14 points assembled by Pia Corhone.
On Sunday, the three battles were lost in Finland.
Reuters: The large group has already sent challenges to engage in the Russian situation of Trump Jr
In the United States, the large group has sent challenges to join the Donald Trump Jr and the Russian employer Natala Veselnska.
The large group, called for the whole of Robert Mueller, has already sent challenges with Donald Trump Jr and Kreml, a russman who is known for Christa Veselnishska.
The news office Reuters, which has previously confirmed Wall Street Journal's exhibition on the invitation to the largest candidate.
According to Reuters, the large group has sent challenges in joining Trump Jr and Kreml to the meeting of a known Veselnitska, which was organized between the United States Presidential Valerie in June 2016.
There were also Donald Trump Mr. Camping Chief Paul Manafort and his current advisor Jared Kushner of the White House.
According to the sources of Reuters, that the specialist Robert Mueller has called for a large complaint in Washington, it means the intensification of Russian study.
Subjects increased that Mueller wanted to be investigated by a large candidate that is trying to find Russia's invasion towards the United States President and whether Trump's campaign or its neighbouring cooperation with Russia.
The large group will extend the rights of the Mueller to collect evidence, send challenges and force people to test lightly.
The large number of general citizens are working behind closed doors.
The larger group will correct the evidence found in the investigation of the accused person and decide whether it should increase the accusations in this case.
Britain's discovery microshirts turned themselves to get home and his car with the heat of the hands
The British discovery is first in the whole country microshirted himself so that he can open his home from the outside door, go to his office and starting his car with the heavy of his hand.
Microsiru is 33-year-old between Steven Northam's skin and priority standards. He now provides service to enterprises and private persons who want to facilitate their lives in the technology of Northamin BioTeq.
Northam cooperates with the Royal Hampshire Church in Winchester, in Hants, with the doctor of sleeping in the hospital, Geoff Watson, in order to meet the requirements of the physician installation.
The microsyndrome uses the same technique as in the microsyncs of kits and dogs, and its installation is only 30 seconds.
The Northaim company will also change the ruptures of houses and cars in combination with the microsynthrone. A single box will be paid to 300 pounds.
Northam is married, and he has one child, and he has installed a microsync technologie as well as his home and his BMW Z4 car that will start when he counts his hands on the driver.
In the showing of the White House, thousands of dollars were estimated to taxers
The last decision of the White House is to fly the helicopter of the marine names to the Southern Sweden of the White House by an American production event to be paid to taxpayers $24,000.
The Green White Sikorsky VH-3D helicopters used the name of Marine One when the President is in the ship, which was shocked in 17.7.2017 in the White House.
President Donald Trump, Chairman Mike Pence and a group of officials of the White House were known for all 50 States.
In addition to the helikopter prepared in Connecticut, there was a shipping boat from Main, a shooting car from Wisconsin and a truck from Mississippi.
The Army Office of the White House was requested for the Helikopter's missional arrangement only 36 hours prior to the slope of the Southern Cyprus, which appears in the document of the HMX-1 helicopterics.
"I just want to ensure that you are aware of the matter, because there is an exceptional event that receives much visibility," the Commander of the HMX-1 reported on the day before the e-mail message, the commander of the marine flight.
The message was reported that helicopters would arrive to the Southern Sunday at 17.7 p.m. and began from three nights. Helikopter would be removed from the place just after the night was empty between six and nine.
Furthermore, the message stated that if helicopter leaves from the White House would be relocaled, the second team would be required for the limitation of services.
The initial men were in helicopter during the time, and the security staff was at the Helikopter when it was in the country.
The TIME newspapers do not find out whether it was finally necessary for other men.
The Hatch Act of the United States prohibits the property of the State employee in political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 informed whether the law of the event was violated.
"There is why our questions were whether this Hatch Act was crimed, and we were told that it wasn't a crime," the commander wrote.
"Remember that you can participate," the assistant commander answered.
Made in America was an official event of the White House, so it was not part of Hatch Act law.
But the officials also have political lights.
At the time, the President talked to the senate for his health care reform and for the more public regulations found.
The use of the Marine One helicopter and Air Force One is not a new appearance.
The Presidents shall use them in their lands,
But they're only uncomfortable for light photos.
Trump's action was aware of the attention in February when Air Force One ruled the President's campaign at Melbourne in Florida State. Trump has strongly criticized the use of the presidential airport on Twitter.
"The White House is very satisfied with the event of Made in America, which was presented by American employees' products from all 50 states," said the White House's director Lindsay Walters.
The HMX-1 units regularly do training institutions in the Washington region and operate in Southern Sweden by providing the President to the White House with a verification of centimeters.
When Trump was at the G-20 Summit in the beginning of July in Germany, HMX-1 did 58 exhibits to the White House.
According to a officer, the flights of Made in America were a monthly training quote of men.
On that day, there were 11 hours of helicopters on "no-presidents".
According to the White House, other costs were not caused by taxpayers.
The investigator said that the company was not in combination with the Helikopter's presentation in the Southern Sea of the White House.
HMX-1 has no account of the flights related to the task of the President, and the costs of the event are difficult.
According to the 2017 Time Rents, the VH-3D Helikopter is $24,380 from the airport.
According to the HMX-1 documents, flights from Quantico from the Virginia State to the White House have been supported for a total of an hour.
According to the White House, helikopter use costs are clearly lower.
"Reducing the costs for taxpayers according to the reimbursement of the costs is rare," says Walters.
"Assessed reimbursement includes staff, care and many other costs that are deemed likely to be paid in annual funding."
According to the conclusion of the RAND investigation company in 2015, the costs of reimbursement are not included in staff, but are taken into account the fuel costs of the fuel, the preparation and the contract.
In some days, the former director of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of helikopter during the event.
"I think it's an American production", Spicer said.
"I know that the Sicorsky and the Connecticut State are very proud of safeguarding national security and working through it, of course, hundreds of thousands of people or thousands of people.
And I think the majority of Americans are proud of helicopters and other defence treatments that many Americans have worked very much before.
It's completely interesting to import it out."
It's not sure if Trump was in helicopter during the event, but at least he shuted the car driver in the place.
In a white house, Trump shocked the newspaper from his own Sikorsky ship.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President. "I have three of them."
The slaughter was shocked to the Vassas Rail. The junctions are forced to replace the bus.

The threat of certain tourists to the culture of the region
The authorities consider their limited number of tourists in Venice.
Local widows are particularly focused on the representation of tourists.
The Italian Ministry of Cultural Affairs calls it "eat and flee" as a tourist, which is only a few hours to be taken and launched by major groups.
Venice has been shocked on the tourists that have been made in the city.
There is a difficult movement on the streets and the great openings are so full of visitors that the people of Venice do not already be able to be a group of people.
They have been forced to move from the historical center as they have come to hotels.
The New York Times and The Guardian about the introduction of the turism.
The authorities consider the limitations to the tariff.
They call the current appearances to be bad towers - low quality tourism.
When you arrive in the big ristal, the time is given for two or three hours.
You follow a band of teaches from Piazzale from Rome to Rialton and to the Holy Marks Tower, and turned back, describes the turism caused by the Italian Minister of Culture Dario Francesh.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the operations of local, trade and jobs.
We have to keep this part of the identification of the cities.
The Holy Mark’s tor belongs to the most favorable visitors of the Venice historical centre.
The Toronto is located in the hall of the Holy Marks Church.
Local angry is also faced with the main part of the race.
In the historical center of Venice, more than 500,000 lives in local populations.
In 1951, there were about 175.000 inhabitants.
In July, 20,000 Russians had shown the favor of masturbism.
They say that their tourism has deteriorate their quality of life, destroying the environment and slowing the inhabitants.
About 20,000 people live each year.
If this continues, a few years later in Venice is not like tourists.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster, says the remarks of Carlo Belframe.
The company is difficult because the vessels bring to Venice the slightly needed results and create the need for the jobs of various sectors.
In addition to the limitation of the tariff, it has been decreased that the riders have gone from the longest historic center.
Luciano Bortot, who lived in Russia, would certainly change the situation if the Russian administrative region, where it is located in Venice, will be more powerful to decide on its own matters, if it is completely autonomy.
In Russia, about 20 to 30 million tourists are visiting each year.

In the evening night, the data launched a tour on the side of the Silian River, or a golden wall.
I'm going well without such a care.

Amalie Iuel has published beautiful pictures in the country of Grand Canyon.

A month later, he improved 400 meters from Norwegia at 55.38.
Iuel, who uses social media, was soon slowly observed that personality and publicity have their walls.
Mans around the world, apparently, began to send pictures to Ieu their sex organism in hope that young drinker would interest them.
Iuel had to close his Snapchat account.
I got a lot of "true pictures" of an unknown person, so I had to change my account in private, Iuel told VG magazine.
Iuel didn't want to see the individuals who were identified in the VG's discussion.
I'll be sure you can imagine, Iuel's nausea.
It's glad to get back after the journey, but I'm going well without any other attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark 1994.
His mother is Danish, Dad, Danish Norwegian.

In June 2015, he changed Denmark citizenship into the Norway citizens.
In Norwegia, Iuel performs three training, Leif Olav Alnesin, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Sletum.
In Norway, there are more opener discussions than the United States.
In the United States, trainers do not ask anything but just give us the provisions.
In Norway, the trainer has much more time to be personally done with the sportor, Iuel said to VG.
Amalie Iuel is able to dominate the norms of 400 meters and 400 meters in the slope.
The footstepper Janne Kurve took the whole side of the horizontal board, now with the MM questions: "That's good when there's nothing."
Now it's a nice count when nothing happened!
Janne Corpi, who has been read to the Finnish most successfully successfully, has again been reached to enjoy their loved species in this period.
It's only last summer. It's been on the horizontal floor.
The shock of the foothead was forced to the Corve operating table in January, and the feet did not want to improve.
The hand had taken a part in the snake.
In the summer, I didn't know what I'm doing, if I'm going to do or not.
Sponsoirs were on the way and many things opened, Corpi tells me.
But that's how it's said that it's a way to do it.
The sponsor continued the contract in two years, and the blood began to get back to the ring.
After that, it was easy.
I knew it last time I was going to be on the light.
I was that shit, yes, it's so fun, that's still a couple of waters.
The body went to count in the same time in September, but after a long county, only an unfair tree was a great thing.
It's just a few.
It doesn't matter.
The competitors weren't the main aspect of the slaughter.
I'm never going to have a shirt, because I've never been counting.
I think it's a shocking star for four years in one kitchen, and then you're in the late week.
I don't think about that, Corpi says.
Today the Corpi is in the midst of the MM boxes held in Sierra Nevada in Spain.
Although individual skins do not like him in a couple of swimming floors, he is always shocking.
According to the amendment, the evaluation of the skins organized by the International Counterparty has been increased over the past years, although a part of the farmers also chose to hold the Norwegian X-Game at the same time.
Yes, these are important kitchens. The visibility is great.
In fact, I think the appreciation always depends on the conditions and the level of the discussions.
The body is a old sporter in Sierra Nevada, Finland 12-century team.
Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkisennime, 17 years old, are Corpea 14 years old.
It's nice to follow the cost of younger friends.
I remember when I was in that stage that everything was new and that was so sick of all.
That's the new flow to himself, the Corpi thought.
I'm still on the shooting, but I don't, it's the snake in friends!
Janne Corpi has also built another sport swimming swimming swimming swimming underway.
Manager leader Pecca Korve's son has been shocked to the rail sport: the swimming has its own raisins to which he makes tree programs.
When I'm over the whole time, I'm not going to be in the lady.
But I'm looking at at at least every day's results, and usually something left, Corpi tells me.
Radio and rail preparation, according to Corve, are a potential urgency plan when the slaughter flows during the decision.
I wasn't planning so long, but it's at least likely a option.
I'm trying to do that a little as I'm studying it in the end of this lake.
I'm trying to remain nervous and develop a lot of time in the summer, maybe some of the departures.
If it's my coming professional, it's not difficult to start when it's already ready in the species.
The restaurants include also a dinner with Jaajo Linnonma, a Elitloppet restaurant.
Two has been shocked with a ristal, which leads to the end of May to Tukholma Elitloppet.
The Corps and Linnonland decided to rise in old traditions again.
It's been a lot of business, and people's been excited.
Now we're already in that point that at least it's not going to be competitive.
A few months you're still in time, you're hoped to get a boat full, Corpi says in your joy.

The Professional Union will take for the long-term commitment of the McVitie's manufacturer to produce Glasgow's manufacture.
According to the GMB Scotlane General Professional Unit, the company has not reported its planning for the future of Tollcross.

The company adds that the representatives of the Employees and the Professional Union would be "represented as the first", if they were incoming changes.
In the letter shown by the Director, GMB urges the company to “require the financing for modernization of producers”.
The GMB Professional Association Drew Duffy is very concerned with the fact that the Chairman does not receive clear information on the needs of the Tollcross business plan and the future investment plans.
"The families are working here from the other generation, and the workforce has been strongly concentrated on the local community and the large cities of Glasgow, which is an important employee in the area of high unemployment and weak income.
The east Glasgow needs the successful McVitie's production of workplaces, loans and employees, as well as Brexit, higher life costs and production costs."
According to the Pladim's reporter, the director of office had received a letter on the past day and the company responds directly to the letter, since it apprecies the continuous impact of the workers and professionals.
"We had a regular meeting with the employees and the GMB representatives in Tollcross two months ago, when we discussed a number of questions openly.
We have discussed with the employees, otherwise, that, in the way of other highly competitive and uncertain market companies, we will continue to evaluate all our business and operations in order to maintain our competitiveness."
According to the informor, the company has invested more than 5 million pounds in the production of Tollcross in recent years, in particular to its producers and improvement.
"We are aware of the long history of Tollcross and we will certainly tell the first employees and the representatives of the Professional Association if we are going to make changes in the action."
Have you warned the movement of Neymar three years ago from PSG Barcelona?
LaLiga may be interested in Marco Verrato
Paris Saint-German did not stop Neymar's target when he was funded by 189 million punishment agreement. But PSG was warned about the prespective movement of Barcelona three years ago?
The movement of the sensation play has been long talked about, and the French Ligue 1 - football team is ready to break the world’s view of the transfers.

Have the President of the PSG warned this movement three years ago?
When Manchester City announced her interested in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned the best PSG players.
"I am not worried, for they know that if they strike our players, we will be their opposers, and we shall contact them with their players," said Al-Khelaiph.
"We're communicating all the sweethearts.
But if they feel our players, they're going to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to be accused of this: it would express its interest in the PSG's central player Marco Verrato previously in the summer.
The PSG made clear that it would not allow Italian to go in any circumstances. It may be very important that Barcelona lose his star player in Neymar because of this.
