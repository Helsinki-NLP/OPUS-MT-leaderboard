What do they do, the SSD? The Czechian social democracies in Prague, nor the volunteer, nor the "conditionary".
The new Councils of the main city will clearly have to overcome certain language barriers in order to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prayer Council and in the cities association.
The newspaper updated.cz has a little "contacted" member of the new Council, as it dominates the notorical ring in the past years, in which the today's coalition partners were in Praga on the rouder.
The coded word chatz, introduced in the fallen era of top citizens Pavel Bém by the Prager's political elite, is rejected by some of the most known actors, situations and causes.
It was surprising that the new routes in terms of these new terms were in darkness.
At least they said that.
"Who is Voldemed place?"
"I don't know."
"I'm a new gang in the Prager Policy," Lukáš Kuckī, the new advisor for culture, responded to the test of the "Paten's Word Chatze".
But also the Councilsher Karel Bśezina, a political veteran, reacted similarly.
For example, the term "golfloch".
"This is the only expression of those you present me here, which I go and go again."
"Instead, I don't think much of Slang."
From the word chat published in the daypaper Updale.cz in June this year before the election convention of the ODS, the editor took six terms out, especially those who were notoricly linked to the Prager Magistrate.
The social democracies should define the terms "veilort", "grande Prayer Golfloch", "Go to the Conditionary", "Sterien", "Retraction of the capital city" and "smell".
The fourth - Antonin Weinert, the future chief of the Prayer's schools, first agreed his participation in the conversation, then not to take the listener.
The fifth advisor, Peter Dolínek, rejected the test before.
"These things are not me, and how the citizens of democracy are inter alia, I do not judge it."
"For me is important how we understand in the framework of our programmes," he said.
As stated already, Lukáš Kauckī had not apparently recognized in the above line that it is the speech of an influential entrepreneur and friend of the former citizens Bem, Roman Janoušek.
The term "Voldemort" says nothing and the only word he corrected at the test was "the largest player golf loch".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," he said, "but I know more from the newspaper."
And ridiculous, "I'll probably have to show a course of language."
The "golfloch" is then not only designed by Matator Karel Bśezina, but also by the Council's Council for Environmental Questions Lukáš Plachý right as an White Tunnel.
However, both social democracies also know whose term is Voldemort and Lukáš Plachý is even able to find this figure and thus what it means to "we go to the conditionary".
"I think that's what to go in some prayer of the gasome", Plachø is quite close to the race solution when you know that it is about the seat of Janoušek's company.
However, in accordance with Bśezina, he emphasized that these knowledge were more covered from the newspaper than that he would be his own word chat.
It seems that there is no similar skin among social democracies to be sentenced to the witnesses.
"I asked my colleagues too, but obviously there's something that really doesn't exist with us."
"We call us on the name, and we also use sculptures or names", says the Chairman of the Prayer sSD Petr Hulinský, who is called "Hulda".
"In the school I was called Bśíza (Birke), but I don't know whether I also call my colleagues," Karel Bśezina gives us his spot names.
The newspaper Denic Update.cz tried the name and see that - he works.
The "Opa" or less friendly, for the parties, the "Opa", representative of Miroslav Poche, who has taken attention to himself by powers to the party's sponsoring, is called by some colleagues "Igráček" (known Czech Lego-figur).
The names are the only to allow social democracy in the internal language use.
Hulinský may not be called "Hulda", but Denic Update.cz recorded another name of the Chairman of the Prayer.
His "Doctor of the Gummiknapple Rights" is able to make Peter Hulínský purchase his title Dr. Juris at the Bratislaver Police Academia.
The government wants to join the torture of "Hexen" and gave a brochure out
Women who are planted in Burkina Faso on Hexen, generally have some common social features.
They belong to the older generation, they don't find a job - for example, for healthy reasons, they're leak and have no children.
If one of these women is "become", she is strictly isolated so that it cannot be dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Mans are rarly affected by this stage."
"Any young and healthy women remain this, since they help and generate children," a commander describes the situation in the capital of the West African State Burkina Faso in a special house to care for more than hundred women who have been cut off by their communities.
The local government has now decided to go against this abnormal "social measure".
And there was a brochure that was to connect the "hexen persecution".
But the thing has a hake.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso can't read", said the newspaper "standard" to the dilemma of the written statement.
In other African countries, the heavyness has also been driving and earned.
In Ghana, the neighborhood of Burkina Faso, the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahov was tortured by three women and two men to death, and they slaughtered with petroleum and simply slaughtered them.
The BBC server reported about this event.
However, the murders pointed out that the matter would only be a confront of unfortunate circumstances.
Successfully your version is broken oil that is used for ritual savings.
Even after the group tried to "a bad spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "Hexen" supports people here without regard to their education.
"The Standard" quoted here a 42-year-old employee from Burkina Faso: "Frères of human souls are previously a risk than today," he said.
While, at least, the government in Burkina Faso is trying to develop the Hexen Year, the President of Gambian has communicated itself in the past year.
"President Jaya Jammeh was a monster hexenjagd after his death, since this share of their death would now be tried to kill the Presidents himself by black magic."
"That he called the shamanes from the nearby Guinea, who were in charge of the police, soldiers and the body garden of the President, who were uncomfortablely arrested by women and men from the Gambian villages and brought into the farms of the President in Kavali," reported the Organization of Amnesty International.
The farm were forced to drink an abuse from plants with suluzinogenic effects, but also enhanced dark and nine problems.
Two of the repented people did not survive to the farm.
First, because of the international pressure, nearly thousand prisoners were released again.
A mixer of Bakala: He warms in the hole - Despite the payment of higher currency
A older man just left the RPG Byty Customer center of the "Kohlebarons" Zdenśk Bakala, the largest private owner of accommodation in Czech.
Under the arm, a map with three new cotton contracts to three apartments: for the own and the apartments of his daughters and sons that are just a prison penalty.
All three were raised in the sog. "Deregulation" just increased the currency.
Instead of 3500 krones of month, the son has to consult for a 2 room room with kitchen of the second category 4100 krones in the next year.
"And there is no fly water in the apartment and heating there must be in a simple carbon," he tips with the finger on the new coast contract of the Son to which he has a full power.
"But something - I have signed", he explains half and half resigned.
The BytyOKD.cz citizens who are called "incorrupt and immoral" are calling for "injustice and immoral" to not simply sign the new treaties and to wait until 7 December, in which they are advertising a guideline, as they are proposed against such treaties.
But the man just wins.
"Another says that the other thing," he makes a slightest face.
The Ostrava region will soon be the great Deregulation Lab.
After New Year, this deregulation is the majority of Czech inhabited in Czech, whose fees have not been paid until now.
Currently.cz decided to visit this "Labor" personally.
The RPG warming room in Haviōov is one of four in the Ostrava region and has been cut full of the 9 a.m. on Tuesday.
Just next to the door, Bodyguards are a security agent and a calling device with her.
"First 2011," a special keyboard field on the touch screen is lighted.
Shortly tipped and the device already splits a number line.
We've discovered the number "157" and already put it on the large screen on the board room's board.
A half second later you're on the line.
Sometimes a older couple is involved in the waiting room to ask after the midst, but the shooting in the waiting room obviously does not apply the new hour.
Most people are here to solve the normal problems - repairs, insurance issues and similar.
From the midst of November, in the Ostrava region, the Kuverts with the new meal contracts fleet the majority of the total of 44.000 apartments of the portfolio of the RPG in the cart.
The RPG Byty proposes a higher rate of about 15 to 38 percent in the writings.
The special switch for the new meal in the customer centre is open since November 18th.
"The action takes something over a week, that means that it's just the beginning," the ladies respond to the back of the shield after a moment of smiling when the "Client" comes as a journalist.
Deregulation and bakalas former mountain workers are a brising topic.
Before the elections, the Vice-President Lubomír Zaoralek, who was a very deeply attacked by this subject, was not wonderful that today the newspapers were full of it.
"Finty years I want a new footbooth from them."
"It wasn't a bit. WC-Briller could switch them," the man called the open air.
To now, the employees are mainly on the switch to convince themselves that they are truly obtained the promised switch that RPG grants to them when they sign the special long-term offer.
In the Genuss of a slowly feminist should also be the other ones signing the new Meeting Treaty until 15 December.
Until now, "Deregulation scatter" in Havioov, but everything else is overwhelming from questions.
"For the total of 360 customers, only about 40 to 50 of the midst in 2011," estimates the Scalan officials.
RPG offers both on its website as well as on the wall tables of individual meal agreements where it appears necessary.
However, if the Minutes are not on the new currency, they will be determined by an independent court.
"This is not a threat but is to understand as information about the only and fully legitimate legal action", RPG says on its website.
"Here no one goes before the court," one of RPG Byty's employees and a man on the street before the customer centre gives you at least partly right.
"I have 13,000 (Crone) interests, there is 5,000 rests for me to eat where I should take the money for a trial."
Then the employee will be insecure.
"I'm seeing."
"Mr. Zaoralek tells them about the media, they should not sign and so wait for the people still," gives them.
The regulated currency ends in the majority of Czech Republics to New Year 2011 and RPG Byty is an economic need for increase.
"The existing amount of currency is not enough to maintain the housing of the housing Fund", says Pavel Klimeš, Director of the Apartment Portfolios of the RPG Byty Society, and - just the disadvantage of the housing fund, which is criticized by the Middle Easter.
During the years between 2005 and 2010, RPG could invest from the thousands of thousands of apartments to the apartments, in the four years from 2011 to 2014, it should be 5,2 billion.
On the large formatting LCD display on the box against the polsterssels in the waiting room of Haviśov, you can always find some red information.
"The measuring increases in 2011 at 15% and less than 31 200 apartments, which means more than 90% of the apartments of RPG."
"It always means that maximum of 7.50 CZK per squaremeter and month" is to read on the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments from the portfolio of RPG increased the average by 38 percent.
"In these cases, it is the extremely low average price of 19.66 CZK per squaremeter," RPG argued.
With 2600 apartments, the average remains at the same height in the next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation is not slowly in the height, but slowly carried out within four to eight years.
What more - the company has a further obligation: all income from medium increase (see diagrams) will return the company to the apartments, especially in warm loans - in new windows and in the warm deterioration.
But, priorityly, these people should be welcomed by signing the agreements on measuring.
Architects looked at - the office also belongs to a child garden
The office building of Avriopoint in Brno is the new site of the company Arch.Design.
But who would already wait here for a mini-kinder garden, with everything that belongs to: frozen walls, creative furnitures, a lot of game tools and even a mini playing place on the outside.
This child garden is available to workers of Arch.Design since last year.
The projecting and architectural office Arch.Design, from which a whole series of native brünner buildings are covered by the first designs for the new Avriopoint building with the localities for its company-minikindergartens.
In an amazing perspective, as most of its 90 employees (in) are located in the babyboom old and the company that projectors and architects return to their work as soon as possible.
In addition to the possibility to be reduced, the child garden is another bonus offering the Arch.Design its employees in the context of their social programmes.
The construction engineers and architects are so easier to bring their dedicated vocational training and children's care under a hair.
The Minikinder garden is an original idea of the employees (in) of Arch.Design and with the support of the management, they have been able to win the supporters of the European Union and of the Ministry of Work and Social Affairs for their project.
The mini-minded garden is financed by the operation programme of Human Resources and Employment Policy from the European Social Fund and from the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
With this financing (eight million CZK subsidies) the necessary institutions and equipment could be provided and for the duration of 2 years of qualificated staff and operating.
Following the expense (2 years), the company Arch.Design is obligation to continue to work the minikinder garden for three years further on its own costs.
The preparation of this project took a whole year of access, providing the Economy Rating Society a strong aid in the development of the application.
To children carefully qualified staff - a nurses and a child garden teacher, child garden can visit children without older restrictions, although most of them are over three years.
And as it's about a mini-kind garden, only five children may be present at the same time, but the day changes over several children each other.
Child gardens are flexiblely agreed on the needs of parents who have children of all employees with regard to the use of child garden the same rights - without regard to the company hirearchies and their respective position.
Although it is an individual education and work, the programme content in the mini-kind garden is comparable to the framework programme of pre-education.
The children are not only playing here, especially for their excellent education - from basic knowledge to pre-education, but also learning English.
The classroom is not only equipped with game tools and creative games, but also with a computer that is available to the children.
What more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company.
Parents can take a look at the children at all times, and so the stress comes from a far away child garden.
Parents use their working time producers.
No wonder that there are also natural and loyal workers' relationships with the workers.
Arch.Design reiterates in the Czechese company that offers significant benefits in the purchase of new employees, which are friendly to the family and strengthen their staff marketing by such programmes.
A skin house also fascinates over 100 years. Look at the interests of Gaudi
The bathroom is like the back of a prehistorical shoes, the floors like the weapon room of a dinosaurer and the balcony are shocked fishermen.
This is the Batloo House of the Catholic Architecture Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
The house, with its organic forms, took the names "Knochenhaus".
Organic forms, wild colors, the insufficient use of stones, boxes and mosaics, which remembered fassades and all-warm lines, all these are typical features for the youth style of Antonio Gaudi.
The fassade of the house plays with dreaming lines, colors and textures that remember the nature and lifestyle.
First, in accurate view, it is noted that everything is controlled by geometrie, rhythmus and meditational order.
In the night, the entire fassade is even plastic, dramatic and the special lighting increases the sight of the colours.
The same weak lines and shapes also dominate the inside of the house.
Well-formed wood copies the window frames, landscapes, sights of doors, even swimming pools and legs.
The house Batlló in the fourth Eixample on the shooting Passeig de Gracia No 43 was established by the reconstruction of a house from 1877, the architecture Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years in charge and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the welfare industry Josep Batlló, originally found on the abris of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but finally he realized the idea of Gaudís to be an uncomfortable and even more suitable reconstruction.
The House House Batlló, however, did not get Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
Nevertheless, the decorations for the representative accommodation of the reality owner and the use of Mosaics at the fassade were his idea.
However, there were many further images and artists working in the fassade.
The joint work on the projects for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful cooperation of Jujola and Gaudí.
Thus Jujol also participated in the building of Gaudís House Casa Milá at the Guell Park, where there are further works of Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its finishing, the house was taken from the huge inhabitants of its organic forms because of the shoes names "Knochenhaus".
Others again called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "speaking house".
It is also said that the sword of the Holy George, the patron of Catalonia, is represented above the building.
But also other pichauric elements symbolize disfellowshipping religious motivations.
Gaudí was a unique centralizing system for the house at the time with relief channels and typical channels.
What's strange to do with their 45-grad nervousness.
Gaudi ignored in his flocks, consequently, all the existing construction rules and left no way out of it.
However, before the beginning of the building, the appropriate construction authorisation was so slow that the city Persistent in two years was so replaced by the result that they requested relief.
Among other things, the Councils also found that the construction of its pillars is even in the public interests.
However, the amendments were no longer, in the opposition - only fiveteen days after the invitation of the city conference, Josep Batloo made a request for approval of the relief of the two higher Stockworks of the house - and it was soon granted to it.
The houseowner himself went to the lower stages.
In the 2st Stock gallery, a company room was located in the third Stock, the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The shooting was shocked at a juvenile business.
The whole six-scale building runs a strike up to the dawn terrace.
The basic elements of the conversion were eliminated by all right lines and just lines, and replaced by bood and shooting walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern approach to mutual linking spaces.
The social part can be fully connected by opening the gateways, so that a larger society could be able to rejoice, without rejecting a certain intimity at more confidential meetings.
The house was obtained by Gaudís, except for a new fassade, also a right uncommon toilet and two other storeworks.
It is also impressionable to Gaudís game with light, as well as the blue and white glassed cachels with which the internal court is supplied and the light heights.
The game of these two colours gives all stages of the house a maximum level to light.
Thus he made the principle useful that white reflects better than dark colors that decorated the sun light on the other hand.
The House Casa Batlló, which was included in the 2005 World Heritage List of Unsco, can visit everyone today.
In the first skate, the most spacious and accurate apartment of the public is available.
The householder only decided to take this step in the year and this from the 150th anniversary of the famous Creator.
When you found that this is a rightly inconsistent business, you have helped the attentions, and it was also expressed on further common and the shooting spaces, including the shooting terrace.
However, the price to take account of the construction channel is not a patent steel, it is 16.50 euros, students, rentners, groups and holders of tourist exhibitions.
This amount refers to the entry prices to other Gaudí-budgets in the city.
Who wants to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon doors should try to close friendship with one of the householders and visit him home.
The right matrats and the right bed? Women have other desires than men
Not the greatest bed frame, but the quality of the lift surface - so matrats and rose makes the good bed.
However, they must be harmonized in order to justify the desires of the concrete user.
In the selection, many things play a role - weight, size, health status, and not lastly the sex of the skin.
It is also important for the internal in which they have been subjected to matrix and rose.
typical example?
In a weekend house where it is not regularly heated, latex matrats are not good, since they need much longer to be "heat".
Moreover, they are significantly more serious than normal polyureteshan matrixes.
And - they should be regularly sent.
Indeed, if they do not have enough relief cancers in the kern and are still on a fixed plate, the temperature is not excluded, therefore, that they are under their thickness.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what you want.
Those who were longer in the foreign, where very high matrats are commonly swimmingly, are difficult to spend on a low matrats with a hard surface.
"If all Eishockey players who have come back from the NHL, I'm sweet that they can't sleep right here."
"For their shoes, shoes and horses, they simply need a wheel of Visco-shaum (Memory Foam - a polymer of memory)."
"This recommends me, among others, that people suffering under a devastation of the nervous system so that they can receive the "information" from the legs and the skin", says Sylva Hadamcsikova, who specializes on polster mubls.
This is why I have concerned many Eishockey players years ago, but other customers also these matrix with Visco-shaum (Memory Foam).
"This is no problem today, because such matrixes offer, for example, the manufacturer Temple, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you must not be a famous eishockey player to learn the advantages of the Visco Shaum.
This "Wunder" actually works very simple.
The smell optimizes its heat and shape according to the absorpted warm, otherwise it is regularly changed to the warm body.
Nowhere it presses, in the night, it doesn't seem like a serious fight.
You're just sleeping much better.
The viskoelastic smell also provides protection against dekubitus (Wundbrand).
In the selection of the matratiz size, you should still add the length of the footsteps to the body size, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Man as a woman who is at the size of 180 cm, so you need a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each width should be available at least 90 cm, so it is 180 cm.
In individual beds, for example, in Singles, 120 to 140 cm.
The comfort half and even for possible visitors.
On the other hand, the following faust rules apply for the ideal bed width: "When you are on the back, you should still be enough for the easiered arm," says Ing. Helena Prokopova, the ad hoc master of the Polsters and Raum Exploitants, who have been widening the problems of the healthy sleep and the ergonomy of houses, and the subject also provides for special schools.
With a double bed, each one needs a own red and its own matrats, but check at the purchase so that the matrats are equal to the same.
On the other hand, nothing else remains than mounting the rose in different heights and it is not possible for all bed frames.
Shum matrats should be at least 14 cm high, matrats with Fedskellet 15 cm, which should take at least three centimeters on the shape and the fein polster.
"In the hand or in the submission, the fenders should not be shown in case," warns Helena Prokopova.
Each matrix requires a special root type.
Full-powered beds with mats and subscription like adult siam-willings have nothing to search in the bedroom.
These matrixes are not able to smell and the reference can not be able to smell what is already slow and weakened today.
And as you lose sweat in a single night between 0.2 to 0.75 l, it is clear that the matrats will be slowly to a huge (and hidden Sieb) after five to seven years.
This is also why advertising advertising journalists who promised a life period of up to 25 years, even long-life guarantee.
Everything's got her, but.
And therefore a practical advice from the handlers: in matrats of 120 or 140 cm width, you should not look at the hygiene of the quickable, slightly sweet smells, but it recommends to use a matrat shoes that can easily get away and wake up.
Even today, while in the ordinary matrix furnitures are produced with the rundum finishing, there are two half of them after opening (which is important for the washing process and the washing machine!), the manipulation with larger matrats, especially only executed, often as the incomparable fight between David and Goliath.
Do you have a fixed place in the bed instead of a red?
Get out of it!
Or best for a bed for unloved guests and for one night.
Also, they should use the plates more likely with swimming pools (if they are no longer there) and matrats with feedskelets and 15 cm minimum height with sog sweet sweets and feinpolars.
Polyurethan matrates do not include a subscription.
For uncommon late races with 14-18 feet leaflets (Lamelles) are suitable for latex or sandwich rats (e.g. combinations of latex and cocos), raws are always paid with a larger number of latinists, i.e. 28 and more federalists, with gloves in the lent effect and the possibility to regulate the latin dusts.
There are no matrats with feed cell, as they do not react to the ergonomic vision.
Besides setting the stages of the federalists, special flexible flexibility modules are also offered.
This applies to a specific verification of the federalists, which allows the federalists to press or win so that they allow the punctuary inclination of the slaughter's slaughter.
Nevertheless, it is important for men with wide shoes.
There are even matrat manufacturers that have started to use "herren matrats" zones for the shift area.
It is also thought to the ladies - they are blessed in the harvest.
For the most complete customers, the pointelatic floors systems (Lattoflex) or the red with pointelastic contact paths are determined with soft multitrusion feeding.
The pressure is distributed on several points, which reduces the swimmingness.
But - if you use a bad (to large and full) head cups for right matrats and red red, most of the benefits will be lost again.
There is also a faust rule: the head box should support the head, its fingers should only be rich to the shooters so that the sleeter muscles can be able to relax.
Ideal therefore appears a 50 x 60 cm large skin, such as the scandinavials.
In the page, the head box (complied with the loading area in the red or the shift area in the matratze) should be compared to the height of the shift.
Something has had our modern matrats with the unique (completed with heu) strokes but commonly.
Modern manufacturers always use frequent natural materials or at least their employments.
The new magical word "Bio".
Instead of terrestrial olive oil, it is used to produce polyurethane oils that are always often natural - for example Rizinus and Soja oil.
Soja is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio says to Matratzen, which consists of its pure natural origin from materials", says Peter Vašíček from the company Tropico Plus.
However, natural substances are also used in the manufacture of matratrics - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
However, you can also give microcapsules that extend fresh forest or lavendelduft when sleeping.
There is also a difference between husband and wife.
While the male is used a "coal" plant extract from birds, so that the matratiz dissolve the warmth and can coal the body, the attractions for women "warming" effects have.
Extracts from red paprishots rain the blood circle, the weak sex is so warm at sleep.
And today's favorites?
Matrats from caltview (he has larger porns with destroyed cell structure and therefore is more active than commercial polyurethan and also much more flexible).
The combination of the various skins (art) of cold shoes and viscos shoes consists of several zones that know exactly where the head is, halfs and pheres.
However, for a high-quality matrix, we have to consult 7000 chrones and more.
However, health rates are generally lower taxes, as they apply as medical aid.
As the first Czech company, Gumotex was shared in this advantage.
You're seeing to shoot the matrats and the red is not so easy.
There are special offers of manufacturers and handlers offering two matrats for the price of one.
Thus the Marke Magniflex offers the matratze duofree with a relatively hidden Visco-shaum memory for 11.990 CZK.
The second will be obtained free of it.
It was the material temperature which led to the era of the viscoelastics with open cell structure and high density in close cosmic time.
No wonder, they've been developed for the NASA, because the astronauts have been executed in the start of large overloads.
Temperatural smells in heat, in quiet medium, it will be firmed again.
So it is perfect to the human body and optimum distributes the body pressure.
It is therefore not just ideal to prevent printing bread but generally increase sleep comfort.
Viskoelastic grains are not only used for matrats, but also for other health products, such as special footpolars which should facilitate the legs and the grains.
Inland manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More parents want human supervisory devices to be controlled by children
The fear of own children grows, and so more parents are going to observe them by GPS.
The system, which was originally designed to explore cars, may also provide good people in order, which would also be helpful in such cases, as in the shortest possible loss of the nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is now almost as large as a cigarette chair, but it should not be greater than a weapons sacrifice.
Many people have the case of the lost Anička fear and fear, so they keep in means and ways to protect their children better.
In addition, for the price of an impairment of its privacy.
"We're trying to say all of us that there's nothing to do with nervous sponsoring, but to reduce the probability that it comes to tragedy," Peter Pilin from Macro Weil, one of the providers of GPS control devices on the Czech market.
"I give you that, in particular, it can come to the abuse of such devices, for example, if someone shoot it into the table, without he knows it, but we had no case before now."
"The majority of customers really purchase it from security reasons", adds Pilin.
His opinion, however, should always know what's the purpose of serving the "shale" and how to use it in the emergency case.
The child psychologist Dana Bočková notes, however, that a child, if it doesn't like it, is just completed.
"As a very small child shows great creativeness when it's about to lose certain things in a sense if they don't want to be controlled."
"When the phones started with the parents' expectations, but they let themselves get off as easy as these new supervisory devices," says Mrs. Bočková.
Your opinion is also struggling whether such a institution is really helping in the case of a attack.
"Before planned discovery, the kidnapper controls practically whether the child has any electronics with which it can be ordered."
"This is the phone today."
"If such monitoring devices are more widely used, they would also search for this because their sale would be safely accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases the police's offenders are always a step forward," the psychologists say.
However, it seems that similar devices can be helpful by means of a padophile.
According to the company RC Monitoring, the location services are offered for cars, as well as for persons, the existence of such a device can also help if it be destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device, in fact, can be set so that it reports the position in certain interferences."
"If it would soon be destroyed, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"At more devices are even integrated by a swimming meal, which means when you go and stay without movement, the device immediately sends a warning under the position," states Mr śech.
His view of similar services could also perform intelligent mobile phones with navigation, just play a special software.
The problem of the current location devices is that there are machines in striking shirt shops, slight or smaller phones.
It's always so dangerous that you lose her.
Mr Pilin from the Macro Weil is therefore tested in the present devices that look like normal digits.
"This has the advantage that the possible angryer must not even recognise that it is a monitoring or location device.
"or he knows it only after a certain time that the police has a time prediction," he adds.
Equivalent to what direction the development is - to armed countries or attachers, is always using the same technology as in the vehicle system.
So for the combination of location functions using the GPS system (such as Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many snacks that you can spend completely Czechs but only two years
The Czech Army has been purchased 445 miles [445 km] Czech Army, assembled with springs.
In the past year, the Defence Minister had already been delivered to the army guards by 224 miles [224 km].
It is quiet to know that the forces have been employed for 225 years.
The problem is only the duty of the duty - two, but at least four years.
The army purchased the thirty-shirts of the sharehold company STV Group, e.g. for the laptopic 40 million crons.
In its foundation for the purchase of this wide quantity of trial, the Generals tab MF DNES answered that soldiers would consume a yearly 60 kilometres of twenty-four.
According to the research of armee Pyrotechnicians, MF DNES, this indicates that the whole army should complete a very intensive pyrotechnical training annually - from all generics and officials of the army command, to the secretarians and puzzles.
Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Armee General Vlastimil Picek are not excluded.
Only so was the considerable annual consumption of sixty-kilometers of twenty-five kidneys justified.
This length corresponds to the other 25,000 detonations.
But this would also be rich for more than ten years.
However, if the old rules of experts apply that, to train each new professional soldiers, two meters of twenty-five feet, the army has been created by this new purchase - even under the view of the growing needs of the pioneer and special units - a quick for the years mentioned 225.
So the soldiers of the rapid invasion responsibilities were slowly estimated to the Minister of Defence of Daridra, they almost had no patterns for handfire weapons, so that the missing funds were strongly limited.
It's a very sweet smell.
"I'm not going to make them buy from us such sweethearts."
But this is finally their decision, they will already know what they need."
"For us, the army is a good customer that we want to come as a handler most widely", says the STV Group Jan Dæckī.
Jan Pejšek, the speaker of the Ministry of Defence, is based on the purchase of hundreds of miles of centuries, so that the army had been covered at least for ten years with this "munition".
However, Jan Dæckī by the STV Group only speaks for a four-year-old use period of the police and army pyrotechnicians for only two years.
"It is likely to be the four years mentioned to be perfect", one of them is, but who wants to remain angry in order to not be regarded as soldiers for the criticism of the army.
After the time of use, any munition must be tested greenly whether it is still reliable and not threatened to the lives of soldiers.
But these tests are not anywhere, but cost more money.
Another argument of the Defence Minister is the quantitative rabatt for the 445 km Cündshur.
"He costs us sixty percent less than the last year delivery of 244 km," Spracher Pejschek shares the position of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Only compared: The annual consumption of pyrotechnicians of the police, the munition from the Second World War or the Soviet Brothers Army has been over a few years.
And the police always orders the amounts of these munitions that they can consume before the time of use.
As a result of the safety of the pyrotechnicians, the possibility of flexibility to purchase more modernly and thus reliable skins are open.
The Ministry of Defence has no major problems in the liquidation of ten thousand tons of munitions from the Warschauer Treaty when the twenty-five thousand Czechoslovakia People's Arms were prepared on their camp towards Rhein.
According to the pyrotechnicians, who spoke to MF DNES, the Czechian forces expect the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of miles of miles old kids that they have purchased today so "favourable".
To date, the contacts I have won thanks to the competition
The segry placement in the competition "Client Employers of the Year" has helped Lukáš Pytloun to sell his hotels in the sale of Franchise.
The winner of the last year of the competition "Clean businessers of the year" was Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The history of his success is like a film scenario.
Lukáš Pytloun would like to travel.
First, in the foreign, he was aware that it was lacking aware prices in Liberec for good night overnight opportunities.
From the expenses of his holiday work in the foreign area and with a bank credit he built a building house with five apartments.
Remember that he was a high school student in the sixth seed, this was certainly a courageous undertaking.
"The ancient price-quality relationship was famined me and so I tried to do something but," says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first rebuilding apartment was avoided by foreign workers.
The whole wine was immediately invested in the house, which he then converted step to the pension with 54 beds.
Sither, in only seven years of entrepreneurship in Liberec, there were four pensions, two quiet restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was until the four-star hotel "Pitloun Design Hotel".
In this year, another first-class hotel was added.
"We have signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tè, which we sold our Franchise concert and other interests in the Franchise of the Pytloun hotels have already been reported", says the entrepreneur number one of the last year.
"A great part of this license sale for business of hotels had just been the winning in the competition "Awards of the year", adds Mr. Pytloun.
The victory has introduced him more advertising and popularity in Liberec and environment.
"The people recognized me on the street, often grateful to me, and I have to say that it was good," he remembered.
I really recommend everyone who want to make something to participate in this competition.
You also don't need to win, every view is good.
He says he's worthy of contacts and advertising to whom otherwise wouldn't have come.
"In some people I have taken thanks to the competition, I have maintained regular business relations until today."
The success-related rhythm is also a little understood by each of its employees.
And he's there at the seventy.
"I note with them more loyalty and pride that they are part of something that is shared in general recognition."
I also see this not only as personal success, no, this is the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name is just shocked on the front," Lukáš Pytloun says to decide.
My followers, I wanted a more calm year when we had it in Farmet
The Siegeseuphory was quickly dissolved from the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his goal, Farmet has the worst worst behind.
The price for the first ring of the Vodafone company in the past year, Karel śarskī, was taken from the farmers.
The Jury then acknowledged the efforts he made a company from the small instrument construction in Skalice, which makes hundreds of millions of arrangements.
"I can say that this estimation is not only me, but also encourages all my employees and has strengthened our self-consciousness in fighting with competition", says the previous year winner.
At the beginning of the farm history of Farmet, the efforts were to do something useful.
And when the state of his father Karel śárskī as a compensation for the property of the communists, a small workplace, he did not take long, left his career in the company where he was up to it, and founded with a number of cameras his father's own company to produce plastic waves.
Shortly later they began to concentrate on plant oil pressures.
In the course of 18 years, they increased the largest manufacturer of automatic prices throughout the Mediterranean.
But only through the success of the competitive and its medialization, it has also been conscious of the non-faculty.
"Don't just that our customers now make the Marke Farmet more intensive, but our foreign partners also began to cooperate with a company that has made the greatest success possible in their country", says Karel śarský.
However, the winned year was not only in the sign of the Siegeseuphory.
The estimation was made by the economic results of the company in 2008 and one part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the hardest year for sale of toolbuilding products.
The crisis, which still less citizens, but mostly protected enterprises, just reached their higher point - many companies were forced to set up their investment projects and to limit the purchase of new institutions and technologies.
"We couldn't, of course, get out of this situation."
"The arrangements returned to 40%, we had to limit the production and even to discharge," says Karel śarskí.
A life-based enterprises must also be taken by such impopulative measures.
However, it became possible to get the situation into the griff and to keep the company into the black numbers, even with lower wines than before the crisis.
In one case, the company was not intended to make stricts - in investments in research and development.
"We built a research and training centre for the committee, we increased our representation on international measuring and obtained main prices in domestic exhibitions," says śarský.
Everything proves that we've surprised the crisis.
The channels are again growing and also the number of new employees.
"The new victory I want to have much joy in the victory - but in a quiet atmosphere," lets Karel śarský.
A question of opinion which is subject to unreasonable rules
The question of the "Abusiveness of the year" is fourth part of the entrepreneur's competition.
Some unreasonable rules have already been made to create out of the world.
To the doubtful winner of the next year's opinion "Absurdity of the year", the obligation to create documents on authorities available on the online.
In this way, more than one third of the not totally four thousand enterprises decided.
So the Social Insurance Management requested a paper exit from the trade register, even if the officer had been able to call him by two clicks.
Thanks to the view question, this changes now.
"The Czechese Social Insurance Management will no longer demand any extractions from the commercial registry in future in control of social insurance payments", the speaker of twenty-first Jana Buraśov acknowledged.
In the sense and purpose of the opinion "Abusiveness of the year" it is to take all the rules and arrangements under the lupe, to comply with the employees in Czech and to deal with the unbelievable ones.
This is already fourth part of an entrepreneurship competitive, which is organized by the Ts. economic period (HN) and enjoyed in the publicity of growing popularity.
If in the last year the three thousand people participated in the vote, it was already four thousand in this year.
No wonder, since there is still a lot of legal obligations that are only and only served to defeat the enterprises.
"Besides, for example, the number of income tax forms, we take a front ring in the world," notes Karel Havlíček from the association of smaller and medium-sized companies and business partners of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurship is the proclamed goal of all governments in the past years.
However, the situation in Czech was unlikely improved in comparison with the world.
According to the World Bank's information, the 74th ring of Czech Republic takes place in comparison with eight worse places for the previous year.
The competitive absurdness of the year was the first time in the year, and each year, after the same scenario, plays.
Each man may report from April to September to the drafting of the competition of administrative and bureaucratic instincts.
The website's website is available at www.firmaroku.cz. afterwards the competitive events of seven candidates for the "anti-price" and the public will vote on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdit and www.ihned.cz.
It looks like the absurdness that receives most of the voices.
For this year, more than hundreds of opinions have been reported, as exactly said 105 without rules and arrangements.
The tips are not only employees, but also professional associations and journalists.
For example, under the named "finalists" of the competition, there are provisions that the maintenance vehicles for cars and fast roads have to be paid or that employees with twenty employees, two offices and two toiles are required every two years.
The register of the "seven" this year is published on the sides of the competition.
The appeal of competition at the Prayer of Wensel is part of a hapening which regularly participates in the personalities of the political and public life.
In this year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the Director of the Association of Small or Mediterranean Employees and Czech Republic and Peter Kuğel, the President of the Czech Republic's Trade Chamber at the level of competition with the Party.
"When the State moves to the entrepreneurs, it cannot be real economic relief, so it is my goal to add at least three paragraphs each year, which are still unnecessary to the employees', Martin Kokurek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
The efforts to create insensitive orders from the world show effects.
In 2007, most of the employees imposed the obligation to report to the acquirement officer on their permanent operational site three days before they intended to go to an exhibition or an exhibition.
This obligation has been deleted by a new force of the acquirement law.
The obligation to obtain the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the obligation to report to the Working Office of Employees' Service visits up to 30 days - was deleted by the law on them. "Green card".
And - all good things are three:
For the absurdness of 2009, the Regulation was chosen to have a specimen, a cold jail and two personnel guards in the conversation room.
This Regulation has been mixed by the Ministry of Health in a few months this year - the cold disease has fallen away.
A new category allows socially responsible companies
Assessment criteria are humanitarian, environmental, education or sport projects
A new newness in this year's fifth year of economic period competition (HN) is the category "responsibilities company of 2010".
Thanks to this competition, it is to promote intellectual and fair enterprises.
"We want to support such companies that are aware of the consequences of your entrepreneurship and support socially responsible initiatives", says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile firm Vodafon, the exploder and guarantee of this competition, as well as the "rebell of the year".
For the first year of this special subcategory of the main competitive undertaking Vodafon Company, companies reported that success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspired and bad enough substance for an independent article.
Although they differ in terms of their activities diameter, their efforts have a common numbering support and consideration.
This is, for example, a person who has been engaged in personal problems or the health of the own employees.
Thus, among the fourty finalists of the whole Czech Republic, the Prager Software Company Et Netera, who promotes the development of non-formal sport teams among its employees, which then participate in numerous tours in various sports most.
Another example of the most responsible company in the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, who is the main sponsor of a foundation fund for children already seventy years ago.
A paper manufacture from Podśbrady is also careful for her healthy employees who are 70% of their involvement, for which it was accepted by the title "The Witness of the Mediterranean Bomen Company"; in the Vodafone company of the year, it was the third ring in this region.
In the Olomouc region, the booking company MiRyz Soft, which launched a flying and also a average of 35 hours per week, and that was not relatively rewarded.
The Jury also honored the title of the company to buy in Czechic producers, support citizens initiatives in their environment and works according to environmental principles.
"We strive to recycling as far as possible to keep the consequences of our entrepreneurship and environmental management as soon as possible," states her business leader Miluše Ryznarova.
The IT Enterprise login from the region Ústí Nad Labem is again located in the health of its employees and therefore has created them to all the notebooks Ergonomic Sessels and Tastatures, which promotes it in their employed homework and uses cartering services offered by a secretly protected workplace.
"We also support the Foundation "Man in Not", which provides concrete assistance to the famous Roman community", says Ondśej Search, representative of the company.
Not lastly, the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištæní" in the region is also referred to as the value of its employees in the form of extra payments to their pension insurance.
"We provide our employed contributions to the manufacture, the workway, to increase their qualification and vacation," said Josef Strapáč from the Czasch company from Bruntal, the winner in the Morish-Switzerland region.
To the category of Responsibility Companion of the year, all sectoral financeers of the Vodafon Company of the year were automatically reported that responded to the questions of the questionnaire submitted to the registration and sent it to the events at the late 15 August.
False or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the event.
"When the representatives of law enforced the questions, they were excluded by the competitive "responsibilities company of the year" in the main competitive Vodafone company of the year, but they were not disqualificated in this way."
"A separate registration is not possible only to this competition, as it is only a subcategory of the main competitive company of the year", says Karel Goldman from the organized Agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Land Funds - Police arrests at a public registration
In the building of the ground fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police was introduced in the last few days.
In this way, the huge media entrepreneurs and real estate leader Luboš G. was deleted by the detectives in hands.
This had used to handle a public competition that was just happening to implement restitution rules so that the foundations offered in the competition would be a concrete interested person.
This will have paid a half million to Luboš G..
"To this time, I can only confirm that the police follows a person because of the crime of dominant power in a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, the Chief of the Pilsner State Authority of the Journal of Pravo, could not provide further details on the current investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old employee was resigned from the police.
How he could handle the public competition, it can only be spectacular in view of the current official information.
The speaker of the Land Fund Lubomír Šerná addressed the question of Pravo, which the police had actually taken prisons in the Pillners' side of the Earth Fund, and it was during a public competition.
"It was about a customer and took place for one of our employees," she explained.
The public competition had, according to Ms. Šerná, the right name "Officiation for Provision of Privileges for Transmission of Basements in accordance with the ground law" and would occur in cases where several applicants are interested in the offered base.
"They provide a higher value in the context of the request, as a result of the transmission, of the restitution stipulates to be compared, than the basic value of the called base."
"In accordance with the offered claims the result of the potential purchaser is determined, then the ground fund shall transfer the basement to the person with the highest offer," the speaker of the fund explains.
Luboš G. was obviously available to information who had registered on the invitation and because he himself was a qualified person because he had purchased a series of restitutions, he asked a basic interest that he returned from the competition.
Obviously against a fat discharge.
This would also be a sufficient declaration for the reason why he had a large amount of money in his finding.
Luboš G. had too good contacts with the Pillner Land Funds in the past.
He also played a role in the cause of the former Head of the Land Fund, Václav Sankota, which was criminally persecuted, because he had found foundations in replacement refunds for which positional decisions were already considered for building projects.
Thus, Luboš G. from the ground fund, for example, also found foundations designed for the construction of public roads, were more accurate in the place where the construction of the carriage Magazine was planned to the Borské pole.
Later he introduced this very favorable with the magistrates against a house directly in the historic centre of the city, which overcomes the value of the bases.
The Council's House had to have a serious heart-in-law in order to avoid the construction project by blocking the baselines.
The housing costs of households increased in some hundreds of monthly
The budgets must not only receive higher costs for all types of energy, but also with higher water and waste expenditures, and for television and some places.
Familys will have to take more than hundreds of chrones from the portemony since January.
Electrome is up to 4,6% torders, gas to 2% and more, in some cities you will have to pay more for water supply, and some places also deserve the heat supply.
Only electricity costs the accommodation budgets annually some hundreds of krones.
The Starkstrom travels have been decreased by all the main suppliers, and therefore the debt is the clear promotion of the production of electricity from renewable sources, notably from photovoltaics.
Gas is only slow, but this is exactly when most people need to heat and have the highest consumption.
So here is also to be acknowledged with some hundreds of chrones per year.
While electricity and gas are more costing in the whole Czech Republic, the prices for television from town to city are different.
In particular, larger places plans price increases.
For example, the households in Pardubice and Hradec Kralové have to pay more monthly to 50 krones, more than 1000 krones per year in Liberec.
The population of Praga again threatens 9% higher water and waste expenditures, and this is the case that the city increases the infrastructure.
If the currency is not changed, there are only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague is in comparison with total Czech Republic, however, still with the lower.
In the northern pool, where prices are now the highest, water and waste costs are to increase 7.4 per cent.
For example, large price increases are expected in 140,000 accommodations, with a decrease of regularity from January.
For example, the Apartment company CPI Byty, which has 2500 Labem apartments in Ustí, plants to increase the mills from January to 100 percent.
Who does not agree with this increase, the company wants to be legally interested.
In the next year, the regulated fees that are still paid in about 300,000 apartments would increase more than 10 percent.
Czech children drink with TV and Rum Beer is out - it works just too slowly
Fernet, Rum, and Wodka, soon a good wisky that was stolen to the father from the home bar.
These are the drinks that have to be treated as most frequent after the Genuss of Czechic adolescents.
There are no children who have to sleep their card again in the hospital.
This results from the experiences of doctors faced with similar cases in the inclusion of clinical departments.
"Ber or wine are completely out of the mode, because it's just too long until it's broken."
"The current trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Pravo Ludśk Pelikán, the Chief of the Chief of the Chief of the Chief of the Chief of the Middle Clinic Hośovice.
"Whisky, if it's possible to get a flat out of the home bar, and if not, at least television or Wodka.
"Woodka has the advantage that you can smell him with the juice, then he doesn't smell so strong," said the Chefarzt.
The speaker of the university hospital's Motol Eva Jurinova is right to him.
"The most frequently it's about television or rum."
"This is the today's alcohol attraction, not only at basic schools."
"It also went towards Slibowitz, which you take from home to house," Mrs. Jurinová acknowledged.
According to Chefarzt Pelikán, there are no exception of 30 or 40 years of age in the hospital injury.
Before the clinic in Hośovice, in which he worked since this year, he was working for ten years in the hospital Department of Motol, where the cars of rescue was shocked from Naa and TV.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"Is your carriage began with 12 years when they first started with 3,5 promills of alcohol in blood, and still in combination with "extase", the doctor described a special serious case.
"It was in the exhibition in Holešovice on a dance party."
"The interesting thing was that her mother wasn't rare that her daughter had not come home 48 hours," the Chefarzt surprised.
If the lack of interest of parents or their incredibly tolerance with their own prostitutes applies as one of the main causes for the growing alcoholism of children.
For a real dependence in the true sense of the word, experts do not follow children.
"Unlike alcoholism, a long-year chronic dependence of the alcohol is to understand all related phenomena, and this is not the case in these children."
For those who have repeated alcohol, a negative family-social background is characteristic,” says Chefarzt Pelikán.
The speaker of the Hospital Motol, Mrs Jurinová, has been placed up to mid November for about 40 kids to the honourable Division for Child and Youth Medicine.
However, only the cases with serious alcohol injury, which needed a hospital residence, are in the statistics.
Not registered children who are sent home after an ambulance treatment by parents or, where appropriate, from the police.
In addition to the cases in which children have only a flash snaps in the school bank, Mr. Pelikán believed that three years-time addictions have been able to leave for hundreds of years: Walpurgift night, Silvester and the end of the school year.
"The last named for two reasons - either from grace for the bad witness or joy on the holidays."
"I have already experienced seven kids in the shopping night," stressed Dr. Pelikán.
A strike child, who slows the night under medical supervision, is paradoxically better than a child who has to fight only with a slow card on the next day.
The head pain in the morning, which produces dehydration and glucose injury, can be left in the hospital with an infusion of glucosy and nutrients that lack the body.
"They are clearly better, because after the "good" experience on the night, they swim with a good laune, without anything hurting."
"It's just something confused of where they are," Dr. Pelikán says, "which gives the patients at least the good laundry by he gives them the costs that she costs the treatment.
Because the transport with the saving car and the night in an accommodation bed is good and pleased to a few zig thousand chrones.
"I used this as a educational instrument when I had just calculated the children at the visits what had costed their turbulence, and that it can happen, that once she needs to work on the whole feasts to win the money for a single feast," added Dr. Pelikán.
However, the hospital cases do not apply to regulatory procedures in order to require the costs required for the raising of children.
Two train flights L-159 first in foreign hand - in Spain
Two slight fighters L-159 from a total of five that have surrounded the Czech Republic of Defence against the Casa C-295M, are fled in the Spanish city Sevilla, where the Spanish aircraft producer Casa - EADS is seated.
It's the first time that machines of this guy have a foreign army.
In the foreign area, they were only seen at man or flight shows.
This is the fluctuable two-site version L-159T1, which was employed by the Czech Army.
The remaining three flights are L-159.
These are still stored in the Aero Vodochody, the Commissary of this business - the company Omnipol - has taken her overnight week.
When she shipped the aircraft physically from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek is not known according to the speaker of the defence minister.
The united fighter L-159 was once again specialized from long-term engaged aircrafts, without any other installations and investments from the Ministry's resort.
"The double L-159T1 was exhibited in the current condition and appearance," said Pejšek in the Pravo newspaper.
He added that the army should not be issued without two-second fighting instruments, as the Defence Ministry signed in May 2009 with Aero Vodochody a 200-million contract on the reconstruction of four overfluent L-159 to the second version.
A new aircraft took the army in July, second wants to take her to the end of this year.
In accordance with Pejchek, EADS was obliged to implement the fighting instruments in the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"The contract is clear and clear that the EADS company is EADS operators of the aircraft L-159 and that they should serve for the training of NATO pilots.
"It is, therefore, the lawyer's way he realises the thing," Pejschek urged.
The economic period (HN) has also reported that the Spanish government had no interest in the L-159.
The shipping of five L-159 against a Casa transport aircraft and the purchase of additional aircraft for 3,5 billion chrones were yet authorized by the government of Mirac Topolánek last year.
The Defence Minister had then not explained the accounting procedure for the purchase, but EADS directly agreed.
The current Defence Unit argued that this tax will be supported for the future export of L-159 to the Foreign.
The Czech Army purchased Aero 72 machines, from which she used only 24, the rest wanted to express her.
The purchase of the flights of Casa should, however, have a legal basis.
The European Commission declared the Czech Republic of Defence, in particular the European Court of Justice, that is why, the aircraft had to be chosen because of a whole European registration and to communicate with a single manufacturer.
The army has already got three aircraft houses, the last is going to be on the Kbely Airport within fourty days.
A longer display finger than ring finger means a lower risk to hurt cancer
Man whose showing fingers are longer than the ring fingers are apparently exposed to a less risk of illness to prostatatic cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on mid-day British Journal of Cancer.
Indeed, this is to combine with the sphere of the men's hormone testosteron.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostatatic drugs and this is narrowly with men to sixty," said the co-actor of the study, Ross Eeles, professor of the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help to determine what men should unlike a prostatatic drug test, especially if genetic risks or other risk factors exist, such as family health loads, accompanied Ms. Eeles.
During the 1994-2009 period, she followed with her colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with prostatatic drugs, but at the same time 3000 healthy men.
In more than half of the participants of the study, the shower of the right hand was slower than the ring finger.
For these men the same likelihood of prostatatic reabs, as for 19 percent of those who were ring and showing fingers were the same long.
However, in men whose spectacular finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk was 33%, with men to sixty to 87%.
The relationship of the two fingers mentioned already in the prenatal age reflects obviously the different spirits of gender hormones which the child was expressed in the natural mother.
Return testosterone corresponds to a longer shower.
Previous research shows that the testosteron slows the growth of prostatation reactors.
Václav Pačes, a leader of the Czechian genetics and former President of the Scientific Academy, said to him whether this study was well known, but he had not yet been "human" for the relationship between the finger length and the cancer risk.
Czech in the snow - D1 and D5
Like the largest part of Europe, Czech too is on Thursday mornings.
On the streets and roads, the winter serviceers were many places all night on the axis.
The D5 cars between kms 89 and 90 in direction of Rozvadov is locked by some Lkws and Pkws accidents and the D1 at Brno in direction Prague "stand".

On the roads which can be settled from natural protection only with inerte strikes, one up to five centimeters of sneedek has been reached.
In Czech, two to ten-century neighborhoods, most of them in the north of the trees - usually up to 18 centimeters.
In the Morish-Schee region, up to 15 centimeters of neighborhood.
But in Czech it's slowly shut up.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapons".
American troops have used a new "intelligent" weapons in Afghanistan first, known only under its code name XM-25.
Generics hope that this new automatic weapons affects the thereafter conflict with the Taliban and changes the relationship with the forces to their benefits.
The new weapon is something like a super-good canon.
In fact, their projects will be carried out by laser with a strike safety of just a few meters.
The special shoes of caliber 25 mm, developed for this weapon and contained high explosive sprays, operate practically as small granates.
The shoes can be programmed so that they can not only explose their balistic aircraft at the time of the time, but at a favorite point of their balistic aircraft.
This means that you can use it against an enemy that hides behind a hinderance - a wall or in the shooting grain.
Of the above, it is usually not protected, so that the murderous steel snakes of the above can simply put it out of shooting.
Richard Audett, who participated in the development of the XM-25, is the new fighting weapons that makes "intelligent" technologies use.
"The soldier is predicted as a result: he sees the goal and sends a laser rail that determines the removal, so he wins a precise view point, after he corrects the increased cycle, then only he needs to be expressed.
"If we say you measured 543 m."
"When you push, the weapon goes up and shoot the shooting on the removal of 543 meters less than one, two or three meters.
400 jobs are moved
The Fujitsu Concern leaves his departure in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July the next year, 400 employees will have their workplace from the previous office building at the Marienbader place in Bad Homburg.
The Japanese Concern Fujitsu leaves his departure in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the specialized sectors on the computer and their maintenance at the middle of the week, in July 400 women and men will have their workplace from the previous office building at the Marienbader place in Bad Homburg in the Astro Park, which is a large office complex on the Lyoner Street in the Frankfurt city of Niederrad.
A speaker of Fujitsu explained, a medium-term speaker should still be undertaken to 100 more jobs of the concert that have been distributed to the region until now.
The Mietangebot has been extremely attractive, and the large space offices also improve the work of the employees' work.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only a Mieter.
The competent business manager Bernd Wagner said, "We found a central location with an excellent infrastructure with Frankfurt-Nederrad."
The excellent connection to the airport is just for a global company as Fujitsu of great importance.
The new transfer of an important company within the region has been joyed last night at the winners and disappointment of losers.
Frankfurt Economic Deputy, Markus Frank (CDU) said to be winned a Global Player.
It's a great location recognition.
Fujitsu passes to the city, the seat is a major impulse for the Niederrad.
The Bad Homburger Observer Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regreted the decision of Fujitsu.
The city is soon informed by the business leadership about the purpose.
"We, of course, have offered our help to the company", said Korwisi.
However, friendship contacts couldn't change the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the resident of the real estate on the marine bader place.
Finally, economic reasons had been given to the explanation.
Now it goes to prevent a long space on such a prominent place.
"I hope the owners and owners of the building are cooperative."
The house used by Fujitsu and the nearby "Sweet Verticale" were part of the other buildings at the marine bathroom place ten years ago to the most surrounded building projects of the city.
As a common project of the city and a private project developer between the Bahnhof and the Council House, a new part of the city was established, which caused both because of the massive construction of the areas used to park as well as the height of the building for critics.
2001, the installation advisory and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel transport systems, the start of Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer who had yet been connected to Siemens, were the homes of Fujitsu.
The building used by Fujitsu was purchased by the Frankfurter Deutsche Real Estate Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and has continued to sell a year later to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu Consumers in Tokyo are known as the third largest IT supplier of the world.
He prepares businesses for example computer and servers and provides the necessary service.
The Rhein-Main area is one of the largest employees in Germany, however, more employed is Fujitsu in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the daughter company sets up the Fujitsu Technology Solutions in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the other daughter companies to be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, Astro Park was mixed 7000 square meters in the office building.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name plays on its extreme fundamental risk - has its seat among other parts of the central electronic and electronic industry.
Amazon sperm server - Drugs against Assange
Wikileaks devices are growing in circles.
The Amazon Internet server has dismissed the integration platform from its servers.
It may be between political pressures after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomates.
Wikileaks-Green Assange will be held in England.
The Wikileaks integration platform is increasingly higher in the United States.
Internet sharers lost access to their current American server and now search for an Internet hite in Europe.
The prominent American Senator Joe любrman called in other countries and companies to Wikileaks' boykott.
And Wikileaks-Green Julian Assange, who is on the interpol's professional lists, is to keep up after a newspaper report in Britain.
"Whileaks of Amazon servers disappeared."
"Free Speech in the country of Free" shared the integration activists by short news service Twitter on Wednesday (Original).
Shortly before, the Internet company Amazon was banned the Wikileaks documents from his servers.
Internet activists had returned to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in the publication of the secret diplomatic depths in order to enable the high access numbers to the documents.
By Twitter Wikileaks further explained: "Prima - our dollars will now be issued to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon had such a problem with the freedom of speaking, "If they should stop selling books."
Amazon has stopped the use of his server by Wikileaks after the Senator Joe loverman's workshops, the television television CNN reported on the office of lovers.
The President of the Senate Committee for Home Protection had threatened Amazon with a boykott, reported the British Guardian.
"I would like to wish Amazon that this action was previously taken in view of previous publications classified information by Wikileaks," said the Senator.
The loverman called for the platform also in other countries to be used to servers.
"Whileaks' illegal, unrelated and unconscious action puts our national security on game and threatens around the global life", says a communication of the participating senator.
"No accountable enterprises - or American or Foreign - should help Wikileaks in its efforts to extend steel material."
Wikileaks-Green Assange, which is searched for injury by the authorities in Sweden, is on the board list of Interpol.
According to a report of the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australians in Britain is known as the exact place is Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always called the investigation in Sweden as an intriguing of his enemy.
Wikileaks speaker Christin Hrafnson said in London, he gave threats.
"There was even called after a murder of Julian Assange."
Thus, Assange was worthy of his security, said Hrafnsson.
The Wikileaks green will therefore be hidden further.
Hrafnsson obviously reacted on statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican Governeur of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, requested that the responsible for Wikileaks' enthusiasms was accused and entitled.
In Canada, a government-adviser Stephen Harper said - obviously ironical - in the television, Assange should be "mored" and Obama could use "a droid".
Between the white house and Assange burned a slagabeausch.
The speaker of the American President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "shiny and absurde" that Assange had requested the return of the Minister of Foreign Affairs Hillary Clinton, if it is responsible for recently known spanings.
"I'm not very sure why we're looking for a man's opinion with a website", says Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and interests in this country are much more important than its website."
The American Government now protects its databases in full on the test.
As Special Officer, the Vice Director of the Centre for Anti-Terror Measures, Russell Travers, was appointed to share the White House.
Travers is responsible to develop "needful structure reforms" that have become necessary after the release of the reports by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to examine the way the whole government exchanges and protects the information.
The American Government also announced to want to ensure the security of dissidents and assets, they should be in danger by the Wikileaks publication.
"We've done everything to contact them," said the Foreign Officer Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if it should be necessary."
Ice University
The "Gelato University" at Bologna will be prepared for better annual years.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the greatest start and visitors from the world.
Where does the entire egg really come?
From Gelatier and Gelataio.
The Gelatier, in German some age of the iron conditor, has the creme in all the rules of the Italian ironic art.
The Gelataio takes the ironcreme from the fridge, stretchs it into the weapon and then sell it.
To know this, you must not go to Anzola de Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But who wants to know more about iron, who did not go to the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The university has established the manufacturer of iron machines in 2003 so that it is justified from its machines all the high Italian ideals.
The three-day basis course for future Gelatieri has the greatest start and visitors from the world.
However, there are also multi-term special courses around chocolate and practical practices in the shocked iron dial.
Some dream in the Midlife Crisis of a new carriage, others simply driving on the glass of their white shoes.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil through Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, the artist from California, loves Slow Food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the industry of Ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business manager and wants to make something own in a nervous job after years.
Two young Egyptians dream to open a iron in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil wants to improve the quality of the ironcreme in their bars - and the Canadian household Julia comes, because their children love Italian ironcrems.
Maestro Relator Luciano Ferrari declares the participants first the ideal properties of the perfect glasscreme.
Decisive is not only a good smell, but also the sweetness and the good conscience.
Luciano also forgot his training the shock of the national and Southern Translation: "Itlandic Gelato is just the best - and then it is still all the many Romantics."
The first step to production seems very simple.
Luciano kipps the basic accumulated milk, skin, milk powder, sugar and stabilitators in a large mixed device, which produces all of it at 85 degrees and then coals on four degrees immediately.
Then he turns a hair on the machine, and it appears to a pastorized white base cream, based on all the milk species.
Soon the dozent is collected with questions: Can ironcreme be produced only with natural substances without stabilisator?
How can you let your own experimental loss free?
Luciano warns to leave the age of time into the Irish.
Those who speak "only from natural ingredients", however, have used stabilisators - mostly a natural product, about a garage meat from the garbage.
Of course, iron can also be produced without stabilisator, only in one day it is to be sold, otherwise it is in itself together, and the customer is slowly ice swimming.
Several variations to the base mass are allowed.
It's more swimming with the aromas.
For the smell in iron, Maestro Luciano distinguishs between the additives that are buyed in the fruit department or at the beauty of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastees.
"The suppliers will all try to turn you twenty aromatised supplements."
"But you should simply try."
Or at the fruit or soft bed with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or at the ice cream from the white basic mass that becomes with eggs to yellow cream and with cacaopulver based on all possible chocolates.
Now the coursers may be able to go on the iron machines.
Luciano can produce four different species of Vanille, Schokolade, Mocca and Haselnuss eat - with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less Vanilleroma or other natural additives.
The same experiment will also be subjected to the fruit species.
More aromatic substances, more fruit-proof - it's not unprecedentedly better.
Haselnuss eis does not smell any more useful if there are more haeles.
The most popular Kiwi eis has the working group that uses more fruits, less water and little less stabilisator.
First, a balanced mixed has the shadow of a gelato correctly exposed, says Luciano.
Egg production is a accounting point: use of Pfisich powder with a lot of sugar, the sugar share must be reduced in the basic receptor.
For Zitronenis, an extra proportion of sugar is needed.
Luciano sets a device with which he determines the sugar content of the fruit species (winzer sets the oaks in the midst).
The computers will be able to facilitate tables.
Make egg no longer requires so much physical use as previously.
Not only the device for the automatic manufacture of the base mass is helped.
There is also a device in which the finished iron mixing is shocked simultaneously and refrigerated at minimum temperatures.
All automatization to desire remains small pieces.
The Brazilian Gustavo holds its courses and its courses from above to bottom with fruit, when he has the superdimensional stabmixer out of control.
"In each course," Maestro Luciano says, " it's just a question of time until that happens."
Control colors in the light
The European Food Authority Efsa has been undertaken by the industry experiencing gene plants.
This project is now formulated by the expert group of Test Biotech, which is an independent institution for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiration theory, but we have documented it well," said the Chef of Testbiotech Christoph Then on midnight in Munich.
The leader of the Efsa expert group for human-changing plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa experts have been under contract for years.
It is paid by concerts such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has, in fact, cooperated with Efsa testing rules for plant plants, and it is in a clear interest conflict, critical.
The Efsa Regulations are, in contrast, with the positions of the Ilsi, and therefore consider the documentation of the industry to be controlled by the authorities in the Italian parma.
It is already the second time that Testbiotech agrees to an interesting collection.
So if a high-ranging Efsa manager has recently been without stocks or transitional time to Swiss farmers Singleta, and has changed the pages so.
The Mediterranean Rundfunk (MDR) also had recently enthusiasmed EU controllers and industrial lobby-related connections, which have made the environmental bond as well as EU parliamentary.
However, Efsa cannot recognise interest conflicts.
It is a view to all the serial data, even in the industry, while they are of high quality, which is in a opinion.
The experts working for Efsa are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But they should open this.
Kuiper enters his work for the International Life Science Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
This itself is a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and policy, including for biotechnology without a lobby contract.
In this case, independent experts, such as humanally changed plants, are now allowed without any nutritional investigation in animals and not tested the reaction of gene plants to environmental impacts.
"We want to know, for example, what makes humanly changed but on the acker," says then.
Current practice is to be only isolated protein but not to test all the plants, which gives no admissibility results.
"If you don't find the risks, how to find them?" asked the accused.
That's angelika Hilbeck.
The scientists have been investigated in the genital technology since 1994 and are currently working at the High Technology School of Zurich.
In this area, as in the United States, the industry is still increasingly trying to influence or discrete critical scientists.
It is therefore not yet possible for researchers who have not been fled with concerts.
For businesses, critical studies would not normally be published.
"The industry controls security research", says Hilbeck.
The stone shoes
Uli Gsell has also worried, totally about 400 kilometres.
On Monday he was formed Stuttgarter Railway, the Tuba on the back.
It was Demo.
It's broken.
The story is known: In September the Baggers were pressed and began to stop a large part of the northern floor.
The Stuttgart World was no longer the same: Sig thousands of demonstrates against S21, the milliar-depth depth of the train court.
When it arrived to the building, there was a large part of the flight in the throat.
Search in 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a huge large stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is swimming pool in East Fields, 43 years old.
He's got some of the brochures.
"These stones are reliquies."
"You can't disappear."
He warms: "An earnest and poor stone, simple and earthly."
When he pulled up, he smokeed to smoke.
What he's going to do with the brooks, he doesn't know.
Stein has time.
Uli Gsell too.
The scene of the stones of the stones leads to a bowl in turbines to a former municipality depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen created his stone rule.
The 44-year-old kids act with old stones.
He's buying all those who get up at the Abris in Stuttgart.
"It would be a damn that they would shoot in shoot or disappear in the depth," he said in his office, a wood box that once was a shock.
He was shocked and threatened to tell him when he was in the newspapers in September that he bought the rest of the northern flight from the slaughter.
But he talked to the S-21 enemy for a long time.
And he told them that he couldn't even do nothing for the Abris.
And if it happens once, then it's the most sensitive to the stones.
About 200 S-21 enemies took one of the 80 kilograms serious quarters in the cut, piece price 6,50 to 14 euros.
As Andenken, however, some are hopeless to give him back to a reconstruction.
500 tons of rongen, 25 large Lkw loads.
Sometimes the half is still in the forest, the rest has been sold for a long time.
Garten owner, landscape farmer, heavy manufacturer.
From all parts they had come and had shooted out what could be taken in the copper room and ambassadors.
The storm stones of the shooting have long transformed themselves into "mooerle" or in limits of carboat prayers.
"In first, this stone is nothing special," Rongen says.
"It wouldn't be the political component."
He grows in his swimming car, makes a tour through his 20 hectares of great kingdom.
Jura studied and broken, later biology, then interested in computers, and eventually became stone snakes.
And stein lovers.
40000 tonnes of stone.
He's swearing his sweet from all Germany.
He says he's the biggest stone chairman of the Republic.
He's breathing.
In the snow, the sandstones are shiny.
"He was one of the Dresdner Marien bridges," he said.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, heat.
"My favoritsstein."
It's the way up to the forest.
He shows on a bowl: red sandstein, previous part of the Karlsruher Railway.
And go on.
"Breat Travertin."
At first, the fourders belonged to the tribune of the Stuttgart Neckartown.
Overall in the dark stone and history, Cannnamer Travertin from the Stuttgarter Police Pressidium, Roman Granit from the Dom Sankt Blasien, Tuff of Heilbronner Hospital.
What kind of job, what the shoes.
If Rongen thinks about how the stones are shooted before by hand and moved with simple flash boards and oxen cards, he will be very honourable.
"It'd be a scandal if you'd be so crazy."
He hasn't become rule, but stones aren't anymore.
But 14 people are employed today, and they have left up in the forest stone measurement, a smied, a glass tree, and a garden constructioner.
"We work hard, but it's satisfied," the resident says.
First of all, he's gonna have to go to the kitchen.
There's also a stone to save.
Talent camp a high-potential
It's raining Andrang on the buffet.
16 students swim over the laugh brown, tomaten suppe and sweet.
The Technical University Braunschweig and the Autobuilding Volkswagen have invited machine construction and design students to a workshop.
In a manner of ideas competitives, they should learn with VW-developers about the car of future specializes - and also with the people's cars.
In the strict way, many enterprises are in the shipping camp, such as VW, on cooperation with the universities.
Your mission: Return the most excited ones in the ears soon before they come to the labour market and be converted by others.
And because universities do not give opinions on the performance of their students, they are trying to pursue the exceptional projects in practice and binding themselves.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunway, the autoconcern runs around the talent.
A young dame from the Personal Division shares ball writers, gummi bars and folders with VW-Logo.
She tells the hopeless youths of practical programs and students jobs and shows their ways in the concerts.
Nico Selle from the TU Braunschweig is the project with VW.
He looks at the advantages of both sides: "Studes are in contact with the industry and gather experiences."
"What can learn students at the same time, look closer to interested candidates, and think who are as employees in question."
Such cooperation, such as sell, are not inhabited.
It's new that it's so obvious for students.
"It was the main point on the practical project, said Selle.
The fight against the fresh graduated will probably be worse.
In many sectors, enterprises are not able to look for their employees from a large number of applicants.
In particular, they need to approve, especially for high qualified workers.
In particular, the technician discipliners are in an excellent negotiation position.
According to the German Engineering Association, VDI remained in October more than 40,000 engineering entities.
And the so-called engineer lack will, according to VDI prognoses, become greater.
For the economic verification and consultation companies KPMG, Roman Dykta is on the Talentjagd.
It organizes an external recruitment events such as the KPMG Race, a modern type of snittzeljagd, where the participants must find their way through GPS coordinates.
Eight promised students want to send the company in the next year or through the United States.
In addition, participants can look at KPMG fills and learn to the company.
Whoever can, decide in two selection rounds in the prefix.
Only the Crime of the Crime of the many applicants runs to the United States.
In the shoes and shoes around the high potential at the universities, the protection is increasing according to Dykta.
"We want to get us out of the mass with the race."
"As a simple shock was too little."
For Talents-Dykta, it seems to be taken into account.
"We have contact with all members of a similar action in the last year."
"Another one stands short before her closure and wants to be with us soon," he said.
Besides the direct bull at the campus, especially small and medium-sized enterprises are also very classically on the pirch.
"We're trying to reach expertise."
"Etwa on the intersolar," reports Sitha Stübe, staff leader at the Solar Technology manufacturer world.
The Bonner company is employed around 1500 employees in Germany.
The death knows about the problem of precaution.
At the time, 35 entities are described on the company website.
"It's just very difficult to place vacant positions."
"This costs much time and money," she says.
Another way is the contact over the Uni Professionals.
Solar world cooperates with various high schools, about the university in Freiberg.
"Professionals indicate that you can do with us or write its diplomatic work."
Their advertising action is not advised to solar specialists.
For this, the company tries to spend with other opportunities: personal atmosphere, flash hierarchy and light communication.
"This can't often offer a great concert," says the Personal Chief Storbe.
The main role of the job search is not long.
Flexable worktimes, child care or good increase opportunities are further crucial factors.
In a study of the Great Place to Work Institute, the 55th place was under the 100 best employees Germany.
The Institute creates an annual best list of German employees.
This is how satisfied the employees are with their work and their work area and look at the framework conditions for employees.
Personal leader's slaughter is also expected from the placement points at the job requesters.
"I think that applicants are especially looking for external assessments about a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner warrants from the German Employer Branding Academy are firms who want to build a good call as employees with a long-term strategy.
He takes his customers more authenticity.
And that means, according to warriors, especially internal measures.
"The best way to be attractive as employees leads through their own employees," he says.
In the Branchenjargon the internal employee Branding, which is, in the field of workmark training.
"Another employees are the best messagers."
If you carefully handle his people and identify them with the company, they would be completely able to make them alone with friends and friends for their employees.
"This is like a game with bands," says the warler.
Obama stop new oil bottles
Before the Coast of the United States of Florida in the Golf of Mexico, there will be no new oil burden in the coming years.
A corresponding ban has adopted the government in Washington, and so the previous plans are finally refused.
Also, before the Atlantic Coast, new boosts are first understood.
This shared the Minister of Internal, Ken Salazar, on midnight.
Resolver for the strict ban which is intended to apply at least for the coming five years is the explosion of the "Deepwater Horison" platform in April.
Before the accident that the 11 employees cost the life and leaded to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama reported his disposal to allow new shoes in the eastern part of the Golf of Mexico.
In order to reduce the dependence of the United States from oil supplies from the country.
Those who are responsible for the promising oil in the Golf are not finally declared.
In the centre of the crisis, the British Energy Concerns BP is addressed to milliardary requirements.
A survey committee at Obamas is intended to present its results during December.
In October, Ken Salazar, Minister of Internal Affairs, had deleted the bohrstopp issued after the explosion.
At the end, various oil concerts also requested new bohr projects.
With enormous controls and strict security rules, Obama and Salazar want to exclude a new disaster.
At present, the competent supervisory authority, which was in charge of numerous corruptions projects, is primarily reformed.
Parallel has announced Obama to close lucrative tax drivers for oil and gas concentrations.
The industry is now publicly warned that the contributions in the Golf would be significantly lowered by a stretching regulation.
"The Government's plans are the largest burden for the growth of the oil and gas industry," says the result of a current sector demand by the advisor company BDO - even before the midnight's ban.
The American Energy Alliance also claims the insecurity in the industry: "No man knows what will change with the regulation."
Investments in new support projects would be deleted to further - to the increase.
Ogoniland is burned
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it rides like at the tank site: billions of litres of raw oil have destroyed the nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
Humans live from the steel, corruption and illegal oil cooks.
Celestine Akpobari means it's good.
"Don't stop," the ecoactiveist says the journalists, "You'll still get enough oil before the line."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has pursued the attempt to shut up a kid in water with the sleeves around him: In the rainy snake, the scene works almost well.
It is not to see what swimming under the surface of green oil smells.
Before she gathered her here soon, Esther Badom reported to the Ufer of the Bodo-Jetty Flights.
In the meantime, the flowing water is perfect.
Five years ago, it was shocked out of a shocked stroke of crush oil in the huge fire area.
Fishers from the neighborhood of Bodo must now roll six hours to reach in fishing water: Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Nigerdelta, applies to one of the most defeated regions of the world.
On the driving through the streamways, the whole range of the increase will be authorized.
Instead of lighting water, the motorboat blends blue flowers who smells his hand in the water, oil fingers out.
The roots of the mangrove trees were like black lacrist stages from the ground, and they were smilingly swearing their weeds.
The warm birds, as they are normal in feed areas, are seek to forgive: When the outside borders slow, it is wide in which the former paradise that rise as a tank station is shymptomed.
"What happens here is an environmental war management", says Celestine Akpobari window: "We live in permanent dangers for health."
The war comparison has been accompanied.
The area of the Ogoni is a struggle field for decades: over 60 years ago the first researchers from Europe have been organized here in the 1980s with the later executive Ken Saro-Wiwa the first resistance, where the shell Congress had to set up its production because it was dangerous for its oil workers.
Even today, the company has returned to Ogoniland: while the entire Delta region of the Switzerland's three-fold size of more than 5000 bohr sources and 7000 kilometers of raw guides are pumped more than two million phases of black gold, the oil fields in the Ogoniland are broken, to be instable, the concert is the situation.
All hundreds of meters of steady places like weird sculptures from the water: "Christ trees" are called the heads of the bowler too grateful.
They're up to 50 years old, most of them corrupted to Mark.
Once again, a such a bowl cap means acpobari, then slows a constant Roh oil in the water.
More than two billion litres are fled in the Delta's ecosystem in 50 years after expertise: a year ago the amount of oil, as they are at the Havarie of the Supertank "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the sea before Alaska, one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of humanity.
Who is responsible for the continued Eco-GAU, it will be struggled.
During the shel-concern Sabotage and the organized oil-driving steel is responsible for more than 90% of the pollution, you see environmental protective swallowing heads and pipelines are the main causer.
Shel is significantly lower safety standards in Nigeria than otherwise in the world, the US scientist Richard Steiner predicted the concert in 2008: Only the rate of defects to leads is "in a variety of times higher than the other places".
In a place that looks like a leaved, shooted workplace under the free sky, goes out of the mangrove plants: they are splitter naked and shocked up to the hill.
Among one of the many floors that are able to be able to be covered on the floor, flats a fire: a illegal small snake.
In the fass, the oil is raised over the fire for a few hours, says Michael, the chief of the group.
First, benzine takes through the grain to the basement, then swimming at the end of the carosin leadership, and finally healing.
Thus, Michael and four employees produce daily until four floors Celele to 300 liters: "This brings us 34,000 Naira" - around 22 dollars.
The Delta residents use the chronic fuel skin in the largest earthly state of Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one raffinery.
The low-price with almost 40 euro-center per liter can still provide the illegal shops: because their raw materials are obtained.
He is of "Bunkerers" who shoot the pipelinetz by Ogoniland: In this way, experts have lost at the country at least 16 million litres of raw oil every day in the Nigerdelta.
However, only a disappearing small part of the provisional inter-related raw material is divided illegally: the Leven part of the legend is filled with organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranging militarys, in tank vessels and destroyed it on the world market.
The debate on whether the environmental disaster has been debt to the surroundings of the population or the laxen production method, the activist acpobari is academic.
"If the oil corporations weren't as an introduction and they wouldn't have destroyed the foundation of the fishermen so greenly, nor sabotage nor the steel and illegal raffineries."
In the meantime, the relationship of Ogoni was particularly to Shell, but it was devastated that only a disappearing of the concert was asked: "It is likely other nationalities like Chineses are better".
Michael's gonna be nervous.
"Better time you're gone," the muscle oilman says.
"All minute the soldiers can come."
If the illicit oilverators are aware of the special unity of the forces of the war, they do not threaten to be arrested, but a painful payment.
It also wants to benefit from the raw material from the country's norms, such as all Nigerians.
"This shit witness has put our country in every way on the dogs," says Akpobari.
Factors discover dangerous construction errors in A380 trials
The A380 is obviously a great security problem.
The investigators have found a possible construction error in the investigation of a notified machine that could lead to a "katastrophical triebwork decay".
The Qantas flight now wants to send the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the noted Qantas-Airbus in the beginning of November clearly have known much more luck than ever: the Australian air security authority has identified a great security problem in the triebworks of some A380 machines, and now warned a possible construction error.
The potential defect would have severe consequences: In the connection with oil smoke, he could produce injuries and leaks, he said, in an opinion published on Thursday, by the ATSB authority.
This could lead to "a catastrophical trieb process".
These are trained by Rolls-Royce in 20 aircrafts of the A380 Railway.
The Qantas Airbus, which was required to notify on 4 November in Singapore.
The Australian aircraft has now introduced legal steps against the British Turbine manufacturers.
She found a complaint in an Australian Federal Court in Sydney which enabled him to take further legal measures against the company.
Qantas-Chef Alan Cœdès said that his aircraft will require damages for the start of November.
When the engine burned, parts were solved and damaged the traction surfaces.
Rolls-Royce made a oil burn as a cause for the damage.
After the interference, the world must now be changing to 40 tribs.
The Australian investigators announced to conduct further security tests to the superjumbos equipped with the triebworks concerned.
The security recommendation is the result of a cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB speaker Martin Dolan.
The security problem has been maintained sufficiently in order to inform all concerned.
After reporting the Qantas machine, the aircraft had maintained its A380 flight overnight on the ground.
Singapore Airlines left about three of its 11 A380 on the ground.
The air Hansa changed the driving work at a A380 as a precautional measure.
The double flight is the largest passenger flight in the world.
Country-wide snow fall solved transport chaos from
Germany totally in white: Overnight is almost snee in the whole country.
In many streets, chaos, trains and flights falls out.
At car accidents, at least three people lived.
The winter frosts Germany: Nearly the whole Republic has been cut on Thursday night - which leads many places to transport chaos.
In the north and eastern are partly 15 centimeters of dark sneedekers.
On several cars and many roads the transport is strongly limited.
In the A7 in Flensburg the winter service was in the durational rate, but it was not completed with the continuing new snee.
Moreover, heavy wicked trees were shocked over the East Sea coast.
The Federal Force for Sea Shipping and Hydrography (BSH) is expected to be at the East Sea Coast Schleswig-Holsteins from spring to storm flows with water stations of 1.2 m over the normal status.
In Sachsen, sneeze movements were leading to significant problems on the cars and federal routes.
According to the unveiled central meteomedia, the Swiss Switzerland has been forced by alarm rates - the highest level is actually.
Some 30 centimeters of neighborhood, fresh and strong winds were sneaking.
There remained a number of cars and cars in the night.
In Sachsen' maintenance, the police authorities also reported great disasters on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind led to stocking transport and stage.
In thüringen, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snow accidents.
According to German Bahn, there are significant disasters in Sachsen, Sachsen Content, Thüringen and North Bayerns.
Sneak on the sleeves, rounded trees on the slopes or destroyed overlappings and shifts are the main problems.
In Sachsen the television was to be established from Leipzig to Nürnberg.
In the Thuring Hall, a ICE had to stop his journey to Munchen.
The 165 passengers were supplied by fire helmets and savings with coal, food and drinks in the train.
Snee winds sneaked over the streets.
On large German airports, the snow winds lead to numerous flights.
In Munchen, a speaker of the airport centre has already been reported some annullations.
In Frankfurt at Main, 40 flights were shocked according to a fraport speaker.
The winter service is in duration.
Although only a few surrounded passengers at the airport, however, they are still ready for 400 field beds.
In many streets there were accidents in the middle of the night.
Tonight, a Lkw-fabric came to live with a train on a train transition in East Holstein.
The local leader was easily hurted.
Near Nürnberg’s neighboring roads came to a similar accident: there was also a car on a train crossing because the vehicle was stolen.
The driver came to life.
In the train, four passengers were blessed - the route from Bayreuth to Nürnberg was cut until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after her car on a glad street at Aghiburg.
A good news has meteorologists, however,: even though the snow will still be sweet and pull and therefore swimming in lighting evils.
But the wind will be cut off.
Only the East Sea is shocked by rapid and smiling winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to at least 15 degrees.
German bank is looking for a buyer for its swimming towers
The German Bank wants to split himself on their own marks: According to a newspaper report, buyers are looking for the money house for the two office tours at their Frankfurter headquarters.
Up to 500 million euros could take the real estate.
The German bank has made its concert in the Frankfurt Banks tours have been modernized, and the bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial center is obviously wanting to renew the costs - and is looking for a buyer for the two homes, such as the "Financial Times Germany" writes on a speech.
The reason for the planned sale did not call the speaker.
"We always check whether it is more sensitive to have or sell realities itself and then return", he said.
The largest credit institute in Germany has already been delayed after a short time.
The bank had only taken the dual door for the mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the employees of a counterparty fund and then healed.
The energy restructuring was around 200 million euros.
A sale would likely bring a lot of money to the bank.
Branchen experts estimate the value of the ports of the newspapers that are "Green Towers" instead of about 500 million euros.
Whether the building is re-employed to a fund in the ownership of the bank or to an independent investor, which is still open, said the speaker.
Thousands betray a whole partner
More than 10,000 people thought in New Zealand of the painted mountains that were declared after several explosions in a mine.
The body could not always be hidden because the security position in the unfortunate shock is still precarious.
Just two weeks ago in Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth, there was a strong explosion.
29 mountain workers in age between 17 and 62 years were disfellowshipped in days.
A summer was left in the unfortunate chair, but no scene of survivors had found.
Because of the high concentration of gift gas and the following explosions, no relief forces could be decreased because of security reasons.
After the second heavy detonation, the authorities and experts found that there was no chance of survival for the couple.
The bodys could not be hidden until now.
Now the family and friends remembered with a memory feast to the dead.
100,000 people had gathered together in Greymouth, a swimming sunlight in the neighborhood.
Two minutes long, they smile.
To the honour of the struck mountains, 29 tables were set on which heals, lamps, and the names of the companions were to see.
Images and personal objects, including clothes and surfboards, found their place here.
Before the government buildings of the country, the flags slaughtered in half mass.
New Zealand hoped that the mountains would come back to the surface, said the Neuvian Minister John Key to the members of the warfare.
"When they've never come home."
He could not end with the death of his son until he saw his body, Lawrey Drew, whose son Zen was protected in the crowd.
A number of foreign diplomates, together with the Ministers and the victims, took part in the Memorial feast.
At the first explosion, on November 19, the British and South African mountains were also protected.
Saving workers began to remove a fire inside the coalberg work on the south of New Zealand.
Once the explosive gas is slow, it will begin to recover the heavy temperatures inside the mines, President Gary Knowles said to journalists.
Fuck, warrors!
Splatters pass to art kino?
The register Nicolas Winding Refn is a new exhibition with his battle epos "Walhalla Rising" old Genre greens.
What public might the Danish government Nicolas Winding Refn have thought when he turned "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Wikinger kitchen with only one eye (Mads Mickels) frees from his peppers and spends with nearly overwhelming powers - it sounds ideal for young men's viewers in searching for blue action, just because our herd likes to sleep rabbid murder methods and his enemies spends out of the living body when he has a bad laune.
On the other hand, the inaugurations that it is actually called, the whole movie on no word, and the other figures make up at least one, two, or a few qualified death crys.
On the other hand, it is shocked and shocked in the slightly beautiful mountain landscape of Skotlands, which offers the wicked world from about thousand years ago.
Ideal better for adult Chinese ass with interest in existingism and very quiet camera drivers.
Beautiful if a movie has several target groups, it hurts only when it excludes each other.
Registor Winding Refn applies to the Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and shocked drug dealer trilogia "Pusher" as a Danish version, but it refuses to make its works with a little more humor to the Mainstream or a little less brutality available to the arthouse.
The majority of the artistic friends should be shocked from the nearly splitting brain mass and the heats.
The action fans died in the late time before long-term, when an unsuccess of free interpretation with a troop of violent Christian missionaries through the ship to Jerusalem and sets an eternity in fleet and nebel before the manship is obvious to arrive in America and continue to shine there.
No wonder so that "Walhalla Rising" in Germany did not find a kino delivery and now appeared only on DVD.
This is especially because of the pretty pictures, but also because it hides a little bit of the kino, which has paid a little attention.
In this movie it is not about dialogue or a stringing behavior, it's all atmosphere, a filmed fiber traum.
And there is no remember for the observers.
Refn slowly gives him a moment of disappointment and smells him with his sweet images and the slight-training sound trance trance tray slowly, but especially with the unfaithful hair that shoes him out of the hearts of the figures.
Only a small boy, who is faithful to the side, keeps something as innocent, and all others are struggled by anger.
In all of the pleasant herds, whose motivation will never be declared, but who will ever be for enemy and interim associations to warrants from hell, where possible to the messager of the Devil itself.
He means loss, but maybe only for those who are without a deceit.
"Walhalla Rising" is a ridiculous film that you can hate and admire, for gorgeous, rivals and surprises.
A experience.
Rare earthquakes
The Atomenergy Authority IAEA has new indications on a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
However, the country wants to take this position - still allows it to control.
On midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighting instruments have a mysterious, swimming building in Syria.
It is located on the east of the Euphrat; the next larger city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
His name is found in documents of the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) when it goes to the reactor, Syria has built the aid from North Korea in the Quader, hidden in a ball that depends on the electricity.
According to a letter from the US-Aussie Secret Service from the end of April 2008, the reactor also would have been able to produce Plutonium - from which the nuclear weapons were built.
However, for other purposes, the technicians are few of the fifty-first.
The CIA has introduced a video presentation with our satellite images.
By computer animation, she identified what components of the reactor should have been before the destruction, which was a small copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon Atom Center.
She also presented photos that showed the building from the nearby or even the internal room.
The reactor had recently stored before the invasion, it called it, but not yet was equipped with fuel plants.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, there is little more known than ever, and the races were more than the time.
The former US President George W. Bush recently understood that the CIA was right before the attack that Syria was built a reactor in el-Kibar, but few of its maintenance points saw that it had been an active nuclear weapons programme in the country.
Some secret services in Europe are more careful and speaking about only a "acceptable reactor", even if they hold the CIA representation for "plasible".
You have no hard evidence, as well as IAEA.
As far as he was sure to have a reactor before himself, a high UN diplomat in the summer only answered the lapidary that IAEA had "pleasant material to ask questions".
The shock of the "unused military buildings" created the Syrians a holy side and planned the floor greenly.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team was found under the former captain, Olli Heinonen, in the El-Kibar Spuren of Uran, which was produced by people.
Furthermore, the IAEA has received a Member State's satellite images of commercial suppliers from the time after the attack that would be more powerful than that of the CIA.
However, these receipts are not to be obtained because the unknown contractors - perhaps Israel - have purchased them exclusively.
The IAEA may therefore not verify its reality independence.
Syria has always claimed to never employ a secret nuclear programme or to have built a reactor.
The Uran stands from Israel’s weapons, declared Damascus.
But this showed the IAEA after the analysis of the particules as unforeseen.
If so, Damaskus refuses to discuss about it - just as about the satellite images.
Furthermore, the control levels are a second inspection in el-Kibar and the access to the clusters of the bomb building.
But the Israelites also slows.
"We will never comment this," recently confirmed the official position at the time of the attack, the official Primer Ehud Olmert.
Thus, the investigation of the case has been carried out since June 2008 and “develops a serious credibility problem for the Authority” as a high Western diplomat at the Site of the IAEA in Vienna, which is finally a serious violation of the nuclear weapons treaty in the area where the IAEA is expected.
As a key to progress in the declaration, the IAEA is obviously seeing three other institutions that should be "in functional connection" with the mutatism reactor - and otherwise exist.
The inspectors have not yet opened anyway for which installations it is, or what function they have or what they may appear suspicious.
According to the information of the Southern newspapers, they are called Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf, and Iscandariayaah, retreated back from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified this place and made a satellite image complex in Masiaf, where it is most likely to be one of the suspected objects.
There may be access to the three places in or directly next to a military baseline - exactly with this foundation by the IAEA.
In Vienna, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA will be sent by the United States to shoot the military stocks.
Because the nuclear detectives were noted by a tip of the US Secret Services.
The IAEA shows, including satellite photos, that between the three places and the fourth part of the Euphrat material was imported and transported.
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said, at least one of the plants could be "related to fuel production".
However, it does not provide "no indication of sensitive activities", such as uraniuming or reprocessing; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is used with uran that is not sufficient.
However, where the Uran should come and where the plutonium for the bomb should be removed, there are, in all cases, lutonium confusions.
It is also unexpected whether the treasures that could be able to be mounted to the three places.
If the hundreds of cars lost from the ground, nobody wants to have information about where the shooting was left.
The IAEA is inconsistent that the IAEA is the only few kilometers from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrat.
The former IAEA Inspector Robert Kelley had recently connected her to an analysis of satellite images for the named Magazine Jane's intelligence review.
However, receipts from the orbit show that Syria had worked on the three suspected places and removed large containers after requesting access to the IAEA.
This may be an accident, but it has not contributed to smiling the suspect.
In addition, it is called at diplomatic crystals, the IAEA has used a few months to develop a plan for inspections there which should allow Syria to realize any military secrets - only to show how large the interest of the inspectors is.
Indeed, Damascus also decreased this proposal.
Had western diplomates in Vienna even a year ago, the reactor has been destroyed, so the matter has no high emergency, some US Bottings Glyn Davies has brought some months to play special inspections, one of the most powerful means that the Winner Atom Authority has to carry out controls.
IAEA-Cherf Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already been deceived by "a option for which I am open in the future."
There is a high risk in this way: for one, there is a majority in the IAEA Governing Council, and some of the 35 countries in which they are represented are all different than the sculpture.
For others, how to remember a diploma: "What is if they find nothing at the end?"
Love in War’s Days
Since Angelina Jolie began with her work in the summer in its still unnamed Regiedbüt, there is a misleading.
The Drehbook itself wrote a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a serbia man.
Many of you don't know about this, but it's enough for disappointment.
Hartneckig, the wedding, a muslim, was loved during the Yugoslavia Kriege in her Serbian manager.
Bosnian women's associations have immediately protested, where some of the Drugs planned in Sarajevo were sent to Hungary shortly.
In the meantime, the film is turned into Hungary and in post production, but it is still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic from the organization of Women's War Opposite wrote about the UNHCR Refugee Help work at Jolie and requested a meeting with the shooting players, reported now a bosnical newspaper - Jolie is himself a United Refugees Helper.
Diplomatically isn't - she has offered the women a meeting in Hungary a week ago, but they refused them.
The meeting should be held in Bosnia, so Hasecic.
Love stories in shocking camps did not give it, and the situation of Jolie's victims with regard to the victims has sufficedly distracted her over the dry book.
Its organization has recommended the United Nations Refugee Helping Work to leave Jolie as a messanger, reports the Guardian.
What exactly has Jolie written for scenes?
The Bosnic Culture Ministry, which has received her Drug book, has issued a driving authorisation for Sarajevo - it is not very clear why Jolie did not even come.
The jugendautorin itself, she does not have political intents with her film, has worked with much effort in the Yugoslavia conflict, to show the horrible consequences of the war and to give a voice to all of the parties.
However, she remains low in content.
Thus, another second synopy on the network, which then sounds very different: the loved ones were able to see before the war slaughter and meet again when they are a bosnic muslim, in a serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What, however, seems significantly different than the variant "fabric offers are seen in folter-sweet."
That the Jolie's movie actually begins before the war - so sure.
The pressure on them, so Jolie, is "unfair and based on missing information."
Now you can only make Hollywood's hackers the peace: when they set the driving book, as soon as possible, illegally into the network.
Nothing like away here.
On this night, it's finally round again for the Iranians.
There's no shooting.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
The fans jokes the joy in smiling laugh music, they smile with the feet.
The Bailey powder in the south Cork is because the players shoot the tableballs over a three-mile distance in birds.
"Bierpong" is called the strange spectacle to win 500 euros of Siegpremie more airport tickets to Las Vegas for the Beerpong World Meetings in January.
Cyan Tanner is a more quiet type; this sweet drink game and the permanent computer that does not really pass together.
But the 26-year-old teenage is trying to slow down from the farming question what will bring the future.
On his plan, it is not a game stage in Las Vegas, he will lead to appeal in January in New Zealand.
"I feel a silent feeling about it," he says.
"It's so far away from home and I don't have any job there."
Always: his friendship waits on him - " she had shocked, so she was smiling as an event manager, maybe a good sign," said the young man and laughed.
Because bad perspectives at home two of Tanners have already been looking for their happiness in the foreign.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a place as IT brother in London.
The kids go: As with the tanners it looks on the island in many families.
100,000 Iran will probably leave the country in the next time, say experts of the Economic and Social Research Institute ESRI in Dublin.
To 2015, they even receive 200,000 immigrants.
For the small country with only 4,5 million inhabitants a strong loss.
Conserving the prognoses, it comes to an emigration environment comparable to those under Ireland in the twenty-first years.
After a decade of the resurrection that brought great well-being with Iran, it is now again wide.
The economic crisis is insured in particular to the young, well-educated Iranians, for which it was only mounted up until now.
Labour loss and social decline appeared absurd in the boom years.
Everyone's been used, the money was in the flow.
However, three of ten women and men are under thirty-sixth without work.
In Irish Times, there are readers of young immigrants who claim "all goes down in Ireland."
"It should make a stand against politicians and bankers - but who can, go and lose our country a whole generation."
"The last time, please turn out the light."
Jura-Studietin Leanne Calfield, President of the Irish Students Union, sees a deep future because the government is only in sightweek and the youth no longer offers future perspectives.
"They reduce the minimum solutions, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," said the 20-year-old boys.
She observes how their compliances are obtained from a unpaved practice towards the next.
Your greatest concern, she says it's to have to evacuate himself in four years.
"This thanks is tragic and depressive."
That's why men like Stephen McLarnon try to put the topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a messe that offers a round-dumping service on the subject work in the country.
"For professional employees, the work in the foreign is a great opportunity to make the first steps on the carriage leader", says the manager.
Show photos surfers in Australia and Snowboarder in Canada on his website.
The message is clear: work in the foreign is not a gallery service, but also brings freedom and joy.
How it feels to build something else, Sean O'Donovan knows for a half year.
Since it did nothing to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on the construction in Germany.
They're just taking a model house in the Gelenkirchen.
In January, the next project continues to Hannover or Berlin.
His home looks only rarly, because he makes extra shops to pay the credit for his home home.
"The situation is a bit crazy," he says when he first goes over his home.
"I get money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I am so good as ever."
He's laughing something and walks through extract rooms.
The small house is located in a pleasant accommodation with buried predators, in the invaders park great, sweet cars.
With a sister, O'Donovan has purchased the house for the four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100% credit financed.
"It were crazy times, there was simply money without many questions," he said.
Did he be afraid that it could be shipped with the credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, sweet thee after and says, "I have no children I have to eat and I am youth; even if everything spends, I can start from a new."
The engineer shall not have the shooting that he is currently listening to.
"No one must hungry - but our situation is not so dramatic as in previous times here on the island," he says.
"A time working in the foreign, that's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe we feel just as Iran."
He laughed and then told his father who went to England in the last large economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life went to Ireland, very simple."
Cyan Tanner likes this damn.
Open the future and just look at how it works with life anywhere.
A few years of work in London has already been behind, and why should it not go well for him and his friends in New Zealand?
But one thing is still that is worried about him in these days: the celebration at its 27th birthday in Dublin.
He's afraid it could be a living party.
"Don't be too many emotions," he says and drinks a big shock of his beer.
"Really, that sounds smiling."
"We like to call it a trip party, very locker, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Democratic Routine
Democracy movement in Latin America will be increasing, such as the support of private enterprises.
Criminality is a greater problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region the influence of Brazil is greater than the United States.
These results were the Latinobarometer survey carried out and published in 18 countries in The Economist.
This survey is regularly implemented since 1995 and shows the exchange of opinions in this region.
Two facts fall in this year in the investigation of September and October.
First of all, the good stimulation in Latin America
and secondly the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions.
In many countries, the Democratic movement in South American Pacific Coast has grown strongly (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has increased around 6% since 2002, the number of democracy members increased by 40% in 2005 to 61% in this year.
In Mexico, where the economy is recovered since the strong invasion last year, it is to recognise such trends.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populated countries of the region, are convinced democracies, which are the regional average (see Diagram 2).
Ca. 44% of the questionnaires explained that they are satisfied with the democratic practice of their country, which are so much than last year, but 25% more than 2001 (diagram 3).
About 34% believed in the congress of their country and 45% of their government, and both values in the last year show a significant increase in 2003 (17% or 24%).
The Lateiname Risk has been undergrounded by the efforts to increase democracy for a decade ago.
This is likely that during the world's economic crisis, the Lateiname Rikas countries have experienced only a short recession phase and have recurred rapidly.
Furthermore, the poor were taken by a stronger social network.
(In 2009, reports of the UN Federation Commission for Latin America increased the poverty rate in Latin America only, and this year has been re-educated to 32 per cent.)
However, there are strong stimulation differences from country to country (see Diagram 4).
Brazilian strong economy and the popularity of the separate President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva are reflected in a wide progress.
In Mexico and the Mediterranean, where the recession was stronger and has increased violence crimes, this is less the case.
The second time since the survey began, many inquiries in Latin America in their country see a greater problem than in unemployment (see Diagram 5).
Ca. 31% say that in the last year the victim of a crime has been victims of themselves or a family member, but 38% in the last year have been cut off and thus reached the lowest stand since 1995.
The increased economic performance is reflected in the increased support of the private and market economy: about 71% of the questionnaires were over-regionalized that the private economy for development is essential, in 2007 were 56% (see Diagram 6).
Ca. 58% explained that only market economy can make progress to their country is compared to 47% in the last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the questionnaires in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private economy), although their left President, Hugo Chávez, is a lot of private companies.
Brazil has estimated 19% of the questionnaires (18% in the last year) the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since the last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% in the last year).
Nevertheless, the questionnants in Mexico and most of the countries in the United States see the most influential country, with this role in the Dominican Republic and the Nicaragua of Venezuela.
A Selection Bet
No one had expected that the elections would be perfect in Haiti on November 28.
But the facts overcome the fears of the election assistants who have led to help the country.
Completed election urges, several-fold voices, election appearances in the Rinstein, destroyed election locations and infringements were only a part of the problems.
Selection room opened with long-term late.
Many Haitians who had become homeless in January have seen an opportunity to find a choice.
Some eventually gave up.
A twenty-first president, including some of the smiling chairman, requested the retirement of the results of the elections due to an appropriate fraud.
In the whole country, there were too little violent protests.
However, Edmond Mulet, Chief of the United Nations Mission in Haiti, called the election "as good in many interests".
According to a careful statement of observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, "do these irregularities, so seriously they may be, the process is not necessarily invalid."
In other words, the show goes on.
The election authority, which is obliged to separate President René Preval and his candidate, Jude Celestin, shall be pronounced on 7 December.
The expected switch will be accompanied for January.
There is still hope in the choice.
The two leading opposition candidates, the Rap-Musicer Michel Martelly and the former First-Lady Mirlande Manigat, have retreated their initial detention.
If Jude Celestin, who is only low or no approval for the elections, declares the election author to win the sample, this could lead to problems.
In view of cholera epidemics and the fact that more than 1 million of earthquake victims still live in cells, a small choice was feared.
In the election day, many Haitians were prevented by lack of organizations at the stage.
Shortly before the election begins, about 250,000 exhibitions were not distributed to the choice.
It's a lot on the game.
The donor countries consider a legitimate, recognised government as a major step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are the same opinion.
Home in the Middle
In the weeks after the sudden death of your husband, Argentina President, Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy, which runs up to 20 points above. This is the highest value since its election in 2007.
However, if you help this in the next year to re-elect, it depends on whether the beloved Cristina Fernández committee is as her murdered husband, her committee and political partner Nestor Kirchner.
The signs of that are not clear.
Nestor Kirchner, who also took the economic policy after the choice of his wife, often set out budget plans that did not take full consideration of tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the President's couple to issue extra income according to their own goods.
In the paper, the television government lost the majority in the Congress last year.
However, the opposition was shared and Kirchner’s death after a heart infarcted on October 27, leaded to further confusions.
Some dominators from the several dominant amanists were behind Cristina Fernández.
However, after chaotic meetings (which a parliamentary was in a face of one another and the government of the observation was concerned), it did not have the Conference to adopt the budget for 2011.
"I will not discuss this," says the President.
The 2010 budget is now also applicable for the next year, with the opportunity that the President has to pay money for its own benefits.
The economy is heat: it will probably grow up to 9% in this year.
The official inflation rate, for example, is 11,1%, but many private estimates - and payment requirements of the workshops - are almost 30% of the value.
Kirchner, who was over the 2003 office, when Argentina was protected from economic crisis, explained growth and poverty against its main objectives, not inflation reduction.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, scanning the private sector and reverse the National Institute for Statistics and Population INDEC, which enjoyed the official inflation statistics.
Can Fernandodez take a more slow way now?
She has called the private industry and the director of work.
In accordance with official statements, payment increases should be limited to 18% in the next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong extent.
However, inflation undergoes the growth rate by a great devaluement in 2002.
Cristina Fernández may, for this reason, wants to return financially to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government took an agreement with value holders who refused the country's previous debt in 2001.
Now Fernández looks like to spend an agreement with the money guests from the Paris Club, which she debt about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners always rejected a review by the IMF, such as other places.
However, in the last month, the Minister of Economy, Amado Boudu, announced that the fund will provide "technological support" in the establishment of a new national consumer price index.
It is not known if Fernández will be politically active after the end of its office without support by her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the funds, most of which is enough for the Kirchnerism.
When the Argentina returns from their summer holiday in March, the waves of the symptoms which she has been taken will be displaced.
If she wants to win another choice, she must decide whether many political decisions of her husband are quiet and slow.
Small Applaus for China
Taiwan's elections are closely closer to the fixed country.
What does Taiwan take from his great brother outside the sea?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million electors, which are 70% of all election authors, were made to choose citizens and citizens in the five districts of the city. This will be a wide evaluation of President Ma Ying-jeou.
With the creation of a partial free trade agreement, Ma itself is a symbol for the relations with the Fixland, and its policy has made the relationship with the Chinese mother country in the first time since 1949.
But it's the test, but it's just right.
Although his coomintang Party (KMT) is in place three of the five citizens, it did not have a voice.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), who favoured a greater independence in Taiwan, was almost 50% of the votes received by KMT 45%.
In a Presidency election, this would mean problems.
Since his election two years ago, the vote part of its party has fallen about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even moved to the city route with the KMT.
During the election, it came to the ordinary in Taiwan forecasts such as the last car convocation with crawall Machers, flaggen-flags and only awaited dancers.
There was even the obligatory, mysterious murder.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and the KMT's Chairman, held a speech on a KMT candidate at the end of the election,
When a man shooted in his face, a man was hurted and killed an overwhelming observer.
Wearer is not clear whether the shooting lies would kill or a war with the candidate.
Independently, the attack said Tsai Ingwen, the leader of the PPP, infringes the choice and cut the PPP into a bad light, which the KMT has made more voices.
Maybe China was the largest winner of the campaign.
It was not thematicized that the relations with the fixed country were not addressed.
Instead, the candidates discussed the plans for social housing and the creation of jobs.
Taiwan loves their faculty independence and brings China's military threats.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to consider its relationship with the government in Peking.
But this time, however, also prevented the DPP to smell the anti-chinesic feelings too much.
She reacted to the new consciousness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
However, I would like to confirm that the majority of Taiwan is favorable to its Chinese policy.
The Government in Peking will continue to pursue its strategy to return Taiwan with economic incentives to the Community.
China immediately sent an entrepreneur to Taipeh to prepare a meeting on investment security and medical cooperation.
It will certainly also be a political integration, but the most important is first.
It would like to wait until the presidential election of 2012.
The PPP has been newly developed.
Two years ago, she was strongly shocked: the former party leader Chen Shui-Byrist stood because of corruption in prison.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he was deeply involved in the absolute independence.
However, under the Tas reign, a new generation of genuine political politicians was developed and the DPP fights for the vows of the professionals and the youth.
Tsai found the president of the DPP a great approval, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Your party now does everything to show that it is also able to build close relationships with Peking.
Tsai plants an idea as a point of contact between the DPP and China. However, this provides predictable free discussions.
Tsai publicly declared that their party offered a "reliable alternative" as a premature approach to China.
Chen seems very depressed about this channel.
From his cells he explained that the applicants of the PPP would have done better to exist in Taiwan's independence.
He even requested the Pragmatician Su to reject the Presidency candidate.
Even without Chens injection, the DPP is hard to choose its possible candidates.
The KMT will be subject to a self-analyse.
But values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth; KMT candidates wanted to conduct their election campaign without it.
The main reasons for his innocentness seem to be unemployment and the more strike between arm and reign.
According to a KMT speaker, it will be converted to its box and the local institutions.
The strong event of the PPP is that Taiwan is only limited to re-adjustment.
At the same time, the majority of Taiwan views the economic cooperation with China inevitably.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent colonist, "no longer returns".
Grammy Names: The Jazz songer Esperanza Spalding was surprising in the category Newcomer of the year
If you come to a president's request, people will not be able to see it.
President Obama himself requested Esperanza Spalding to take place in the ceremony with the Nobel Price Sale 2009. Now the 26-year-old Jazz-Basistin and Snackman was overall appointed for the gramma in the category Newcomer of the year.
In view of the fact that Spalding since her album "Esperanza" 2008 is already a celebrated star in Jazz scene, the namement appears a little uncommon, but it corresponds to the Grammy rules that a artist before publication of the album, with which he was known in the broad public, could have issued at least three albums.
Your ambitious album from 2010, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with its skilled voice and a good scene for Pop, Funk and Latin Music, you can compare Spalding calmly with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success is being Jazz-interpretin in this category of the namement Spaldings.
Moreover, the "History" album of Vijay Iyer Trios was named in the Category Instrumentalalms. This loved the critics experienced a rise.
The Concurrent Years includes "Moody 4B" of the experienced Saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" of the Keyboarder John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a raubing favorite from New Orleans and often guests in HBOs "Treme", was excellent in the category of the Time Genèse Jazz, in the other albens of Stanley Clarke, John McLughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The Secret Societ of the wild stampank musician Darcy James Argue was well-known in the category of the great group. Hence, he is inclined to the Billy Childs Ememble with his room jazz and the amazing Dave Holland and his Oktett, whose life ablam "Pathways" is a good example for a basic leader as a democratic band leader.
Grammy Names: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey leads to classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53th Grammy adward includes a good mix of musicians and composers from the world.
The list of Michael Daughertys "Deux Ex Machina" for clavier and orchesters is conducted with five voices, and Steve Mackeys "Dreamhouse", a electric orchester work, with three voices.

Moschee in Themecula endorsing the planning committee
The construction of a mosque in Themecula was found after a fifth public hearing often the unique adjustment of the local planning committee.
The critics proposed the project to promote both terrorism and transport stages.
However, according to the Commission's statement on midnight, the new Religious Centre meets the local provisions and will be an aesthetic view.
"The project is supported by many good people - from Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"After the Americans make me proud of it."
"It shows that justice is ruling."
"There's just a little winner," he added.
"It's just very nice."
"In this Tal live wonderful people."
The meeting began at 18:00, and the discussions for and against the construction of the centre were nearly until midnight, while the votes on both sides were much simultaneously distributed.
The debate was continued on the site of the newspaper.
" There's no more America," said a comment.
"It's another planet of the ass, and the state of freedom is dead in the sand."
"America's at the end."
Planned Islamic centres have also led to Protest in other parts of the country, for example near Ground Zero, the shooting of terrorist attacks to the city of New York on 11 September 2001.
In the Tempecula Valley, the priest Mahmoud Harmuush called for violence.
His community with about 135 families has lived peacefully in the Riverside Conciliation for years. But they wished to have a larger and better place than the camp that they have met together with a manufacturer for water filtering facilities.
The new, about 2.300 m2 large shoes in the Mediterranean style will have two minerals and will be higher than 13 m.
It will be on the 17.500 m2 large base at the Nicolas Road near the Chaparral High School.
The Cities Council can still be enforced against the project.
Arsen-resident microbs could allow new life forms on the earth or where otherwise
The discovery of a foreign bacteria, which can live by arsen, opens new opportunities for new forms of life on earth and otherwise.
Although scientists have discovered this infinite bacterium here on the earth, their view is that a life is possible without the elements that have been observed as a living.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs to wake up or phosphor or arsen."
“This makes something very special, although it is almost a 'fremde' life form”, Paul C.W. Davies explained by the Arizona State University and Co-Auditor of the report appearing on Thursday in the online output of the Journal of Science.
For now, six main elements were considered to be living unnecessary - carbon, water, steel, sugar, phosphor and sweat.
But as the scientists find out, the bacterium in the Californian Mono Lake also continues when the phosphor is replaced by arsen.
"It is questioning what else is possible," said the Co-Autor of the report Ariel D. Anbar by the Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in searching for extraterrestrial life, as scientists need to recognise their forms, so canbar.
The study is discussed with microbes found on the earth.
The advertising of a press conference where no details were announced about the discovery, PASs has shown too broad speculations on the Internet that the report could act on the discovery of foreign life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "in other planet systems, organisms can be placed in Gang with other elements of biochemical processes and that the 'Standardelements', which are absolutely necessary for our view, are not unprecedented", explained Charles Cockell, Professor at the Planetary and Space Science Research Institutes of Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is a new, because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures a element can be replaced by another," added Cockell.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolf-Simon from the NASA Astrobiological Institute, who led the study, selected the Mono Lake because of the higher arsenology content.
As the arsen and Phosphor are chemically equal, she accepted that microbes that are both deleted could be replaced by the other.
"The ability of the arsens is primarily based on that it is chemically similar to Phosphor."
"The organisms are hard to distinguish a element from the other."
"But the difference is so large that arsen works differently than phosphor. It reached in our biochemical system where it almost disappears everything", says Anbar.
The researchers set the bacterium GFAJ-1 to increase the arsen concentration.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphor, but it can also survive in arsens, shows that a arsen-based life form can naturally occur, or on earth or on another planet or moon, more often on the arsen.
According to Jamie S. Foster, dozentin for microbiology at the University of Florida, it is the idea that Phosphor can be replaced by arsen, not new. But until now there was no more functioning example.
Arsen came more often in the early earthquake years, she says, therefore, science has resulted in that early life forms have used it.
"This is reason for accepting that life has also developed differently than in the early earthtimes," says Forster, who was not members of Wolf-Simon's research team.
The research work was supported by the NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Successfully stolen exhibition dog found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs that were stolen before a bellflower motel, were found according to the statement of the Los Angeles Council of Sheriff on Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two acities and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - changed on Tuesday, as Unknown the 2006 Chevrolet Express Van, where the animals were entered before a flower motel 6 nights, so the authorities.
Two of the dogs were found afternoon, and the last two nights at midnight, Steve Whithmore, a speaker of the Los Angeles Congress Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is: the dogs are good," says Whitmore.
"They are in good condition."
"They were returned to their legal owners."
Whitmore did not make exact information about the home of the dog yet to the situations leading to their discovery.
"The investigations are still walking."
"We don't want to say this again," says Whitmore.
"We follow some screams."
The dog owner, Christina Rickard and David Peek, were not available on Thursday for the accommodation.
They took their two dogs on midday afternoon in a district house in Downey.
Representatives of the sheriff found the car and the two dogs in different places in Compton.
The Akatis - Trace, a 3-year-old route, and Didi, a ten-month old horns, were injured.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, Rickard and Peek wanted to present this week in the task of their Japanese owners on the competition, remained missing until midnight.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were at this weekend because of the ACC/Ecanuba National Championship in Long Beach in the city because Trace should participate in competition.
As Peek the Times reported at midnight, the other dogs should participate in other competitions in the days before the ACC/Ecanuba show.
South California is a stop on the nearly one monthly tour of the couple of dog view to dogs view.
On Monday night Peek and Rickard were checking in the motel.
They are often overnight in motels and parking their cars before their room windows.
They took three other dogs - a boxer arm, a parson Russell Terrier and a British, with a motel room.
The swimming Asias and Corgis remained in the delivery car, because it was clouder there.
They left the window open a bread, so the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car on Tuesday at 6:00 a.m.
Peek promised every one who could give a reference to the corgis a finger loan. The animals were planted for identification.
On Thursday, it was not realized if a loan was paid.
The levy will be burned after the legal approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulences and insecurities, MGM has finally taken green light for a new start.
On Thursday, a New Year Concourse Director officially blessed the "prepared" crown plan to spend $5 billion debts, and the 86-year-old entrepreneurship company the way for new films and television shows.
According to the sentences of Thursday, the plan meets the requirements of the US Concours Law, so that MGM's new starting under the leadership of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spigls Entertainment, is nothing more in the way. Barber and Birnboum will be presented to some spectacular Studio as the principal business leader.
The number of employees is calculated from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 is only in force only when JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned contribution of $500 million for the financing of the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a bank's consortium is involved by $75 million, the company, which has to be financed by the midst of December.
The restructuring of the study began in May 2009 with the assignment to the Investment Bank Moelis & Co, the company's leadership that was struggling $300 million/year in the resolve of their financial problems.
In August, the business leader Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO in Enron and Restructuring experts, known by his activities at Crispy Kreme Doughnuts.
The efforts of Moelis & Cooper to solve the financial series of MGMs and paid the more than 140 guests of the study were longer expected.
After monthly discussions, the parties decided to provide the purchase company at the end of 2009.
But the auction was only a few biggers and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion requested by the believers.
In the spring of this year, the MGM team started with the restructuring plan, which was signed by the believers after months of discussions and internal conflicts at the end of October.
If MGM has been officially overlooked the competition in the next weeks, Moelis and Cooper receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share of Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, is $9.5 million.
Cooper, which has been paid monthly for the management of the company $375,000, receives a "exfolgsbonus" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnboum planned to restore the production with MGM. In this year, the study only produced a film and created a year plan with seven or eight films that should come to the Kinos in the beginning of 2012.
They also plan two films after "The little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The study requires a separate share of $265 million to $275 million for its financial share in these two films that should be in the region of Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who has financed about 18% of MGM loans, tried a fusion of the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose larger shareholder is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not lead to any result.
Tech Toys holds your gift budget in balance
This year's favorite under the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both players can get a huge loch in your gift budget.
A iPad costs as much as five BMX radars for $99, while the price for a kinect game corresponds about 10 classic spring lists or about 48 dozen play doh.
But you can get your gift.
Recently, I visited the search for three electronic games under $80 three national players - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Walesale Club.
I was immediately clear that Moores's law had been in force. This year, technology players are more powerful and costs at the same time less than in the last year.
And although less new game tools appear with their own website, the most famous of this type, webkinz and Club Penuin, is a larger offer.
There are always more button-floor players on the market, and many contain reloadable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(If not otherwise specified, all prices of Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years) are painting pictures, as large as sea skins that smell a note when you press on their bottle.
Once pressure corresponds to a note, you can play a song by several presss.
More Sing-a-ma-jigs songs in Harmony.
Attention: If you have started with the press once, you can't stop.
For a combination of sent and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
On the basis of Elmo Live technology, developed in the last year, the animatoric puppe changing games such as 'Simon says', and thanks to the new ray-blocking, she controls the Moon-Walk.
Children testing the device use Mickey as dance teacher. Your parents, however, estimate the lack of volume.
If you are a child of the 80s, you surely remember the Alphia, one of the first computerized games.
Now he's back (Hasbro/Plays cool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole shopping card that can be able to get a car to an instruction hours, with a safe water with auto correction function as a teacher.
If you don't want to trust your smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo from VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the most suitable and useful solution, equipped with a qvaly tastatur. However, the games contained are not less worthy than those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which is equipped with the Leapfrog first large revision of the Leapster ship with a new, lighter screen.
No versions are compatible with older cassettes.
iXL of Fisher Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) is used for games and eBooks a similar iTunes system, and thanks to the SD card work, family photos can also be viewed.
Finally, there is still a screbble Flash ($30 by Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are not greater than a strip switch and have a own LED screen.
The game is to join the blocks in words before the time goes. It is great for an improvised bookstable competition.
Always more players have a kind of online connection.
If you go only after the offer, Webkinz and Club Penuin are the most important ones.
To give your child a online tire in the Penuin Club, for example, you can buy a Disney Club Penuin 2" Mix 'N Match Figuren package ($5 for children from 6 to 12) which contains a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child receives sufficient credits in the Club Penuin Store for two other parts.
This can be a shooting shoes or a puffle shooter.
The latest head cell microboat, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is not greater than the head of your dentists.
The shop moves rapidly on 12 vibrating silicon legs in every favorite direction.
It's glad to send him out of locks through an irrigator.
And he's a little out.
Our kitchen has fallen from the kitchen and even some time in the mould of our dogs.
Police positions in China are sanfters
As a training officer, Tang Shenbin exclaimed on a urban place, checked his nervous signs and delivered it with military authority and struggling orders.
He wanted that his women members of the Chengguan - China's robust guards of the city order, feared and encouraging the observers for their desirable races and hungry for violence.
"Grade stand!"
"Blick just out!"
"Show them," he flew to them, "who sweet girls are so nice!"
Four girls, little growing to the adolescent old, with white hands and identical oil green jacks and hoses standed straight.
Four pairs of black pumps stand in right line.
Four ordinary gardens are perfectly sweated with blue-wheeled clothes.
"If you see them average," Mr Tang notes.
"Models are nice."
several governments have already tried to put the image of Chinese city inspectors.
All new applicants have to have a high school ending in a city.
Instead of greening, the province of Guangdong introduced a light blue unit.
Whan was replaced by the Netherlands's Sternes: 2009, 50 officials reported that a non-regulated bicycle car was set up by the operator to pack it after half an hour and left the place.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to change the image fundamentally.
Since 2003, 13 women enhanced the urban police teams and were particularly chosen because of their appearance, their good figure and their youth.
They're gonna give the shocked police a weird, feminal aspect.
Unfortunately, however, Scarlett Johansson would also be able to improve the bad image that the Chineses have of this city command.
Right, so the critics.
In addition to the police, these officers may only apply the city laws by means of bus payers or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media shows routinely another image.
In January 2008, officers in Hubei province tested an observer to death when it filmed with his phone how she was shooting a protection against a swimming pool.
In the past year, a training manuscript of the beneficiary officials was stolen and published on the Internet is described how criminals can be tested without blood loss.
In this year, a Shanghai water-melon squadler is carried out after a dimension of hand with five officials of the brain injuries.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows training officials in China at an attack on road drivers.
"Chengguan makes fear of the government," the National Journal of China Daily deplored last year, after further controversies regarding tactics.
The newspaper requested a "very green-free relief".
Skepticers are not sufficient to the present approach.
When the district searched for eight women's recruits in October by show, a editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether women had real tasks or should only serve as an optical delay.
Maybe both.
According to the ancestors, women in age from 18 to 22 were searched for a good figure and "harmonical face trails".
You should be averagely large - over 1,5 m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 doll.
The employment relationship ends with the achievements of the 26th life year.
According to the officer, women's activities are physically more than 25.
"The most important thing is her image," gave an innocent district officer at the nearby government website Rednet.com.
"In order to get the job, the candidates first depend on their external appearance, such as size, weight, face routes, etc. "
Then the temperatures and "indoor qualitys" come.
"Women Chengguans are like flowers," he said and added, "but there are still other obligations."
Zheng Lihua, Chairman of the City Management of the district, does not want to contribute to this description,
However, the fact that dimensional requirements in terms of both gender are not inoccupied in China.
Similarly, it applies to coherent face lines.
Whether this is equal to a good look, it is struggled in China.
But people with disabilities or physical ideas do not need to be disappointed.
"We, unfortunately, can't use lambs or bucklees here", says Mr. Zheng.
"It wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who is patching on the Baoguang plate near a closter, is 22, has a sweet bag and a well-formed mouth.
It is not like sexistic that the value of it is set on its appearance.
"I see in this uniform sexy?" she asked with ironical view.
Your colleague with the boys, the 21-year-old Xu Yang, comments: "We have the task to represent the image of the city."
As a result of their information, they do not regret the short position because they had more ambitious carriage plans than simply sharing handlers through gass to prevent them at the business machine.
Each morning, the strikes have been sold with about twelve road drivers who tried to spend on foot or on the board as many breeds and tofudirees as possible before they are continued.
"Mr. Wang, please leave here."
"We have told you so often," explains Frl Xu a handler who had been flying on foot and then left him on a bicycle cart on the store.
According to the officers, the activity is more monotony than strict.
"It's almost the same day," says Huang Jing, 20 who study the free-time transmissions.
All Routine.
It is a reason for women's officials not to condemn the goods of the handlers, such as their men's colleagues.
They can only threaten criminals to report their men's assignments.
This aims to protect public advertisements which are often exempted by officials in China.
In this year, hundreds of people of Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunan, were rounded after the wealth cut, Changguan officials would have killed a handler.
More than a twenty-first police officer and Chenguan officials were injured at the night incident, 14 government vehicles were shocked or burned.
Xindu remained abroad of such violence.
But those who are disappointed are not excluded.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang platz, where the women's officials patrolized this morning, gathered over 50 people on a road board.
The officers condemned a motor route which was reparated instead of a workplace.
The owner crys cryers and mordios.
After a 15-minute dent, the officers were talking to the way to their vehicles and continued with the motor route and their owners.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of men's stretch, remained back. He turned his white name shield to remain anonym.
Like their colleagues, coordinators - men more than 40 - play a full supporting role.
But they were not forced to present a cleaner image there.
"Atimes we're going to break up."
"Atimes, however, physically," Mr Li uses.
"The most time people spend with the war."
State lawyer will not accept Senator Ensign
Senator John Ensign, a lawyer of the Ministry of Justice, freed from the accused that, after his case with a former election assistant and his trial to make a lobby activity against her husband, gave the applicant to the Senator audience a midnight.
This decision ends the most serious legal proposal against Senator Ensign, the Republic of Nevada. Before the Skandal, the countrywide for slaughter lines, and his carriage, he was the possible candidate of the Republican Presidency for 2012.
As Senator Ensigns' office was known, he was the sentence after the annual investigation "health pleased".
However, the Senate's Ethics curriculum could have a disciplinary punishment.
They were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations were introduced against Senator Ensign and that no further appeal in this case was presented.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to express himself in this case.
The judgment was a surprise for many Ethic lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. Your view was that there was sufficient evidence that Ensigned the Lobbying prohibition.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents that were opened first in October 2009 in New York Times showed the conviction that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his election assistants, helped lucrative contracts to purchase his sweeter on a business with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton was active during a election campaign.
Ensign took contact with some political friends to generate hampton's work. According to the documents and talks he overlooked them after the Hampton's Lobby work.
Since Hampton was recently in Ensigns' election team, it was not to take a lobby work for his former employer or the whole Senate for a year.
According to the declaration of Ethic experts, the uncommon agreement between Ensign and Hampton, which was closely satisfied before the affair, was contrary to the prohibition called the Drift Lobbycracy.
According to the posted Index, "that seems to be a debate and the infringement against the Drift Statistics," says Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who has specialized the defence of customers in the Government's visa.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to give the reasons for the decision in the Ensign field, Mr Brand and other Ethics advisers said that the Ministry seemed very careful to adopt political appeals after a variety of disadvantages followed by the media with great interest, including the decision in the last year to let the complaint against the former Senator Ted Stevens because of the failure of the advocate.
The complainant "It is obviously horrible," Melanie Sloan, Chairman of the Association "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (a organization which is the aim of combating corruption in the parliamentary and government crystals of the United States), is a group of lawyers who have put different appeals against Mr Ensign before court.
"This means fundamentally that high-standing government officers can now exempte that the laws for them are not applicable," added.
Paul Coggins, the principal defendant of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview, he received a call on a State lawyer on Monday, and another on the next day in which he was informed that the Ministry would not be sent up against his customers.
Mr. Ensigns Defenders had cooperated with state lawyers in order to convince them that the Senator, as his office once again in a statement on midnight, had "dealed in accordance with the law".
Mr Coggins refused to explain more accurately the legal arguments he had submitted to the lawyers.
"I'm not sure to go in the conversation details between the Ministry of Justice with me, but it's just so much to say, "We believe that we have taken the right decision," he said.
Last month the Federal Selection Commission has decided to establish investigations for a separate composition by the ethical group after a payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensigns to the Hamptons against the Federal Selection Act.
The election committee said it has not been sufficient evidence that the money was something else than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, who supported the Senator for a long time, was one of the company where Mr. Hampton found thanks to the assistance of Mr. Ensign Lobbyists.
A email from December 2008 stated that after the company continued to be a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's Head of Stab, John Lopez, had an interview with Mr. Hampton, where he reported to him that he was "acceptable".
Mr Ensign was also joined with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, on lunch, and asked the Minister of Transport to agree on a meeting on behalf of the airport society after this Mr. Hampton had established a lobby work.
On the last year, when information about these businesses was taken to the public, Mr. Ensign was apologizing with his electors and put his position in the Senate where he had been on the fourth place in the round of the Republicans.
After a few months, Mr. Ensign told reporters that he was working for a third office in the Senate two weeks ago.
In the advertising that Mr Ensign is no longer the goal of police investigations, his preachingster Jennifer Cooper, the Senator, hopes that the Ethics Mission is very quickly following the example of the Ministry of Justice and its investigations.
"Senator Ensign is pleased to continue his hard work in the service of people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire's call takes note on Twitter
A twenty-third of them went out in the court hall.
In a minute, they sent their reports on Twitter about weak witnesses.
At the end of the defence, there were more than 140,000 Twitter reports about the process for robbery and beds kidnapped children in a house that took place in flamens.
On Thursday, the honoured process of Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of having murdered a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the judgement on the death sentence which the jury has declared.
However, Mr Hayes has already submitted applications to the court for the reasons for a profession and the courts will be employed for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that it has been the intensive reporting on the process - even through the extensive use of Twitter by the average reporters - to a "circus mosphere" and a so far-displayed reducing of driving details, so that the jury has been unacceptablely influenced by public equipment.
This appeal could allow the appeal duties to address the question whether the new technologies are required in the Court of Justice.
"Comme I experienced it during this process, I believe it is really a danger if the introduction of the new technologies in the court hall affects the right of each individual to a proper process," said Thomas J. Ullman, head-defender.
The Chairman, John C. Blue from the Supreme Chambergericht, whose week the requests were made by decision and preaching back when he said that the new media would be "speakly controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury of sufferings was carried out.
But this was not the last word in this matter.
Since decades, the courts have found that the reporting on famous-professional cases may cause doubts on the fairness of a process.
In his historical decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States, Dr. Sam Sheppard, a Western Patent of Cleveland, who had to kill his wife, took the judgment and said in his decision that it had given a "carnevalsatmosphere in the court hall" because of the new media.
Some believe that the TV series and the game film "After the refugee" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that the courts that Mr Hayes has considered a half-century sentence may follow the argument that new rules have been needed to regulate the ways of communication from the court hall, which were still unpropositive at the time of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the new media in processes that are followed by a wide publicity," said John J. Donohue III, Professor at Stanford Law School, who investigated the death penalty in Connecticut.
Professor Donohue said that some appeal duties could be fascinated by the idea that the limitation of an extensive communication from the court hall could make the process.
The Twitter matter is only one of the many who presents the lawyers of Mr Hayes to discuss on years and thus delay a sentence.
For example, defenders pointed out that Mr Hayes could already be sentenced as judge Blue did not allow them to test the reactions of potential jury by demonstrating them during the jury choosing of a cruel slaughter photos.
Some of the jury said, photos of the victim, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years of age, and their daughters, Hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years old, had filled with abscheu.
Defenders say that they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty, and argued that the judge had failly a jury who had been a criticist of the State Authority, and that he had exercised inadmissible pressure on the judgment when he had taken the unlawful decision to free the jury over the weekend.
The jury wasn't isolated.
However, their arguments on the impact of the explicit reporting on the process may be the greatest interest.
In a sentence which they had sent last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign for the Governor and the American Senate.
They argued that the new media had continued to re-eject the emotions on the case.
"Under such daily advertising the media pepsis, cameras and reporters outside the court hall," the lawyer writes, "what you haven't experienced before in New Haven and maybe even a countrywide."
Your main point on the reporting by Twitter is contrast.
In Interviews, some journalists said that the point of view that these direct news are more than reports that are more slower than a technological view that reduces the report on future processes.
However, some lawyers said that appeals would often be compared to the argument, social and technical changes need to be adapted by the courts.
Mr. Hayers' lawyer, strengthening this statement.
In their intention, they dealt with the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, in which the sentence of Dr. Sheppard was denied due to the reporting and clearly made that the new media required new rules.
"This case," she wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21th century."
Can you connect the separator?
After a campaign of shooting words and negativeness, this week is slightly broken in Washington.
Is it the omen of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before you return to the battle of the parties in the capital city?
On Thursday, the meeting between President Obama and Spitzen of the Congress did not have an interruption in the great matters with which the meeting was taken at the end of a government period in which no decisions were taken.
After all that you hear, it was not a high debate between two different sides, nor an observance of their shared responsibility, but more than a empty episode of a partial point agreement.
The public meetings of the President's deficit committee on midnight were civilized, despite the political differences that continued between members.
It seems to be clear that close interactions can be a mutual respect for the ideological club that continues to trend to members over a period of months.
This is little enough to emphasize that it is a new time of cooperation.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one of the other signs of the cooperation and compromise preparation is required, while trying to derogate the limits of the public opinion and the patience of the electioners after a renewed participation.
The meeting was therefore limited on Tuesday and its assessment by the participants at a minimum of claims or accused.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too deep and too deep than they could expect a rapid change of the atmosphere that was predominant in the past two years.
Unlike taxes, expenses, health or expectations, both sides are a kilometer far away.
Lastly, the November election of Washington has voted for at least a short time mild.
"No question that has changed the tonfall," said Pete Wehner, a official representative of the Bush government, now works for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center".
"This is uncertainly after elections.
Elections make partial sufferances that will be deleted again.
And that's good."
In some questions, especially those in the agenda of the "Theme Duck Session", the Republicans and Democratics have no choice than a solution."
Bush tax rates end up the end of the year, and no one gives it favor.
Both sides want to find a way to keep some or even all, if it is interim or permanent.
In addition, a compromise on the increased unemployed employees is expected, even if only because the Republicns can not give it to believe that the favoured tax rates for the rich, while they reject unemployed employees.
After the meeting in the White House, the optimism increased in these questions during the "Lame Duck Session" and at the same time the new START Treaty can be ratified.
But William Glaston of the Brooking Institute warns that a successful cooperation in urgent issues of the Lame Duck Session must not lead to a sustainable cooperation of the parties if the new 112th conference is called in January.
Instead, he says, it is a stage of non-compliance likely, maybe even uncompromising.
"And the things to be done are done, this short-term psychology will be affected in contrast," he said.
Wehner is also skeptic - and this skepsi is shared by many - leads to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of things happens from today to 2012, as a champion, or shadow box, for 2012's main event," he said.
The reasons for this have to do much with the drawing of the new Republicn majority in the white house and with the Teeparty choices that were used for their education.
As the Republican leaders may also be concerned that they are too high pokers, they know that they must try to make their promises to reduce the expenditure of the government and to keep the health reform more powerful.
These parties will already be clear in the first reactions regarding the recommendations of the Deficit Commission, which contain a tax reform and the increase of certain taxes, and the increase of the pensional elder and the deterioration of the State expenditure.
The Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and have, in accordance with their own appreciation, very emphasized to put the deficit question to the public agenda that they can't be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan for the official recommendation, and they are very fighting in order to reach only near this number.
The largest resistance is in the selected representatives of the group, as in financial questions, at least today, just a few game spaces or a little sympathy for compromise.
Galston said two phases in the struggle between the White House and the Republicns in the Congress.
The first struggle will be held in the form of partial deficiencies in the next year when the Republic of Obama requests the State budget, taxes and the health system, and then will be followed by a stage of increased double-party cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It is evidence that, despite the participation of the current election, most Americans still want to work together.
If comparisons in a sackgase, as happened in 1995, both parties must take care of the public reaction.
Whoeverever is sentenced to lose will change the course and need to find the compromise.
This may actually be a optimistic vision.
Partiality and polarization are now greater than in the middle of the 1990s, and they seem to be a larger ideological club between Obama and the Republic of Congress than at the time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activers of both parties in 2010 are a pure forecast for a more wide choice in 2012.
This is how many Americans will be welcomed by the holy spirit this week.
However, on both sides, there will be much more efforts to find a common namer in the matters which are divided into one another.
Congested US document portated Moscow as a port of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of the "Cleptocracy" and it provides a part of the reserves and the protective fees that she gathered on the Kreml. So, in February, the American message in Russia was reported in a memo.
The police and the State Security Service were high protected in order to maintain their thermal life standards in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legitimated business but also by organized criminal bands.
Each piece of officecracy - what Vladimir Putin called "Verticle of the Authority" - takes its part of the money that the Chief moves upward.
The memo sent by the messager John Beyrle to Washington was published on Tuesday of WikiLeaks on his homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose name was edited.
It was written, while Yuri Luzhkov was even Moskaus Citizensman, and it accused him of corruption.
He was shocked in October by President Dmitry Medvedv, but there is no evidence that it would be disappointed in the interim time.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who has a known manufacturer, have always reaffirmed corruption laws for years, and he wins many of these charges.
In September he declared a Russian television advisor when he was asked after a documentation that suggests that he was corrupted, "It's crazy, it's crazy, it's crazy."
> A large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is inhabited that, as happened in the messager's report, individuals are called, and it is unexpected that this happens by a diplomate of a foreign country.
"The direct link of the Moscow government has led to criminality that some of them are called "discrete" and to the conclusion that the government is more than a cleptokrat than a government," says the Memo.
"criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (in terms of the world of the criminals/ the mafia, which means "dach" or protection), which is struggled on the police, State Security (FSB), the Service Oversight Authority (MVD) and the Office of the State Avocats, as well as the whole Moscow government office.
Experts have found a trial structure within the criminal world Moscow.
"Luzhkov is on the top place."
"FSB, MVD and the Military are on the second stage."
"Clearly, the ordinary criminals and criminal inspectors follow at the lower level."
"This is an incompetent system, in which criminal groups are closed a laugh in some areas, because the city does not offer any help."
The report continues to say that the FSB's money is covered by the largest company and which is arrested by the police for small business.
One source, which means, is "declared that Moscow's business holders understand that it's best to get the protection of MVD and FSB (and not by organized crime), because they have no more weapons, resources and power than criminals, but also because they are protected by law."
"But this reason the protection is no longer asked by criminal gangs as previous."
The Memo notes that while the collection of money is complete, the protection itself is not very determined; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business very quickly closed - because of one or another inmigration.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but noted at the same time that he has made little progress.
The message's memo contains descriptions of men with coppers, who probably were full of money, going into the creml.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvev must leave on the officecraft," said George Satarov, director of India, a Moscow expert committee, recently in an interview.
"For he is part of this officecracy."
"It is no part of the political class, because there is no more political class in Russia."
Without the political, without an opposition, without a separation of violence, he says that corruption is uncertain.
The countrywide, so estimates Indem, costs the Russian corruption more than $300 billion per year.
The country is launched at 154 a new investigation on the global enhancement of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (the countries are listed by "also least corrupt" to "the majority of corrupts".
The interpretation of the memo of the American message that happened late after Moscow’s time will be resolved with security losses within the Russian government, although Luzhkov can be accused of Moscow's error, it can also be a possibility for the cream to indicate that the problems are resolved.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin stated that the WikiLeaks documents could be a false fault and reacted to the enthusiasming that the American diplomas called Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it is about our interaction that is an important factor of internal policy in this country," he said.
"On to be honest, we wouldn't have expected that this comes with such an arrogance, with such a pressure and so unthic way, you know."
Khmer Red Veterans Unfortunate to contrast the past
In a weak, enthusiasmed classroom with smiling and smiling walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built it at the later Khmer Red leader Ta Mok.
Everyone here loves Ta Mok.
"He was a good leader and he was careful of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because his brutality during the Khmer Red Governance is known as “the fighter”, the command chair remains popular in this former Khmer Redge Hochburg in the northwest of Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges that have developed the infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers are still living.
However, this year, 12 years after the capitalization of the Khmer Rouge against the government, a long-year member in Anlong Vengue is requested.
In April, a local truth and condemnation forum allowed victims to confront the people who first supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book that first reported the history of Khmer Rouge for the children of former soldiers.
And in July, a community contribution of UNO and Kambodsha was sentenced first a former member of the Khmer Red when it condemned the former Chief of the defended Tuol Sleng Folter Chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known than duch, at 35 years of prison.
With each of these developments, the fear was under the Khmer Red Veterane Alnlong Venngs, assessing their efforts to compensate and reintegrate the Kambodsian society.
"These are still refusal and fear in the former Khmer Red, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, Chief of the Documentation Centre of Cambodshaas, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"For she was the life under the Khmer Red glory, but the regime has become a symbol of the wicked."
"It's the family itself."
During the Khmer Red governance in Kambodsha, between 1975 and 1979, 1.7 million people were executed or died of diseases, reprocessation or hungry.
When the Vietnams entered and the Pol Pot-Ied government was cut in 1979, the remaining of the regime and its army went to the border of Kambodshaas to Thailand.
Here they extended until December 1998, when the last movement was capitalized, unreasonable.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the Guerilla war in the west of the mountains and dschungel of Kambodscha, Ta Mok moved the next generation in Anlong Venng.
But in the middle of the 1990s, when a peace agreement contributed by the United Nations in 1993 to the first democratic elections of the country began large groups of Khmer Red combaters to overcome the government, which led to the capitalizations of Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998 of a natural death, and Ta Mok, who had not been given, was arrested by government forces at Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in the prison of Phnom Penh in 2006, where he waited for his process.
When their men did not protect them longer, most of the former Khmer Red fighters fled into the destroyed poverty of the rural Cambods and many had the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even if some of the Khmer Red officials had their local government posts because they put their weapons down, the simple soldiers remained armed and unfavoured farmers.
"These people have benefited only very little of the capitalization," said Sok Leang from the Centre for Justice and Condemnation, which holds public forums in the whole Kambodsha, also in Anlong Venng.
"They are vulnerated in the Utopical Agriculture of the regime."
"You're swearing without any professional knowledge."
According to Lim, 55-year-old years of union with the Rhmer Rouge in 1974, struggled in the dschungel towards Anlang Venng before 1998 he cut down to lead a life as a poor traveller.
"The life under the Khmer Red was good," he said.
"Tha Mok gave everybody something to eat."
"But now the life is difficult because we need to care for ourselves."
The runing Khmer Red Court also urged concerns here.
The court's first year will be tried to submit to the court of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, and Ieng Thirit, another former Khmer Red Minister.
The court's mandate is to condemn the old leaders and those who are mostly responsible for the slaughterings, but it is not said whether it will be subjected to further acts on these four cases.
This has helped little to smell the fears in Anlong Vengue.
Current media speculations have been concentrated on In Chaem, 64 years of age, which was during the Khmer Red governance in the late 1970s of district Chefin in Manteay Meanchey province.
She told the documentation centre of Kambodscha 2007 that she led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Damms, a project that probably died in thousands of pregnant workers.
At a warm night in Chaem from the work on the fields to their wood house came back to a smooth street outside of Anlong Veng.
When the sun's long-term shadows on the decreased grace reproached in Chaem to discuss their past at the Khmer Red.
If the court invites them, she would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodscha lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there are no persecutions anymore, it would be war here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who was fled by the Khmer Rouge 1878, also warned once again that the situation would be insecure, the Court would accept more suspects, although experts and historians discuss it.
"Cambodscha must catch a loch and shoot the past," he said.
But the contrast with the past is what Cambodscha needs to do in order to go forward, said Chhang Youk from the documentation center.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer Days means composing the broken pieces," he said.
"It's our obligation to put these broken parts together, so as we can understand everything."
The centre creates the first school book approved by the government on the Khmer Red, the 75th "Story of Democratic Kambodsha".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the High School School of Education, containing less than four pages over the Khmer Red.
As often in Kambodscha, young people in Anlong Venng are just a few over the Khmer Red, despite the connections of the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19-year-old student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps students understand a major part of their history.
But his parents reacted skepticly when he brought the book with them home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are misstrayed because they are not sure how many people are sentenced from the court."
A such resistance makes the compensation process complex and complex, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the school book and the court will be obtained after and after the influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful relationship here.
On the top of the Dangrek mountains, one of the strikes leads to a swimming path to a right side of black Russia, covering a red blue dawn.
Pol Pots body was burned here after his death in 1998 on a snake.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, said that she didn't know much about the man who was burned here.
"And he has a strong spirit and many people go to pray to him," she said.
It was Nuom Sotheas birthday and later on the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last peace place where she will put a bus riding bananas - in the hope that he brings her happiness.
The white Country has agreed to join an unarmed uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obamas' campaign for global nuclear security, the Government of Whiterussland announced on midnight that there will no longer be a higher uranium, which is a critical part of nuclear weapons.
The contract was announced in a common statement after a meeting of the Minister of Foreign Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Whiteern Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Guide.
The US government had tried to convince the whiterussland for years to gather higher uranium, and the last spring year seemed to have reached a heavy.
However, the official of the United States government reported that in the past two months two secret agreements with the white Russian countries were taken to remove a weaponable Uran from a White Russian research station for 187 pounds.
This prepared the arrangements to remove the rest of the material on midnight, according to an official employee that remained anonym because of the sensitivity of the theme, about 500 pounds of funds.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obamas 'Nuclearm Security Board of the 47 nations' from April, which was excluded by the White Republic.
And it was obviously good enough to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next meeting in 2012.
"I was really shocked by the fact that they wanted a seat in the Nuclear Security Board (de 2012)."
"This shows me that it works", said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear security.
Clinton called the Agreement "a very important, very important step" of the Whiterussland.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to ensure all nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the United States government has helped six countries to get out of its high-scale Uran.
The whitesland will be the seventh.
A twenty country did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obamas Nuclear of Security, the White President Alexander Lukashenko stated that the nation will never be sent to its Uran.
"Who keeps high-riched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally weaponsable, and less rich Uran," said Lukashenko at the time.
"This is our raw material, we're not going to make bombs, and we're going to sell no one."
"We use it only for research, that's all."
But just a few months ago, the whiterussland approached the United States when it was interested in the meeting of an agreement.
The first start to remove the Uran Whitesland in October was particularly complicated because the material was easyly punished, says officially.
It was loaded in a special shop, which is more than 1,300 miles to a Russian manufacture for location and disbursement, says officially.
The second start was decided on Monday and was carried out according to the offices by flight.
The US government pays for these $14 million, with a majority of the money in the White Russian research with a weak uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was very carefully coordinated and agreed to build confidence," said Andrew Beneiawski, a representative of the Ministry of Energy that works at global risk reduction.
James Martin Center estimates that the Whiterussland had at least 88 pounds of armed uranium and hundreds of pounds of high-scale uranium.
The whiterussland will, according to the common agreement, resolve its loan until 2012.
The relationships between the white and the United States were encouraging for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's serious misunderstanding of human rights.
But the statement from midnight suggests a possible approach.
"The progress of these global security issues welcomes the United States of America and Whiteruss that an increased respect for democracy and human rights in Whiterusland remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens."
None of the Spanish government against the CIA flights
The Spanish government did not have any infringements against the CIA flights with Taliban and Al-Qaida prisoners on Spanish state territory to Guantánamo, such as a telegram from the U.S. Messager in Madrid.
This reflects the documents extended by Wikileaks and opposed to the daytime "El País" (per cable). It is added that the former government chief María Teresa Fernández de la Vega requested to be informed by the Spanish government to "to demonstrate that foreign aircrafts that are overcoming Spain are being monitored".
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the European Council, in which the aid to human rights practices was accused in a twelve countries, including Spain, the former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega, were discussed.
The Chairman of the Governing Body was able to hide nothing in this matter by the Council's report "he took Zapatero outside" and confirmed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"The Vega understood, Spain does not have any objection against secret service flights on Spanish state territory."
"They just want to be informed," reports Aguirre per cable.
Also, the former Foreign Minister, Miguel Angel Moratinos, pointed out that the Spanish government "not wants to give great attention to this matter, although the government has little influence, as they are in the hands of the judges."
In January 2007, the advocate Vicente González understood the message that he would not block the initiative to declassifie the documents of the Spanish Secret Service Center (CNI) and the Defence Minister of the CIA Flights.
"This reports do not contain any tragic or sensitive information", the messager explained after a conversation with the State lawyer.
Nevertheless, the United States were more concerned about the "possitive coordination between the Spanish State lawyer and the German Prosecutors" than about the declared information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent researchers will complicate our efforts towards discrete handling between governments," says Aguirre.
When a midday in March 2007, in which the U.S. Meeting Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba participated, the latter commented that "but the Spanish judges were strongly thinking of their independence and what they were to keep properly", he gave instructions to its workers to "evit the decisive reactoral comments to leave the shock."
The messager also expressed his concern about the measures of the PP in this matter.
"Besides its general pro-American situation, our experience shows us that the PP will not be doubtful, as a result of the fact that the Government of Zapatero's acts of the United States, which could be subjected to human rights violations as possible, has been strucked, or mostly ignored, even if these interpretations could affect the US government," he said.
The child murderer has increased in the Internet on the "muhsal" of the maternity.
The young woman said about the child when it was dead and she had a blog, "Terror on galactic kind"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki".
With this small name, she holds contact with a cusin and at least one friend of friends, and both are from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The communications are from 2008.
In order to understand this, you must know their lovely lives that rebuild the ABC daily period on the basis of testimony of their family members.
The 30-year-old galic woman took a relationship with Iván Tunñez, a industrialist.
She took a year.
Shortly after she solved her relationship, she was known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know whether the baby's from him, but his former man never let him conduct a DNA analysis.
Shortly, she went to another relationship.
The chosen Alberto, a young man from Lousame, was a neighborhood.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balears to look at the labour market, the little man left with her partner that she had even joined to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their messages, it is possible to conclude that their relationship with love has cut off and trends.
She is alone on Menorca in March 2008 and writes: "Alberto is very sweet and sweet because I came to work."
"If I told him, he found it good, but now he realizes what it means to be alone all day and not being free to do and let him do what he wants."
Later she mentioned a message she just received on the phone, "I want you to return this month or let me get a address that I can send you to the boy."
She claims, "If he doesn't like me to leave the kids with my mother, I'll take him off when I'm back."
In May she says of the return to her village: "This week I'll go there, but I'll only stay until 19, because I need to imagine to a job on 20th, if I don't want to lose it."
She explains she takes her first birthday if everything's okay.

Popular Party won 4 Sites in the Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28 November, the PP could play a crucial role in the towns of Leida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant vote and deputy in the last regional elections, the PP has already shown its view to Parliament's elections, and its expectations are more positive, because the number of votes that this party is achieved at these elections is normally doubled as the elections in Catalonia.
Thus, the Catalogue People Party 610.473 votes received by the 2008 Parliament's election, while this paragraph was only 316.222.
Last Sunday the PPC reached 384.091 votes.
If this upward trend - the result of the changing of the PSC's vote share and the introduction of the choice of the PP-, the analyticals of the PP must prognose that, at the election of parliamentary elections, the PPC could increase from 8 to 12 Congress Members, while also CU four (that has now 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 Members (of 25).
These calculations indicate the fundamental importance of catalonies for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People ' s Party, the ERC would lose a deputy, which is now three - while ICV keeps its Members or could win.
However, if the election calendar is maintained, the next term is to be held in May 2011, and the People's Party (PP) may also be the language at the wage to prepare the socialist rule, in four province headquarters and with its majority in the city Council of Barcelona, one of the largest budgetary management: 661 million euros for 2011.
The nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the citys of Barcelona, Tarragona, Léida and Gerona, where socialists do not achieve a majority, nor their traditional associations (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debacle, it is not unexpected that this party will lose its representation in the Common Council of Barcelona, where 5% of the votes should be achieved.
However, the PP marked an increase in their vote share in the four province headquarters and could become a crucial force in Barcelona, Leida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced to play the main roles in Tarragonas, where they had registered before the current citizensman Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
The PP is only 500 votes behind the PSC. The Citizensminister, Angel Ross, has a good relationship with Mariano Rajoy during the last election campaign.
In other important places, for example, in Badalona, Castellon, or Reus, the People's Party could represent a significant increase.
Currently, the PP is represented in 34 cities management catalonians and aims to train lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalogue Cell concerned thousands of travellers Al Qaida
Besides the seven feasts in Barcelona there were three more in Thailand
The seven of the police officers of the police of Barcelona police and Nigerians formed the skihadist cells, controlled by Thailand, the various Al Qaida groups, including the "Move movement to release Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Lashkar e-Taiba" (Let) - was the last author of the attacks in Bombay, who called 106 dead in 2008.
The Spanish Minister of Internal Affairs has a great importance for these investigations, which is so far that he assures the "Operation Campai" as the "Operation Campai" of Al Qaidas worldwide becomes "featured" and, as a result of their ability to act".
The researchers show that in the two years in which the cells were active in Catalonia, thousands of places were sent to Thailand, where they were false and then sent to the groups where the criminal Galaxie Al Qaida was collected, so that their "fighters" could without prejudice the borders of European and other Western countries.
The discovered cell is not the only one of the discharged networks active in Europe, and therefore other European police units, except the Thai research bodies, have also affected the investigation, and it is not excluding that in the EU's area in the next days, it will come to similar attentions as those carried out at the past weekday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabra Asghar, Malik Setikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Battle Agunbiad) was captured in Thailand, where Pakistanian Muhammad Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Syrian countries were arrested.
They had brought from Bangkok from the cells registered in Spain and other European countries.
The catalanic network - a part of that was destroyed in 2009 - was, in particular, stealed to tourist passes in accordance with the terms of the International Islamic Front.
This means that the documents on the name of men in the age of 25 to 45 and had to be valid for several years; they did not show a vis-stamp.
In research, it is stressed that there was no connection between the Catalonia arrests and the attack in Bombay, although the author was "Lashkar e-Taiba", one of the groups of recipients stolen in Spain and inflicted travel costs in Thailand.
However, it should be reminded that a few days before the catalonian attack was sent by means of a money transfer undertaking several thousand dollars, which were used in the purchase of Prepaid cards for mobile phones, which later were used by the members of the "Commando", which were prepared for the life of 106 people.
The police has invited a large documentation.
PP requests a transmission of the tax agreement by Mas
The Chairman of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity last night to present his own conditions to support his officer as President of the Generality, which does not differ from those already established during the election campaign and allows to comply with the priority of the economic recovery and the submission of regionalist independence, such as a financial compensation agreement that the regionalist leaders wants to propose on the top of his mandate.
The Chairman of the Catalan People's Party moved to the security of Artur Mas, which she gave to the 18 deputy who had won on Sunday at the last Sunday, a point that is more than enough to feel unreasonable; because the candidate of the Burger-regionalist Party CU has indicated that at least one of the opposition parties is in the vote.
The future conclusions that regionalists want to join in the future parliamentary elections are depending on a possible intent with the PP, but the discussions which leads to massa with the other participants are turned into catalonies.
As regards the PPC participating, it calls for the support of the Officer 'all discussions on the sovereignty and independence' and for an agreement on the financial balance between the State and the Autonome region, as in the Baskenland, and the CU Party's headquarters, to submit a referencedum.
Many political leaders are commonly in order to make the built political equipment of regional management more slower and to put up the inheritance and gift taxes.
The details of the negotiations on the Office of Mas are employed by the PPC Jord Cornet and Dolor's Montserrat.
But Joaquim Nadal (PSC) has already announced a hard opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV), who will join Joan Puigcerkos (ERC), Albert Rivera (Citadans) and Joan Laport (Solidaritat Catalana).
The Old Employee confirms that the death cases are not to be returned to "unless measures"
The owners of the old house in Olot do not exclude that their chairman killed 11 older people
The responsibilities of the Older Secret La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave last night a press conference where they found the damage of the criminal acts Joan Vila Dilmes - the chairman who had killed at least 11 old people for whom he was responsible.
The chief of the former secret, Joan Sala, was in charge of his lawyer, Joan Cañada, in court and proclaimed: "La Caritat wants to accompany the responsible (for the death cases), but "the right and our detention forced us to accept the process and civil detention".
The establishment must not only take a social loss because it had not been identified at the time with the offences of the chair, but now pay a high deterioration rate calculated by the lawyers of the victim's family members.
Joan Vila Dilme claimed that the first crime returned in August 2009 and that he has been murdered since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodys - former patients of the age of the age and diseases - because he summoned that no doctor had investigated the losses personally, but the forms were telephonely developed because of their age and diseases.
The Chief of La Caritat destroyed this point around and explained that "extinct measures could have been the reason for accidents".
The lawyer of La Caritat added that it was "no indication for vessels for a person other than the accused."
On August 29, 2009, the baptized baptized 11 murders and declared that the first crime was pronounced on August 29, 2009 and murdered the second old woman after a half months.
In this case, he killed with a overdose insulin, in difference with the first crime, in which he had administered a mixture from different medications.
The Chief of La Caritat stated that the access of the staff to the medicines is only difficult to control.
The insulin insulin pain and the cocktail of cocktail, in six of nine offences began to release patients from their suffering.
But the results of the laboratory surveys will find whether Vila was lying and actually chosen a less severe death for his first victims, or if he burned them from inside, he accepted smuggles, how he had done in three women he killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, we do not have faith, no matter what the number of the murdered murders may be more, and this is justified that Vila had made very different words before the court and that there is no sense to change his course after eight succeeded murders.
They said they made themselves out of this reason and to declare the scope of these events of justice.
Drugs of the European Central Bank (ECB)
The investors reacted last night to the threat of the President of the ECB Trichet, who warned: "The markets should not underestimate our reaction powers."
The Euro Peripheral countries' risks have been dramaticly increased and the shares of the European banks are more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can be angry and that the euro has not assessed a few points of concern.
The events of yesterday are typically for an illicit market, which is in the measure where it recovered again, however, due to the closure of shorter and higher specculative positions.
The institutional investor will still not lose his fear.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank invited us to return our Liquidity Actions, which the ECB must make a return to the fourth year in the morning and probably some time in the future.
The Federal Bank requested the adoption of the plan for purchase of State debts, since it is inefficace, as well as the removal of all extraordinary liquidity measures, which should be maintained by an unexpected access.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect that the current liquidity measures "alone to March" will be extended and that the fourty-year registration with unlimited access to the quarterth end to ensure liquidity at least June will be maintained.
We are also expecting that the programme for purchase obligations will be continued and that it will be a strengthening signal.
If the expectations created are not fulfilled, the extraordinary reaction of the markets will be returned from last night and if it is hardly maintained to return to our Liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Like at the ECB meeting in May, where the bank confirmed that the purchase of State debt papers would not take into consideration and assemble the markets thereafter, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and bearing.
In May she showed the teeth and at midnight she told her to have a lot of buying, which provoked a new part of the market.
Last night the auction of single-year state institutions in Portugal was very weak.
The government was only 500 million to 5,28%, with 750 million to 4,81% in the previous auction.
However, the interest rates in Portugal increased 30 base points in the whole curve, reflecting a change in the markets in accordance with the words Trichets.
In Ireland, the numbers of the debt debt in Allied and Bank of Ireland were published.
The sum is estimated for about 100,000 million short-term and possible 15 000 more. There is time to create private capitals, or these banks are entitled to them.
Although Ireland has lost his credibility after it had not recognized the problem with stress tests in July, the numbers are acceptable and helping to reduce the incertitude.
However, on Thursday, the Government must receive the parliamentary approval to its new budget and, as it is not yet sufficient to support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has prepared its discours on the summit of State Heads and Government on 14 December moderate, where it has been asked for political unity to show that we are playing together the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries to the nine Sinfonie Beethovens.
Last night, the Spanish Government President introduced the plan of action to be adopted on Friday by the Council.
Rent reform, transparency in autonomy regions such as financial institutions, decrease of the State deficit, liberalization, privacy and job-making measures.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish burs has increased around 4,5%, doubles as the rest of the European bourses.
In comparison with February, the reaction of the Government and the Spanish Central Bank was quick and convinced, and we benefit from the surprising effect.
Today, there is a wealth of a three-year state support that will benefit from Trichet's effect, and therefore we make a strong demand that will remove all doubts of our debt capacity.
For Spain, the invitation of a aid plan would be self-received.
We would receive liquidity that we don't need. The Smart Office has 40 billion euros, three times as much as in March. The interest rates are over cost and access to the markets would be closed freely.
Nevertheless, our strategy should respond to the Motto César's wife: "This is not just its own, but also the shoes."
Just Mut, we're gonna do this!
The President of Eulen, on request of his children, accepts the Society Assembly of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the Alvarez family, owners of the Eulen and El Enebro corporations, does not disappear.
David Álvarez, the founder of the enterprises, will fear the Society Assembly of El Enebro, which will take place at the request of five of its seven children on 16th, since he holds them "absolutely unlikely". His children will try to receive a majority to control the administrative bodies of the company - inhuman of the Weingus Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Alvarez and his children David and María José provide the legal measures for a new judiciary capital in their struggle to control a part of the company group.
The founder of the largest maintenance of business services seems not ready to submit control in its legislation to the bodies of El Enebro.
The Board of Administration was issued by five of its seven children, which were appointed to members of the Administrative Council on 18 January of this year, which was already undertaken in the trade register.
The Society Assembly of El Enebro, which was appointed by the Court of Commerce No. 2 of Madrid for the 16th anniversary, has solved a new shock in the shock of the Alvarez family.
The call of the Judge to recommend the Assembly is the only legal way to ensure the invitation of the Society's Assembly.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Paul, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz will be acknowledged by David Alvarez as a "uncertain means of the applicant - his five children - to declare through legal discrepancies, complainant powers and legal abuse of the congregation for non-declared on January 18th," as official speakers explain.
This argument is the basis for the warning of the congregation in the next place to explain it as "absolutely unlike".
The same protagonists, who smell in discrete smells, have already tried to call a congregation on a pathy way in June.
At El Enebro - ownership and owners of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, in addition to other property values - control David Alvarez' seven children 100% of the capital.
Instead, the founder of the service group calls for family protocols the use of more than 51% of the capital.
This is the actual background of the matter which the judge has decided in the hearing on the treatment of the claims for which no date has been established.
Red Bull is seen in the F1 with a secret weapons of Siemens
The cars are improved in real time with a software.
Since Red Bull 2004 ended in the world of the form 1, his history is expressed in this exciting universe of the speed of surprises and success.
At the beginning, no one gave the new observance and, despite his upset, during the last season at the end of November all at the winning of the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso.
Without the ability of the German pilot and Master Sebastian Vettel or the performance power of the Renault motor, the "secret weapons", which led the Multi Siemens Red Bull into the hands and thus created a winner team to become legend.
In fact, it is a powerful software to simulate processes in 2007 which are intended to make the German company not with authors.
This information programme called PLM was used for the development of mount chains in manufactures in the world, energy work and high-specific instruments.
Bezweckt will be a credible reproduction or simulation of a product or process before it is actually built to avoid such errors and overflow costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon's cameras, Sukhoi’s aircraft and the most famous use vehicles of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, director of the Siemens Industry Division, explains that with the use of this software in the form 1 - Fabric Red Bull "in few hours, almost in real time" the changes and improvements that are identified on the costs and tests can be deleted and implemented.
The Russian Worm concludes that 1992, at average, ten technicians were working in the rears, which could lead to at least three or four improvements in a season.
The Red Bulls Team today has 180 high-qualified young people. With powerful EDV plants, they perform analysis and all possible changes to the rear car.
The Siemens Manager explained that the PLM software could be able to analyze and improve all components of the Red Bull rear cars, with the exception of the engine for which Renault is exclusively responsible.
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamic and the security elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred to reality within less than 24 hours from the virtual reality of the Simulator by continuing production and hightech auto-claves.
The only limit that has been placed in this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million that can be evacuated by a form 1 - team for its counterparts in a season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech fabric for the development and manufacturing of its rail cars in a 50-kilometer away from London.
This is two buildings where visits, especially from journalists, are strongly limited.
All that happens there is top secret.
The accommodation includes 580 people, including the two pilots, the World Master Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bulls real form 1 - Held is uncertainly the last Master Sebastian Vetell.
Among the huge technological resources that the energy drink manufacturers in the services of its participation on the rear lines, further protagonists, whose support is inestimated and their knowledge is equal to zero.
The technological head of the work, Steve Nevey, emphasized that five years ago, was still able to say that the progress in the F&E-renarms sector with 50% to win and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the share values have changed; the technology is 85% of success while the contribution of pilots is estimated to 15%.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber never can be replaced by EDV, because they "isn't predictable gladiators".
HP will open twenty own loans with local departments in two years.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) last night, his first exclusive load in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of the sales network that exists from twenty businesses with 80 to 100 squaremeters which will open the multi in the next two years in Spain.
The company agrees this initiative with the already existing 16 sales areas in the multimarket industry, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Court English.
The Chairman of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, called the rebuilding load at the Great Vía in Barcelona, property of Pont Reyes, has cooperated with the HP for thirty years.
The North American Company Group is intended to establish 200 sales in Europe until 2010, which has 20 in Spain.
The first week in Bukarest, Romania, and Belgrade (Serbian). Barcelona is the third business.
Herrera did not want to betray the coming new openings, but did not conclude that Madrid could be the next goal.
The Chairman, who is also Chief of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy for load opening is always equal. It supports a local department with experience and business knowledge.
The North America business group is the only loading equipment (with interactive products to accompany). In Europe, all loads will be equal to the same.
In addition, HP is responsible for the training of the load staff.
Helena Herrero said that it was not a Franchising system and hobbed that it was regarded with the exclusive sales institutions, "to optimize the customer service and the advice of small and small companies at the purchase and later, even the packaging."
The load in Barcelona has a pioneer pilot program that resolves the technical problems of HP devices with guarantee.
A online service builds a connection to technical centres in Maastricht (Holland).
"In this way, we can solve problems in ten minutes, sometimes to two days."
"This system has been developed in particular for small and small companies and private companies, since large companies have already made their service contracts for technical customer service", said Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants his rivals in three years a million customers 'clauen'
The employee member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a hard year for the banks, but first a new liquidity crisis and a prophecy period will be the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, it is expected to have an indent of interest rates that try to balance the banks with increased costs and prices for payments.
Sabadell expects to start a million private students in three years - one to exist.
Sabadell has found the way to create the coming three years and so to survive in a very complex economic environment.
The bank will introduce a new three-year plan in 2011.
The objective is not only to survive without taking the public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share for a million private students - 700 000 if you want to deal with customers who will lose the bank - and this is the great challenge that this bank is before, because it has more attention to its business workshops than to now.
In this year, she has joined 250 000 private students and 50 000 companies.
Their market share in private students is at 3,5 per cent, while business students represent more than 10 per cent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is the increase in productivity, speech exercisity, cost reduction, and the challenges that the bank face with this is present together with the annual final report.
It is only a few banks to establish and publish objectives in these difficult times, since all the plans of the banks have been divided through the financial crisis through the world.
This year, Sabadell is completed by its Optimate Legislative Plan four years ago, which was initially extended to three years, but it was extended to a business year.
The key goal of the bank is the customers who will leave the sparcasts.
In a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola emphasized, 2011 would be a "sweetie" year "with great reign".
The manager is out of that, Spain only comes out of the crisis.
Furthermore, it would be "severely difficult," in two or three years "making jobs" - based on the survival of the banks.
Even if it comes to the fact that the war against Passive - which punishes the interest margins - will be defeated, the risk appropriations that banks and sparkases have to pay for their emissions towards liquidity, as the compensation for weak profit rates is already deleted to the price for credits.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are structural and they will exercise pressure on credit."
"We haven't turned the hair, but the interest differences are very high," Guardiola replied.
Banesto already expressed the recommendation of her filial network to limit the payment of long-term loans and increase the interest difference (see Cinco Días, 22 and 27 November).
The manager also acknowledged that the banks were now following the statistics "augmenting the expenditure", but "in a framework that was prescribed by the competition".
Saadell's guideline is based on an organic growth, even though the group does not exclude corporate business as always.
Nevertheless, he assures that in Spain "wise larger enterprises are needed".
"It will change everything in the next year," he says.
He emphasizes that the need for capital is currently "augmented" and does not conclude that some Spanish financial institutions will be deleted in red numbers.
He believes that the FROB could replace the currency market in capital flows.
After firming that Saadell can also survive the markets, he realized the argument of some bankers who already prophesies a new liquidity crisis.
He emphasizes that nothing can be rounded, but in contrast with the accidents in June, you can achieve short-term funding on repossession business and thus take the crisis.
CECA closes a second fusion wave of the spring boxes
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, was able to come to a fusion weather of sparcase and emphasize the speed that the industry will be restructured.
When the concentration process began the Spanish swatch cases, several spring cases were not involved at the first phase.
Instead, the Director-General of the Spanish Sparcase Association (ECCA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, would not take place this second round.
"I believe that the majority of the fusions has been closed. Cajasol's participation in the Banka Civica group cannot be considered as a second round, which was much more about adjustments."
"The largest part is closed. It may be that we have been instead of seventy-third or fourty, but all important processes are already completed. They were controlled by Banco de Spain, which has strongly supported all operations."
In a breakfast organized by the business leader and manager Aragonians (ADEA), Olavarrieta pointed out that the concentration process was completed as soon as possible and that we must be satisfied with the fresh end that was set in previous times, not now, within the framework of the business plans with Bankco de Spain.
"The transition of 45 Sparcases with a average of 280,000 million insurance file to 17 with 75 500 million is a historically uncomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced to 62 percent and are now much larger than we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement," he hoped.
Olavarrieta declared that "there was a number of uncomfortable views on the slowness of the process, the insecurity and the insensibility", as "Banco de Spain encourages us to complete the slowness of the right before the end of the year."
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, firmed yesterday that Spain had one of the most strict financial systems of Europe and "viellence" of the whole world and complemented that those who doubt it were "no deep knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic association, we must "no concerns" about the situation of the financial institutions and the sparfalls, which have undergoing a "very significant" concentration process that will be completed as soon as possible.
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the Red Line of Germany
Berlin has decided for the maintenance of the euro, but at the same time the European Union has decided.
The smugglings on the market have solved a double response to the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero introduced new adjustment measures, starting at tax deficiencies for small and small enterprises, the regulation of period workers or the relief of the 426 euros for unemployed unemployment support, until 49% of AENA, the management of the Barajas and El Prat airport and 30% of the public lottery.
On the other hand, Elena Salgado, the former government President Felipe González, supported the criticism of the chairman Angela Merkel, as responsible for the current crisis.
How are these procedures to be understood?
It is expected that the features position is not an error of its public work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of the new definition of the euro.
In this way, Germany sets a fundamental new perspective to build our future, which is collected with the maintenance of the old traditions of a majority of his partner.
In view of the rebellious situations in Europe, in Germany there are three possible ways to be speculated from the crisis.
First: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south leaves the euro space.
Second: The re-introduction of the German Mark, although it is now under Science Fiction, supported by a majority of the public opinion, about 50% of the population.
The third: a conversion of the euro in accordance with German proposals, which means: more macroeconomic controls; strict budget management; punishment of countries that are presenting the requirements; possibly the payment of certain countries, and the expansion of the costs of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been delayed since some time, so there is no exit now.
First of 2009, both the IWF and the European Commission encouraged deficits, and the German Government moved towards a constitutional reform from the pool to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign for the inter-department between the need for Germany (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign of the Mediterranean country, as a feature of the decision to save Greece.
This has been a strong criticism, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and published views were absolutely against a salvation of Greece.
Finally, in the last October days, the Merkel has a clear position, which calls for a reform of the European Union Agreements to allow the saving of a country and to impose the private donor to take part in the costs.
This position was expressed as an anti-European, as it continues towards the Irish crisis and all the following.
But its proposal, if something grateful, has been adopted, and in the next months we will participate in the reform of the European Union which will allow these measures from 2013.
Germany took a red line that didn't remember.
It's all that, even if we have to take unfavoured measures, it will not be given the old functionality of the euro from this time.
2013 will be the birth year of a new currency area where the counterparty countries are hardly punished, it will be able to be able to explain to payableness and to take part in the private sector in this case.
Germany shows that we need to spend a hard growth rate, with high spacious and investment rates, consumption level, improvement of productivity and competitiveness, and positive foreign sales.
The other alternatives that are based on debt and buildings with huge loans in the payment balance, as indicated by Spain in boomtimes, will not simply be included.
The offer is clear.
And we would do bad about not understanding it.
It is not only to go down the State deficit until 2013 to three percent.
The demands are much worse.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to distract ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulences are more calm.
And that we will use the possibilities offered to us until spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero also understood this, and his double advertising (the promised reforms after conversation with the big businesses last Saturday and the proclamation of new measures from eve) pointed out that, despite the criticism of Merkel, the order has prepared its way.
But the red line taken by Germany is there, and it doesn't seem to be so that something would change.
With the possibilities taken into consideration, we should not exclude the euro area that is completely cut by little serial countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sports and regulatory environment
Tricks like the Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax, but not the will of conducting a sanction.
The excluded by two players of the Real Madrid Real (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game of 23 November against the Ajax in the Champions League led that a lot of thickness had been borrowed about whether it was an unportuous act or if both players should be sanctified by the EUFA.
As generally known, the two players lost a few minutes before the player (and the team had already obviously winned) time and played several fouls so that the Scheedsdirector showed them the second gentle card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid would join his group, the two players will comply with the sanction required at the next link against the axere, and so without cards in the next game phase.
Finally, the EUFA Disciplinary Committee was the trainer of the club, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different money.
The prominence of a yellow map under such or similar circumstances is no new practice, it is most common in the world of the football.
She is so wide that she is part of the Etho - the unwritten, but in this type of sport - rules.
A part of the debate on the reported case is that a team of the football club Real Madrid (when in his hymne Edelmut and honor had been punished and in other occasions had been punished by his players for similar events) played the main role, and the dramaization by Mourinho, which has added more to his long history than theatral and provocative technicians.
In any case, the debate is about whether it is not explicitly prohibited by the statutes to respect the principles of sport, which means whether these acts are a regular environment.
In this case, the damage caused by the sport should be examined.
The sports spirit defends the physical incertitude of the players, a aspect that has not been threatened by these acts, because it was not agressive game.
Another aspect of a cleaner game is to avoid that the opposite players take an unjusted benefit from the current team.
The paradoxe of the action of the players of the Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we normally understand under a false game or a rule environment, because the circle of the rule was not personally completed to avoid a sanction, but should be as opposite as possible to be punished by the Schiedher.
The players waited and took the sanctions joyfully.
Another question is what kind of advantage the mutual traders have been taken from the disadvantaged foul.
It should be highlighted that the Rivale has not been in a sense of income or benefits for the played game, since the obviously result of this action was that the own team had to continue with less players.
It is no useful strategy for the next game, as the club then does not have these players.
The advantage is obviously that the players start the next stage of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation to a future game.
But this is a long-term advantage, until a certain degree, since the team can ever differ. Furthermore, the players receive a sanction with this action and go to the second cycle of cards where they differ less than in the first cycle.
This is not so clear if it really is a benefit.
Finally, such measures do not oppose sports, including strategic decisions to benefit from the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to deal with sanctions (which would actually be a clear case of regulatory environment), they wanted to choose when they were understood.
They have taken a strategic decision without a punishment or flying before it.
Although the borders between the production and the regulatory environment are different, I believe that this matter is a clear case of production.
I have the impression that the Polemic has been resulting from two factors: because it went on two self-determinations and because of the type of adjusted transmission.
The damage that has been added to the principles of the sport by these acts is less ethical than more ecthetic.
Offers for customers for groups of Christmas meetings in Barcelona
The dictatory of the calendar this year allows a la vine of reservations to fall on the 16th and 17th December.
The payment feasts themselves are wide. They do not want to pay more than 20 to 30 euros.
As the Turron and the Christmas lottery, there are again groups that start to the guest city and free-time business of Barcelona. However, as a result of the economic crisis, they resolve a price in order to also set the customer session, which is the large masses: almost all wants to evacue between 20 and 30 euros for a midday or dinner, confirm the demanded entrepreneurs and associations.
In order to make the booking a little more complicated, the calendar (Silver) has left all orders in the week of 13 December, with the result of a la vine of reserves of dinners at two spotting days (16 and 17.) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have established the group shareholders from budgetary reasons.
In order to avoid rejecting this tradition, many employees pay these from their own tache.
As the conjuncture is always, it is requested for weak prices, confirms the chairman of the guest city body of Barcelona, Gaiity Farràs.
The representative of the Town Association is not expected to predict how the celebration appears in this month.
"The people think it's twenty times before they reserve."
"He wants to go out, but they're very careful of the prices," he stressed.
The business will go well, "the quality to good prices with a good service", he adds, and remembers that customers are expenditure in times of crisis, for which prices are most strengthened by 25 euros.
In a survey in various central restaurants, the night of December 17 leads the suppliers to collaps.
The Soteras Group says that the questions for this Friday would be bombed by less than 30 euros. The group has adapted its menu with full offers between 25 and 35 euros to the conjunction.
In another leading group, Andilana, 16 guests in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), has conducted the property of the calendar, even since November.
"We have made it impossible to keep the previous year prices with the menu for each shooting from 19.95 to 30 euros."
The AN Group, which leads to El Mussoli, Attic, Ququ and the total of 23 places, does not lose the optimism after returning and good income from the second quarter, if even a few days focused perspectives for Christmas business.
Sources of the company group indicated that the 18th over-active day will also be a day with friends who are predicting Christmas.
A Christmas menu has been added for 30 euros or more than prices. The impression that the customers are ready to pay 10% more than in the previous year and, on the contrary, want more details, such as Cava.
In some enterprises, it also looks like green trials, because the employees are again invited, and it shows the impression that the group relations are back in the relief.
Site of the Town Association Fecasarm (as well as the sneeping, restaurant and free-time association of Barcelona) is aware of the vice-president, Enric Gomá, to see the end of the tunnel, and notes that the reservations are totally "reserved", although the customers are "excited".
However, the fun on the party would not be back, no one pays.
The Pakistani nuclear programme has great concern in the United States
Islamabad makes atom weapons "better than every other country".
Enthusiasms of Wikileaks confirmed relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The enthusiasmed content of the correspondency between the North American message in Pakistan and the US Department, which is a huge concern for the Pakistanian Atom programme, is confirmed by the Internetportal Wikileaks.
On the basis of the clear and slight details offering the documents on the content of the conversation and the thinking of the accredited North American diplomates in Islamabad, they emphasize that cooperation between two countries will not be strengthened in the matters of nuclear security, but that the instable Asian countries makes more nuclear weapons " to a faster rhythm than each other country".
In particular, the ownership of the Pakistanian Atom programme - that the weapons are not assembled, but their parts are struck in order to slaughter their destruction when possible attacks - will be prepared without sleep nights.
The following risks include the messanger in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before visiting the former Chief of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The nearness of some nuclear plants to the region attacked by the Taliban, the confusion of the nuclear material and the incidence of the transport of nuclear material."
The large number of persons involved in the Nuclearsenal and the Rakete Programmes will be viewed not only by the United States, but also by Russia as an exercising and reason to handle care.
"Pakistan has to establish strictly credible staff to monitor the nuclear plants; because of the low educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to resolve people who work with Atom or Rakes programmes," said the U.S.S. Corolev, the Russian Foreign Minister, in a discussion with its North American Office.
New at the Internetports Julian Assanges, enthusiasmed documentation, is that cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in matters of nuclear dissemination and the increased time in Pakistan makes nuclear weapons.
In May, a message office, which describes the communication with Pakistan as "freetory", declares: "No transparency is often available; on help offers we do not receive answers or they are rejected."
In another communication, Peter Lavoy, official of the State Secret Service for South America, confirms that "in spite of the economic disaster Pakistan's nuclear weapons are produced so fast as no other country".
The messanger Patterson requested Washington during a visit from the Supreme Headquarter, General Ashfaq Kayani, to " clarify", that "Pakistan's army has to make its quiet support for terrorist groups."
On the Jagd to Wikileaks Chief
Obama calls for a high responsibility for the anti-terrorism fight to prevent new enthusiasms.
Interpol provides a red warning for persecution and relief of Assange.
All that is associated with Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, is a complex labyrinth, in which it is difficult to explain the contents of the experts.
Yesterday, Interpol expressed a "red warning" for "Assange's Success and persecution."
However, it is not a traditional arrangement for the establishment.
She is not new, she is 20 November.
It has also nothing to do with the latest integration of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accusions of sexual abuse that the Australian must put in Swedish.
Moreover, the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, firms "the police knew where and how she could contact Mr. Assange."
On 20th, the International Police Authority, with Sitz in Lyon (France) on application of Sweden, has not been informed by the Swedish authorities until yesterday after the holding of the power.
The 188 Interpol countries are ordered to identify and discover Assange "in order to fix and provide it promptly."
Although Interpol is not able to appoint an individual involved in a red warning, many Member States consider the red warning as a free letter for arrestation - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extraction agreement, as the case of Sweden and England, where Assange may be held.
The action recommended by Assanges lawyers, who published a letter, in which they informed that the 39-year-old Wikileaks reasons are ready to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by video conference.
They also recall that Assange requested the travels from Swedish and compared with the State advisor who received the approval with the prescribed Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, the Head of Stalin.
"This is like a jagd, not like a legal persecution," is accused in the writing.
While the world looks for him - and his mother of Australia from her son's innocent fault - Assange is on a unknown place, however, not angry.
On Monday, he gave the director of the magazine Time per Skype from an uncertain place from an interview. In the conversation he requested the return of the US State Secretariat, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be demonstrated that it was responsible for the order of North American diplomates to spontane the UNO and thus violated the international agreement signed by the United States, it should be returned," he said.
His opinion was sentenced yesterday by the presidency secretariat of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who called the application to return as "laugh and absurd".
"I'm not sure why we should put value to the opinion of a type with a website," he explained the CNN sender.
Obama himself has taken a high responsibility for the anti-terrorism fight, Russian Travers, with the prevention of new documents.
The attempt to give a less attention to the speaker of the Chairman Barack Obama, Assange, is in contrast to the views that the conservative politicians and comments in these days.
Mr Peter King, who is leading to the Chairman's Chairmanship at the National Security Committee of the House, has requested the State Department to investigate the possibility of establishing Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations, "to assume their money and to follow every who supports it or gives a contribution."
Tom Flanagan, advisor of the Canadian President Stephen Harper, was still gone, and he had to call Assange to "more".
"Obama had to turn him into a target board and use a non-employed aircraft or something like that."
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, Baptist Minister, former Governor of Arkansas and possible presidency candidate.
"Whoeverever was left in the government's information, he's the detriment and everything that is no direction, it's a mild punishment," he explained to the Sender Fox.
Puigcerkos is looking for an eye winner in the ERC
The Republican leader allows the party to vote secretly on its remaining in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the full assembly principle.
Joan Puigcerkos seems to have found a receptive for the several times to go from a internal rise in the lines of the loss of 11 Members and half of the electoral ERC.
The Participant is aware that his retreat threat is not sufficient to the sides of the former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector today is struck as its mentor itself, and he does not cause the same offence as other former struggles.
Hence, the leader of Esquerra tried to win the new critics with an eye winner, which would ensure its position to the next community choice.
For the beginning, the ERC's over 200 regional members could have been secret of their stays in the office.
With choices, not with high hands.
If the carodists wanted to pass a punishment to the Chairman, they could do this without fearing repressives.
In fact, the Chief wants to avoid the impression of disruption as well as the undertaking under his person.
In several interviews, he confirmed that he would feel the half of the voices no longer confirmed, and he added without indicating percentual values, a result of "in the Bulgarian style" would not be good.
Carod Nuesans call for more than only the party to provide its office. An unsuccessful gesture is controlled by Puigcerkos the upper body of the conference.
But as they do not have sufficient majority to obtain delays, they will agree with the state of a plan of action from now to May.
To this end, they expect to be able to enhance the preparation of the document on strategic reorganization that the guideline will be submitted to the Council on 18th vote.
Their hope is to be made for Puigcerkos. On the contrary, it is to be promised to present the Congress in the early 2011, which the party's piece already holds for a fact.
The ERC participating group is the view that the "polyphony" damages the stability and is trying to bring the organization into the ability to shoot their shocked doors behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by the official consuller Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
In view of the fact that the Puigcerkos is an idealist, the owner of Innovacio was based on a fact that the participating "in exchange against various goals".
He counted five of whom two were on the front.
First of all, the "restructuring" of the board, so that at least 90% of the members of the Party, which means the integration of new faces in the area of Carod.
The second could be the great news.
Huguet proposes that the full assembly principle should finally be set out as a functional manner.
In this way, he defeats a reform of the Statutes that it will allow to hold the conferences with the selected delegates.
From the end of the full assembly model - one exception in the Spanish party system - is the Puigcerkos' team that has already been fighting on the last two conventions, as they were.
Indeed, at the meeting of 2008, the partialisation was held with the review of the principle of the full assembly on a convention which should be addressed with the reform of the Statutes.
This end is still understood, since the information of the internal relief in the last few years was not ratified.
Now, without taking the critical sectors, the time could be done to restore this matter and end forever.

Reader Exception Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN declared that the former panist party had the right to apply to the National Order Commission and to request what the right is to do with him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, ensured that the exclusion of the Manuel Espino Barrietos had been right and that the former participatory members of the PAN had the right to apply to the national order committee and to request what the right is subject to him.
In an interview that took place before the complaint Gabino Cué Monteagudos as the Governor of the State, he stated that the exclusion of Espinos was a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an independent decision of the Order Commission in Sonra."
"Mr Espino has the right to apply to the Commission's orders of the National Council, in his case, to take a decision from a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he stated that it was not to think at the time 2012 and that an alliance to the Presidency candidates has never seen at the negotiation table.
Nava Vazquez was convinced that the national action was strengthened from the internal vote on the coming 4 and 5 December, in which his followers were selected.
"This (a Allianz in 2012) is a theme that never had been at the negotiation table, at least now. It was a proposal for the community choice, he was successful and fulfilled his purpose."
The panist leader declared that the PAN returns to 71 years of dialogue, so "not fears the internal competition; on the contrary, "We enjoy them and it strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the Council would, unfortunately, choose the best Chairman who would need the National Action for the next three years, and therefore he would "to those who would decide the Council".
"I'm totally unreasonable and open, and I'd be proud of transmitting each of the five of them to the office of the party seat."
He predicted that the revocation of the party marked in the last elections of 4 July would reflect in the following elections, although "that's not at the time to think at 2012."

In this regard, he expected that the three governments, which were exhibited from Alliances between Oaxaca, Publa and Sinaloa, would take the fahnes and observe all the country, so "will be placed in them, and I am sure that Gabino is higher than the requirements".
When he is asked for the criticism of the PRI at the President Felipe Calderón for his discount in the context of his four-year-old government, Caesar Nava called for the members of the PRI to consider the six-year period of the former President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believe that the governments of Zedillo and Salina were better than Fox and Calderón, they should begin to defend them, they should finally come out of the pain," he confirmed.
He believes that the deputy of the federal government expresses expressions such as those he can make in his discurso in the National Auditor, as it does not prohibit the mouth and less a centre in this country.
Obama sets up in Twitter for the law for undocumented students
"If you are the Dream Act - law, then call your senators and strike to adopt this law," the President of the United States in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported the country-wide mobilization for supporting the Dream Act - law on the legalization of undocumented students with a message on his personal blog in the social Twitter network.
"If you are to adopt the Dream Act - law, then call your senators and strive to adopt this law," tweeted Obama.
His short-cutting communication contains a cyberlink to a comprehensive document requesting the public to be contacted with their senators, since the vote of the law directly promotes.
"If your voice we wait, the time came to listen to you," he stressed.
The message was distributed after the 42 Republican Senators and locked all the voice for each law, except the expansion of tax disadvantages from Bush and the financing of the Government.
A such blockade announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the distribution of nuclear weapons.
As regards the blockade of the Republicans of the Dream Act and other projects, the President Robert Gibbs said, he trusted that, once the issue has been solved, a timeplan for the other projects could be set.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that fiscal matter must be completed before the end of the year..."
"I think we can meet a agreement at all times and then we can plan the end of the rest," he said.
The Chairman of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday, "he would ask the vote on the conclusion of the debate, so that the Dream Act - Act, with which the initiative for non-documented students could be agreed to the Senate since the next Thursday, although the next week would be likely.
The Dream Act version or the American dream law would be legalized by about 8000,000 young people who were inmigrated in the United States when they hadn't been sixty years old while the last five years lived in this country and have been registered to a higher educational institution or to the army.
But the defenders of the law need to adopt the initiative sixty votes, because they are appointed on the votes of a handful Republican, and the organizations of the Chairmans of this project have an intensive impact on the adoption of the law at the time.
The democrats, among which the majority supports the Dream Act, have over 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, would vote and only a Republican Richard Lugar from Indiana has announced his support to the law.
The Defenders of the Dream Act must therefore be on their side if other democracies should decide to turn back to the initiative.
The majority of the Republicans, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who overlooked Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans, who supported the Dream Act in the past, are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but explained that it would not be supported at another time.
Another Republican who had spoken for the law, John McCain, has not yet established his position.
Although the Representative House has another version, analyticals agree with the Dream Act in the Senate before the largest obstacles.
Put the fingers with literature into the wound
The second round of 'The Lust in the Language' was a swimming course in which the participants became strong for the story
"I understand the sex in the language, but I understand... The finger in the wound? What is expected from me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who opened the second round of 'Los placeres de la language', a cyclus that fed the Spanish language literature and used the subtitle of its question at this time ( on another event the round table was given to the sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "Bring us in difficulties," the Argentinan writer sweet to the public, which was mainly composed of young people who gathered together on the International Book Messe in Guadalajara (FIL), to attend the modernized round table of Marisol Shultz, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela reads a text that she taught on Gonzalo Celorio, and then marked the shultz as a great story. Luisa speaks in the first person and is the protagonist who is to learn what is a "want" and is from a doctor to whom she did not answer, but provides instructions for the leadership of their recording.
The infector convinces her: "Patience is not my strength, maybe it's my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumalogs, which you slaughtered on the midst of the Gang, and which you declared that the desire is no scientific term, the psycho-analytics encounters the secret: "The Wrest is the really open, the symbolic is the narrow."
The main figure of the discovery is facility and closed that she "assumed that it is really open and not existing". But she is convinced that the pleasant in the language and in its cases is mixed.
Valenzuela, the writers, played with both.
The Nicaraguaner Sergio Ramírez also presented an enthusiasming story that he called 'Promise', and in which the fingers were not mentioned in the wound, but are discovered.
In response to the magic realism, he spoke of a famous magnificent magician that was touched by the clouds, swimming men, or rebuilding the torment lost by a girl. The story made a magnificent and reported by America, the great Roman, who failed from the beginning to his own chronists, and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticized the overflow of the stories told by the overseers.
"Cervantes, who called us all (the writers), shocked the predicted witnesses who were in the stories that were true, but on the other hand, the history of the Americas would never be told - with educational power that even the shame came down."
However, he has said, "If it's the crazy and liars that are the best to imagine the things," and there is a closer approach to reality and lies, where you don't know anymore, to whom the story belongs, where the physic literature reaches the gateway.
He actually calls it the 'Tradition Cervantes'.
"We have tried to be what he's told."
When Mayra Montero was at the series, the writers commented and glorified the diversity of the interpretations to which the invitation of the FIL to the round table "The Fingers in the Wonder".
The Cuban and Porto Ricanese had contributed to the great wounds of social violence that their country - like the whole Latin America - as a result of the fight against drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poesie, good songs contained a quiet, not predictable commitment," she explained, after highlighting that literature communication and liability is to build between the author and readers as a "chemical reaction".
In the evening, the Spanish detector, Luis García Montero, also decided to have “the fingers of the engaged writer in the wound of the scriptor”.
He noted that in a fast living world also the intellectual habits and the control of consciousness go on to dogmatics, and he will forgot: "It is a small none behind each confirmation and a small ja behind each injury."
"To be our thoughts and reality in possession, we must nuance: and Nuanciers often urge to put the fingers into the wounds and to smell those who feel much better when they are in the form of charikatures, black and white, in predicted ideas without nuances, and also to strive the powerful ones that it intended to take attention to the world in black and white shares, and calling for a sense of writing again.
Romano fight for his first title
Ruben Omar Romano looks back on three finish games, he experienced in his career, but three times he played decisive games.
The dual between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end of the game also has two different styles that are prescribed from its trainers, and the engagement marked by oppositions reflects the results.
Ruben Omar Romano looks back on three finished games, he experienced in his carriage, but three times he had decisive games, and until now he was well maintained because this opportunity is of a very special importance for him.
The Argentinian has highlighted the medaille to the second champion, he remained a step behind the winners, and it's surprising that he has launched end games with the same team.
The Santistic Strategy reached the first end game as a trainer at the tour open 2002, when the Morelia had the wheels in hand with which he had produced a great degree against Toluca with 4-2; later, Clausura 2003, he reached the crucial dual that also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Preparing with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', where they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to turn back, since the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros on 210 minutes of play, but at 1 meters he came with 3-1 and took two options to switch his title, but the three of his players lacked the 11 steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two finish games with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rivals. Thus he would never ever be persecuted by the disaster and free from the wicked magic to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he confirms that the most important is the game itself for him.
"I want to become Champion, I don't want to break statistics, this is for a club, for my dedication, which I give, and therefore the title will come to me, but what happened before it is the most important," commented the taxer when you ask him about the lost end games.
The last end game has remained strong in the memory of him, assured that he had learned much of this: "The only lesson we can get out of this is that until the Scheedsdirector does not fail the end, we can't celebrate at the line, the players are also prepared, because the last time we were preparing with two editions, and I believe that it's a teacher until the game is ended, there's no place to celebrate."
To know that this series could be decided by one meter shoes, not worried to him, because he trusted his players: "There are never going to come to the shooting, you want to end in the regular game time, but sometimes there is no alternative and you must be prepared to be prepared, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately we prepared a bad game, sometimes as a result of nervousity or strong effort, to keep the title already in the hands, which leaves us something for this game, and we hope that this time will not come."
It's in Romanso Macht to be not only a second champion and to expend the smell that brings the title with herself.
The United States changes the rules for the maintenance of a visum
The persons must be presented before talking at the consultation at the services for Visual Survey Services; the costs will be reduced in waiting time.
Since 10 January 2011, the procedures for the application of a visa are changed in the message of the United States and the consoles.
The new procedure requires the majority of the applicants before their discussion in the consultation with the Services for Visual Inspection (ASC, the initial bookings in English) to be presented.
The ASC staff shall provide the biometric data of the applicant to be reviewed by the consultant before the conversation.
The new procedure has certain benefits for the aspirants, including:
The overall costs for the completion of the visa are not needed to pay the terms, the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is equipped to be paid.
The applicant only provides a single payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the contrary to $140 for a tourist visa, $ 150 for Visa with application (including Visa for time workers) and $390 for handlers and investors.
Those who want to extend their visa only must not conduct a conversation in the consultation, they must only be presented by the next ASC where they present their documents and are taken by their finger presss.
Since the biometric data are obtained in the ASC, the applicants who need a second term for the discussion in the consultation are less time than previous.
Those who invite the visa in the consoles of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo have no longer to pay the service offer of 26 dollars.
Additional information about the new visa application procedure can be found at the following site: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the Fund for Foreign Life
The North American Railway Agency introduced a press conference to provide a fund tomorrow, which will have an impact on the search for living in all.
The National Air and Railway Authority (NASA) of the United States takes place tomorrow, Thursday, a astronomical discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of foreign life.
The Fund will be presented at 13:00 p.m. at a press conference at the NASA seat in Washington by astronomic experts. This is a science that investigates the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When the press conference insured the NASA, it will be "a supervisory fund for searching for extraterrestreat life" which was resolved with experts from other countries.
The discovery could describe the theory that it can exist in phenomenonal environments that are still inhabitable for human creatures. The hypothesis has been discovered that these are in intelligent lives - like people - can change if they improve their conditions of life.
It seems to be a microbike found on the basis of the Mono Lake at the Yosemite National Park, California, where she lives in a surrounding that has been maintained too giftous for all human forms, since the sea is strong.
In any way, the microbios use the arsen as a survival resource. In view of this capacity, the possibilities that it is on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere could give similar life.
If these organisms pollute the ar, according to the astrobiologists, "is actually another form of life, there is a second life form that differs from the known ones."
The room journey will be known tomorrow, on Thursday, at the press conference, the real scope of its funds is known.
At the conference, the geobiologs Pamela Conrad participate in studying the possibility of life on Mars, and the Biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists, the Titan (the largest moon Saturns) studyed whether its chemical composition of the earth is different.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and Pattern forms an opposition block
With the reform of the Organization Act on the Congress, the two party system will be introduced.
The 60th Legislative period was started, and it was already installed a block of opposition by the members of the PRD, PT, convergence and Jesus Manuel Patron Montalvo, who represented himself as an independent person.
Before the start of the 60th session, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergence, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo from the PRD and Patrón Montalvo against the reform of the organic law.
With this reform, they repeated it would introduce a 'third party system', since there were now two people, the same number as the parties that controlled the Congress.
These four Members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinators, were the only ones who voted against the presidency identified by the Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his property as the Chairman's Chairman.
Corvera Quevedo explained that the PRI and PAN parties would have introduced their political arrangement with these reforms.
He concluded that in the next days they would speak to the representatives of the PAN and PRI to change the scheme, and that they were going out of your political will and if they did not have it, they would be retraced by both parties with which the opposition coalition would end.
"I come (the opposition coalition), this is what I see, because we will be excluded from all decisions that do not take into consideration the opinion of the other."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergence declared that it would be consistent with PRD, PT and Patron and that it would therefore be a pluralistic group.
It could not be allowed, he continued that the Congress, after he was monopolist, should now be "duopolist".
"It is not the spirit of the law reform that the Congress has to rule forever a two-party system."
"For the beginning, this group begins with five Members and speaks with other colleagues and colleagues to become more", explained the Convergence Member.
Hezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT expressed that the Congress had now become a 'beast' for two.
"For the time it was just a party, now they share this to the second."
Patron Montalvo requested to respect the Members and to submit their place to the negotiations.
"The five, which are currently dismissed as different groups, have decided to agree to take up our place at the negotiations table, because because he has made reforms by the other and devastated, we have remained outside and we have not agreed with this reform."
200 000 weight more for "the delivery"
The city management of Mazatlán pays a further check to the employee of the electric material company.
Another check over some more than 200 000 peso for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city management.
This includes the amount paid in the second half year to the owner of the Electronic Materials company, 1 200 000 Peso.
According to the page for more transparency of the city management, this was issued on a amount of 200.144.56 Peso spectrum by the number 9258447 last November with the "Open Accounts".
The Teacher Luis Miguel López Moreno had already predicted that more money from the community would go to this supplier. It will be observed by the Auditria Supreme del State because it sells too higher prices.
What has not been mentioned, the total amounts that are debt to you and then the number of checks that are still issued for Camacho Palazuelos.
"It was nothing purchased with her, it will only be paid the debts as well as the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The latest scenes "toys" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, 2 of 15 October, 19 October, 29 October, and this last of 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as it is legally prescribed, if an ASE company is in question, in order to avoid that other administrations request their services, the Ombudsman would ensure that its services would not be taken again.
After the Noroeste magazine published on 25 July the examination of the schecks issued by the city administration to its suppliers, it was known that, from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, he had paid the community over 10 million peso with 42 schecks at Camacho Palazuelos during the three-year official period of the Master Jorge Abel López Sánchez.
It also found businesses with Jumatam where they entered Schecks in value of more than 3 million peso.
Tourism places must be improved
Tourist companies regret the accident of the foreign tourists because of the bad state of the Gloria Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlan.
After the struggle of a foreign tourist in the invasion of the Gloria Sánchez Taboada, the tourism sector of Mazatlan requested the authorities, the areas that are in a bad condition and a bad picture on the port city, to give special attention.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, chairman of the Soviet Association of Zona Dorada, recalled that, in various occasions, it was requested to meet the goal of travel and to convert the bad conditions that the tourists are to new employment opportunities or roads.
He said the bad state of the roads and roads would have been negatively affected, since the tourists came to the slaughter and looked at the disorder, whereas they would apply the close shoes.
"Political politicians do not know what it means to close a company a day and they don't think about how much money you lose; but they wouldn't carry out the construction work in this way slowly and unplanned."
The hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the storm of the tourist would have taken note of the lack of prevention and the remaining maintenance process of the city.
"The congregation must take its responsibility and avoid what happens again. How to do this? Well, by a preventive care instead of improving everything in the next place," he explained.
"We waited for ten to have a cleaner city. Because not only because it is a foreign transportation area, we have to keep it up, but also we have a right to a cleaner living room. City management has to change their strategy to get the city in a good condition."
" There are other places that are also unpleasant and unfinished," he said, "for example, the Escudo and the Venadite of Mazatlan."
"Our day we need more than only advertising to closure tourists. It must be offered a good product, a city that cleans its streets and streets, and keeps the tourist attractions constantly in shock," he added.
"They have not been given sufficient attention, and this kind of incidents makes only what is clear for all: a maintenance is urgent."
Raúl Llera Martinez, Secretary of Promotion of Touristics, expressed how important it was to save the tourism site of Mazatlan, because they would not be used rightly and left a bad image.
He mentioned a number of places that should be taken together with the city in front man. The city should be priority to build clean, ordinary and attractive for foreign traffic.
"Bothly, Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural places that first have to be swepted and cleaned to make them attractive for the foreign transport and to make them attractive for the inventary we make for this travel target.
IP requested results from the Conference
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE, proposed that Members should take the great responsibility to give an example of a better synaloa that is before many challenges.
The company sector of Mazatlan requires a valuable Parliament, free of debate, to the parties and the Government, because Sinaloa is chosen and is at major problems.
Last night, the 60th Parliament was referred to, and it is a set of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of the PAN, three of the Partido New Alianza, two of PRD, one of PT, one of convergence and one of PVEM, which is totally 40 people.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to make a more clean work, feeling the society and the various social groups that are attributed to a responsible parliamentary work, and that they do not repeat the same pattern of partiality and parentalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE Coordination Council, proposed that the new Members should take the great responsibility to give an example of a better synaloa that is before many challenges.
"We hope that Members really exercise their right to act freely from negotiations between the parties, because it is normal that they take agreements with which they represent their own interests, transforming themselves into the coppers of the governments and the leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to build the bridges necessary to submit the current government.
"We care for them to carry out a reliable work and to use all things for society and their groups, because they were the inhabitants of Sinaloa, who discussed their confidence at the last elections."
José Ramón Manguar Sánchez, Chairman of the Hotel Association Tres Islas, means one of the great challenges faced by the 40 people's members is the lead and common works for the economic growth of the State, since today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important is that they increase economic growth, investing and infrastructure measures, which will in any way promote the creation of jobs."
In terms of the foreign transport sector, he requested the new Members to share them to the Ministry of Foreign Traffics the necessary value of the State budget.
"I have understood that it is the Ministry with the second most funds, which is incompatible with an important economic activity, which brings duties and investments into the country and is in direct competition to the agricultural industry."
Tourism projects must be acknowledged by money, supporting public security, and the alcohol law which has not been renewed in previous legislation periods must be put on the latest position.
The Holy King is Search
Pumps, cars, drivers and other players want the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
The next three-year-old anniversary will be difficult for parents to meet this desire, because the budget is not more than 12 people and a sweet bottle.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give the hope that Melchior, Caspar, and Balthasar gives them the player and the clothes that they seen.
The family lives in a pleasant house in the Siege Salvador Allen. They live from the hand into the mouth, because the father has no fixed work.
"Atimes, my husband has no job, but we sell manners and cartoffels... I'm going to go with the eyes to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little.
The four-year-old Adelaida would like to be a puppe or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wanted a barbie poppe.
The ten-year-old José Alfredo wants to have a 'monster car' for which eight months old brothers Jesus puts clothing in the size for a year.
" (Josea Alfredo) said to me, 'I would like this monster', but I answered him, 'Let us wait, kid', because it was much more money', Cettana was worried.
For the older children who were in the school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
The 11-year-old Maria Guadalupe has the size 12; the 10-year-old Isaías size has 10, while the eighth-year-old Miguel size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacked tennis shoes. A couple in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela, you can participate in the 'Saint King' campaign by sending a player or bargeld in the reception chair of the Noroeste newspaper.
14 Municipal drug dealers arrested
In the midnight, a Cannabis' production and sales network of Cannabis was undertaken for the ten household investigations in the administrative region of Estonia.
Fourty persons were arrested and were sentenced against different contracts.
The house searches were played in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, to the places that had served before the drug production.
"Around 750 cannabis plants, four kilo hashich, bargeld and equipment that have served the production have been confused," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, speaker of the security police of Quebec.
Overall, 11 men and three women were arrested from Sherbrooke two of the men who are the main threshold of drugs.
The arrested persons should be apparent for hours after their arrest before the justice building in Sherbrooke.
They could, inter alia, be accused of the production of cannabis, whose ownerships for sales, the complot and the service of crimes.
These house surveys have resulted in long-term investigation activities that have been held over one year.
"The information received from the public hand has allowed us to carry out these conclusions", precisely Mr. Ruel.
For the 70 police officers of the Regional Investigation Unit, Estonia of the Security Police of Quebec, Sherbrooke police office, and the menphremagog police were involved in this police operation.
The secret immigration could be seen unfairly
The draft legislation of conservators to regulate the problem of vessels enforced by private immigrants will be struggled after announcing the three opposition parties at midnight that they cannot be able to make the proposal.
"I'm not going to stand on this chart."
"I hold with a party who put fessels to you on your feet," said Michael Ignatiff, Chief of the Liberals, after the weekly Caucus meeting before the gathered deputy.
The Liberals said that the draft legislation, which allows each person who comes from a marine ship identified as an illegal immigrant to a year, was injured as proposed by the Canadian Law and Freedom Constitution.
Gilles Duceppe, Chief of the Québecois Bloc, also pointed out that it could not support the draft legislation, since he goes against the false target group.
"We are, however, and it seems to be all the opposition parties, so we will wait for what the government takes", said Mr. Duceppe.
The criticism regarding the migration question of Olivia Chow, NDP, has made the critics from the hand which requested that their party was not sufficiently stable towards the home migrants.
"The Neo-democrats agreed to take measures against blind passengers, and as soon as we try to follow by communicating a other legislative draft, the C-35,," urged Chow.
Therefore, we did not prefer the draft legislation of the conservatorys because he seeks the blame for refugees and holds children captive at least a year," said Chow.
Jason Kenney, Minister of Immigration, accused the opposition partys to play with the policy and to ignore the will of the Canadians.
"The Canadians fully share the Members that they do not tolerate this kind of domestic immigration, these criminal procedures relating to Canada and treating the country as a foot-department."
"They are expecting that Canada takes hard measures", says the Minister of Reaction Kenneys.
"The Government has not announced any confidence on its draft legislation that could lead to elections by the country who had rejected the Government.
However, a conservator has expressed the QMI Agency that the Government would call for a vote so that each opposing Member immediately explains its elections.
The new unit does not find harmonity
Despite the proclamation of the possible creation of a new, existing unit for combating corruption and collusion, Jean Charest requires many observers to continue the training of a public research committee on this subject.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, said that this idea is not last year: Quebec had consulted the New Yorker Department of Investigation on this subject last January.
The metropole has been engaged in a substantial unit against corruption since 1870.
However, the announcement of midnight has surprised more than one.
It should be said that this measures, due to the meeting of the Permanent Committee of the Quebecer Police Service on 29 October last year, has not been discussed in the least, despite the Presidency Robert Dutils.
It was also uncomfortable that Stéphane Bergeron, critics and member of the Quebecois party, the announcement was qualified as "for the hot heavyed caninchen" and "a solution fairly based on a cheched".
Minister Dutil had again been used to those who feared that the political power has too much influence on the future unity in question.
"They will see the result if we will be proclaimed", he rejoiced.
"It is aware of this problem."
According to Rejean Parent, the President of the CSQ, nothing can replace the implementation of a public investigation.
"The more Mr. Charest wants to prevent the education of this research committee, the more people like you and I think he's going to hide something," he said.
"The only means to form an investigation committee is the return of Jean Charest," stated Yves Boisvert, Decent for Ethics and Policy Systems at the ENA (Scool High School for High Administrative Officers).
In order to get out of this sackgase, he suggests to the Quebec that the financial testing controls make a specific mandate to establish such investigations on corruption and secret discussions.
"It should be able to extend the mandate of the test control", he decided.
He also believes that the chebec of the test control could enable the same power as the Commissioners to fulfil the obligation to commit the people.
The education of an unit is not the only project in the charest schools of the government.
The Quebec is also requested by Ottawa to reverse the criminal law so as to be better established on such crimes.
This request is made by the Officer of the Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the law practice in such a manner of punishment is not clear.
Vic Toews, State Minister for Public Security, confirmed his colleagues from the Justice, Rob Nicholson, currently set up with certain dossiers.
During the Operation Printemps 2001, the groups of motor raid police were arrested 131, although the criminal law was not renewed.
Ottawa has therefore implemented the law against the Gangsterm.
Flights under closer monitoring
Several river trails remain at a strict monitoring because of high neighborhoods since Tuesday in some regions of the province.
In Shawinigan, in Maurice's administrative region, it came to an earthquake on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
On the evening, another earthquake in Saint-Lin-Laurentide, in the Lanaudiere administrative region was accompanied.
A Strasse is joined in itself.
From Tuesday to Middle Wednesday, strong rainfalls have decreased from 40 to 70 billion in several regions.
This was expected from 20 to 40 billion more than the regions to Thursday.
The northern regions of the river and the Tal of the Outaouais regions were the most intensely affected.
There were totally 100 billion rain viewers.
Since there is no need to accompany the neighborhoods that have already assembled in certain part areas, the transition of several waterways is feared.
The Quebecer Security Service warning information on the highwater heat flows of Ouarwater and Achigan in the Lanaudier region was called.
The streamways in the north, in Saint-Jerome, in the Laurentine mountains and the cemetery in Lotbinière will be here as an object of high water surveillance and continue to be observed.
In the Lanaudière region, the intense neighborhoods took place in some seas in Sainte-Jullien, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a exposure bridge was continued because of the strong rainfalls.
Ten residues had to be evacuated as preventive measures.
In Outaouais, the event of certain views has caused the switch of several roads, especially in the community of Mansfield-et-Pont Fract.
The Security Service remains in alarm preparation and monitors the situation as well as the security rider Annik Bouchard.
The Quebecer Landeshoch Water Center, on the midnight of the strong increase of several rivers, particularly by Maskinonge, Assmptation, Ouarwater, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont authorized to part
The Quebecer Rundfunkmoderator Stéphane Dupont has experienced a partial decrease before the Canadian Supervisory Board for Rundfunk Standards (CCNR) because of its controversial statements on social care and Haitianers as well as because of his accidental statement on Funk.
The CCNR agreed that Mr Dupont and its CHOI 98.1 FM had had had the right to express its own opinion, but certain statements had had "inadequate information on social care and unreasonable negative manifestations of Haitians, as well as a kind of unreasoned statement that is not appropriate to the day extracted sequences".
The Supervisory Council also concluded that a debate on self-assault involves the proliferation of the names of two individuals who started self-assault against the code of the round-function transmission.
The CCNR had received several complaints on comments made during the 2008 and 2010 period.
The first available was established as a result of a complaint of the "Common Force of people assisted socially from Quebec".
The active organization was estimated that the amounts referred to in the sender were clear.
Moderators should provide more solid than irrelevant information.
With regard to the theme of self-mortal, the Moderator Stéphane Dupont had the view that self-domicide was a expression of fatigue.
The majority of the Supervisory Board members had concluded that the message was that self-assault should not be considered as a solution to life crisis.
"The majority of the Supervisory Council takes into account that the consequences of the "Dupont le midi" sentence would have drawn a positive topic in a family-based and appropriate manner."
Hence, he was not infringed to his person.
The last point of struggle was the statements that had faced on the earthquake in Haiti.
Stephane Dupont and Jean-Rene Dufort had given themselves a media-efficace combating that made a lot of reactions.
The CHOI modeller had declared that they were not dependent on Haiti's aid, since they did not know with security whether the needs would also be obtained.
The Supervisory Council is the view that these comments were not misunderstanding characters, however, that their cumulative effect represents unrequisitely negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already cut my three-day sustainment punishment in this matter."
"My record is young for a half years," the moderator explained.
In all decisions, the Board of Supervisory applies to the proliferation of an unreasoned expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM Rundfunctionist has treated "side its obligations".
The consequences for the round-functioner, which, among others, had to share its decisions once during the primary period of three days, are low.
An King of the King-Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, Montrealer Algerian origin, has a very special course.
The athlete, which brillies in "Sanda" (Foll Contact Kung-Fu), in the kickbox and in Thai boxes, now increases in search for new challenges on the Tatami and the boxes of the world.
"I started in Algeria with fighters like Kung-Fu and Kickboxes for 12 years," said Zemmal, which has been accumulated since 2008 in the Metropole, to continue to develop themselves under the profession.
I personally search for all sorts of battle, because for those who are presenting the earthly battle, as the mixed fighters of him, they do not like to be competitive fighters in North America."
He had recently worked as a security officer and appointed his rivals a bad news at the UPS company, where he received two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) between 23 and 30 October.
"I have winned the categories of the full contact Kickboxen and the Thaiboxen," he explained.
"I'm preparing me to the world pokal in San Shou in China."
"They were invited by the fighters from each category, who had been placed at the last fourth World Meeting."
"I got a baby in Toronto Bronze in 2009."
"2005 I became a beach in Vietnam."
"2007 I finished the tourist in China on the fifth place while I became toronto thirds in 2009," he added.
"It's a remarkable thing that I have made progress in every competition fight."
"To this rhythmus I'll be first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplinary from China, with fausts and footsteps as well as grounds.
The two battles are usually on a platform, more rare in a boxing.
The most renomeed boxer that came from this type of combating is the American origin of Vietnam, Cung Le, who is well known in the world of the fighters.
If Nacer Zemmal keeps only one event in his career, he would be safely called his presence at the Super-Turnial "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of the Kung-Fu.
"This competitive fight is viewed by the highest and in China," explained the sympathical poundsker.
"It's a little like the equivalent to the Stadion Lumpinee (the largest stadium of Thailand)."
"This was a super-exploration."
Zemal had winned his first battle in the half-final of his category (80 kg) before he lost in the end.
"The one who has seen me was a profession," he analyzed.
"There are four chairmans for category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the halffinal gather each day at the end of their category."
"The winner of each category offers the shoes to crown a single champion, the king of the king."
450 million in contracts without description
Hydro-Québec has authorized project planning companies $450 million to contracts for the Eastman-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
Within this lake of more than 100 contracts, a consortium consists of the company BPR, Dessau, the Group SM and Axor, which has received the most important part of the project guide to a sum of $295 million.
This consortium, called "Energy Generance", was established in 2004 as a membership of the decision of Hydro-Québec, which was responsible for the private sector, to overcome this important hydro-hydro-project as a amount of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the "Energy Generation" Consortium acknowledged the lucrative treaty without having given it a public registration.
The Quebecois Party represents a serious ethical problem, which constitutes the risk of competitive consumption and a price increase.
"This is a new way of a carded game and enhance competition."
"This means that you are carded carded games instead of secret way now in an open form", explained Sylvain Simard, deputy of the PQ, on the press conference.
On spring, Samard had addressed the question before the National Assembly, because it seems hard to understand how the interest of publicity can be taken in this way.
The Minister of Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, had reacted on the afternoon by she gradually pointed out that it had treated a carded game with this treaty.
"I remain faithful to my line," she turned, enhanced her, the PQ was "unfair" and it was "flore you.
She said it was "that's the least", that the PQ was apologizing.
The model of the consortium is worldwide swimming practice.
It is generally a timely temporary clause that allows two or more enterprises to dig their experts in terms of an order for a complex project.
The "Eastman" project is a high level of complexity in relation to its working step.
The construction procedure is in the gang and must be established until 2012.
However, the Treaty was forgiven without a competitive campaign; it had already been held negotiations.
Furthermore, the model of the consortium in Quebec itself does not represent any exception in relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" last week, the model of the consortium object of government communications is applied in the field of the construction and consultations.
A short transfer of the Quebecer company register allows it to name more than 200 consorts from which some of them seem to be permanent.
For example, the company Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its nuclear competitors, with which CIMA+, Genivar, SNC lavalin or also rock and Tecsult.
Any link, and there are several dozens, brings back to one and the same legal person, namely Dessau.
As regards the "Energy Generance" Consortium, Minister Normandeau pointed out that "the Territory of Baie James has been subjected to a special working force dynamic and that Hydro-Québec considers this fact since the 1970s in particular."
Real Report, the large employee of the Société de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a declaration that the Nase on the fact has retained that the draft guideline contract was authorized under agreement.
"If you make a registration and there are only few applicants, your prices will be fast in the height."
"You have two possibilities, or you take the people who are on this March and say to you, that a satisfactory agreement will be dealing with a good price."
"The thanks is, however, that the price is not decisive, but the understanding of the persons", confirmed.
The Consortium "Energy Gerance" is part of a long list of contracts by more than $50,000 from the Quebecois party.
The contracts were authorized by the Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ project for Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
According to the review, the newspaper "Le Dever" was more than 100 engineering and advisory contracts, companies or their filials, including resource works, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had received 22 contracts, Gennivar had 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without engaged in "energy generation".
All of these treaties have been negotiated.
They are totally employed to $449,783,344, where the contract with "energy generation" exceeds $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard had allowed to believe that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor) were known by the "liberal party du Québec".
Minister Normandeau had accepted that the PQ was equally linked to the company they "financiated" before she precised that it was much more about their leadership forces.
Barometer Conscious Consumption - The "Green" label is not trusting
Greener, but skeptic.
The Quebecer Consumer has little confidence to the main factors of sustainable growth, but also little to the marks marked or the eco-marks that should control its choice.
The damage, although it is in a media efficiency universe, where it is the case of information for the benefit of a responsible conscious conscious conscious consciousness: the barometer's conscious conscious consciousness has a lack of credible information, an inadmissibility that makes it aware as a brem of its commitments, as shown by the first reading, which has been held yesterday.
Although they have pre-exported the consumption of so-called social products in 2010, the Quebezers seem to have few credits to sell them.
Two thirds of the Queezer population are to give little faith in the environmental commitment of the company as well as the green company, so the responsible consumer centre of the Sherbrooke University provides the measuring instrument.
Another idea: half of the consumers doubts the confidence of the officials, the certified certificates accompanied by fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that declare themselves as an environmental consciousness, the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the discursement of politicians to this subject is seriously taken by only 14.6% of the Quebezer population.
However, information regarding responsible consumption seems to be important to stimulate this consumption, which is presently only a third of the Quebec consumers.
In fact, the eggs of 46% of the consumers were slow and doubtless characters of the information.
This is the second brems identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
Furthermore, a third of the competitors of the performance of the green products and services that are trying to handle them is mislead.
According to another communication, half of the consumers had changed their habits in 2010 and had previously changed the mark of one or more products to express their conviction.
According to Barometer, they had also benefited to 61% purchase in handlers of their city village and benefited from the purchase of food built in their region.
Green and Responsible Conscious - the index of the environmental conscious consumption had reached a maximum value of 100 in this year -- the Homo consumption of Quebec likes to present itself as a king of recycling, which tries to reduce the samples left in the environment by care for the animal protection.
However, the social and ecological consciousness seems to be maintained before his car, so the barometers: just 28% of the cowboys have indicated, used public transporters in 2010 or have been favourable to demonstrate their environmental interest.
The allocation and the driving route also benefited from 39.1% of the participants of this comprehensive conducting question, which the classic concepts.
State aid for the transfer of eXcentris
The Quebecer Government, requested by the Society Angus and the Parallele company to participate financially in the transfer of the kino-complex eXcentris, agreed with a cooperation but only in a competitive contribution.
The developer company Angus and the Parallèle company, who had expected to have an expenditure of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to overcome the Daniel Langlois' eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent, had obviously not received what they requested.
Although the government has accepted to participate in this matter, it is in its own conditions.
Instead of the expected spends, the Quebec government offers a slower slower than the initially obtained height, which could call for a reliable solution to the living, at least in view of the sources deleted from the public coffee.
A first action plan, as well as a request after 12.8 million, have been rejected last spring from Quebec, the Bitishing has been corrected since it was renewed.
A proposal, together with a action plan, was already sent by the President of the "Society of Development of the Cultural Entrepreneurship" (SODEC), François Macerola, Minister of St-Pierre, which is leading to the eXcentris.
A few days ago, he had left her a last report.
However, the coffee proposed was transmitted to the SODEC midnight.
Parallele and Angus have now time to respond to this.
In any case, it seems to be really pressed on the side.
Let us recall that the Quebecer ownership community of the Kinos and Kino complexs had refused to make a direct state investment in support of the adoption of eXcentris by providing the argument that the Minister of Culture has not provided financial assistance to real estate projects that he did not allow other cinemas.
In contrast, more than one other segment market operators claimed substantial and economic assistance.
Kinochef Daniel Langlois had presented the author in the areas of his cine complex, which could justify the exception from the State Case.
The lack of cinema that shows independent films is more clear than clearly in Montreal, and eXcentris knew to keep his customer at the stage.
The Society of Angus and the Parallèle company with Christian Yaccarini at the pitze are controlling a private financing campaign, from which they take a total of $7,000 in order to curb the purchase.
Since spring 2009, only one lens flows to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallele.
The future purchaser's goal is to open the three cinemas on 27 February following year with the presentation of the very successful film of Xavier Beauvous "The men and divine".
Christian Yaccarini, however, did not apologize the newspaper "Le Dever" and ignore what he and his group keep the following corrected proposals.
Secret of the Complexed Canada
The new, American diplomatic guidelines distributed by WikiLeaks were the secret of what the United Nations considered under the minority complex of the Canadians against the Americans, but in the same sense, they opened the last relief sense to Canada.
Therefore, the American diplomates are convincing that the Canadian election electioners do not have the Canadian American relations, and they believe that the visit of President Obama had helped the conservative government to implement their budget of 2009!
The four new communications between the American message in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly distributed yesterday, provide more details than the fragrances of substantial content in which you have to swear.
One of the data connections from 22 September 2008, i.e. in the period in which the federal election campaign was in full range, reports on how the United Nations has no longer participated in the items discussed by its political leaders.
For the great surprise of David Wilkins, the American messager in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers a number of explanations in this situation.
"In the Canadians nearly inhabited minority complex, the Canadian, political leadership forces may be more likely to speak about internal combat questions of the daily day than to move the black Peter in this election (as the 1988 campaign on free trade)," he describes.
The United Nations, as concluded, are therefore "the speaking Goliath of this choice: all presentations, but potentially threatening to speak from him".
The messager understands this "extraordinary style" less than because the two countries have intensive political and economic relations.
"Logically", he estimates, "If it would be the capacity of a candidate, a party and much more to lead to such an essential relationship that the electioner has as key factor in terms of urgency."
The other expression of this sense of importance reads on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, business officers in Ottawa, sent by President Barack Obama to prepare his first visit in Ottawa.
"It is helped to ensure the Government's continued confidence on the federal budget at the beginning of February, where Canada has the first deficit known after more than a decade of year, which has been resulted in a programme of detention from 30 to 40 billion dollars", describes Brese.
He had never mentioned that the Government had to have held the parliamentary meeting before Christmas to prevent that the parliament would be struck by the coalition and that there would be a further part of the opposition partys on the quality of the proposed relief programme.
Another report from January 2008, which was given by the Ambassador Wilkins, in the United States, conscious of Washington's ever-negative image that the extracted data and dramatic series were distributed from the United States.
The messager is worried about posts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, where few subtle reactions to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or the "No-Fly-List" list, or also the appointments for the purpose of the CIA muscle protze.
Another report explains how Hillary Clint at his French official College Bernard Couchner had asked in their first bilateral meetings whether Europe is willing to take certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Couchner should have answered the question, but on the basis of a individual "Fall at Fall" decision.
At the end of the meeting, as describes, "what he equipped a paper in puncto Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Canadian muslim."
"The State Secretariat has commanded to review the records again."
Finally, let us note that the guests are experienced with regard to the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and very close advisor Stephen Harper, had explained about CBC that those who were responsible for this massive leck should be "transported".
He was referring to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Worldwide Plan for the Renewing of Lightness
Last night, UNO in Cancun proposed a plan to renew household, trade and industry in 100 countries in order to achieve a reduction in the greenhouse gas (FCKW), which corresponds to nearly a third of additional reductions to be achieved in order to stabilize the earthly climate until 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position at the steps of the concrete major projects to be implemented by the UNO in Cancer to compensate the absence of responsibilities of industrial countries.
After the last plan, the main problem would be avoided in the form of 1.8 billion tonnes of the FCKWs issued on the ground if the white-floor birds, which still represent a monopolie of 50 to 70% on the market, would be replaced by fluorescent or better by lightdiodes (LED).
The appreciation is responsible for 8% of the global emissions.
This corresponds to a 70% equivalent of the global flight park.
In Kopenhagen last year, the major emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and other, including Canada, were bound to voluntary reduction plans that should be undermined by the global FCKW emissions of 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, from this balance, there should be a decrease of 5 t to stabilize the increase in climate from this day to 2020, with a view to preventing that it is not controlled.
In the white-floor birds 95% of energy is in the form of warm, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compakte lightbirds, energy consumption reduces 75%, with the new LED bleeding blends are reduced twice.
The compakt light skins keep in the switch between 6000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED reliefs, such as those who had taken on the market this week, this company has participated in the UNO study, have been expected to live at 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-leaf bird, which provides an enhancement of the possibilities of the exchange plan to be used in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that you have completely new smooth flights, they can also work with a regular resistance.
And they do not contain any checksilbers.
Many specialists have shown that compakt lightbirds have reserves because they contain cocksilders and that they should therefore be recovered as a special milk which is not always possible in the developing countries except for producers to provide an approximation.
The main source of cocktail emissions on the planet, however, is not the compact of fuel rings, but more than the carbon powers that are essentially extracted more cocktails to generate the electricity generated by the white birds.
Only in the United States these coal powerworks are covered annually by 25,000 tonnes of checksilber.
The report provides details of the profits that each country would develop thanks to this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would spend a million of dollars annually when purchasing electricity and eight million tons of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3,5 carbon powers, which would be made by Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Seventeen coasts are expected to advertise the results of the selection
UNO Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon requested the "indirect" publication of the results of the presidency election of the Elfenbein coast directly after their Frist.
"The Secretary-General emphasizes the need for the independent election committee to receive their work and to announce the provisional results without any further appeal," said a UNO Chief.
"He requests all parties and institutions of the coastal coast to make evidence of their responsibilities and to include each initiative to the use of the provisional results."
Despite the extent of certain foreign governments, the election committee had the Deadline, which was set on midnight at midnight, three days after the election on Sunday, without publicing the results.
About 40 minutes ago, the President of the ECI had confirmed in television that the Commission would "continue with the work" to announce the results.
During the midnight, many calls from the whole world have become, but the CEI will finally call the name of the winner of the second election round under the separate Laurent Gbagbo and its opponents Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo Lager is calculated by the Constitution Council, which has been achieved by the former Rebellioner of the Forces (FN) in the period of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the presidency campaign of the iceland coast, confirmed that the Chairmans of the FN practitioned to protect the elections in the north of the country had shocked to go to the election.
The whole choice could be cancelled if the Constitution Council takes into account the complaints set by Gbagbo.
However, the Gbagbo meetings are now more than the view that the highest court of the country is not neutral, since it is conducted by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely linked to Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, the man of the north, who is able to communicate with the ex-rebels, has estimated the delay in the sale of the electioner results and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even though it has not been so far to demand the winning.
Gbagbo confirms the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost; and a complaint before the Constitution Court has been hindered by the election committee to publish the results is illegal.
The second round of the presidency elections were held on Sunday for the decrease of a country's association and condemnation process, which was divided into two parts over a year.
The United Nations had warned in the midnight because they could be able to be able to be responsibilities in the case of possible explanations.
Laurent Gbagbo had the first election round on October 31, with 38% of the votes against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who had the public support of the former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round) as a spitzen candidate.
Labour unemployment rate in France in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France is 9.3% stable in the Metropolitan International Employee (including the overseas departments 9,7%), which shows the information published on Thursday by the Statistics of Insee on Thursday.
The unemployment rates in the Metropole are at 2,631 million.
The details of the second quarter were 9,3% of the purchasing population in the Metropole and 9,7% involved in the overseas departments.
The unemployment rate was increased in 0.1 percentage points over the year.
Indeed, 3.4 million employees of the French metropole were not employed in the third quarter, however, they wanted to find a job; in particular, whether they were all available for two weeks or not or if they were working requests or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to decrease the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the Metropole (+ 0.9% points within three months, +0.5 percent points over the year) and 25%, including the overseas regions, continued to decrease.
In the third quarter, 637.000 young people were between 15 and 24 years according to the unemployed IAA.
The seniors have also a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the Metropole (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482.000 of the 50-year-old persons, 6.6% involved in the overseas departments.
Only 25-49 children could benefit from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8,3% in the metropole (-0,1 percentage point over three months, +0,1 percent points over one year) and 8,8% in France in total.
After a compensation of its calculation procedures, the Statistical Federal Office has not been published since 2006 the monthly unemployment rates.
However, Eurostat, the EU Statistical Office, continues to follow this method and announced a quota of 9,8% in France for October (the overseeing departments) to 9,9% in September.
Alexandre Guerini accused and arrested
A investigation procedure was introduced against Alexandre Guerini, 53, head of a discharge company and Brother of the President of the General Council of the Region Bouches-du-Rhône (PS), and was introduced in the prison in Luynes near Aix-en-Provence in the course of an investigation procedure on public and fraud markets.
Alexandre Guerini was accused of income of social powers, income of general goods, hehlerei, civilians in corruption, unlawful insurance and weapons, so his lawyer.
"Alexanndre Guerini has been prepared and has proposed to express its attention to all the questions that the State Authority is put to him, instead of extending the Hirngepine."
"It's just to submit him a number of punishable punishment points, one other thing is to prove it", explained the lawyer Florence Rault of the AFP (Agence France Presse) before listening to his mandate.
Mr Guerini, Brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Socialist Party) in the Department, had been worth to let the Judiciary, by means of his lawyer, a memorandum to his justice.
A family Guerinis, Philippe Rapezzi, was also accused and arrested at midnight.
According to the law envoy of Lucien Simon, she never had done anything else than his depony that he had to lead.
In terms of business expertise or the target of the related fund, Simon never knew, so.
In this case, however, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Public Service of Abugnana, was sentenced at midnight because of subscription and complexity, then, under the order of maintaining the protagonists of these acts, again on free foot.
"My mandate could give statements to the facts that he had been proposed."
"The leader of the State lawyer has not taken into account his freedom, said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons were sent under accused and issued out of prison on Tuesday night, including two of them under legal supervision, so the Ombudsman Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadyakian, the representative of the Employment Employee Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), is legally followed by the "invalid influence and passive observation".
Two State officials of the Ballung room Abuagne, Michele Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, due to a title "Introduction and abuse of Generalgot by a representative of the public service", and otherwise because of "competition in the abuse of public money".
Also, the riskist of Alexandre Guerini, Jeannie Peretti, was accused of "health and submission of social property".
For those who were represented by the Guerini, Stéphane Brunengo-Girard was recently arrested because of a similar case of betraying power from the public hand, the Corsika had affected.
Factors suspect their society to have a role in taking money from "high" offender creatures.
In April 2009, the investigation against X because of the smooth fraud in the provision of public contracts, in particular in the discharge, is carried out in the records of several open investigations procedures.
In close analysis, the investigation is particularly focused on the conditions of the incentive and the operation of a depony in La Citatat, which also refers to waste from the Afganistan area, as well as from certain cities in the city of Marseille (MPM).
Business Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée-Palast exceeds its secondary function for Syria
Over six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher, who was held in Iran for "Spionage", was the French public in Atem, launched the diplomacy in alarm preparation and acknowledged the deterioration of the relationships between Paris and Teheran.
This is all under the attention of the United States diplomates.
The American documents received by WikiLeaks and the "Le Monde" newspaper gives some backgrounds to this crisis.
They describe how Elysée declared the Americans its strategy to give this advice to its own crisis of "healths" in Iran (a small group of Wanderers).
They show how the French responsibilities tried to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchs does not have the release of Majid Kakavand, a prisoner in France, and has been managed by Iran on the basis of trade with materials for the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, she sets the way the French Presidency has tried to handle the media in order to make the idea believable, the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad has played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reis, in a green light.
Indeed, he did nothing in this regard.
On August 12, 2009, a diplomate telegram editored in Paris shows the title "Iran: French comments in the way of handling with geissels."
François Richier, Elysée-Berater in Strategic Questions, took place in response to Patrice Paoli, Director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
You explained the French methods.
They called on the Americans to put everything in place to turn their own nationals who would be violently guarded in Iran.
"Match Larm," they said, "artificized sound and clearly and without delay" the words "Grund Men's Rights", "Unschuld", "unsuccessful release" in the media.
This is necessary to bring the Iranian regime into a sense that is very slightly respecting his image.
"Do this more, ask the Iranians not to do that."
Because "Still flows does nothing", the discussions surveyed on an unexpected way, the Iranians are "Master in Exhibition".
Mr Richier adds that the establishment of foreigners is a "smiling and Iranian tactic" which is "decision for political pressure".
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reise from the prison (which should come on August 16, when she flys to the French message) "assure the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians" (230,000 cupation).
And he allows the Elysée to shut up other spectacles, a phenomenon that "she will raise".
The Iranians could "arrange one of the about 800 French citizens who live in Iran nearly in the future," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Riiss has been released from the prison 12 days ago, however, it will continue to be held in Iran.
A information was carried out: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose exemption the United States as a result of illegal trade with an enthusiastic electronic material to Iran, has been decided to be taken from the prison by a judge in Paris.
The American message comes, as many other observers, questions about this unclean coïncidency.
For Washington, who follows the illegal Iran networks of the material for the nuclear programme, Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Did France take a cook trade in purchase?
The release of the Iranians against those of the Frenchs?
On 4 September François Richier, as a result of a renewed submission with Katleen Allegrone, assures François Richier that this is not the case.
The Elysée, as he says, was not just "humanly surprised by the decision of the judge," but he also tried to stop.
"It has given a rain exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice." (Actually, Michele Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the decision," he explains.
Mr Richier also wants to point out that Majid Kakavand is still under "stricter" monitoring of the French secret service.
The Elysée band chooses a phone number, returns, and reports the American diplomat, the Iranians "when they are in the buildings leading to the Iranian message in Paris".
During the holding of Clotilde Reis in Iran, the Elysée did not believe his efforts to make by means of advertising and the organized "fighting survey", the Syrian president Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influent central role".
Americans do not observe this activity without Iran and notify that the manipulation produces fruit, since several printing articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 declares "the media blue of the French authorities".
This is based on this so much "Dankes witness" to Mr Assad, the Paris message is asked.
"From their statements full of glorious prices, the French authorities are in secret that they have just aware of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document refers to the reasons for the Elysée to disappear this section.
He analyzes the intensive communication efforts to confirm Sarkocy's opening policy against Syria.
A 2008 policy launched, which has been “the numerous critical votes in France and the foreign country”.
"The Syrian role growing" is trying to lead to Paris "Syrians in front of which observation can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region."
The objective is also to "consider between Syria and Iran".
The American message knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier acknowledged her: "We do not know whether the Syrians have always done anything."
"But we have thanked us, however, with them."
"This should at least be confused with Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes her in the Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanks the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role for the release of our countrymans".
No online games for young Koreans to Middle night
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "the Aschenbrodel" which is prohibited by the youth to play in line games after midnight by striving them the access to the government, so they are responsible.
A draft legislation which calls for online players to reduce the access to these games under 16 years after midnight, will be submitted to the Parliament in December, sculpted representatives of the Ministry of Cultural and Family.
"My children play these games all night and have difficulties with learning in the school, and also to lead a normal life daily."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and right to sleep", said Jo Rin, with this draft legislation as the Ministerial Officer of the French Press Agency France Presse.
The online games will be re-accessed at 6 p.m.
The manufacturing companies had been precisely prepared for the application of the law for a year.
The Government also requested the manufacturers to accompany the parent’s daily access to these games with a time limit, as provided for in the time limit, with the parents requested to add to the responsible person.
It will also be those who want to provide free programs to limit the time passed on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "red" countries, and the newspapers regularly reports on various events related to intensive Internet uses.
The country is also unfair Champion in global online game competitions.
In November, South Korea had four gold medals in the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
World Meeting 2018-2022: the FIFA names the Country of Direction
The FIFA's Executive Committee on Thursday, 2018 and 2022, is a higher political choice in which the rail is threatening and the lobbying of technical criteria in the background of the World Meetings.
One thing, however, is sure: the 2018 output of the FIFA's reign discipline will be held in Europe, its traditional hochburg (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain and Portugal, the Netherlands).
The 2022 issue will then be extraordinary; the International Football Association hopes to be able to win new territories (Katar, Australia) for themselves in 2010, or to continue to pursue its discharge in the United States or in Fernost (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Emir of Katar, Belgian and Netherlands Head of Governing, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) provides the measure of the economic and political use of a world master.
The powers behind the cults are therefore threatening to hold up the last minute.
Instead of establishing a hierarchy of the candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portugal (2018) and the American (2022) data are more arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so weak for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, who was at the beginning of the enthusiasm of the two executive committee (Reynald Temparii and Amos Adamu), had also been able to destroy the opportunities for its own country, the ways of the football, which had only one time the world's mastership, that was 1966.
The BBC had once again given the birth floor on Monday by extracting a documentary report that took three influentious members of the Committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Liou.
It was enough to strengthen the FIFA and to bring the English responsibilities that, in primary context, had been a intensive lobbying in these last weeks.
The Head of Government hopes a re-establishment of the shooting achieved by Tony Blair, who had achieved the organization of Olympic Games in London in 2005 for 2005.
Does this intensive use enough to restore the image of England before the committee?
Nothing is less safe, since the Duo Spain-Portugal does not have to strike with its already prepared stages, expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM in Portugal in 2004) and its football culture.
However, the economic and financial shadow sides of the two countries could defeat their ambitions.
The possible repressions against the English countries and the doubts about Spain and Portugal allow Russians to become a weighter outdoor, despite his shoes in the dossier (Stadia, hotels, transportation).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided that the unreasonable and unfair advertising on the observations of the English press "a unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" was accepted by the members of the Committee.
"It works with drecks, you try to compromise it," said Putin.
For 2022, the United States seem to be strengthened by the experience of 1994 to be logical favorites.
The first economic world power, the seat of the FIFA head officers, seems to have a long list of benefits against Japan and South Korea, which have set a very beautiful project separately.
However, these new candidates seem to be satisfied for two countries who had organized the competitive fights in 2002.
Another threat: the warm authorisation of the WM 2026 WM 2026 for China that will be affected by Asian opportunities at 2022.
With Australia and catalogue, which had taken all registers with the expectation of future stages, the FIFA follows its expansion in the direction of new areas, but these two countries are a greater risk than consciousness.
Australia, as well as Japan and South Korea, could have suffered from the weaknesses of the television rights acquired by the European countries (from the time disappearance), the positive FIFA nerve.
Second mandate: openness
The Gaulle was really trained.
Metterand had let him believe he's kidding.
Valery Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the smallest teeth.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is less than this.
A mandate in the Elysée calls the next.
The current head of the State will be a candidate in 2012.
But the opening is not a good face to the side of the mystery that arrests the Presidency function.
So you have to do as if the question is to be done.
In one, as well as in the other sense.
2006 the ambassadors Jacques Chiracs proposed that a third mandate should not be excluded without believers themselves.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy in a serious tone insured his decision to take "any time in the early 2011".
That he would allow the perspective of "two Mandates" at the service adjoint in Elysée before the UMP parliamentarys, then a little fiery.
Was that the official announcement of his candidature?
Not missed.
The President only reminded the Constitutional change in 2008 that the number of five-year-old official periods are limited to two.
He made a statement, no proclamation.
It is not the first time that he mentioned the election of the presidency on such meetings in a humor sound.
"You have even seven-year-old years with me, or mostly," he explained in July 2009.
To a new in May 2010: "Do not believe I do not think about the phase later."
His words of premature do not make him more for candidate than on Sunday, but also not less.
If they call comments, then it is a two-fold reason.
The acceleration of the flow around the candidature with the PS on one side.
However, it is not the inclusion of competition with the Royal Segolans, which has aimed at showing up Nicolas Sarkozy.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidate in 2012, which many members of the PS are more early than accepted for combating.
The bad surveys on the other side.
Firstly, the electioners of the right would provide a candidate of François Filon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate, and there are no discussions with the UMP," immediately and carefully reacted the area of the Prime Minister.
"If he could find a strike as possible, he would not be candidate," shares Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe to be able to be blessed," corrects Alain Juppee, who has found himself with the opening.
Euro: the ECB has been able to keep its purchases of State sampling
The last assembly of the Central Bank Council of the ECB in the past year should provide opportunities to show how to emerge from the crisis, or at least proclaim a large number of non-conventional measures in the monetary policy to end the year.
The crisis of the European State debt imposes that the Central Bank in Frankfurt can, of course, not be able to impose the situation today, more than an enormous situation on the European markets in order to not raise their deterioration.
Political costs would be too high.
The French Financial Minister, Christine Lagarde last night, welcomed the role of the press conference taken by the ECB for the solution of the State debt of Europe.
It has not to say whether it is the view that the Central Bank can do more, for example by providing its programme of purchase of State assets.
"I keep my considerations for my European trade partner (...)."
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, in Brussels, was not very closely shown about his projects, but much more joyfully to point out that the programme of purchase of State sampling on the secondary market would be "extensive" and that, at the meeting on Thursday, "we will be viewed as decisions are taken".
Only certainty: The ECB will set its license unchanged by 1%, the historically lower level since May 2009.
In practice, the obligation purchase of the shadow chamber was doubled by the ECB last week to about 1,35 billion euros.
And according to the discretions of some handlers, she should have worked as new purchases to Irish and Portugal states last night.
Overall, the Eurosystem Central Banks have been purchased by EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
In the handlers the anticipation of a continuation of the purchase currency is no doubt (see page 29).
The people's experts have no longer expected considerable changes in the course.
If more than three months have been lost from the ECB's arsenal, the latter will still be made on the unlimited financial reserves on a free-government, or for a period from one week to three months.
People's experts have already been thinking that this measure will still be extended for a few months.
"I can't imagine that the ECB will change its programme in an essential manner."
"In some cases she would take the risk to provoke new spectrums in a short view," said Michael Schubert, the civilist of the Trade Bank.
"A progressive expansion scheduled for the first quarter of 2011 seems to me likely to be more likely", anti-skripts Norbert Bröms, people in Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the field of its interventions on the market of State debt, the ECB should "conserve such a purchase volume of obligations which lives in the market", adds Norbert Brüms.
In view of the relief of the position of the European banks on the markets of State debt in the euro area, the Central Bank has no choice to keep its presence on the market.
"They must go to any price to the employees of the lack of investors and act in such a way to prevent the premature injury of the rates paid to the weakest states," said last night, a major obligation manager.
Because if the interest rates of high-level would still prevent the States to reduce or to stabilize their debt.
This is the price for the protection of the euro.
The Berlusconi Government is going to cover in Italy
The situation last night, with the decline of the ecksins to 10 years, was a little shocked after an unfortunate week start for Italy.
A return to the Trinity Style.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economy, President Giulio Tremonti had heard the situation as "undecimal" and heard him with a "unforeseen" weekend, which was soon declared.
On Thursday, with the German interest rates, the shoes had reached its record of 210 base points and the prices of the contracts to cover the competitive risk were at 263 points, which had argued a certain deficiency in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi, with his Ministers, pointed out that the Discrimination of Spain on the German interest rates was at 400 basis points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed himself as "who worried" of the "marketturbines" and a possible shift drive from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third of the euro zone, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," states Irwin Stelzer, the Hudson Institute.
In the clear text, it is the problem of the decline of economic growth and the declining and slow-energetic tax measures that the State imposes a threat to decay its financing needs.
The last Brussels prognosis were a cold duche for the government.
An Italian growth of 1.1% in 2011 and of 1.4% in 2012 will be expected to be expected ... although this budget is estimated to be of 1.3% compared to 2% at the Senate.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates the budget deficit will still be 4,3% of the GDP in the next year (in addition to 3,9% predicted by the Governments) and 3,5% in 2012 (except 2,7%).
It is therefore also possible to urge a new budget collection that could be used after the holidays to a sum of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new sperm measures are to be taken", says the Employer Olli Rehn.
Italy receives the support of international institutions for hours.
"The fundamental festivals of Italy's economy are in order, and its accounts are regulated, which we have been repeated for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian Countries of the International Monetary Fund, which is involved in the IWF with Italy.
"There are no problems, nor short-term, nor long-term views, since Italy, despite its high debt (119.2% of the GDP in 2011, A.d. R.) is requested to reduce stabilisation speed than other countries," observes the OECD Chief.
The question remains after the political inconsistency.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will be viewed as a disfellowshipping proposal for the Chamber, which could be organized by the previous elections already finished March.
There is, therefore, a little good period for a decision-making regarding a serious crisis.
Europeans think about the development of anticrisis measures
Christine Lagarde expressly expressed it in the context of a press conference in Paris: "I think you still have proved it on Sunday and evening: the Europeans are clearly assembled, are ready and engaged to defend their currency and their currency area."
Although it is relatively relative - the last decline in the interests of the European State obligations was water on the currency of governments and the ECB.
However, from a normalization begin, it may not be the speech.
The Standard & Poor's Rating Agency had announced that it could reduce the debt note of Portugal, which is probably the most effective goal of the speculators today.
"When in May is a real lack of clarity and political reliability, especially on banking systems", says Exane BNP Paribas.
In particular, "the political time is much slower than the markets".
The European countries, which are well conscious of this pledge and of the danger that they are rejecting, are more intensifying the debates to strengthen the anti-crisis measures already existing.
The informal discussions between the most direct financial ministries and, in addition, with their opposite to the G20.
And this is also about the meetings of Eurogroups and Ecofin in the beginning of the next week.
The ECB is here today.
The decline of the unconventional measures to strengthen the euro zone countries in the faden cross of the markets (see below).
As regards the EU Stability Fund, its Executive Director Klaus Regling has already started its Asian tour on Monday in Singapore to inform the investors in the television on developments regarding the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of his visit is not expressively foundation, he will certainly prepare the terrain.
The first public expenditure from the EU Stability Fund shall be provided for for the next month.
Last night, a official American representative of the Reuters Agency had acknowledged that the United States supported a potential increase in the additional, direct commitment of the IWF mobilized fund.
Portugal and Spain, mostly the countries, are being sent to structural reforms, especially in the field of the labour market organization.
Reforms to be added to sparmatic measures, however, should show effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid strive another way than Greece and Ireland.
While the one, as well as the other, is to avoid any price, must be obtained international assistance before they set up their own budget corrections and have decided on unexpected structural reforms that reverse their confidence during the period.
The European capital employees are back to the options available to accelerate the normalisation process of the markets of State grants.
Axel Weber, who was on 24 November in Paris, was first the idea that if the 750 million euros were not enough mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund, the Union would not be able to re-interrupte again.
The public experts of Barclays Capital, as regards the market of the European State Debt, would be judged, in the main part of the stakeholder, to extend around 100 billion euros, "preventive" in the form of a direct flexibility course.
This means the European financing stabilisation mechanism currently involves 60 billion euros.
A Council that has all opportunities to be examined in the main cities of the European Union.

Snee and Flower: 24 departments in Alarm level Orange
Snee episodes continue to deal with transport difficulties, especially in the secondary transport networks of Britain and threaten to affect different economic activities.
Fourty departments are now at alarm stages Oranges because of the threatening snee and glatteis risk.
The regions of you, your-et-Loir, Dux-Sevres and Vienna are already joined by 20 divisions in alarm phases; 18 from midday and two, Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to Meteo France, the intensive snowviewers tangle the north of the Gironde and the Charentes, it slows it easy on the ee-de-France.
The departments concerned are expected by 2 to 5 cm and also from 7 to 10 cm and 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
These are the regions Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions Basse-Normandia, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The skin accidents are pretty pretty enough to call on trafficking disorders and to prevent certain economic activities, says Mtéto France.
In the Côte d'Armor region, more than 7.5 tonnes are cut into the region of Côte d'Armor, including the transport chains Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudeac.
The transport situation in the secondary transport networks in the United Kingdom is, according to the transport police that made it possible to use the vehicle only in the emergency case, very difficult, and the use of some TER travel bus has been over the whole day.
In Picardie, school traffic was deleted for Thursday.
None of the specific limitations were provided for in the mid-week.
The prefecture "requires the drivers to higher attention on the roads and to adjust their conduct."
The Directorate-General for Zivile Aviation (DGAC) invited the airlines to strike 25% of her from Paris Airport Roissy and 10% of the flights starting by Orly because of the expected, strong snow accidents.
The DGAB recommends the passenger to contact his airline.
The Gatwick airports in South London and the airport in Edinburgh, Scotia, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial skizzen
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport industry in the Ile-de-France is in full range, it is a billion.
At least in the debates.
In particular, the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris, which is intended to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to lead to the construction begins of the SGP, the State has launched a capital dotation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the amount that the SGP would allow to provide a part of the financial sum on the markets duely.
Today it has finally come to the first high-counting calculations.
The 2010 Supplementary Budget, followed by the Financial Commission of the National Assembly, contains the measures required to put up the first part of these money.
These are two measures: the creation of a special tax on closure and a higher tax of the offices in the Ile-de France.
First, in this way, article 15 of the draft legislation, it is "except the public and legal officer of the Grand Paris Society".
This is deemed to be: "The product of this tax is at 117 million euros per year."
Secondly, a new regulation of the already existing undertakings is: "To modernize these to increase the product of its own product and to overcome this increase in the company of Grand Paris."
How much would it take?
A race.
This amount is not covered in the text.
From the 4 billion are far away.
"The tax resources will be calculated to the $4 billion of the capital dotation, which are included by the State and the company of the Grand Paris, according to and after the project," says the explicit interpretation.
In the SGP, this system is not intimidating.
"After the moment of receipts (the two taxes, d. R.), the projection can be covered over three years and then create only 4 billion."
"This is notified in the budget and after and after."
The SGP states that 2013 will be started to notify the $4 billion for the budget 2014.
This measures, which will still be able to seek for four billions, is dangerous to move a right to call a parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting is held on 7 December.
Sweet hacker and exhibited spione
The WikiLeaks business has a double importance.
On the one side, she was skandal, a scandal, which is only a skandal in the sense of scandality, which dominates the relationship between States, citizens and presss.
On the other hand, it announces deep changes at the international level and provides a shock to the future dominated by government.
But let's go on the line.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each of the data created by a secret service (a x-favoured nation) is uniquely composed of newspapers.
The "excluding", American enthusiasms about the sexual habits Berlusconis do nothing more than what they had been read in all months and as well as in every x-beloved newspaper (except those who are Berlusconi), and the horrible carcinourized prophecy Gaddafis box of cabare artists for their sketch for a long time.
The rule that the secret folders may only exist from known news is essential for the dinamic of secret services, and that is not just in this century.
If you go into a library that goes to the Ethiopian publications, you will recognise that every work (over the Gral, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Temple or the Rose Cruzler) is exactly repeating what was already written in previous works.
This is not only because the author does not want to publish research (but therefore he did not wonder where news about non-existence would be), but because of those who are swinging to the Okcultism, believe nothing else than what they already know and confirmed what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
Also the secrets.
The informant is faul, and faul (or restricted spirit) is also the chief of the secret service (or, at least, he might be something else, editor in the delivery), which is only considered true what he recognizes.
The Top Secret information about Berlusconi, who sent the American message in Rome to the State Decree, were the same as those who had already published the newsweek a week ago.
Why, therefore, was this a relief made for the intensifications of these files?
On one side, these messages are known that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then the government chiefs can call on to each other or take a flight to meet themselves at dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and have, except some of the small representations, transformed into the Spionage Centres.
Each favorite observer of films knows this very precisely, and it doesn't happen from skinness that you do so to ignore this.
However, the fact that it is to repeat publicly, hurts the task of the bleeding and serves to put the American diplomacy into a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that a x-favorite hacker can shoot the most secret secrets of the most powerful country of the world, is the considerable shock against the press of the State democracy.
Moreover, the scandal has less the victims than the "Scarfrichter" in circumstance.
But let us imitate the deep nature of what happened.
Anyone, at Orwell’s times, all powers were able to be able to control as a Big Brother that controlled every spirit of his undergrounds.
Orwells' prophecy could have been perfectly identified where every movement can be controlled by the phone, every active transaction, the visited hotel, the selected cars and so on; the citizens would become the total sacrifice of the eye of the power.
But if you are driving in front of the eyes, what today comes, that yourself the secret crypts of the power can't go out of the control of a hacker, then you hear the control interruption to be one-handed and will be circumcised.
The power controls all citizens, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the race of the citizen, can experience the secrets of the power.
But how can a power that is not yet possible to realize their own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said that a real secret is a empty secret (and a empty secret can never be enthusiasmed); it is also true that any knowledge about the Charakter Berlusconis or Merkels is a secret of secret, as it prescribes the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks, to open that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, means to exercise every authority.
WikiLeaks did no Sarkozy or Merkel injust, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this force that has been added to such a strong power?
It is obviously clear that the countries will not make any information preserved in the future more online - that would be equal to one of the exhibited on the road line.
But it is also obvious that it is hoped to be able to keep confidential reports on the phone with the current technologies.
Nothing is easier to find out whether and when and when and when a head of State has moved to an aircraft and has contacted one of his colleagues.
How can in the future be maintained in private and only for certain ears certain relationships?
I really know that my prediction at the moment to science fiction and romantically sounds, but I see the need to present me to the government agents in a secret way moved on uncontrolable marshways, their communications are no different than in the blue memory, and there are also the few written information they have received.
The information would be accompanied in only copy in closed papers: basically, the watergate's sponage survey was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technologie today advances as a cancer, namely back.
A century after the drastless telegraph revolutionated the communication, the Internet rebuild a telegraph with (telephone) drast.
The (analogues) video boxes allowed the film researchers to study a band movie by switching from behind to the top and switching all the secrets of the assembly, while today the (numeric) CDs do not allow anything else to switch from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macro proportions.
With the high speed drives, three hours from Rome to Mayland, while this is required by aircraft including three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is not exceptional that policies and communication techniques return to cars and horses.
A last observation.
In previous times, the press tried to understand what was lost for secrets between the messages.
Currently, it is the message that calls confidence information from the press.
Climate: How France says his financial promises
A year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to investigate the compliance of rapidly resolved finances (and called "Fast Start" or "Fest Start" finances) achieved by the developing countries.
And it's already found the great French beauty.
The Copenhagen Treaty imposed the developing countries to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised 7.2 billion euros over three years, France 1.26 billion euros (e.g. 420 million per year).
In response to the opening of the COP16, the EU took all registers to convince their partners in the fact that their commitment towards the financing of fast-state finances: detailed action report of their Member States, press conference, large neighbouring events, brochure distribution.
Transparency is noted and estimated for its real value: the developing countries and the civil society are pleased to see if all developing countries have become the same precision level.
In 2010, the EU announced that 2.2 billion euros have been released, which brings them to the right way to address respect for its commitments of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if you look in detail, the things are a little more complex.
In accordance with the Copenhagen Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" to ensure that an additional use has been introduced without reaching a part of the public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the Commission proposed a harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today everyone chooses the right value he considers as the best.
For example, the Commission has as a direct value for those in 2009: the international financing will be maintained and provides 150 million in the framework of the financing "Fest Statute" for three years.
Other countries have chosen similar guidance values in respect of year or conditions at the level of public development aid.
On the contrary, France believed that the financing of "other new projects" in 2010 was "new and additional."
In other words, there are no direct values in the expenditure of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
Concretely, the total amount of French support for developing countries may remain stable (or decreased) - the France proposes to maintain its commitment to the "new and additional" financing.
Another, decisive element is the decryption in costs and loans.
There is no rule on this, and everyone chooses his account mode.
Some, such as France, have 1 € as equivalent to 1 divided €.
Obviously, this is only difficult: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain rentables investments (oriented to the recovery of emissions based on more effective technology) can be justified, it is trivial to present the euro, which will be combined as an equivalent to an independent euro... and should also be calculated only the costs of the payment for the capital grant as a contribution (e.g. the equivalent of an interest rate).
However, France has nothing different than the following transmissions: it "hereinaftered" its obligation of 420 million euros by taking 91.5% payments (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% depends) 36.1 million euros - see the EU document to convince itself.
France is the only EU country that payments are largely implemented.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (e.g.) to meet their obligations to 100% with costs.
On the other hand, if the overwhelming majority of the European Union has to comply with its obligations, France is only 10 percent and understands comparable use.
Beautiful Hokuspokus!
In general, France operates in its fast-state financing with a double skin: in part, with further development of the action over time and, on the other hand, with the reality of the financial use.
France is able to believe that 420 million "new and additional" million have been issued in accordance with its promise and that 36.1 million euros are spend.
The manipulation of the Financial Ministry (which seems to have been Bercy, who has performed the arbitration) could have a double negative effect on itself; once the internal EU (which continues with the other Member States if it is enough to lend it) and then in negotiations which have not been completely taught for the developing countries...
The chapter of the financing is only a small question on relatively short time compared to the overall discussions on climate.
But it could be too many in the great machine of UNFCCC.
We hope that this will not be the case.
As always, it is impossible to learn his lessons from this first year to finance.
First of all, France could announce a change in its type of negotiation for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and the balanced justice with the other countries of the European Union.
However, in particular, France could follow the discussions on the strictness of long-term funding (e.g., decisive and currently discussed the issue of "comparability" or the type of negotiation of its loans.
France could change its position in order to be continued in terms of conflict issues, as it is in other matters.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister of Environment Kosciusko Morrizet, which will be taken next week in Cancun.
A surprising advertising on the fast standard of France and its vision of "accentability" and the use of loans would increase from nature from the international confidence basis that is necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - Pestizide taken by children
A child of 10 years takes 81 different chemical substances over the day, so a study published by the Association Generations Futures (ancient movement for the protection of the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which states that their results “in view of the low number of analyzed samples no statistically significant value but represents illustration dimensions of the problems treated”, has normally purchased within four, from some ten-year-old foods consumpted to the food times in the Oise and Paris more a intermediate time in the supermarkets.
These typical food times, including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and vegetables, three milk products and 1,5 litres of water per day - were also investigated as the nascheries of laboratorys in the search for chemical substances, pesticides, sweat metals and other harmful substances.
The thermost balance is incredible: 81 chemical substances, including 42 as possible or probably cancer, and five as safe cardiogen classified, as well as 37 substances with endocrine stroke factors, indicates studies of several institutions, such as the International Cancer Research Center.
"If, in the nearest cases, the legal limitation for each chemically individually accepted substance is not exceeded, it is very good that the reality in which the consumption may be exercised with the endocrine factor is concerned," notes the association.
Preparing at the breakfast includes only the butter and the tea with milk already more than ten of the cancer-related residues and three safely as carcinogens, as well as more than twenty residues that may affect the hormone system.
The imported apple from Brazil as a interim time for the study provides samples of six chemical substances, including a banned fungzide in France.
The same applies to the green grain from Kenya, enclosed in the midday, in which the study shows a strictly banned insects in the EU.
Moreover, the hacksteak, the thunfish from the bridge, even the bagate and the cow of pestizides and other chemical substances were shocked.
The analysis of nitrates and cloroforms were lighted during the driving water.
During the evening, the lake store was identified with 34, the chemical residues of the " richest" and even the plastics used for the refrigeration of the meal in the microwave was not unexpected.
The final risk of this "shadown cocktails" for consumers is probably underestimated, according to the study.
The "Aliance Europe ECology Les Verts" (EE-LV) proposed, on the other hand, "the face of the emergency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "reduction of civilization diseases".
In July, a study of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was identified with regard to the presence of 365 residues of different, in fruit and vegetables identified pesticidics that are consumpted in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
