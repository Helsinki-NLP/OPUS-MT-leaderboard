The Prager Börse is struggling against business conclusion in the minute.
After the shooting disappearing in the morning, the Prayer Borss could correct the losses.
The transactions with the shares of śEZ reached almost half the normal business.
The Prayer Börse was linked to the invasion of the Monday at the beginning of the Sunday, as it was cut to six other percentage points.
This time the reason was for the invasion on the Wall Street.
In Czech also, the market reaction is shown on the result of the vote of the American Representative House which has refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector.
Case of shares in Asia
A dramatic case experienced the shares at the Börsens in Asia, while the indexs could compare a part of the losses during the day.
The index of the Hang Seng Börse in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points during the business period, but later one of the losses could be reduced, so the decline of about 2.5 percent.
The Index Hun Seng China Enterprises, who observed the movement of the Chinese shares at the Börs in Hong Kong, nearly 3,8%, the markets were closed in Shanghai.
The shares at the Börse in Sydney lost more than five percent, but then the loss of 4.3 per cent reduced.
The Börse in Taiwan resulted in 3,6 per cent after the index.
"The Timing for Saving Action in the United States is insecure and will affect the financial markets in the world," says the Head of the Monetary Authority in Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong determines, although it belongs to China, its monetary policy itself, independence on the Chinese Central Bank.
The interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as those in the United States.
The American legislators should return as soon as possible to the negotiations table and adopt the draft for support of the financial system, according to the words of the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd.
Otherwise, it was threatened that other countries would also be affected by the invasion.
A bloodbad of American acts
On Monday, the American Representative House rejected the plan for the support of the financial system for which up to 700 billion dollars (approximately 12 billion Kč).
The lawyers thus ignored the invitation of President George Bush to support the plan.
Bush's view of the plan would regulate the fundamental causes for the financial crisis and therefore help to stabilise the whole economy.
American actors experienced a bloodbad on Monday, and the most important share index marked the major invasion in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index summarized by almost seven percent, a similar invasion was last marked in 1987.
The index was already cut before the vote, but there was little signs that the project would not be done in the House of Deputy, and the index experienced a free case.
Congress makes permission: US government may pump $7,7 billion in banks
The highest representatives of the United States Congress and the Government of President George W. Bush have joined themselves in a broader form of an agreement on financial assistance for the American Financial System.
This should be amended in the beginning of the next week.
The American legislators reached a breakdown in discussions on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance for the American financial system in a range of $7,7 billion (e.g. 12 billion chronics).
However, this does not mean the victory.
Indeed, the Congress Members must continue to deal with some details of the Agreement before they publish the conclusion of the law and vote.
The financial system support plan is negotiated on Monday at the American Congress.
On Sunday, the Chairman of the Bank and Financial Service Committee Barney Frank of Agency Reuters said.
The Senate may, according to different information, be the most likely to be voted on the plan in the middle of the week.
The economists should, according to the communication that the plan is adopted, the first important psychological factor to enhance financial markets.
However, it comes to an "exportation" due to the complex mechanisms, as well as to the markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made a significant progress.
We have explained our different views about how a market stabilisation package should look", said the Democratic Nancy Pelosi against the Agency Bloomberg.
In accordance with your words, it could be a final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of the lawyers were meeting the American Financial Minister Henry Paulson on Sunday, in order to provide its final form to the Government Fund.
This presents an inconvenient hypothequencies assets from financial companies that threaten financial companies in serious losses and threaten the stability of the whole system.
"We are at the random of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and must also be effective on the market.
I think we're at the goal, says Paulson.
A signal for Asian business
The global financial crisis is also clearly in the share markets that are strongly slow.
Consequently, the words of the Democratic Senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, were trying to reach a final agreement before Sunday at the Congress.
In this way, investors want to be based on business markets in Asian financial markets that are in the first time zone where a decision of the Congress could affect the business on Monday.
However, until it is not very clear when both rooms of the American Congress vote on the law are voted, it is also unclassful about whether negotiations could not be a problem in the last minute.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the following days.
However, the law will learn some changes.
The total amount for the system shall be shared in two parts.
The initial $350 billion should be prepared as soon as possible as President George Bush requested.
However, the Congress can block the extent of the rest of the money when he has the impression that the programme does not meet its function, with more than $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush value progress in negotiations positive
The President has a veto right in this decision, but the Congress may agree on its veto.
In spite of these changes, however, the basic thanks to the programme has remained based on financing for the purchase of bad hypothetical values, whose value has been made, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to return their hypotheks.
"We've done everything.
The Representative House should be able to vote on Sunday on the law, the Senate then on Monday," said the Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The American President Bush has also shown satisfaction with the progress.
His speaker Tony Fratto explained that Bush was satisfied with the progress of Saturday and "truly appreciate the mutual effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Restriction of golden fall schedules
The Chairman of the Bank committee of Senator Christopher Dodd, the Legal Understander, agreed that the legislators would be responsible for the currency programme, the protection of taxpayers before losses, the end of benefits and a timetable for the financing of the plan.
The new law also aims to limit the so-called golden schedules for corporate directors participating in the programme and set up a committee to be monitored by the fund.
This will lead the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard in this way and achieved a great progress in direction of an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans," says Paulson.
The plan also calculates a support for householders who have problems with the repayment of their hypothecary.
The Government should deal with new rates with hypotheks which it purchases, with the objective of reducing the monthly costs for debtors and enable them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
The proposed plan is a good idea after Patria Finance David Marek's main economy, but the implementation will be very difficult.
"And therefore, because you are not aware of what mechanism and for which price the problemtic active will be purchased.
This will be crucial to how the financial sector and the government share the loss between each other," said Marek to the server iHNeed.cz this week.
Whether the plan is adopted now or start the next week, Marek's view is not expressed.
"By more important is that the Congress members have some to support the plan and to adopt it as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement that it comes to an adoption is at this moment the most important", emphasized Marek.
Double on messer's snake: MP3 player against phones.
We advised you at your choice
While almost every MP3 file can play, you can not call MP3 player.
That's why it seems like it's better to buy a phone.
However, there are sufficient reasons why you should have a own player.
The choice depends on the type of use and claims to the future owners.
Securely, you're severely buying for home a greatest plate player to listen to the latest album of Maxim Turbulenc.
Once such musical news appears not to LPs, and from quality view there is no objective reason for it.
However, you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues in Regal, you probably dream at least one of this.
So it is also with the music on travel, so with compressed music, simplified - music in the MP3 format.
There are also categories of prices and quality.
For one, it may not be acceptable to give eight thousand krones to a player, but also a pink-floyd-flane is likely to be severely listeners for twenty-twenty krones from the market.
Two extras between which there are sufficient spaces for each room.
The selection is wide.
The life period of batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what phones can do they don't even make an extraordinary way.
No modern device is to use as universal as the phone.
Besides the primary functions, the phone and the simulation, it can return music and videos, both get up, it has a better, sometimes a worse photo device and may also be shipped.
And if you're involved with the Smartphones and communicationstors, you're almost a little computer in the board.
It's a little wonder, because no refrigerator can grip and no TV photos.
However, the university of the phones also brings parts with themselves.
If you use more functions on your phone, this is more often you will have to load it.
And the playing of music is one of the greatest energy fresh.
Only few phones can play music longer than ten-twelve hours, but it's much less.
In this regard Music Player (specially the simplest) are clearly more powerful.
Therefore, you should recognise in the accepted phones that they can't play more than a few hours of music.
If you depart and call up, you will like to buy a shopping device for the office - that applies also to more devices.
When MP3 players, you will not have this problem, even the less goods keep at least 9 hours uninterrupted operation with one time.
There is another problem when you want to overcome the music on the phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices is available through a USB termination, and any phone can not be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can switch the music directly to a memory media, but only few card readers will be completed without reducing with the changing memory cards that are used in your phones.
With players, you don't need any special software to exceptions (iPod).
You only need the device to eat via USB port with music from your PC.
Most phones and players themselves provide a music library, ordering according to the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the gene or, for example, the evaluation by users.
Some devices are only the tree structure of the address directory, like Windows Explorer, some can both (reverse, assembly, Sony, cown, intelligent phones with the operational system).
Players are easier to use, phones can be more
When selecting a concrete device, you should specially expertise after the lifetime of the battery, memory capacity, quality and type of the ring, and of course also the drive comfort.
It's music especially for you and hear you every day only in the road trail, then it's a favorite phone that plays MP3 files.
What's really possible for almost every phone.
You don't need to control otherwise what music formats can process a phone or player.
MP3 creates all, and the most music you receive will be just in this format.
The format belongs to the most distributed, and most devices can also play music in the WMA format.
Actually, AAC (use a format, the apple and its iPods).
Best phones also allow the purchase of music online.
Only mobile internet is required to call the corresponding pages of a supplier (or another provider), and you can already buy a song or album.
This service can already be an enormous argument for the reason why you should have a music handy.
Unfortunately, the offering of the suppliers is bad and is only limited to fast radio.
The prices are not the lower.
However, it is generally said that this kind of sale of music will be controlled in future by the music industry.
The phone's most of them.
If you have fun to listen to something, take the phone in the jacket, while the player is forgotten to home.
However, it is the point of view of whether you are always listening to the head or at least a free-speaking institute.
If not, you can go back to the integrated sound speaker, almost every phone, but only the least MP3 player.
The greatest advantage of music handys will be in price for many.
The most acceptable costs are normally less than 3000 chrones.
For three and four thousand chrones you've already obtained a totally relevant Walkman.
The biggest handicap will be for most people that no normal head listeners are there.
The best and technically extracted phones with a 3.5 mm opening for normal headache costs up to fifty thousand crons.
The advantage of the player is back in light service.
The easierest - and not inconsistently accepted (see selection) - player can really serve everyone.
A minimum of functions, which is evident in the use of the previous normal cassette repair or for example the plate player.
It does not threaten collision in the form of an irrelevant mobile Internet and then a horrible account for data transmissions.
What device should be taken now
The most suitable phones (e.g. Vodaphone 527) are also available on a slot for exchangeable memory media (type M2, microSD etc.).
Even if you purchase a corresponding map, there are two thousand krones.
But look at it.
The base degrees are generally supported only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most money can also read 8-GB player cards.
If you already have a phone and want to buy a precious MP3 player, then go to Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
If after capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to place more than 1100 crons on the table.
Listen to the most appealing listeners, take your favorite specialized phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have a own MP3 driver head, and the driver comfort comes to the individual MP3 players.
On the other hand, Sony Ericsson, whose phones from the Walkman series have the same user device as the individual sales MP3 player.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crons, but with higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (normally 15 hours, maximum to 35 hours) offer MP3 manufacturers of the above manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is already coming to Czech in this year.
Maybe.
The Mobilfunk market in Czech is rightly equipped with the Czechian providers practitioning all the services as they are offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that imposes the classic to lower prices.
Maybe this will not be able to wait for a long time.
That the Czech Mobile Canadians work to the most costs in Europe, we have already reported on Mobil.cz.
This also confirmed the Telecommunication Authority, which pointed out that the price for a SMS is higher than the rest of the European Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission on the regulation of the roaming costs, it is likely to be a paradoxe situation - for some customers of the Czech Mobile Canadians, SMS will be more twice from the foreign.
How does the prices in Czech in comparison with Europe be so high?
The answer is simple, it lacks competition, which makes really a fight.
Maybe it seems paradox, there are three mobile networks in Czech, and a penetration of far more than 100 %.
However, mobile channels are pleased to deal with the fact that there is much competition on the Czech market.
The President of the Council of Czech Republic of Telecommunications (thu) Pavel Dvośák is also obligation to help, often expressed in the past, that there is no place for another provider in Czechia.
It is probably true that a classic supplier with a own network does not have many opportunities for otherwise (for example, he would probably find not even frequencies).
But there is another possibility - a virtual provider.
In the case of the accession of virtual suppliers to the mobile market, there was a significant price ratio to which the classic mobile channels had to react.
There were still similar voices before the entry of such companies such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market in Britain as in Czech.
However, it has shown that there is a place for such suppliers and that they can really be successful.
Nevertheless, there is no need to look for examples.
In February this we reported about the starting of the virtual supplier Mobilking in Poland.
In only a half year, this provider was able to win more than 100 thousand customers and to increase the five largest providers of the country.
Hinter Mobilking is the Penta Financial Group, which is in Czech, among other U:fon.
The benefit of virtual providers is that you can focus on a more concrete group of targets.
In order to operate effectively, virtual providers need much less customers than a classic provider.
They do not need relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers are normally profiled as low-cost companys - they offer bill phone conversation and SMS, which often is accompanied by a less extensive service offer.
Thus, for example, Tesco Mobile in Britain offers at least half more than half of its competitors.
However, as shown by the example of mobiling in Poland, it may also be a right to put up a non-clicked target group.
In fact, this provider is specifically directed to men.
"Real Man chooses Mobilking - the supplier who loves and can trust them", says David Seibert, the CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator company of this virtual supplier.
It is important to say whether a similar concept, like in Poland, could also be in Czech foot.
Daran also doubts the speaker of Vodafone Miroslav śepickī: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market session on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively calculated from the view of the service offer."
In Czech unfortunately, the mobile channels believe
But it is almost sure that if a virtual mobile channel provider Czech will not be mobile.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but in Czech the negotiations are not otherwise hopeful.
It will go to the market entry of mobilking in other countries of our region," says in a telephone conversation for Mobil.cz Jana Studničkova, a preceding president of the Penta Financial Group.
Indirectly she confirmed that the current mobile channels in Czechia were not otherwise bound by this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything to make no potential competition.
Your interest in starting a virtual mobile channel has already shown the GTS Novera group that wants to take another step to become a real competitor of telephone O2 in the field of company.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed networks, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And before, it's better.
On this option we have repeatedly negotiated with all the Czechic mobile channels.
With some of them, we were already able to reach a rapid deal of negotiations," said the publishers of the Pavel Kadl Group.
Maybe there are better times now.
Of non-official information, the first virtual provider may be expected until the end of the year.
But until all, this is rounded by an unwindable wall of the swimming.
"In this moment we do not think that there is a full virtual offerer in Czech place.
The Czech market is a large number of markets in other markets.
Until then, no subject has spoken to us with a complex and serial project in this area," says in its statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sscheś from the Press Department of Telephonic O2.
In the specific case of the Czech market, further providers are also shown.
T-Mobile Martina Kemrova's preacher added rarly in accordance with the Declaration of O2: "After we have not found a viable and mutual project that can continue to build."
And she adds: "The network of T-Mobile will not be a virtual provider until the end of the year.
At this time we should have made a concrete offer to think so short-term."
Vodafone highlights its attention to complying with the requirements of the own 3G license.
Miroslav śepickī means: "The negotiations with potential virtual providers are open, especially in the area of the participation of costs and infrastructure.
If this is what we look at from the view of the customers than the best.
The main strategy of Vodafons in this area is in the search for a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile internet."
The responsible authorities - with the providers in hand
The action of mobile channels is easy to understand, another provider called more competitiveness, this would lead to a decline of winning.
Why, therefore, should such a competitor facilitate the market entry?
That providers can be able to move to a strand if something happens, the long hin and hers are also involved in the development of U:fon.
The most strongest pressure in direction śTU went to the time you came to the market, from the T-Mobile company.
This also provides the public information available from the websites of  zu.
Now, however, just U:fon is a argument why you should not allow a virtual offerer.
Martina Kemrova noted: "The competitive area of the mobile market was recently strengthened by market entry into a fourth mobile supplier.
In view of the character of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new actor would provide high requirements on the market itself and in particular its services."
However, the absolute detriment of the Czech regulatory authorities in view of this starting point of view.
It is not only the position of the ŠTU, which is twenty-third - in difference with Britain and other high-developed countries - is not the competence to enter economic competition.
This has only the UOHS Agency for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
However, this concerned the whole problem in its entire typical situation.
"The market involvement of a virtual mobile channel would then be possible after it came to a contract between a mobile channel and a virtual supplier on the appointment of the necessary infrastructure.
Not until this contract was concluded, because the offer was probably not sufficiently interested for the classic providers,” said in response to our request by Christian Chalupa from the UOHS for external relations.
This formulation would not be surprised by the representatives of the suppliers.
A authority representing consumer interests and, inter alia, should consider that no one misuse its position on the market is more important.
In particular, if Christián Chalupa adds: "The foreign where virtual suppliers work totally normal, it is to be observed that their market access has contributed to a price reduction in mobile telephone services."
However, it is likely to be the pressure on the correct functioning of the market, and a price reducing does not involve the interests of the UOHS.
In this case, it is really shocking to the almost shocking in line with the three mobile channels, which results from their reactions.
The question if it really is about a accident is on the hand.
Just as the absolute same benzine price at the tank devices is only a accident and the consequence of a hard competition campaign.
"The Authority has found no signs in this matter that indicated the trade directed towards competition, and therefore has no reason to enter any kind of matter.
No offerer has a dominant market position, so he does not have the increased responsibility for its market trade.
The necessary instruments for the opening of the mobile market for virtual suppliers are likely to have lacked the telecommunication regulatory authority," Chalupa stated in its statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many strict points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, prepared by the STI, which is a single market after telecommunication in view of economic competition.
At such market, of course, none of the Czech Mobile Canadians have a dominant position.
Some legal experts, however, provide a different vision - for the marketing of a virtual provider is always necessary to accept the network operator.
And the mobile channel has - logically - the monopol for its network.
This means that it takes a dominant position in a particular segment.
However, even if you do not contact this argument, it should be a warning for the UOHS at least that three mobile channels are similar.
The complaints of a number of interested persons (including the GTS Novera company) show that they are subject to very similar obstacles in negotiations with all providers.
The derogation of the responsibility to the ŠTU is then a legal trick in telecommunication services, which is distant from the whole matter.
This was to be observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, in the recently adopted new news of the Telecommunication Act, it is not possible to implement the expansion of the competences of the TSI in the field of economic competition in telecommunication, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
This must only be aware of the representatives of the UOHS, but they probably have other interests.
It's all right if no one looks.
Uncertainly, the functioning of any pseudovirtual providers remains equal to several in the Czech mobile networks.
There are companies which depart their own price lists for mobile telecommunication services, but only publicly.
Normally, it is an undertakings that operate in the field of multi-level marketing.
Personal mobile telephone services offers, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Star Life and others.
The price lists of these companies are normally selected only.
The wise of this is that the company involves the operator as a classic company that orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, it receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czechic mobile suppliers prohibit a similar type of continued sale.
"If you have to describe cases, then it may be a violation of the contractual conditions we will be employed then, which can lead to an end of cooperation with the society concerned," Martina Kemrov answered our question to this problem.
However, it is unlikely that some of the responsibilities of the mobile channels do not respond.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, it may be thousands of customers.
However, no operator is opposed to such a action.
Indeed, from the activities of these companies, they did not have to be denied, at the same time, they - in difference with the real virtual suppliers - are not affected by the actual official marketing.
On possible problems, Miroslav śepickī notes: "The law allows such types of speculations, however, the services of these companies are used only by a very low percentage of customers.
They must also accept that SIM cards do not run in their phone, so they can't have completely as normal customers of the mobile channel."
Only it should be strange, at least it should happen.
Furthermore, a further question for the UOHS is opened.
Reverse mobile channels before such action, why are they switching against a virtual supplier?
It is added that the UOHS has a rightly strong competence to detect such activities, and if not, it must not be satisfied with the declaration of the suppliers, they know nothing about it and their business conditions would prohibit it.
When Czech Republic isn't the most precious
As stated in the text several times, the market involvement of virtual providers had a significant decline in the various services.
In all countries where virtual suppliers have been found, the classic providers are trying to prevent their decline almost more or less.
The arguments used by them were practically identical - a too small market, or a very sweet market, problems in the quality of services, etc.
In the high-developed countries, however, in these moments the regulatory bodies were introduced which did not have the interests of the mobile channels, but the real customers.
If it was through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they reached that the first virtual operator was, and then further.
Unfortunately, the Czechan regulatory bodies are in the whole case as a warm cartoffel.
From our experiences, we cannot conclude that incertitude in the skills in these cases is more favorable than in these cases.
But we don't get the fleet into the corn.
If the background information is agreed and soon a virtual provider is present, the Czech market may soon be moved.
If a provider allows the development of a virtual mobile channel, the UOHS will not remain inactive when it is to dismiss any other interests (discriminate).
And then the Czechs will finally not call more than the rest of Europe.
The new Czechic hymne has four new versions.
Find the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech National Symnes.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Miek Topolánek introduced the new accommodations of the National Hymne Where is my homeland on the day of Czech State.
The Hymne was renewed by the National Theatre Orchester under the leadership of Jiśí Bślohlavek.
There are four versions available - with a man or woman's solvent, in chor resolution and in a toolal version.
The opinion was adopted by Kateśina Knśinkov and Adam Plachetka.
The workers of the hymne versions are Otakar Jeremiach and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNeed.cz server, you can listen to all four versions.
For Bślohlavek, the Czech National song is one of the most beautiful hymnes.
Previously, he had said to the Czech Rundfunk that he had chosen for the Solo-Varian songers with young, representative voices that are marking and popular.
"I've tried to keep a clear diction with both and then with the Chor, so that you understand the text well so that it comes out of an agreement," says the Derector.
The Czech National Symphony next year takes its 175th Jubilee.
The song Kde domovj began first in 1834 on the bridge of the Stindetheater in the originally tschechical piece of Fidlovačka of Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music standed by František šcroup.
It was popular, and people took it spontaneously.
The first throne of the song then became a organic part of the national sympathy after the development of the Czechoslowakei in 1918.
One of the seven state symbols also remained after the development of the own Czech Republic.
How the "new" hymne sounds
Prayer transports first on a chip at midnight
On Wednesday, 1 October 2008, the story of the Prager transport companies will be a date in which the first train passengers in a U-board, road station or bus will be covered in the board instead of a paper driver.
These can now purchase about hundreds of thousands of people with the Chipcard Opencard.
The passengers can purchase a 30-day, 90-day or a year cop (validly from 1 January 2009) and let them play on their chip cards, such as in the centres and furnitures of the transport stations at the U-bandour stations Museum, Mśstek, Nádraíí Holešovice, Andhl, Roztyly, Laśany, Kobylisy, Rajská zharrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons are also available over the Internet on the pages of the transport companies www.dpp.cz since yesterday.
The service was entitled to over four hundred customers until afternoon.
Those who use the Internet sale can really forget the expenditure window in the U-Bahn stations where they must regularly wait on their paper vehicles for a long time.
You're buying the coupon via Internet, playing this on the open card in one of the thirty branches of the city library.
"In these places, travellers are also available to a switch with a decent staff, the interested person at the internet sale and also plays the coupon on the card," says the speaker of the project Martin Opatrný.
Besides the libraries, the electronic cops can also play on the open card that have been installed in some U-Bahn fibers.
How do you see such cars?
They are red, remembering travellers, the passengers may have already noticed in the Roztyly U stations, Budśjovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Actually there are five of the city, until the end of the year must be eighth," adds Opatrný.
The Coupon controls an automate instead of the driver
The use of cars that will work from tomorrow is easy.
You just need to enter the chip card, and the cowpon that you have previously purchased plays from yourself.
The electronic coupons shall apply not only in the capital city, but also in the environment from tomorrow.
For example, in the cities and on the bus lines, the numbers 300 to 499, with the maintenance of the populations from the Mediterranean region to the capital city.
"In the trains which are part of the integrated transport to the Prayer, the adjunct readers have the ability to check the validity of the coupons by time and zones", says Philip Drapal from the Ropid Organization. This organization combines the driving plans for the prayer transport.
The city bus has card reading devices on the box at the driver.
The chip card must be shown not only at the driver, but the open card is to insert to a marked place on the side of the box.
Thus the driver controls the validity of the played coupons.
"When a passenger checks the validity of the played coupons, nothing is easier than requesting the driver to ask this information," says Drapal.
A passenger who does not run with front-bus bus and no longer knows when the validity of the coupons ends, can go back to self-administration automobiles where the coupons are played on the card.
Here the information on the validity of its documents will be shown on the display of the device.
The Sudans requested a people ' s decision.
In 1945, the Sudan Germans were invited to join the Böhmerwald to the United States.
This comes from a letter in the collections of the South Bohemic Science Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we would, at least, want to live under the control of the United States of America.
With such desires, some groups of Southern Germans should have been used to the Presidents of the United States in 1945.
This is, among others, from a letter that has been received in a private archive and which is saved today in the collections of the South Bohemic Science Library.
The Germans of Krumau requested the American Presidents in the letter to return the "South Gaus", which was adopted on the basis of the Munich Agreement of Hitler - not allowed to the Chechechoslowakei.
"We have understood the situation correctly, and we really want to make sure that the American units are not as a subpressor and enemy in German territories, but as freezer," says in a letter signed with the words "Mans who are the slope of the Southern."
Since the connection to the Czechoslowakei, the Sudan Germans, in the light of the Czech National Character, allows them to expect brutality, relieflessness, inconsciousness, underpression and slavery, request the Presidents of the letter to take the American Presidents for today and forever the rule of protection over the Bowmerlands.
"We can't believe that you can't talk to a four-million inhabitants of this area towards us a foreign State to emphasize and eliminate minorities and pursuing nothing to win the allied," is in the letter.
The reason for not signing the advertisers, it is likely the fear of the "Tschechic Subpressors".
If the President of the United States doubts about the interpretation of the Böhmerwalddeddeut, it should be sufficient if he would initiate a public decision on whether the people would become part of the United States or would like to live under the protection of the United States.
Although the text of the letter today knows the historic war may spend something naiv, some periods believe that it is a good image regarding the expectations of the Sudan Germans.
Even if the Bohemians had to admit at least that they would be negotiated on their departure from the Republic, only few of them had a real possibility.
Some waited that the United States and the United States would deal with an autonomy for the Sudan.
Others believed that they could just stay in the Czechslovakia.
It also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who is from Budweis.
He was in the war as a buddhist German at the sea at the East Sea.
When he arrived at the end of the war in British prison and brought him into a war prisoner to Holstein, twenty other Boomitic Germans came to him, he had to add them to Czechish.
"They believed, if they were home, they would pass the Czech Republic," says Chalupa.
No one of the German war prisoners who had lived before the war in the Czech-Slovakia has estimated that it would be taken from the Republic on the basis of the Benesch Decrees.
You don't think - then pay!
A emotional campaign calls for car drivers
First action on security on the streets in the Czech history.
In this way, the emotional media campaigns were characterized which would like to start the Ministry of Transport at midnight.
The Authority of Ministers Alleš śebæek agrees to defeat drivers of dangerous behavior behind the lenkrade.
The campaign for 150 million crons is going on television, radio, cinema, Internet, but also on fleet.
She will take the driver of too fast drive and alcohol on the tax.
And they also remind them of switching in front of driving.
In particular, the campaign wants to speak to young drivers, motor vehicles, footballers, and not lastly with awareness of professional power drivers.
And what's shown in the spots?
Especially the stories of people who call to emotions.
This also produces the "blue" slogan of the whole campaign:
You don't think - then pay!
The words "not even" are situated in major books on a character shift.
And then the word "pay".
This means that you can pay an uncertainty moment with your own life.
The spots will be shocked by the observers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Caribbean countries, where there are very normal images with drastic invasions of accidents.
It is promising that the accidents and the number of transport stations are declined on the Czech roads.
The spots were collected by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Sugar broth and peitsche for drivers
"For the drivers, the moto of sugar brot and peitsche applies.
Sugar brot means that when they go to red, for example, they run time.
The Peitsche then is the advertising of a punishment or a accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," says the hospital psychologist Na Homolce Martin Kośán.
And therefore, information campaigns are needed in the press and especially negative advertising, means the psychologist.
Not less effectively, his opinion is on tables that make the drivers attentively at a risk.
"If you're setting a static table that warns before a danger, it probably will soon be shocked with the environment, and the drivers will not take them anymore," says Kohán.
Olmert would take almost all the areas in the exchange of peace.
The Presidency of the Provider Israeli government Ehud Olmert has expressed himself for the practical return of all areas in 1967, including Jordan, Ostjerusalem and Golan, when they can close to the exchange of peace with Palestinian and Syria.
This he stressed in an interview printed on Monday by Jediot Ahronot.
"We have to get to an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all areas (instead of all), if not all", said Olmert against the newspaper.
"We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to delay the Palestinians a similar high percentage (Israel regions) because it will not be given peace without this," he added.
He emphasized that a possible return will also include ostjerusalem.
"Their, who wants security in Jerusalem, and especially not to want that tractors or Bulldozers roll over his legs, as has happened one of my best friends, will be rejected at one of the part of Jerusalem," observed Olmert, in response to two attacks in the city in July, where several people killed and twenty people were blessed.
According to the first, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temples and the sacred and historical places" which are on the territory of the old city.
"The one who wants to receive the Israeli sovereignty over the whole city must be integrated by 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work", he confirmed.
Absorption from the Golan Heads
Olmert said for a disappearing Israel from the Golans, what is his view of an unbelievable condition to the end of a peace agreement with Syria.
This would, however, require certain efforts on the pages of Damascus.
"My proposal does not call to close only with Syria on the basis of a disappearing from the Golan Heaven of Peace with the only basis of the Golan," he reaffirmed Olmert.
"The Syrians only know to know what they need to turn back to the Golan Golans.
They will have to reject their current relationship with Iran; they will have to reject their relationship with the (sitial) Hibollah movement; they must reject the continuing support that they give to the terrorism of the (sititic) Hamas movement, the terrorism network Al-Khaida and the Zshihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," concretely the Prime Minister.
Questions after the accident: Is Stewards in the bus unlawful?
The law does not know that in a television bus, the turn is not allowed.
With regard to the tragic accident of a bus of the Society Students Agency near the Italian Padua, the question is whether Stewards and travellers can go to the bus during the journey.
"When we strict and formally observe the law, the activity of a Steward is opposed to the law on road traffic," says the speaker of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The accident that came around a twenty-year-old Stewardes' life in the last week, probably was caused by the driver of the LKW, which crossed the road to the bus.
The young woman stood in this moment at all unfortunately next to the driver at the least safeest place in the car, although she had available two other places.
However, a bus may also have an accident or smell in the moment where the steward coffee or newspapers are employed.
A role also plays whether the bus is equipped to the car letter also with steel places.
If this is not prescribed in the bus, the travelers must sit.
The TV bus of Student Agency has no shooting places; what confirmed the director of the company, Radim Jančura, against the current.cz.
"We talked about this with the Ministry, and this has not first agreed to move travelers.
Later, you have taken this, and we have reached a consensus, where the travellers may go to the toilet when they have their seat place," he shared his position.
The law does not know Steward
"No clear legal interpretation for the role of a Stewards - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is no law prohibited to provide services to the carrier.
The law on road traffic is only aware of the term of vehicle adherents; however, it does not define its rights and obligations," said the speaker of the Ministry of Hanzelka clearly.
However, the Director of the Railways Division of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný believes that the law is closely covered by this problem.
"It is the case if the bus has a steel place in the product authorisation.
That's all right," he stressed.
Buses are shared in the city bus where there are shoes, and the maximum speed is limited, the transportation bus with steel places and a higher speed and higher permitted television bus without shields with the highest permitted speed and seats that are equipped with safeguards.
As in the flight, the Fachman says
The BESIP Service for Transport Safety Jaroslav Hośin does not consider a fundamental problem in the movement of Stewards on a bus movement.
"The situation is comparable to the service of an aircraft is not threatened by many risks.
Also here is not sure when the turbulence comes, and the Stewardess can shoot the head."
"Bus, however, stripped, then, of course, also applys the laws of the physical.
Like in the city bus or in a road trail.
The safety of Stewards must be clarified by internal rules," he also says that this matter is not completely resolved from the view of the law.
Jančura is ready to stretch the services
Student Agency offers a single bus service from Stewards.
The company is employed by about two hundred people in this function.
The Director also does not consider its profession after the accident as a risk.
"But when I get the impression that Steward's profession is risking, I'm gonna strike him.
Coffee and newspapers can be obtained by travellers.
This would also take the costs," he says.
As a matter of security, Asiana Alexej Litvin's director founds the lack of Stewards in his bus, but his company is only a brown of lines compared to the student Agency.
"We have no stewards, but we're swearing from the beginning.
Before or later, this ends with some mortal accident," he had not expressed a year ago for tiden.cz.
It was an incredible tragedy.
In the accident of a line bus to Neapel, a young stewards from the Pilsen region was uncomfortable, who had worked for two years.
The Slovenian LKW was likely to be able to cut off the strip and cut the bus off.
However, the driver of the bus tried to evacuate a sharp manure, colliding with the right front of the LKW.
That the two places were sold for the Stewards, Jančura is deployed.
"These places cannot be reserved at telephone connections, they are blocked."
Signature will call LKW-fabrics.
The Agency will not wait on the court, but expects a financial deprivation for the family of young women, but it is also of the sides of the debtor.
A legislation change?
Not in view
An accurate arrangement of the movement of Stewards on a bus could bring a legal arrangement where a thirty-fifth expert of the Ministry of Transport has already been working over one year.
"But this has not yet been achieved to a concrete conclusion.
The bus is not uncertainly on the agenda order, above the point system, the maximum speed on the car train and the use of phoneys at the drive," says Fachmann Hośín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of Stewards as a threat to the safety of travelers", says Hanzelka, where the safety control of the bus is in the competence of the police and labour protection authorities.
Dusseldorfer hopes quiet on Frankfurt
In large words, it is not missing in the letter of the WestLB Presidency to the employees of the house.
With a combination of units of the Düsseldorfer Monetal Institute with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank, the Central Capital Market House of Sparkases Financial Group could be found in the letters known at Monday.
The WestLB introduced a "competitive block" in a such business.
And it could be a connection to the crucial encouragement to further dealings in the country bank sector.
So it will be read when a responsibility in difficult times is to demonstrate activity.
Because the WestLB struggled is like in a powerful press.
Not only from the Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Service Monitoring Agency, which has recently expected the Northern Western Government to find a solution to the future.
From a kind of kind of link between the Deka bank, which has known Sparcase experts for their investment funds, and the WestLB has already been talking - even on the Frankfurt page.
Even though Deka-Bank-Chef Franz Waas was aware of the posting of half-year numbers at the end of August, in a fusion of the house at the Main Land Street with a country bank, about Helaba or WestLB, he doesn't understand.
However, the Governing Council of Deka, which is carried to half the country banks and the Sparcase Associations, has taken the position to conduct the meeting with WestLB on common business activities.
In this way, it could take part in the capital market or parts of it.
The discussions are free, so it's in the financial place, just started.
The Deka bank, which is part of its 3000 employees to the most important employees in the Frankfurt financial place, is not the first time that it goes to consolidation in the Sparcase sector.
2003 was a moment so long as the Deka bank could fusion with the Rhinland-Pfalz Landbank and the Helaba.
However, there was nothing from this three bond.
Many of the plans were publicly, the Hezekiah country government said to participate in Helaba.
The other two houses also did not find each other.
The Countrybank Rheinland-Pfalz went to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
But it has always been thinking about a connection of the Deka bank with country banks.
Nevertheless, Sunther Merl, President of the Helaba, had spoken against planning games.
However, independence of this, it seems to be realized that a comparison of the various households of the public and legal sector does not take place.
Once the landscape is over in Bayern, the BayernLB's first connection could be closed to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
For Helaba it isn't a good news.
If the pressure increases further fusions, you go after and after the partners.
In the south, she would be more than Junior partners, although she has made the financial crisis awarely better than the households in Munich and Stuttgart.
A meeting with the West LB has renewed the Hessen-Spain and Girversband showings that participated with 85% in the Helaba at the beginning of the year.
The North LB remained.
Such geostrategic considerations are only one of the sides.
On the other hand, the question is how the different business models are adapted to each other.
In June, Merl expressed the crucial question with which business model is to ensure the future of the country banks is not answered by the German Spain and Girls Group.
At the end, the West LB could also be a dilution, but it is not self-deseared.
Thus, in the letter of the province there is also the speech that it will be aimed for a "general solution" for the house.
As it allows to bring the composition of individual units with the deca bank under a hair, it will still be shown.
The second Wednesday is known as "Italy Wednesday"
For Elena, it's the first, for Luca the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena's like his girlfriend with it, and it's all different, he says.
Between them, at the five-level bus phase of the Marke Kaiser, there is a massively built barrier and proves to the travellers around 200 October feasts, which deep thon can bring his bones.
Elena just gives Luca a kiss, then a kiss.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, the buspark next to the Puorta Newa Bahnhof, at 23.45 p.m., starts at 4 bus, "Monaco destination, birra Festival", at 6.30 p.m.
Three buses are mainly preserved to Italians, traveling only to Brazilians.
In one side of the park, the South Americans sing next to their fahns, they have already been celebrated in the night.
And so, Marco Watch says, that's nothing for Italians.
Marco, who has a long mantel with pelzimital feed and a brill with wide silver birds, is the bus.
From five years to October, three tours are alone in this year.
Tonight, day on the Wess, at 22:30 p.m.
Overnight would mean only unnecessary costs, says Marco.
75 euros cost the driving, the welcome sumsturk with Caiser-Bier, used to believe the Bayeric cleaning order, the hospital insurance and the German language travel guide - Marco visited a language course in Frankfurt, including.
And the bus are already rolled on the night, on the Autostrada direction "Brennero".
There's no bird, not yet.
Quickly, it will be quiet in the bus, the travelers sleep.
Well, they will still need their forces.
Conserved in Brix and in Holzkirchen, where some other buses with Italian signs on the 8-hour cars are placed before the München.
As the Marcos Group finally arrived at half seven hours early on the park near the Theresienmose, there are already 50 other buses from all Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a last conversation, declares the attack plan.
First of all, set the yellow cups.
There is the left "Octoberfest", in fracture, including the Internet address of Marcos Reiseburo: "conoscersiviando.it".
Secondly, "When the doors come to the bierzelt, it means walking!", Marco calls into the morning.
"It's going!" Leave the places and places in the back of the ceiling.
"Don't pass, but we're blocking, and not all the eggs on the same banks, distribute in the room!"
The measure, burns Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget drinks.
"The security believers show that we take good care of us!
When you leave the place, they are gone!"
Third: "Third night point twenty-five back here!" understand?
And we're going to come on to Visn.
In the way, a yellow caps binds a tripmark to the trees, to the shilder and even to the selection plate of a large Bayerian people party.
You want to be shocked for the retreat.
It is known as "Italy Wednesday".
There is no precise information about numbers; the speech is of 50 000 who make themselves on the way over the alpines and fall in the bicycles, ten percent of all visitors should be attended at the extra from Italy in this weekend.
The Muncher police is strengthened by seven police police from Southern Tyrol, supporting Italian voluntary helpers, the Bayerian Red Cross, which leads to a national statistics, in which Italians before Britain (e.g. 60 employees) and Austrians (e.g. 80), with about 200 medical careers.
Especially popular with Italians, it is the court.
Without bed nights for believers of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system was relatively stabil, emphasized by the Federal Finance Minister Peer Steelbridge only in the past week.
It is good that the politicians use the word "relative" and also understood that the German banking sector will not be removed from the critical developments.
Because it's happening at the weekend now.
The coin noted in Dax is a billion credit from the turbulences to the markets from a consortium German banks.
One person trusted with the situation said Reuters on Monday that credit aid was up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate should simply depend on the part that they also take.
The money comes from private and public banks.
In the background, losses are at the daughter Depfa.
The State financers had reported a periodic report on long-term projects for which he had paid, very short-term refinancing - which is not possible because of misconsciousness on the markets in this respect.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's bar reserves were 95% to 2.537 million euros, and the own capital rate was slightly identified from 1.6 to 1.45%.
The current revenue and net income from financial affairs were zero in comparison with the previous year period, which was estimated from claims to claims and certain value papers, as well as the resolve of reimbursements in the loan of EUR 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
Only higher income resulting from refunds from the restructuring of the former Depfa group as well as from the refund of interests under the rules of expenditure and in the business supply for concert companies, the decrease had been decreased by about 16 per cent even more moderate.
The former State financer had first settled after his privacy in 1990 with commercial real estate credits that were then extracted in the Aareal Bank.
Since the classic State financing was too few, the depfa was then strengthened in infrastructure projects and the financing of Community private investors and the State (Private-Public Partnership, PPP) and international diversification.
At the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate must now take registrations that will have a "excellent material effect" on the profit and loss calculation of the group, it is indefinite.
The fact is that the divident was cut off.
Soon for 2007, it was shorted for two thirds.
The Hypo Real Estate has been a significant state and infrastructure financer since the depfa overset.
It is more dependent on refinancing on the interbank market as it has no customer installation.
With the composition of the American Investment Bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the credit payment is widely reversed among the banks, since the banks accept their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs annually for a part - approximately 50 billion euro - of the depfa deportfolio short-term resources for refinancing.
According to the report of the Hypo Real Estate, the financing requirements of the group with the credit are covered at a decrease time and the company is "in effect of the current largely functionable international money markets".
In other sources, it is necessary to hear that refinancing has been secured by money until the end of 2009.
The HRE Chairman Georg Funke explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group will not have to take up the money markets at a timely time.
Federal Bank and the Federal Service Oversight Office (BaFin) are deeming that Hypo Real Estate Group’s market capacity is now insured.
This is hopeful for shareholders and believers of the bank.
But in view of the dynamic and inevitableness of the crisis, there is no doubt.
It is not even remarkable that financing must not be taken in full range.
But the opposite is not shocked.
After the late Sunday after the dealing after the bank was still insolvency, at least the savings could not be able to calm the farmers.
The share rate is about 75 per cent to 3,30 euros.
However, it is good to keep the loan currencies.
If priority debts are not moved, the rates of the non-profit benefits are more clear.
In particular, the expenditure of the previous daughter company Württemberg Hypo and, of course, the duration periods coming over 2009.
In the case of hypo-real stages, it must be a special installational alternative, so that it must be considered to be the validity of the banken crisis and the Institute itself, which had received the depfa's crisis in the house only when the stability of the international financial system was depending on the stability of the international system.
As long as the banks, governments and less-related business banks are ready to support the system, as long as the pensions are able to be discharged.
Or it is the one that is now not expecting someone - that the financial crisis will be overwhelmed in the coming 15 months.
However, in view of the reports of the part-stated State, it is only a decisive hope that is now limited to security.
This should, in particular, provide some long-term believers with the decision whether they should be divided from their commitments.
The short-term investors can always make a decrease for the future payment of tax payments on currency profits in the past years.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento Box
As Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, to present the first school day at the Tachibana High School, the girls began to smile: The German is total "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange logo she spoke from Japan.
"The first school day in Japan.
I was surprised.
Soon before the school journey, I had a bammel.
I live on the border Tokio in the direction of Kawasaki and run 40 minutes with the journey to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find the way alone, for luck, I didn't lose me.
The beginning of education seems not so strictly set at the Tachibana as with us home in Niedersachsen.
The students take up from eight hours until twenty before nineth a short conversation round with the teacher, the 'home room'.
But before the teaching began, I was on the row to present me.
I'm not the guy who likes to speak before people, not before a class of 40 students.
Because I had no school unit yet, I took a old rock of my guest mother, blue, blue shoes, and black shoes.
So, I put me in front of the pult and tried to speak all right: 'Sayonara Wo Wo she Sylvana...' - I call Sylvana, come from Germany and I have birthday in a week.
At the moment, I was very happy that I had started a good two years ago to learn the language.
The 31 girls in the class have all tasted, shocked and won, and soon I heard the word "Kawaii".
I knew that out of my manga.
It belongs to the surviving japanese word chatz and means 'sweet, sweet'.
Then I'm shocked on my place.
The girl, next to me, was very wide, she found it a honour that the winners should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quiet, but when the Gong smelled, I was regularly shocked.
Everyone talked through each other, and asked me sweethearts in the bowl - it's really difficult to understand Japanese English.
All their bands were packed in the pause.
My guest mother had done me too a lunchbox - that's something else than the German pauss breasts.
I had a trip with meats, small beaches, salt from gucken and algebra, fruit and a species of meat in the toilet.
Of course, I don't have a smell of what I'm going to eat here in Japan.
It looks strange and smells completely new.
It's like it's really nice.
Well, until the salzy plants may be brrrr!
The Bentos are not just breakfast in Japanese schools.
Sometimes, a girl gives a child's own prepared Bento, which then is especially artificially prepared - in the hope of learning the boys closer to the pausensnake.
That's why I read in my manga comics.
I'm sweet if I can see this here too.
'Why Japan is it?' I asked my friends when I told them that I wanted to go to school for one year in Tokyo.
I always said,
"Why it's fascinating me now."
Finally, I'm reading the most favorite Mangas for years.
And so I understand better the comics and the culture there, I have also started to learn a little Japanese.
So for me it was very clear that I had to travel here forever.
Because I also have a facility for tradition, then and swimming.
And there's a great value here.
On the other hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditionally.
And since everything is so well organized, I didn't feel here anymore, even though Tokio is the largest city that I've seen."
Rattes also have feelings
Should a rat or sheep fly at risk mean that they also have fear?
Joseph LeDoux is convinced: many animals also have feelings.
Only how can you examine whether they are reacting to the same if they are similar to us?
The Internet Journal "Edge" has been published for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents the answers selected in a series of answers to the question "What do you keep true without proving it?"
I think that animals have addicts and other conscious conditions, without that I or any other one could prove this until now where we can't even prove that others have conscience.
But in this case, we can at least hope that all human brain present the same basic configuration.
However, when we use other species and approve questions of the recognition or generally of the consciousness, we have an instant outcome because the hardware does not agree.
If a rat is in danger, it does the same as many other animals: it stands dead, flights or strikes.
People are similar to what some scientists close to a comparable subjective experience.
But I don't think so.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to bring our subjective experience to the animals.
For a closure, almost always with human consciousness the seed prefrontal cortex (for its participation in the short-term memory and the executive/control functions).
This wide region is much higher than the other primates and seems to be missing in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that differ from the prefrontal Courtx, including the knowledge we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is therefore reason for accepting that people even differ from the other primates.
Another dramatic property should be in the language of the human nature: as such a large part of his life is associated with the language, it often depends on the consciousness of it.
In this case, we can exclude animals.
However, even though consciousness does not differ from language, it would certainly affect it, so that animal consciousness, as may be created, is probably very different from the majority of our conscious conditions.
It is therefore difficult to figure out how consciousness can appear in other animals.
If it is, as something internal and subjective, nor, nor, because of the special hardware, it can analyze our own experience, it brings us his research for great problems.
Most of my explanations refer to the content of the most conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of conscience that should be scientifically simpler access.
You could investigate the consciousness process of animals without consideration of their contents, and exactly it happens in studies about the short-term memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
However, in this approach to Christof Coch and Francis Crick, the neural corelate of consciousness is more likely to be identical or even not.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the importance of the prefrontal Court for the conditions of visualization.
What is the result of the refunds now?
I call them back that an emotive system, such as fear, will be actived in a brain conscious of his own activity.
Thus, what we call "terror" is the mental condition in which we find when the activity of the brain localized disorder systems (or their consequences, such as physical reactions).
Recommendations are closely linked to the regions of the Court of Justice, which represent the primates and, in particular, the people.
Connecting with the speaking nature, we are able to be able to distinguish and categorize with the words and grammatic conditions, in order to write them together with us.
For example, Antonio Damasio said that infringements from primitive activities in the body feelings regions of the Courtx and the brain, similar Jaak Pankseep, but more focused on the brain.
Since this network has not been very changed through human evolution, it could be involved in cross-border refunds.
I can't oppose clean theoretically, however, it is unproofable.
Pankseep argues what appears in Rats and people like fear, probably feels likewise in both cases: but how can you examine whether Rats and people accept the same way when they act similarly?
Does a sheep flee at risk, or is she also feared?
In my eyes, simply conductiveness can not be a similarity.
Although the neural comparison continues: rabbits and people have similar brains, sheep do not even have a brain.
But the brain is responsible for admissions?
And even if you can prove this to people: How would you prove it to be shown by rabbits?
I believe that rats and other skins, perhaps even sheep (who knows?), have reciprocs.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And because their reputations are most likely different from our (the human consciousness is based on specific slugs and languages), I would like to study the emotional behaviour than the emotional rewards of rats.
In any case, progress on the neural level will be achieved, provided that rabbits and people are missing the same.
As I do not investigate language and consciousness at Rattes, so not income, I don't know whether they exist.
You can keep this short-term, but I'd like to go forward than to walk on a wall constantly.
I'm also a practical emotionalist.
Uefa-President Platini: Gnaden Frist for Poland and Ukraine
The Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Watjunik said that the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government considers the decision of Uefa in Bordeaux as a evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize EM together with Poland," said Watjunik.
"But this is no amnesty for our country.
The work has just started and there is still much to do in two countries."
In the timeplan for the construction or reconstruction of the stations, streets, hotels and airports, the two guests are behind.
Even the number of EM stadiums may be reduced by eight to six.
"We can't miss time anymore.
Now we need to work with maximum speed,” said the Ukrainian President Grigori Surkis.
"The EUFA will keep us constantly in the eyes."
A further radical step was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish Association PZPN has been suspended after numerous scandales by the National Olympic Committee and was replaced by the independent manager Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission was joined on request by Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
The best "the serious danger that the PZPN is not able to act according to the rules", said Drzewiecki of the Poland news Agency PAP.
"We have assured the President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation of Uefa will not be suffered under EM 2012."
several initialists were sentenced alone in the past season because of the driving decline, finally even the ligastart had to be moved shortly.
Comment Dennis Quaid returns
She wanted to promote a new movie, speaking in the interview about privates - and now has a angry with the ex: Hollywood-Star Meg Ryan revealed her fleet Dennis Quaid as a wife.
It's smelling and smiling back.
Late Rosen war at the ex-eeper couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood players now have a unpleasant strict strict with each other in all public.

Accommodation prices for airports and hotels
In the first half of 2008, refugees and overnights in Europe were more than twice in the previous year.
In Germany, flights were even more than 50 per cent of the current study.
Flights and overnights in hotels have become more favorable - this is the result of a study of the traveling and financial service provider American Express.
The company has analyzed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and identified a significant fall in the second quarter after an increase in the prices in the first quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market for years, the overnights have already increased many places.
From January to March, the prices in Europe's towns, from 41 to 48, continued at average 6,9% compared to 2007.
From April to June the prices were lower than in the previous year.
The most clearest trend was in Paris and Rome, where travelers 30 to 37 per cent had to pay less than one year before.
As a reason for this, American Express sees the weak dollar currency that led to a "decreasing travelling experience of American tourists".
Also, financial locations such as Frankfurt or London are increasingly involved in the decline of the hotel prices than industrial standards such as Hannover, Köln or Stavanger.
In the northern city, the hotel prices have increased by 26.3% even the record in Europe.
The trend in the first quarter also showed the following:
Because of the inversation of Keros, travelers had to pay more than 2007 in the Economy class, at least 29.2% of torres.
From April to June the prices for the Economy Class to average 12,5% compared to the previous quarter, however, in the business and first class, price changes were significantly lower.
In Germany the prices are more higher than in other European countries:
From January to March the prices increased at 11,9 per cent, in the second quarter they increased 23.6 per cent.
According to the study, the prices have even been half of the German internal flights.
The company explains that the price income is the following economic growth.
The demand is broken in many segments of the flight market.
On the other hand, the Open-Skies Agreement, which liberalizes the aircraft between the United States and Europe, is an increased pressure on competition.
Signs of the encouraging situation are the strike of unprofittable routes in airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had reported Conkurs in the first half of 2008 - only in Europe were these 24 airlines.
HSV suggests Gladbach 1:0
With a gate and simple methods, the Hamburger SV table leaders.
In the Borussia, Luhukay is not still trying to find a functioning one.

It'll be a birthday without real party.
"We know the order," said Marcell Jansen.
He believes that the tabler certificate is more for the incomparableness of the liga than for the dominance of his HSV.
The compliance with their late adjustments - the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the Town Protection Petric and the Jansen purchased by the FC Bayern - is still not slow, but it has not yet been slow.
"We need more flairs and more driplings," said Jol.

Dark Materie affects the airline of rooms
Since years, a mysterious phenomenon of swing-by-managers has been able to ensure that dark materials affect the speed of spaces during such a swing-by-manager.
Experts are afraid that the general relationship theory Albert Einsteins could not be very right.
Soon 18 years ago, the "Ulysses" space passed through the world space.
Because soon cold fuel drives are threatened to the kitchen death.
A mysterious phenomenon for confusion has been provided by scientists for years - the Swing-by-Annomy.
The Swing-by is a flightman from rooms where it receives additional slowness in the gravity of a sky body, around the earth.
This allows the samples to save much of the carriage.
The European American Research Center Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the sunson Ulysses.
However, the researchers have been surprised for years: the aircraft is not 100% as expected by the old gravity law.
Moreover, it comes to irregularities in the speed.
The sonders will be unexpectedly faster or slower.
For the time, the physicians could not explain this effect.
They made him a Swing-by-Anomy.
Some experts are afraid that even the general relative theory Albert Einsteins, which describes the proportional power of material by a struggle of the room, could not be completely right.
The American Physician Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Study from Princeton believes that Einstein did not ruin, and tries to explain the Swing-by-Anomy using the so-called dark materials that the astronomers have considered in the universe.
"Anomy could be a dark material that could also be near the earth, responsible for anonymation," he wrote.
From the existence of the dark materials, the world space researchers have only known for about ten years.
It is obviously a relationship power that allows to observe the effects of other heavenly bodies.
However, it is completely invisible, which means she sends and reflects no electronic magnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of the scientists, the dark material is a fifth of the entire mass of the universe.

Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and went back to Cornwall.
His finger went after Plymouth.
However, the Court found that Ms. Randle, who worked a large part of his time for the National Trust, was persecuted by the abuse that she had been added two times in the week.

British accommodation companies may be in the house after the savings of Bradford and Bingley Bank costs more than 80 million pounds.
The government provided 14 billion pounds available to protect the installations of Bradford & Bingleys 2.6 million customers.
The interests for this loan are paid by all companies receiving money from investors, including the 59 building companies
The Director-General of the Association of Communities of Apartments (BSA), Adrian Coles, said that it was "inevitably" that the companies and their members should pay.
The 14 billion loans will be finally paid if Bradford & Bingley's credits are paid.
However, the interim interest rates are calculated each year by 700 financial undertakings to accept payments.
The financial service compensation programme confirmed BBC that the 59 accommodation companies were included in this number.

It is worse that those institutions who have been carefully conducted during the real estate reserve are now calling some of the costs of those institutions, which were wisely less sensitive.
According to the BSA, no company has been completed since the existence of the registers in 1945.
"We will observe all aspects of this matter over the next weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from significant costs."
The interests that will be affected in 2009 shall cover the seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, interests will be made for a full year and it could almost be double.
Since companies are mutual organizations without corporates, their members shall be paid by higher costs or lower interests in spending accounts.

Ancient Prime Minister of Bangladesh is rewarded
A court in Bangladesh rejected a cup of the former Prime Minister Schach Hasina, which means that it could be arrested if it returns to the country.

We will register a complaint against the Supreme Court."
The applicants apply that they need a cotton to return from the foreign country to prepare for elections in December.

New investigation in the US state lawyers
The United States General Avocat has employed a special fleet to be sentenced by the accused of nine State lawyers in the United States in 2006.
The record was a report of the General Inspector of the Ministry of Justice, in which the acts of the administrative employees were criticized.
The report was critical to the officers of the knowledge house, lawyers and the former general lawyer Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation has been carried out by the fears that the lawyers have been excluded by political reasons.
The Special Marriagester Nora Tamehy should now clarify whether the officers held during the investigation have lied the investigators in order to defeat the justice.
In its report, the general Inspector Glenn Fine has not been completely investigated or completed.
One of his main recommendations was the profession of a special armor with the authority to force the Witnesses to speak.
The conflict began as the Ministry of Justice in December 2006 nine US lawyers from their employees enthob.
At that time, the Ministry argued that the State lawyers would be dealt with less working services.
However, later, it was found that the dismissed State lawyers were not worse than many of their colleagues, which many observers decided to consider the advertisements as a political motivation.

The meat Loafs epical song must be honored
The Rockstar Meat Loaf is to be honored during the music price "Q Award" for his epical hymne "Bat Out of Hell".
The song that will take his special gold price during the delivery in London next week, said he was honored to be acknowledged.
The song that lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds was the title room at Meat Loafs Hitalbum from 1977.
"Coldplay" means the names for price loan this year after it came into the closer selection in four categories.
The director of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said that there are some songs that are about materials like time and gene and "Bat Out of Hell" are certainly one of them.
The song that was sent by Jim Steinman required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It begins with a instrumental part that takes almost two minutes.
The song appeared as single in 1979 in Britain and has reached place 15 in the Chart.
However, Meat Loafs had spent about nine years in the Charts and sold over 40 million times in the world.
Meat Loaf, whose real name Marvin Lee Aday has suffered in serious health problems in recent years, including an operation in 2003 because of an irregular heart attack after he was struck on the bottle.
In 2007, he had to defeat the concerts because of an accurate cowboy confusion.
Later he was known that he had a cyste on his smile band.
Obscure streets in town, often forget and eventually sell
New York City has thousands of main roads, alone, page streets and other environmental roads, where some are famous and others are only well-known.
However, it is even difficult to say for experienced taxi drivers and long-year-old local accommodation where there is extra place, simply because most of them have never heard it.
This changing street is located in the East Village and passes from the First Street North Street between Bowery and Second Avenue, without reaching the Second Street.
It is bread and 120 feet long and looks more after a steel gas than after an active driveway.
There are no road switchs.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard distance plan.
However, this street has their admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a building company that recently built a luxurious building on the First Street.
It wants to create extra places to make a cleaner drive to the loads and bottles expected in the new buildings.
The long-year neighbors, who say she's fascinated by the short gas, just because she is one of the rest of the past of the house block.
However, the city management department responsible for the protection and establishment of the housing building and is responsible for the road is not interested in receiving them.
During a meeting of the Commonwealth Board's Committee for Land Landing Use in this month, representatives of the city management and Avalon Bay have designed a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
However, the Committee prefers that the road remains in the hands of the city, and asked a new plan to be presented in the next month, so Susan Stetzer, the district responsible in the Council 3.
"But very little room has remained in the possession of the city and we want to hear extra place still from the city," she said.
"It could give offers how to repair the road and work what could be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure that public access remains guaranteed."
Avalon Bay has announced a few months ago that makes the small street new pools and seats that are thought for a coffee, which would like to avoid the company's room.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the road was made public in this month for the first time.
Michele de Milly, a speaker from the Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the road, but it wouldn't like to have her.
"The main challenges of the Avalon Bay are to renew this fallen gas and to make it a public seat point," she said and added that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, speaker of the department for the protection of the building, had actually been the desire of the city to sell the street and emphasized the task of the department to develop the real estate than to be managed.
Comparison with his friendly neighbor The Bowery, Extra Place has maintained something from his historical impression.
Some believe that the street has obtained their name in 1802, when a large farm belonging to Philip Minthorne, distributed between his many children and a closer strike country was not called.
The door of the club CBGB, the Puncrockdenkmal, closed in 2006, opened to extra place and the street is mostly known for the photos on the cover of the album "Rocket to Russia" by Ramones.
The pflaster was great, said Danny Fields, the Manager of Ramones, who made the photo in November 1976.
The street was full of shoot, lumps and parts of fabrics, pools, feet and sleeves.
Some inhabitants, including the blogger, who writes about the genitalization of East Village, rejected the idea of the sale of Extra Place, with the argument that this public basement, as it is, must remain public.
Others have buried extra place as a rareness – a practically unchanged switch of the city that should be left in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who operates in the blog named "Jeremiah's missing New York" (subtitled "The Book of the Chronicle: A bitter Nostalgic view on the outer town), has published a part of the discussion of the city history of Extra Place that appeared in the magazine The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at that time: "Extra place is a small swimming gas that is even a dark day and is marked by disrupted metal doors of the lakes, closed windows and on rain swimming newspapers. "
With a few exceptions, the street has looked out soon at one night.
A Ratte passed through the back of the street, not far from the door that led to the CBGB before, where there is a sweet business today.
Graphites were to see on the walls and a empty beer flash on the ground was not far from a fresh swimming cluster of explanated newspapers.
Some passengers said they had thought rarely about the extra place, but they thought that the street could be shocked.
Fields added that, according to his opinion, some people undermine the journey of the road in their current condition.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the dark, hot, and excited places.
Debates on two language training: education in English environment
In this issue of "Education Watch" Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discussed the positions of the candidates for two language training.
Lance T. Izumi, leading scientific employees in California studies and director of educational science at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a composer of the book “No matter why the Mediterranean Class needs a school choice”.
Speaking to the Spanish electors is a complex task.
Barrack Obama's proposals on the subject of education are a typical example.
Obamas Election campaign mentioned that "the probability of the African and Spanish schools to successfully complete schools is lower than at white students" is true.
In order to close this performance, Obamas's educational plan, specifically, recommends a two-language transitional phase in training for those who are only learning English.
However, the question of Obama is whether its use for the two-language training, which is the main point of education in other languages, is contrary to its interest in reducing the distance in education.
Let's take, for example, "Sexth Street Prep", a basic school in the East Los Angeles.
Most students are Spanish and are from families with low income.
More than a third of the students who have been in the country have learned English.
However, in 2008, the surprising 100 percent of the fourth class students had the state test in Mathe at a good level.
Similarly, 93 per cent of the children from the fourth school year in the English test were well evaluated.
This surprising success has been achieved with other methods than those who are favoured by Obama.
The Sixth Street School provides its main point on review and training, on the steadfast control of knowledge and a standing that does not tolerate exceptions.
Furthermore, the school practices the approach to training in an English environment. That is the point to view Obama, so the school leader Linda Mikels.
This approach sets value to the almost exclusive use of the English language in special education.
Ms. Mikels, who rejects the idea of two language training, said to me that the school had a wonderful success with a student who had just come from Mexico before the first time. 12 months later, you would be involved in the classroom and can't recognise it again.
"It works", she noted, "it works for us."
Will Obama take a school like the "Sexth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with large parts of Latin America and other English students?
The performance of the school would facilitate the answer to this question, but the training policy positions within its own party (the national educational associations support the idea of two language training) and their own consequent support for the second language training predictions about Obama's response.
While he agreed to the point that immigrant should learn English, he recently trivialized the topic by noting that people should stop, worried about the legislation aimed at "Single English".
Instead, he said, "You must ensure that your child can be Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close the performance, he should take care of educational models that work instead of causing and trivialize them.
The oil price results in renewed fears for the economy
On Monday, because of the fears that even the American relief plan for financial markets could not be able to re-establish the economy.
The Roh oil finances at the New York Trade Offices have fallen up to $99.80 per barrel at the pre-session.

On Monday, investors have already shown concern, although they had announced the Congress Chairmans, they would have joined themselves on a saving plan that should be the largest in the story.
This message was overwhelmed by new concerns that the financial crisis has not yet been closed at any time.
In the first chapter of the growing crisis, a government communication on Monday is intended to purchase the wachovia Corporation bank business.
Interimly, Belgium, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have nationalized the European Financial Centres in part.
After analysis at Barclays Capital, it is apparently not possible to experience the stimulation of the markets, despite the negotiations that took place at the weekend.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, it is expected that the demand for goods, inter alia to oil, will continue to decline.
Analysts of the German Bank have written in a communication to investors that the prognoses for the global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have been indeed uncertain.
We believe they continue to write that the good markets will also be affected.
"Besides the prospect of the goods markets, most of us are worried about whether the US virus expands globally, especially to China."
The bank analysts have made their expectations for oil consumption due to the weak economic growth for the next year, and their prognoses for oil and gas price for 2009 are 20%.
In the second quarter of the series
Shaun Elis, defenseer, thought he had seen everything after he had been opened in the last eighteenth half years than everyone else in the Jet tricky.
Then on Sunday he saw the second fourth, in which the Jets converted a game without a result.
"I've never seen something like this," said Elise.
After a crazy game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinal, who had spoken to the bad weather, started the second fourth.
However, when the Quartereback Brett Favres Pass at Lavernues Coles for a 12-year-old touchdown, this marked the perfect attack to a afternoon on which their developed cooperation made an exhibition.
Favre found Coles in this neighborhood for more two touchdowns, which one time as an extra defender and the other 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
"I haven't particularly tried to try," Coles says about the breaks that went to Coles.
"He's a super player.
Our vote has voted, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles Fangen played, the defense Quartereback Kurt Warner took place.
Foreign Defenced Darrelle Revis started a lacking snake and transformed him into a 32-year touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and took him off.
Linebacker David Bowens then careed for a loss of warner.
The last ball loss, injured in Bowens, was probably the worst.
The cardinal had the ball with 10 seconds left in the game than the Jets turned back to the ball and Jay Feely converted a 20-year shooting to 34 to 0 drive.
These were most of the points that the Jet had ever achieved in a fourth.
When he was requested to describe the sense, Erik Mangini, the coach of the Jets "The second fourth or the third fourth?"
On the answers both, since the Jets left 21 points to be achieved without one single, Mangii said, "Crede me, I have met the second fourth more than the third.
A number of points have been achieved in short time."
Expeditional Gentlemanship slaughtered its world reorder
Haile Bergselasion from Ethiopia again showed why some of them keep him for the best long-term trailers of all times after he broke his own record on Sunday and became the first person who has done the route of 42.2 km in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flank course at 2:03:59, the Birthlassie improved his previous result from 2:04:26 by 27 seconds he had reached the last year in Berlin.
Burselassie, 35, has set up its 26th world record in his multi-scale career, where he has reached at least a world mastership statue to Marathon or has established a world record on each side of a kilometer to Marathon.
Last month the birth layout left the Olympic Marathon in Beijing, because of the fear that there may have been overwhelming in the afternoon that air pollution could deteriorate its asthma problems.
Instead, he has registered himself for the competition fight in Berlin.
In nearly ideal conditions - at the start of the sun and 9 degrees and 13 degrees at the target - he wins a medium speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per miles.
Since rail drivers such as Bergerlassie and Paul Tergat from Kenia have changed on long-term trails, the record time for Marathon in the past 10 years has fallen over 2 minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil in 1998 with the result 2:06:05 in Berlin.
After his victory on Sunday, he had informed the giant lance of the press, he had had powers in his car two weeks ago, so he couldn't train a week.
Obviously, he has been fresh after pause and not cut back.
"I'm so happy," he said to report.
"All have been perfect.
I took the training back a week ago and had some more concerns today, but at the end of everything super."
He was criticized, especially in Kenya, Ethiopian Rivales from East Africa, that he is extremely orchestrating his skins, a lot of the world's best marathon stars are generally meditate to the rail leaders as if it would be a train race, and the world's records over the swimming combat.
However, this criticism is little damaged by the dimension of the Bergerlassion as a long-term strike driver.
At Sunday, four Kenyanians reached the center of the trails at 1:02:04.
Two elite drivers from Kenia, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi continued to demand the Birthlassie after they left the timers.
Some more than three miles before the Finnish has made his last arrival to separate from Kwambai, which has arrived as the second in 2:05:36, so that his best time has improved nearly 5 minutes.
Kamathi was the third one in 2:07:48.
In women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kasachstan and now German, has finished a wonderful year by showing the seventh outcome of all times.
The world reorder of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Britain.
Last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She passed the games in Beijing, because of problems described as a retreat. However, she tried to win in Berlin and to improve its best time in her third marathon for five minutes.
She planned to run her way by making her a quarter from Ethiopians and Kenyan swimming up, but over 30 miles (30 km) after it.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia was second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenia was a third party in 2:25:01.
The pride and the trap in the life of the black population, in a city of the very special type
Hidden between the evacuations of the free-time parks in the around of Orlando, a few miles away from the swimming, sweet and giganic trails, is a peaceful city where the pride and the complications of African cultures come.
Eatonville, the first largely black city in the country and the home town Zora Neale Hurstons, is not more easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 seaes, three crowd places, 300 blue houses, 300 good beds, more than enough boards, 2 schools and no prison."
Today, it's a slipper place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee are coming to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to remember the most famous author of Harlem Renaissance.
And yet it is and remains the city that she describes – and she made it to a tourist flow by taking it to the Florida travel leader that was produced at the time of the depression of the Federal Officer project – in many senses a place of the entirely special species.
Eatonville is so independent and private as in the 1930s, as Hurston wrote that rural black communities often refused to share their real thoughts with the wise man, "as little as he knew about us that he didn't know what he was doing".
Even today, in a year in which Senator Barack Obama, a black president, Senator Obama, calls for an open conversation on racial relations, there are still many regrets to be observed by outsidesectors.
"We are very thinking about how our history is told," says Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a inhabitants of the city and community member of the oldest church of the city.
It must vote."
Eatonville has been defined for a long time as paradox of the Triumphe and the fight.
It is both a historical example of black movement and a community of almost 2.400 inhabitants in which the poverty rate is double as the country average.
It is one of the tops of literature and, on the other hand, an example of - sometimes condemned, sometimes - the black culture of the rural southern, which has their roots in the American slavery.
It's not surprising that people here are both proud and on the hair.
And so correctly the concerns about Eatonville's image actually began with Zora, as all Hurston were called here.
She introduced their hometown in books that came from hearts and were written in mouth like "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida travel leader changed the city close to the 77th road, a street leading through the often forgotten central Floridas to the shoots of black history and human drama.
As well as Oscar in real life as in literature, Hurston led to the load of Eatonville's first citizen master, Joe Clarke, and then moved to more private affairs.
"Besides the road to the left," she wrote, "the green-wheeled modern schools, with their buried gardens and playing places to care for the Howard Millennium, although he can read and write."
She also mentioned the new man of Witwe Dash, and wrote that Lee Glenn "sell sales any kind and pass to hours rooms."
In few hundred words, Hurston thus brought Eatonville to self-government, but also with analphabetism, second marriage and sex.
This was certainly not a travel leader.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was estimated by all.
"Zora described the things as they were," said the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls, flew the Hurston, sitting the men who read the songs about their beauty, which were full of sexual reactions.
She added, "A few people do not like this."
You still remember Hurtson as a living expert, who returned regularly after their family was taken to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that, when Hurston was burned into the city, she often did this without warning, in a smooth chevrolet, smoking and waiting for hosen, in a city, the same has become some of its honourable clothing style today.
According to Mr Franklin, most of the inhabitants were fascinated, but many of them were viewed.
"The people were always happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But "they never remained too long," he added while he looked in his store, on a terrace which looks at the Sabelia Lake, in the Hurston all likely to be baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and engaged in her books.
With the majority of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was a famous author, a timegeist Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at the Barnard College in the 1920s, she was in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived in an anonymous Grab.
In Eatonville, there was no big memories, no public readings in great style.
"I don't think they have understood their contribution in the world or heritage in the most lowest", says Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography on Hurston was published in 2003.
The wine came in the 80s.
Orange Council authorities wanted to put a five-pure car trains through the city to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the long two-pure main roads of the community.
Orlandos Vortees had already been traced by the western city border.
The proposal was submitted when Eatonville was still repeated from a difficult stage in his history.
The relatively idyllical isolation of the community, inter alia, had ended.
In the 50s, the fight against racial disappearance of Hass took place in the Community.
"In that time, a shock of white boys came, and they were shocked people and witnessed on the side sit," said Mr. Franklin.
"There was even a woman killed there.
They stood a water meal out of the car."
In 1955, Hurston asked in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel to impose the demand of the Supreme Court of Justice to integrate its decision in the case of Brown against the School Council as "political instead of my race".
People today say that even though the raising of race was positive in some aspects, she weakened the group assembly in Eatonville and the self-consciousness of his young people.
"Shere children were able to be disappointed - I remembered of it - they stripped his teachers in the morning and were slaughtered his teachers on the night," says N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and the leading director of the public group for the protection of the Eatonville Community.
This could be obtained so long, and it was added to them until teachers and students came out of the same place.
"There wasn't his white teacher, because he was a white teacher - I think there's a cultural club", said Ms. Nathiri.
However, citizen rights have contributed to the creation of a place for another Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, artists and artists who moved on to predicts, as they did, with positive self-consciousness and talks like: "Whyever can reject the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker made the way to Hurston's unnamed Grab and began to fight for the renewal of her spirit.
Five years later, Robert E. Hemenway was to find a lot of magnificent Hurston biography in the book records, and made it again part of the American literature channel.
The television project came exactly at a time when the famous daughter of Eatonville was once again in the light of publicity.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw them as a rescue.
The community began in 1988 with planning a Hurston Festival to show what the district could destroy the construction of the bus.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return to the party.
A few years later, the district turned away from his road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-pure television trails the city, accelerated the whole with speed speed, shooted real citizen slow," said Ms. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd said something more easyer: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the television project has contributed to a change in the self-image of the city.
There were more attractions, as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who went to the church since 1993, and the inhabitants began to recognise the past.
Eatonville was registered in 1998 in the country-wide historic record.
A new smuggling library (notably called for Hurston) opened in 2006 on the renewed and excited Kennedy Boulevard.
Today Eatonville is like a speciality in Florida: only 6 miles from the city centre Orlandos may sometimes feel like a winter in the summer rain as small as it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(He is today at 90% black.)
Foreigners on the search for the history of Eatonvilles and its importance are still being treated with care.
For most interviews, a approval is needed in the preceding area and certain things - as the wall of the old church of Eatonville, which was covered by a knowledge and represents black men in the field work - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs. Jones, a courageous, self-conscious teacher with a favorite for dark red, still fear that her disagreement will be misunderstanding.
And yet, at the same time to which the Hurston Festival was greater, there was also a increased degree of homestolz.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw their whole race: beautiful, with all its problems, nor worse or better and exactly proud, creative and flexibility, albern and sweet as any other group of races and people in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that you can hear in the voice of Mr Franklin's Neffen, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who is ready to return to Eatonville, to work in the city management or to the police, who could use some help.
And even the students, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11 years of winter park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"The majority of the people who walk here will be thinking, "Ah, this city is nothing compared to all the others," said Alondra Kenon newly at a Sunday after the church.
"But if you really stop and look at his story for a moment, it's a very beautiful city."
Here we are in New York to talk to a fluctuous financial lady.
At the first time, nothing changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were closed from the newspapers and the violent television screens in the Times Square, they wouldn't even notice that they are in a debacle.
They would never believe that on their heads, in the shooting offices with the glassfassades, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the Monopol in New York, they have the worst horror day since the office in 1929.
The delivery continues to shoot the metallular teeth along the citizens and transported tablets that are shocked with muffins for breakfast meetings.
Latinos are still clinging between the apartments, as human patches are struck with the 50 shirts shirts that spend on a joch-year stage on their shoes.
The officers are still waiting for the citizens' foods on their breakfast bag and it is still unable to receive a yellow taxi at one week between 16 and 19 hours.
It wasn't feeling like a crisis until I decided to open a new sport account after Thursday afternoon.
Although I decided to put my duty temporaryly on my JP Morgan Chase stammfiliales in my JP Chase, about 20 people were sweet.
Not to the money switchers to spend or pay money, but to the customer service switch scheck books where steelers are ordered, to ask tourists on the path to Macy's shopping house and to open new customers accounts.
The majority before me, so later I learned from Starr, my "private banking officers with license" were on the same basis as I sweet.
in contrast to me, however, they had already taken their part of smaller banks to places where they were pending, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and State Island.
They had the money of such trifts (unlike a few of the building parking), the company banks and the local sparcase that had only been in a state of filial, and said they treat their customers as a family.
In the last year, 15 of these banks were still and left.
In the past few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion, a competitive management, and as a read freeday of New York over weekend to home, was Wachovia, another bank with $440 billion, on the search for a saving buyer.
In the fear of another invasion, the officers and ladden officers brought before me their bars to a bank that was seen as a safe port, a bank responsible for most of the savings purchases at Wall Street.
The entire normal New Yorker has been able to fly in the last few weeks.
A woman who has been phoned in my Chinese sugar market, took so much confidence to Lehman Brothers, the pleite bank and whose apparent chairman Dick Fuld, as she would spend over a false colleague.
And Lyn, who has been uniformized for the 50-year-old concierge of my living blocks, has come from our usual entertainment topics on Brad and Angelina and my food supply.
"I have now all my loans in money market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not going to get any more risk."
Muslim buildings stolen during the legal rush in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, an austrian freedom party of Austria, and Philip Dewinter, member of the Belgian Rights Pertei Vlaams, took part in a demonstration in Antwerpen on Thursday 17 January 2008, to represent the organization 'Cities against Islamization'.
They take switch in the style of transport marks on which a mosque is formed, crossed with a red line.
The police condemns the law extremists of the decrease in a Muslim Friedhof in Austria, which represents significant wins at the extremely right party's election of the country at the same weekend.
Tonight of Friday on Tuesday, more than 90 guests on the Friedhof at Traun at Linz were seriously damaged in a police, according to the organizational action.
The murders expressed Jewish symbols such as the David stars on some of the farmers, but criminal officials keep this to try to spend the motivation of the extremists conducted by the Hass on Muslim Immigrants.
It is not clear whether the case is in any way connected to the elections.
A speaker of the local Islamic Community said they were "the most shocked" about the message of the graffiti that took place as the religious month of the Muslim Ramadans to the end.
At the same time, in Austria, a round conscience investigation is taken after the country was cut right in the strict parliamentary election.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, which two largely directed parties, almost 30% of the votes, took place in their election campaign for a strict anti-immigrant law, and some of their elections were criticized by the enemy as a foreign feminine.
Heinz-Cristian Strache, Chairman of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the voices, took place for a ban of heads and Burkas, and even reported his condemnation against foods that are generally linked to Islam.
In his last association in Vienna, he spoke of a 'European Brothership' to prevent Islam' growth.
Both parties want to prohibit the construction of Moscows and Minorists with the argument that these political symbols are a continuing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Investigations and analysis that were carried out directly after the election and indicated that the extreme rights of the politically strongest block in the country indicated that this new development is based on young elections that are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign Traveller for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the Glam-Rock star sentenced by the sexual abuse of children, was legally undermined to travel to France and Spain.
Judges took a sixth spectrum after he informed the controlling authorities about it, he wanted to travel through France to Spain.
The police in Kent was granted the last Thursday to spend a foreign slaughter after she presented the proof of the complainant for the punishment of detention because of the sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, the right name Paul Gadd, was not attended by the Ashford Officer in Kent, but was represented by the lawyer Corker Binning.
EIn speaker of the Court of Justice, "On Thursday, 25 September, the police requested Kent at the Office of Ashford to prevent foreign travels from Mr Paul Glad to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not personal."
As required by the Register for Sexual Criminals, Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he would want to travel to the Foreign.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel to foreign for more than three days.
He must also report the police seven days before his planned departure.
The advertising of the authorities may lead to a prison penalty of five years.
The police in Kent said she would not discuss any cases or pieces of residence in the country.
A speaker of Kent Police Unit said, "The police in Kent will do everything to protect children in this country and in the foreign."
"We believe it is easy to control someone in the United Kingdom because we have a comprehensive system to prevent effectively any potential risk."
"It is a higher concern for the police in Kent to protect the people of Kent and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sexual offenders in the country, to minimise any risk that could exist for the population.
Letter returned the last month to the United Kingdom after he was 27 months in a Vietnamian prison for abusing of 2 girls in age of 10 and 11 years.

But he said he wasn't feeling good and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not leave him through the pass control, and he traveled to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to go and return to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officers came to return to Britain.
Finally, on 22 August, he came to Heathrow at Heathrow at Heathrow on 22 August and stayed there during his lawyer David Corker to the office of Uxbridge in West-London, as Scotland Yard successfully asked for approval, to ask him to register as sexual criminals.

'I receive the master behind the bridge to keep his characters', shoes Brauer, photograph.
No paragraphs, no shoes, no costims for the arrival.
The nature of the large flamencotangents who refuse to concentrate and spend the interpretation in order to obtain a disappointed appearance as a woman or man.
One of the artists
Otherwise, personality
I see in private lives, in these moments that are for the public alien, I know when I can find for the typical bees, the depth of a stealed eyes or expressions of the hands that are concerned because they are not involved in the blues.
In his ‘Flamenco-people’ project, the German photograph Suter Bauers is a changing theatrical theatrical of some incentives on the bridge with songs, dancers and guitarists. From this page he was still a little known for the artists.
With this proposal, the photograph creates a special ionography of flamencodification at different levels.
The exhibition that belongs to the program of the month of photography of the Flamenco, 'exhibits the international importance of Flamenco, which is always greater from the day to day', explains the artist and clearly makes that 'Flamenco-people' can be every person like, but when you look at the photos, the viewer notes that there are no typical images of artists on the bridge.
All the normal people on the port are artists who are in a position to meditate on the painful suffering, joy, and thus move the public.
In order to maintain the personality of these artists, you must not make photos on the bridge.
Your personality and character is in their hearts.
What was interested to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to keep the characters of the largest flamencies committees with the camera.
Bauer, inspired by the Festival 'Cante de las Minas', made a long journey in 1997 to play songs, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, images emerged to remember the classic photography.
The application of various styleistic means destroys the classic basis of the image, by the image the modernity and the idea, as the Flamenco builder understands, is: `Music with traditional roots that change and surprise each day'.
It is not just the dance, the instrument game or the instrument game, but the personality of the artist, his character, who flows with his art the public.
The search for the essential thing, after a certain thing that is visible in the form of his ear, was and was the fixed goal of this work that is presented in the galerie of El Fotomata in the next time.
Announced personalities in Flamenco, including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others belong to the close selection of almost seventy artists that were photographed.
The project has become anthology of the flamencos and will soon appear as a book, with all ports from the exhibition.
Bauer's suffering to the portrait led him to take this idea again two years ago and to implement as a 'port portrait of the sports' (‘sportART Project’).
Although the concepts of the ‘Flamenco-people’ project are different, the photograph is very likely to picture the people, to learn to know them and to spend me in their life condition, is it for a short moment or a longer time.
I think the portrait is the most difficult one in photographing.
You smell or smell people, personalities that you sometimes don't know, or they leave you alone for a couple minutes to make a photo.
Unlike these circumstances, I always try to realize my ideas."
The collection of the ports of the Flamencos from today with the title 'Flamenco-people' is located in the galerie of El Fotomata, which is located in the street with the name la rue de la Mata and passes parallel to the street la Alameda de Hercules. The exhibition can be viewed until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa believes that the Rome, which he just writes, is "toll curiosity".
He doesn't even know where the action of the Romans is and what it is, but Mario Vargas Llosa tried to extend the project he worked right now, a Roman with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and went to the Amazon area.
Last night, while his presence on the Ha Hay Festival Segovia, the favorite Nobel Prizes gave to the project with which he is “a toll curiosity” and ‘all knows that he should not write to the Roman’.
"If I would be struggled, I wouldn't do it, but I'll do it and hope to end the Roman, so he closed his participation in the festival where the ideas, thoughts and words were discovered. In the four days he saw hundreds of writers, historicals, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of 'La City y los perros' was one of the most beautiful personalities on the third festival and made prognosis.
Vargas Llosa, who wins the festival of Hai Festival, which most of the presents make their voice, is compared with the old output of 'Our mutual friend' and is seeing in the theatre Juan Bravo.
He was presented by Félix Romeo and noted that he had a public before himself that was not given enough time to continue to: how his profession was made to the literature, which was ‘excellently absent’, of ‘life in reading’ and ‘more experiences, as he wrote and ‘disciplins’, to complement his career of inspiration’, to complement his intensive work with documentation, a multitude of corruption and processing, and to make the factors like Vulk and Alegogan’; as he writes and ‘disciplins true’, to complement his ‘discipline missing of inspiration’, to complement his intensive work with documentation, a number of corrections and overviews.
The Spanish American Romanian writer emphasized that there is “no way of life” what you can measure and where you can know whether books change the life,” but I refuse to believe that the literature is a pure entertainment, a flight experience”, emphasized Vargas Llosa, who said that it is ‘the effects’ and ‘the people are more out of each other’ because I asked the writer ‘I do not leave the light’ and ‘the responsibilities’ for his professionality.
At the festival in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play with: Strift feasts cut partly.
After the announced steel fighters found that the ground of the place was in bad condition, the slaughter bathtub was entered on the morning after which the Festival in Pozoblanco was completed.
Thus the event has decided to move the fighter with understanding of Ferdinand Bohórquez, Paul Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández.
Thus, the festivity of the inconsistent warning was deleted, for two of three partys couldn't be held.
On Saturday, it was not possible to celebrate the second seat fight.
The maturity group was taken from José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, which were after and taken by and after.
So it was just a party on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luke, who cut three ears and triumphated after which he left the path with joy and aesthetics.
At the same evening, Alejandro Talavante met two ears and one of the ears, which made him more by gallopiers than by his warfare.
And even worse was El Juli, who continued by the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without the spirit.
After he had been so badly fighting, a majority of the public reacted in his second fight with Buh-Rubs.
In Alava, two persons wanted to get out of their car control, which was struck with two thousand kilos of Hashish.
Morning: five minutes ago ten.
Transport controls in Ertza, in the urban area of Armenian (Alava).
Two police officers requested the car drivers to stop where they were taking the flight.
It looked like she should not stop with the load of more than two thousand kilos of hasch.
The police persecuted her and took one of the drivers who was 28 years old, known as A.A.J., how it was informed by the National Ministry of Basken State.
The arrested person was accused of official documents because of drug trafficking and dealing with drugs.
The case was that the transport police officers of the Alava region had already completed transport controls on the N-1 and ended through the town area of Armenians.
They decided to keep a car to perform the route controls. The driver did not follow the instructions, soon increased the speed and tried to delay the control.
The police began persecution until the car reached a few kilometers away from the border. In that moment, the drivers moved out of the car to fly through a landstretch to a forest area.
The police of the city of Ertza finally took one of the pains. In the car, a Iveco Daily, the drug chairs transported 2,178 kg Haschsch, who was invited by the police.
The prior part of the car was shocked with hash kitchens, which later were conducted to the specific laboratory analysis and to decline the band to other police services.
The officers also found that the sign "doppelt" was so that it was not matched with the signs specified in the Kfz paps, and that further, a detention was taken due to the expiration of official documents.
The police of the city of Ertza continues to investigate the detention of the second suspect, which, as already mentioned, could run, but also to determine the origin of the invited drugs.
The 28-year-old A.A. J. was sent to a police office, which will be sent to the detention director in the next hour.
Shooters Heather Lockler were arrested because of the driving under the effect of unknown medicine.
The artist Heather Locklear, known by the role of the Amanda from the "Merrose Place" series, was established at this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) because of the drive under the effect of an unknown medicine.
One Witness has observed how she tried to go in a strange way from their parking in Montecito, reporting speakers of the transport police from California to the Magazine 'People'.
The Witness reported details that Locklear had been pressed at 16:30 a.m. and made much laugh by trying to move her car down or forward from the park, and when she turned back, she took a few times at her sun bridge.
Sometimes the Witness, who first had not probably known that Locklear came on a close street and increased the car.
The Witness was the person who deserved the emergency, because she was ‘the fear of the locklers’.
When the police forces arrived, they found the shooters in their car, who wanted to stand on the road and block the transport.
'It seems to be indirect', because they needed the police in a special drug and alcohol centre to make a test.
According to a police speaker, the shooting players had been excluded by the first moment. 'The first observations of the officials were to follow, we believe that Lockler was under the influence of an unknown medicine', as the speaker.
Locklear was arrested under the suspect of conducting an uncertain substance that could not be determined and enforced in a local investigation against 19.00 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was decided after treatment from the clinic in Arizona where it was treated against fear and depression.
Llamazares is responsible for the case of Silva, the Analous Association of the United Nations Links.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and the members of the United Nations, has now assured that the regional association will be the one who will be the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sport House in Sevilla, Francisco Manuel Silva, which was returned to the week after he was accused of making business with family members.
'In such cases, I am a large federalist, and the adalous organization will be the one who must take the responsibility to take,' Llamazares indicates what action the party must have to be against, which is until now as a city council in the Joint Council of Sevilla.
Nevertheless, the Chairman of the VL defended the need for transparency in the possible investigations of the regular distortions that Silva could have started: ‘The VL always found that such cases were the maximum transparency’.
With regard to this theme, he stressed that the education is “a stronger ethical codex for all public employees”.
‘Sangre de Mayo’: Herdbook of Garci
Inspirited by 'Episodios Nationales' by Benito Perez Galdoos, José Luis Carci in 'Sangre de Mayo' is the revised version of the famous state of Spain against the Frenchs. This is a surprising film in the film, with approximately 15 million euro investments for the drug work.
In this way, the Cineast has tried to ‘a quantity of personalities and social analysis’, which he always admired the works of the famous Romanist, explained today Carci at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long directory of the donors.
'Sangre de Mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, this Friday in Kinos is presented and later showed on the telemadrid as a fourth ministerial.
José Luis Garci, the great fan of the literature of Galdoos, ensures that it was completed by its ‘Kindnessstraum’, which he had to thank Esperanza Aguirre, who had been able to turn a film to the second century in Madrid, and especially because the history was based on the basis of 'Episodios Nationales' three years ago, he took the task.
The total amount of 15 million, which was set by the Autonome Community Madrid for Drehwork, offers Garci, as he added, the 'excellent possibility' with the help of decorations and suitable clothes, the image of the 'concerned Spain, which was examining the false leader for the fighting, because the people had been resigned through the fight for independence and under the rule of the Federation of VII.'
However, the Chinese regrets that you could not recall with the financing such as ‘Alatrist’ or ‘Los fantasmas de Goya’ (seven times as at ‘Sangre de Mayo’), so some scenes from the Drehbook with the Horacio Valcarcel, who worked almost all his carriage.
For this reason, Garci, who had also been the film director in ‘Volver a begin’, was involved by his usual way of work: he was put on the shoes to the players with which you should first try to turn before starting and for those who did not have caught, appeared to be "motive" and respected, "a part of the work of the film director is to provide assistance in the theater and in the cineater to know what in the cine industry where you are working".
Many offerers on which he is in 'Sangre de Mayo' have to repeat before his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar Candidate in four names (of which he won one), is the opinion and assured that no one of the three candidates representing Spain's Academy of Hollywood is a young generation of Spanish film graphics. Neither ‘Sangre de Mayo’, nor ‘Sangre de Mayo’, nor ‘See meases of billar French’ and finally not the selected film ‘Los turnassos ciegos’.
For this movie, Garci doesn't expect signs.
'After you think you're working for the birthday, then you notice that it's only a reward, and now you're satisfied when you're still produced a film,' Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional activity.
Isabel Bayon calls the memory to the dance from Sevilla Tórtola Valencia
A flamen cottage from Sevilla is a shower that also stands from Sevilla.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalane (Furrence Tortola Ferrari) and the mother of Andalusirin (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), which was born in the fourth triana, and when she was three years old, her family was killed to London.
She was a dancer and experts for Eastern dancers.
She had a huge life, she was one of the first fighters for the emmancipation of the woman, such as Isaac Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was buddhist, vegetarine, and put himself for the decrease of the corset, which limited the free women's movement.
The life of this woman, who has left her scenes at the Dance and Ethics Revolution in Europe during the time between wars, was fascinated by Isabel Bayon.
'I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this role to me what was impossible.'
'We do not try to tell her life to keep their spring,' said the flamen cottagin.
Your dance bases have helped me in Flamenco.
'The dance of the smetterling' came to me, for example, as Guajira, or 'the dance of the slange' like Tango.
Their dancing was sensitive, and I was said that my dancing are also in this athetic area, she says.
The incentive is calculated with two extraordinary cooperations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing for Isabel again in one of his ideas, how he also did it in ‘La door open’; and with Flamenco Meester Matilde Coral, who wanted to work together with one of her former schools.
'Matilde plays Tortola, a very ridicule personality.
I am happy because she agreed to work on my work, and I feel very honored."
The incentive is also calculated by the musical composition and the guitarists of Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the sense of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, and the Viola of Rafa el Viola and the cooperation with the artist Juanfra Júarez, and he ‘preachs the role of the artists who were Divas, in which he always loved himself.’
In this work, it is also mentioned in a specific way of this woman's life, which has been known in so far places as India, the United States or Russia and also in Europe, although she normally lived in London.
'I wanted to call her back in memory, 'for I think she is one of the women who have a huge influence on a certain era and their works today no more and that is why they are still less valued,' says Bayon.
The idea is placed at 20:30 in the Lope de Vega theater.
The publication of the book 'Diario de a poeta new housedo' also encloses the triennium.
The presentation of the first illustrated version of 'Diario de un poeta recién casado' in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez was married 1916 Zenobia, offers an appropriate atmosphere to celebrate activities planned under the Analusian Council for Cultura, to celebrate the 'Triennium of Zenovia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). The purpose is to remember the fifty-first jubilea of the literature prices and deaths of the two.
So ‘the Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón’ is closed with the new publication of this work, with the international congress in New York, with the restoration of the home museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia, and with the exhibition 'Juan Ramón Jiménez: ‘The chopo de Light’, which was opened in May and which they were in different places in Andalusia, now reached New York and was presented in the loop of the international conference.
The Italian Council for Cultura has also received aththundert Exemplare of `Diario de un poeta recién homedo', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The goal is to make the person and work of the Analusian world shower.
The United States can feel bad without Paul Newman
'A sometimes, God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them."
This sentence is from the Sally Field, who cooperated with him in the 'Senssion Reporter', and from the then dominant concept of the American cinema, which was left in the stage, came from the whole America to Newman with his enthusiasting view and followed.
Look at what she costs to give him the Oscar.
And when he went back in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
However, it was a great blame for everyone.
'What sometimes feels, is essentially more than a expression, and now I have lost a great friend', said Robert Redford shouted, 'My life and my country were the greatest degrees of his life'.
No one had no fear to make himself laugh, nor to overcome.
As a ‘pater’ of the cinema and paused country, he died in a tragic moment, in the fear of terrorists and the market adjustment, in which the unexpected self-value feeling of the United States in the unexpected search for reasons for resurrection.
If there are only few people who can be surprised in this hard time, you must not be Lu's cernuda indefinitely to love Paul Newman.
For all he was almost a platonic idea of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and experienced both various losses and profits: from the Foundation which wrote the fight against the drugs and to honor his son from the first marriage who died at overdosis, he was established to the own brand of household and organic products.
This is all a gift for the country where it costs much effort to pursue a mortal food culture.
A wide wave of the surprising suggests that the Hollywood is well-being without taking into account nationalities and citizenship.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, confirmed that it was not just a man who died, but the whole era.
The English Sam Mendes, director of the film and Oscar Prize, said that the work with Newman was no longer or not less than his career.
Russell Crowe, the wicked boy who came from Australia, waved to describe Newman as his greatest inspiration.
'We have left the biggest from us all', said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who are trusting to live today, as Paul Newman lived: high demands for justice, a responsible private life, which leads away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even impossible in the current medication.
But there's someone who tried it, and Paul Newman was an example.
He was married to Joanne Woodward, who was faithful, even though there were certainly many opportunities to be not.
"What should I eat a Hamburger on the street when I have home filets?" he shouted often.
In the heavens he will be proud that his daughters have the same view as his fans, which is not normal in America.
'For all the great roles he played, he was not so proud of the faithful marriage, the loved Father, the observed Opas and the Philanthrop,' they say.
For the Olympic Games, the streets in Madrid are missing.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to organize some of the olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the slaughter for 2012, may be 2016.
But I ask me, ‘Do we prepare this?’
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say that it is not true!
She was called as a perfect road, and according to my assessment, she was the worst street with all drunk and drunk that it was.
Of course, it's a lot of disagreement if you look at the evaluation and I could check it, that would not be so obvious.
But, let's go from the beginning.
The instinct starts with the tickets that allows you to go first.
It doesn't seem to be bad, but if they let you go, then they should give you everything (including chip to avoid the stage on the street).
So don't.
Here they let you take the ticket (the first intelligence that consists of it only because to go there) and (only after an infinite waiting speed) there's the surprise! The T-shirt only gave it in the size 'S' (a second intuition because I need the XL size)
Where do we actually live?
Or is it that after the crisis only was decided to purchase smaller, more bill hairs from less substance?
Well, things like these are a little in comparison with the days on the street.
Unlike you have to go very early to take the chip, there's a waiting speed of at least 15 minutes and, moreover, you have to leave the smoke.
The waiting has longed more than 35 minutes, as in the case of a road where 110,000 people are expected, is unreasonable.
Finally, as it was expected, the street started and we had not left our back box, even though it was slowly, but it would be more difficult to get back.
Furthermore, in these 40 minutes waiting for rain, so that it came to the attempt to organize a people's resort and overcome the rain.
I think that the morning will certainly have some 500 people of the skin and some like me will be because of this chip I have received, not to appear at the time when the classification is classified, I can already think that the start was wrong.
Of course, if you would ask me after a perfect road, this street would never attack me.
So I think we're gonna have a long dream of a city that is well prepared for the Olympic games
Microsoft on search for a (virtual) receptionist
At the ‘Emerging Technology Conference’, organized by MIT, Microsoft has presented the progress of the new image recognition system and human interaction, a kind of artistic intelligence without much intellectuality, but which is able to carry out some primitive tasks, such as a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, it is a route plan to move on the company's camp). The system takes note of what it listens during the entrepreneurship.
Thanks to a camera and a form and face recognition system, this 'receptionist' can recognize how many people are in the room, who are they and even remembering how they were expected, it can listen and understand the key words of their entertainment.
It is also possible to order the attendants to the groups after the meetings.
In the presentation video, 'the receptionist' notes a third person, but she understands that this person is not belonging to the group that leads to her conversation, and that there is no company advisor.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and answer that he's going to hear it soon.
All without the blue screenshot
Impressed
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things that can focus it, for example, on the next version of its operational system Windows.
This week, we were very overwhelming about the Microsoft's strategy exchange.
Windows 7 will be faster and do not have so many integrated programs.
Steve Balmer noted that if the computers would be equipped with the most necessary, instead of fifty-commerce, they would work more faster than five times.
Everything is only a determination when you remember that Microsoft was added one or another function and 'Extra' in Windows versions.
The direction change is rejoicable.
Microsoft has the right, the operational system loses its importance as well as the software.
When Google Chrom appeared in the network, it was part of the theory that it was the first step of Google to competite with Windows.
Sends many suggest that the browser is not an operational system.
The operating system, as an unreliable part, will always be necessary so that hardware and software can operate simultaneously.
The operational system meets the function that can be compared with the function of his wife or husband when it is about to report something to his mother.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but you need to think on your 'Tod', not as an absolute, but as relative truth.
What Balmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People give less attention to the operational system every time, so more to the web browser.
The computer is just starting to execute the Firefox, the Explorer or Chrom and we carry more time every day on the surf, than in the area of the 'window'.
What is the half of the available applications in the computer?
Reverse is more
And Windows 7 must be compacter, much more compact than Vista.
Easy, not overcome, less complex.
The interest of Microsofts is more to integrate its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In fact, they need this, without doubt, and I bring a small example to this.
The photo of this place I made in Redmond, in one of the reception spaces for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
On the refrigerator automate, a switch is confirmed: 'Your search. Our future'. It presss a switch for use of your online search tool.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of the employees at Microsoft, Google used for searching in the network.
Moreover, last week was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not begin but appear at the end of 2009, before 2010.
Microsoft seeks the possibility to put Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 simultaneously on the brand.
Every day the phone becomes a computer.
Android and iPhone are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
The Fabuleux Marcel
Paul Picasso had it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in 'Blood Diamond' of Edward Zwick, just as Al Pacino in "The Pate" of Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it belongs to the clothing of a good-building painter.
When we started to tell the innumerable Stars adventures, we can return to the image of a very powerful man, with a split bart, which had been higher in a wall circle weight.
On the basis, this is a typical man-t-shirt of tree cotton, unclean and smooth.
The English languages call it “tank”. Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Brussels, however, refers to all other brands.
First of all, because of its great name, although it is called 'Marcel' in the closest circle. The legends report that the names are connected to sport and by the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the favorite editor Edith Piaf.
The ‘La Marcel’ refers to all because of its wonderful tree coal, because of its distinct Unisex speed and is marked by a small Belgian fahne (as recognisable) which have this T-shirts as details on the hill.
And attention, the Belgian company concentrates not only on the production of 'tanks'.
You also have College Sweatshirts, Boxer Retro, Cardinal and Cashmirs, Hospital Holes, T-shirts with strips, babies, Mini Shorts
Modeled and convenient subways.
However, it is very harmful to use it as sub-adjustment.
You're very excited.
"I want to be a young mother, I don't worry about the candidate."
Her great presence with her sister did not stop developing her own personality.
Monique Cruz is awesome but full of life joy.
Today, the sisters Gruz takes their new activity in the mode very serious.
For Monica, it means more than for some nice and rich girls that keep their call.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the company Mango, where she was located and also the representation of the most important premiums in the Spanish mode that sponsors the Spanish Model House.
Blessed and protected, winners on the short roads.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this original/Winter season, which my sister Penelope and I have designed for Mango, and also I visited the presentation of the second version of 'Mango Fashion Awards' and took part in the dinner at Valentinos Ehre.
A very intensive working time that is simultaneously surprising.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, as well as I'm fascinated from the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
In the meantime, I'm going through a city and watching women, how they are pretty, how they combine their clothes, which I often do.
You're a very wide woman, aren't you?
I believe, but finally, everything is in one and these areas has many communities.
Since I was small, I was sweet from the clothing; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to select my teeth's clothing limits and to see their clothes.
It was super, almost better than going to a free-time park.
Soon, as a dance, I always tried to take care of the clothes.
You know, we can dance so much that we can have our own style in teaching and in the samples, to look at the Spiegel and feel good about it.
As a shooter, if you get the cost, you're turning into the real spectacle role.
Finally, everything will be connected to each other, it is so much respect for the cost designers and their professionality.
You've been 30 years ago, you didn't lose a crisis?
Oh, that's it.
I feel better than you, as a 30-year-old, I feel good.
I think the woman will be rife, have experience and can enjoy life with less errors.
I'm not afraid of my biological hour.
I wanted to do the things I've done since I was small, and that gave me a lot of joy.
So you think you're going to be a mother, right?
Since long time I know that I'm going to be a mother, because this requires my body and also I want to be a young mother; that's not gonna let me get away.
With regard to the candidate, I'm not worried about it.
I will communicate my child with great happiness and learn it with love.
With regard to the film art, you're looking at the work that you've participated and rounded the last year.
That is, and I want to very much to be presented by the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theatre, is very pacience and disappointed, and I want to have everything to do, of course not soon.
I very wish that 'The last hour' and 'In search for the tumba of Christ' will be recorded first time.
See how they got you
A couple of days ago, you looked at Naomi Campbell's turning up with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's okay, don't say that.
It's not so that I went to the start to model.
Naomi Campbell, who I have known for a few years, has just called me and invited me to London to make a paradise for the well-being event of her organization 'Women for a better world' and the clothing we show. I know that two clothings from our college for Mango were increased to collect the money for Naomis NGO.
People don't know Naomis's good heart.
There's a lot of things about them, and I'd like those who she knows would tell you that they don't agree.
However, I will support this good thing in which she is involved.
She asked me to participate in the parade for this great thing, but when she comes and asks me to make a manner, I'll also do it.
In order to support women in the third world, what is also necessary.
The car drivers that can be deteriorated because of the alcohol level are required to install the 'alcolock'.
The Authority states that the driver who had three official punishment because of the alcohol level has installed in his car this system that has prohibited to start the car in the shocked condition. If he is alcoholized, the car is not switching.
The initiative has been announced in June in the last month and is now part of the report of the General Advocate General, and it is a pilot project that will be long for a year.
The purpose is the resocialization of the driver, because it is a course for the changing of the conduct.
In addition to the General State Authority, the Ministry of Transport will also participate in the establishment of the Technical Institute for Safety of Cars.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75% of the drivers who were shown more than one time because of the driving under the alcohol impact, they returned to tax.
The `alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system associated with the car, it misses the alcohol content in the air examined and prevents the autostart when the driver has tested; or if a alcohol concentration is identified, which is higher than allowed.
The costs of more than 1 000 euros are charged by those associated with the sanctions.
In this regard, a study carried out in the United States in 2007 showed that cars that have been equipped with these devices have been prevented by 65% of the regular degradation in the first year following its introduction.
In Spain it is calculated that 115 people could be saved annually.
The measures are limited to the administrative action because of two reasons: to attack this behavior before it becomes a criminal offence.
In order to facilitate its implementation, a legal reform can be achieved on the ordinary way, and the basic law is required to reform, which is necessary for the criminal persecution process.
The device is still on the Spanish markets, no business available, although it has already been built in some useful vehicles and vehicles of the public transport.
The House will vote tomorrow because of the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers Party, which proposes to install this system in school bus, which has already been made in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With the British Faculty, at 17:40 p.m. to the hour provided by the program, the airport of Benito Juárez de Mexico DF traveled to the Spanish aircraft, with the prince and prince of Asturia.
The sun went down, but their lines have still forced to use the hand as the sun screen to see the king couple exited from the flight.
Direct on the Gangway: the Spanish messager and other authorities
A couple of hours ago, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the prince and the prince of Asturia would visit the city to formalize the official travel.
- Ah, very good, so, there's nobody to take you from here or so.
No, she's the Spanish, but she lived here a couple of years.
- Yes, very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the prince and the prince of Asturia are and knows the importance of traveling.
There are many who waited at the Hunger of the airport and the red kitchen, including military protection of 27 marine soldiers.
The prince appears to be laughing, waiting in the sea, and she, the prince, with long hair sweet by the wind, without a common 'peep-toes', may have been informed that it is expected to be a wheel in DF.
Before they join the room, they smile and are prepared on the photographs where the official follow-up is expected.
At the gate of the hotel where they are understood, one of the four largest in the city is waiting for a reporter from the mexican television that makes desire.
The best premium of the mode
Probably there was no suitable place on the world as Paris to present a premium of the mode, and it probably did not have an excellent model designer and Bonvivanten as Valentino.
Mango presentes the second exhibition of the modeton-Mango Fashion Adwards for the promotion and international increase of young modellers.
This will be equipped with monetary prices of EUR 300 000.
Eyer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first exhibition, saw her descriptions in the Mango Filiale creator of Boulevard Houseman number 54 in Paris and almost tried because of the emotional reception.
Moreover, this is the second largest business of the company in Europe and was recently opened and offers a sale area of 1 335 m2.
The biggest business is in London.
So many events have been related to the model designer Valentino for his jury presidency. Everything ended with a luxus dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the environment of many famous people, they seemed to be spectaculal in the mainstate that was organized by Mango.
Nati, with the serious heart that was cut by pain, because his brother had recently died. He took the path of the Model House and had some shocks of ELAH, which were shocked. He stood in the arm of his son Luis, who is nearly two feet large and had Valentino at the dinner with his honor.
Andik, the owner of the house of Mango, welcomed the guests and was so a covaler, so that he ended with the Rotschild bar without Jacketts, because Jacketts had slaughtered the lady.
Monica Cruz, who was able to work and had a hose and a hamlet that she himself modelled, and to dinner she took a long, black sexy clothing. At a night-free walk by the Oper, joined by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballett tests, so she was shocked, remembered at the old times, took a stage and made a type 'grand more'.
In Sastre, the space passed out by the rooms of the palace, but before she had shown us the photos of her son on the phone.
On the next morning we were able to join us about the presence of Oliver Martinez, a personality that has always been stirming, and on John Travolta, who had requested to have a room without shoot in the International Hotel in Paris.
The stars under the starful heaven of Paris.
Oh la, that's life.
1001 Council against stress
There is no 1000, but a more possibility to forget our chaotic life.
And if there's little, all are gathered in a book where it comes to dispatch. The book comes into book negotiations on September 30.
The weaker is a punishment when he smells at 7 o'clock, but even worse the idea appears to come back to the hectic rhythm that requires the current life.
The office calls the swimming and computer that leads to the pain of back.
The stress is the wicked of the 21th century.
But there are no two methods to fight the daily creation and the problems of the work world.
The number increases, but not less than 1001.
Besides Yoga steels, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott in the book provides the entire list of opportunities that are adapted to the shock and the time each individual.
The work against stress is '1001 possibilities to relax themselves' and thus the peace that the book provides is in the negotiations of the Delegate Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Who does not mean that it is impossible to reach peace in areas such as workplace using personal contacts, so this manuscript opposes such faith.
Furthermore, the methods will be offered to remain in contact with the nature or to propose 100% of natural receptions that lead to depletion.
If the adrenaline in your venene does not grow up to restore the balance of the body and stress has become a problem, the moment has come to add to the sofa, to stop the brain and concentrate on reading.
Discuss in sleep
Some Kids speak night
I don't mean those who wake up and tell us what happened on the day before, but the children speaking during the sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, in the best case, you'll be shocked, but in reality, it has no importance.
This is a positive sleeping that is called the speech in the sleep.
She is very wide, especially with children and adolescents.
Of course, more than one of you were told you have spoken tonight.
This phenomenon can occur (a time in life, for example, during the high fever), or regularly (day, once per week, once in the month) on the next day, the child may not remember anything.
There is no only reason to cause this appearance.
There are often associations with other appearances in bed, such as alptspaces, panic fears at night, Enuresis noctura (sweet night), speaking in bed, but there is no reason for it.
As we have previously mentioned, it can be very high fibers, stress situations or overcome.
In any case, it's a little investigated phenomena.
The frequency with which it comes is very variable.
It can be that you speak quietly in individual words, fleeter or can be a very opposite (which, wine, long discussions).
In the cases where the expression is very intensive, it is recommended to observe the child and to consult with a specialist in order to examine whether a problem is caused by the fear and in this way.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it will not be treated, if it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (e.g., with sleep appnoe or stress).
What can be done is a series of simple prevention measures:
Don't try to smell the child before sleeping.
So, looking for a peaceful game for the child and avoid stressing television programs that are horrible and too wild.
In the nervous children recommended restraints, they can be used to help them get a certain inner tranquility.
This helps the child sleep quietly.
If the swimming thing comes in bed, try to keep the silence.
Think of it is harmless for the child, and on the next day it will be able to remember anything happened.
Useful Councils
Don't stop it.
That's unuthorised, because the child is unconscious, so you're going to get it out of bed.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it's quiet.
Think of it if there is a couple of appearances, it is recommended to let you consult or find out why the child has fear.
If they understand what it says (what isn't so common), the child does not press to carry out an appointment and to learn more information.
So you'll be able to achieve nothing, because if the child sleeps, it's unconscious and can't think about it.
Moreover, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it's dreaming and why it say, because they are careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you are doing.
Maybe it doesn't tell the child that you hear that night and know his secrets.
Not even as a shock.
It's a lot of fear.
So, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's a moment that keeps just a few minutes.
Ironic homes ... finally
After a long round of duration, the iron houses on the game field are finally back to success course.
Without great effort, the egg sharp played many towers and made it to implement it, and thus win the game.
The time of the meeting, in which the angryers had to show their ability to show, was not very high.
After a first attack of the guest captain buyer, whose television was nearly on the shift, Ill houses should dominize the game with easyness, and it just changed with a television, then a brain with a highpass, and the Romanin with a shooting with the foot shooting to demand the deceased Danish.
The enemy manage blocked in the field and left only the vibrant Riahi in the pitches of the storm.
The start of the second half-time should be decisive with the first two by Riahi and Temporale fighting towers, and then with the first door for the iron houses through Marais, which was exactly right to re-accepte a ball that was struck in a first trial of Debold.
But the illness torch should not be able to enjoy his happiness for a long time and be sent to the bank for about 12 minutes, with a number of submissions to his master room friends.
However, Denmark didn't use this and had no major problems, which were just a little back to defence, except in the last seconds of the game, where the ball was very close to the latte.
Sarkozy takes a shame of fishermen
Before he runs to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will still make a delay in Britain.
In view of the determination of the fishermen who locked the passengers to several Bretonic and Norwegian ports on Monday, the French President decided to stay on Tuesday morning at the port of Guilvinec in Finistère to meet with their representatives there.
The latter promised to receive 'with a constructive spirit' and hope that he comes with 'concrete proposals'.
The President's visit is in place at the same time as a General Assembly of the Crisis Committee founded by the Breton fishermen in order to implement measures in view of the extreme increase of the slight price, which has reached a record value of a average of EUR 1,14 per litre.
According to the publisher of the Elyséepalast David Martinon, the President would be talking about possible solutions to help their companies to become competitive and to ensure the working conditions and the payment of the souls.
Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen with decisiveness.
On Thursday morning they led to the Morbian and Calvado’s Protest Market, caused the stage of almost ten miles long.
The seggling of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle Islands did not depend.
The half of Quiberon was limited with a sperm.
The souls are prepared on Monday by exposing their decision-making by burning rifs and palettes from early morning before the carpets of breast and Lorient ports, while stopped demonstrations in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement turned on other ports of the Atlantic Coast and the channel, such as Sables d'Olonnes, where the fisheries did not export, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the hands of the trade ships.
The fishers of Turballe and Crossic in Loire-Atlantics resolved the blockade of the significant total raffinerie in Donges on night.
The decision made by Boulogne-Sur-Mer to wait for the meeting at midnight in the Ministry before they decide on possible measures.
In fact, the Crisis Committee in Guilvinec should decide on the reactions to move and its participation in the discussion planned by the Ministry for Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some braton fishermen do not want to be represented by the members of the National Fisheries Committee who did not support their movement.
'The strike will continue' because 'the fishermen will not point out' and 'do not want to go to Paris', for example, Liliane Cariou, President of the Fisheries Committee of Lorient.
Professional fishermen who do not pay taxes are currently costing about 50 cents, but they believe that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with the same for less than 30 cents per litre.

Emmbraer takes his delivery prognoses for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer calculates this year with 215 flights, despite the threatening recession, as a risk for the world economy.
Emmbraer, the fourth largest aircraft manufacturer of the world, confirmed President Fredrico Fleury Curado for 2008.
In the first half year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircrafts.

AIG would take it into consideration to delay more than 15% of their activity.
According to the Financial Times Sunday, the American International Insurer Group, which was financially supported by the American Monetary Authority, considers that more than 15% of his active assets are to return the $85 billion, which were proposed to him.
AIG is willing to tax the sale of a majority of its businesses, their life insurance at international level and their age precautions in the United States.
According to the FT, the AIG Administrative Council held on Sunday night to review possible sales.
The AIG could not be confirmed.
The FT continues to declare 59% of its share in the backsuring transatlantic holdings, as well as its real estate property and investment in the private equity.
With regard to these sales, no final decision was taken, the FT continues.
AIG must work as soon as to pay the credits over 85 billion, which has authorized the Federal Reserves, also to the risk that the United States authorities receive 80% of their capitals and lose the current shareholders in the same measure.

However, with 228 votes and 205 rejected the Financial Secretariat Henry Paulson the resources for which he had requested.
Nearly two of the three Republicans declined his plan.
'This is a bad picture that represents the Congress as impossible to accept a plan', said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
'This shows how much the market on this plan was,' added it, and fears that a project accepted to 'to be late' in several days.
"If the project is actually condemned to the disaster (...), it will be the task of the Fed (the American Central Bank, an American Central Bank, etc.) and other central banks to get the crisis into the griff, which would be more limited to the credit conditions", warned Brian Bethune, Head of Global Insight.
And Ms. Piegza emphasized the feeling of extreme urgence, "as it brings himself every day, the destruction of a financial company" in the United States.
On Friday, after the competition of Washington Mutual, the American authorities planned the purchase of Wachovia's bank business by its competitive citizen group.

Obama, winner by points in the first television dual
At the first debate of the two candidates for the White House on Friday, another was to find out who was the winner, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As QGs expected to select both the Republicans and the Democratics, their own victory in this television dual, which should be followed by a third of the American families.
The political analytics David Gergen estimates that John McCains' performance was not sufficient to stop his return to election questions five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, which was published on Saturday, is the view that Obama has five points (49% to 44% for McCain), is the view that the democracy is clearly the best figure.
In the still undetermined elections, so those on which it come now, Obama was conquering with 39% as a winner from the surveys, while as a CBS survey 25% of them McCain saw as a winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his breakfast on Thursday with the good performance expected by his companion Joseph Biden at the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin
'It would be a mistake to assess them.
She has good instincts, but he warned this weekend Bill Clinton.
The seventy-year-old McCain did not listen to cut his unprecedented experience in the field of external policy in front of it, and it was very clear to submit the 'nativity' of his enemy in respect of these issues, which were the central point of this first television dual.
'Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand...' he stressed several times.
'I don't believe that Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge to be chaired,' he also assured.
An attack point that is preached since yesterday in the Republican election position.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He expressed himself short and precisely without letting himself out of the voice.
He urged his ability to take good decisions and to renew the image that has the world from the United States.
'McCain has not yet understood Obama' this weekend, put a democratic election democracy in the Republic of the Republic, not to have the complete extent of the crisis laid down on the 'Americans of the road'.
'When the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you', Obama last night urged 20,000 people who had gathered a election session in North Carolina in strict rain.
He didn't even mention the words 'Mittelstand' or 'employer'. 'The financial crisis has obama, who keeps the Americans the most suitable to save the economy even on the border of the ground, a clear advantage.
'The next week could be a decisive channel', estimated yesterday by the influentious democratic senator Charles Schumer.
The Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton government, compares the 'good economic instincts' obamas with those by Bill Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998.
For the democratic candidates, the current crisis 'the end of a eight-year-old economic policy implemented by George Bush and is supported by Senator McCain'.
After again he pointed out that he would even create taxes for 95% of the Americans, despite the smugglings on the Wall Street, as the Senator of Illinois pointed out that the creation of a possible energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energy, together with the introduction of a health insurance system, is priority for him.
However, McCain wanted to create an installation of 45 nuclear power operations until 2030.
The two candidates will take into consideration the questions that are taken on the plan for the saving of the financial market over $7,7 billion (470 billion), which was adopted last night by the Congress and is extremely unrelated to the people.
'Have you noted that in Minsk there was a choice?'
Youths and oppositions demonstrated Sunday night on the main place of the White City to delay the results of the parliamentary election before.
Some hundreds of white Russians gathered together after the closure of the election locale on the market in Minsk to protest against the begurous characters of the election of Parliament.
Although no result was made, many young people came to demonstrate the power of Alexander Lukachenko: ‘The dictator must come back.’
Some give that they have not ever chosen, 'What is useful if they do with my voice what they want', says a youth.
They do not believe that the regime that has shown the foreign observers in the best light to return the negotiations with the European Union is ready to comply with a democratic course.
The sanctions, including the notorial of Visa for 40 leaders of the Whiterusian personalities and the resurrection of certain possessions, could be decreased if these choices were considered clean by the observers.
According to the opposition, they weren't.
'We were excluded by the election committees and our observers did not take part in the payment', deplored Juri Potemkin, pressers of the Union of Democratic forces, a theoretical assembly of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, stressed by Alexander Milinkiewitsch, former opposition candidate for the Presidential election 2006 and the leader of the Pro-Europe Movement, because it is important for who speaks the voices, and with us it is the executive.
If the deputy entered the Opposition to the Parliament, it is because they were appointed and not selected.
But their income to Parliament can mean the time in the television, meetings in the regions and proposals for legislation. '
The opposition, therefore, is to be binding in the political game, because 'the dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which Russia has a strong debt, is in a crisis and we do not reform, we are risking to become a Russian Protector.
Well, we want to be independent.
The opposition fears that the European Union's security and cooperation organization, which has continued to be elected, does not recognize the election as valid.
It emphasizes that the election numbers are too high and that the expansion of the stimulation in advance (26% of the choices of Minsk) has made the way for any type of manipulation.
'Have you noticed that a choice has been made,' asked the leader of the Social Democratic Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners who were released in August this year.
There was no one in the election locals.
And there will be a maximum of five Members of the opposition in the Parliament, such as those who have mostly agreed with the views of the government. '
The style of the night turns back to October.
In the television, President Lukachenko and members of the Central Selection Committee welcome their success.
Subject - From blood that was resurrected
Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of her foundation, and her President, Dr. Francine Decary, had all been pleased because Hema-Quebec became one of the most safe and efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, she has reassured the confidence of publicity, which was hardly shocked by the scandal of blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross services during the 1980s were assigned to HI virus and hepatitis C-virus.
In view of this drama and the inadequacy of publicity, the Government of Canada in February 1994 conducted a public investigation conducted by the Judiciary Horace Crever, aimed at bringing light into the situations leading to such a tragedy, and to develop directives to prevent a new disaster of this kind.
While the judges of Cancer still slowed to leave his report, several provinces at the time set a committee to develop a new system for the management of blood conservation in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gelineau Committee complied this task.
According to the reports of Gelineau and Krebs, two blood banks were found in Canada: Hema-Quebec responsible for Quebec and the Canadian blood society to provide the other provinces and the two territories.
'1998, when Hema- Quebec took his work, not only 38% of people trusted in the blood conservation system in Quebec, remembered Dr. Decary.
The situation was uncomfortable.
Through the huge efforts to improve the security of blood conservation and working in this area for the next years, we have rewarded the confidence of publicity,” she says, before she proudly stressed that nearly 94% of the population of Quebec had confidence in Hema-Quebec at the beginning of 2008.
However, Dr. Decary is conscious that “relivering is extremely destructive”.
Since its foundation on 28 September 1998 Hema- Quebec acts in accordance with the principle of precaution.
At this time, we experienced many cases of human forms of breast-feeding in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, tells this woman who has been leading to the leadership since the creation of 1998.
"And we didn't know if this disease could be transferred from the blood.
Thus, we are urging one of the main guidelines of cancer and gelineau reports, which applys excluding measures if you don't know and if a disease continues slowly, as it is obviously in the case of Creutzfeldt Jacob's disease, which expresses a degeneration of the brain, which leads to death inevitablely.
Thus, in April 1999, no blood was taken from persons who have been maintained since 1980 than one month in the United Kingdom.
Well, a few years ago, without any doubt, it was proved that this disease will be transferred from the blood.
Thus this event has shown us that the principle of the precaution we use is a sense.
The 1999 market appeared a much more accurate technique for recognition of HIV: the nuclei acid test (NST), which allows it to demonstrate the events of the virus itself directly in the blood of the spinner, and not that the antibody against the virus, as it had been the case at the previous test.
The NSTs enabled to reduce the incubation time between the time when the person was infected and the one when the first viruses can be demonstrated by our blood techniques, the specialist declares.
This time could be reduced at less than one week.
So the risk was that certain costs could be infected without knowing, and that could not be recognized significantly.
These improvements enabled the risk of transfusion of AIDS through blood transfusion in considerable measures.
Today one of 12 million people is risked to get HIV infected.
"In other words, it means that you should distribute 12 million blood containers before someone was hidden with HIV.
Since Hema- Quebec shares each year between 400,000 and 500,000 blood containers, it would last more than 24 years before the case was brought to HIV through a blood conservation.
I believe you can feel that today when you get or write a transfusion to restore the health', the Hema-Quebec leader says.
'Our challenge for the next ten years is to receive the safety of our products.
You never know what disease inhibitors can be achieved in the system.
First in the last year, on the island of the Reunion, the Chikungunya virus has occurred, which will be transferred by insects through the blood, as well as the Westnil virus.
We need to be monitored, and Dr. Decary continues before she stressed that Hema Quebec must also provide sufficient supply next to a secure supply.
'The need increases because the population is old.
Since cancer-related treatments are more aggressive, patients need new red blood body or bloodplatches.
The overpopulation of the population is also affected by the blood rate, which is only 3% of the habitats of Quebecs that are appropriate for blood delays. '
This allows every healthy person who is 18 or older and complies with the pregnancy criteria every 56 days, so six times in the year.
In the meantime, 14% of those who have their blood are not accepted because they are sick for AIDS or Malaria, and who is in a country that is distributed in the malaria will be excluded for one year from the skin.
'In this 3% we create it to receive an inventor that corresponds to the needs of hospital houses.
The lack of devices are very rare.
But the members must renew this spending network if they are older and no blood anymore.
It is difficult to convince people to sell blood, but especially to keep them and bring them to become regular fever.
Life is so hectic today that you're finding the time to take a hour at the blood sleeves, Francine Decary regrets.
With a annual budget of $297 million, hema-quebec provides not only blood conservation but also human tissues, including skin transplantates, heart clothes, agglomerates and skin, which is almost used in severe burns.
These tissues are investigated, processed and frozen before they are interaggregated with Hema Quebec, which also managed the only public nabel bluebank Quebecs.
In the nabel crystal, which was previously considered as biomedic waste, there is rich blood that can be used to treat severe diseases, such as leukemia.
'For some weeks we celebrated the establishment of our thousandst Nabel blue tests, and we planned to decline more than thousand annually.
'We must like to begin to make it available for transplantations', says Dr. Decary, which describes this programme of the Nabel Skill Absorption as very popular.
'My mothers are convinced to have no access to it' because hema-quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costful program in all hospitals Quebecs.
Soccer - Impact in halffinal
Montreal Impact last night, thanks to a 3- to 1-size (4 to 3 with all doors) against the Soders from Seattle at the second and decided game of the four-final series in the Saputo stadium, where the totality of the mortality was qualificated for the half-final round of the divorce of the first liga of the USL.
The Mediterranean player Antonio Ribeiro took the crucial gate in the nineteen minutes of play.
After a first half-time without door, both for the one and for the other, the media field players David Testo and Rocco Plancentino entered the other part for Montreals training.
Roger Levesque was the only one who took Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Remember that at the first game of the first game of the pre- and back series on Friday Impact the Starfire Complex in Tukwila in a Seattles forecast a 2 to 1 relief.
In half-final, the effect is measured with the whitecaps from Vancouver.
Saturday night Thunder was able to equipze a 3 to 1 deficit with a 4 to 3 seats, but the Whitecaps moved to the half-final round with a total link of 5 to 4.
Impact must be held on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series are set today.
Shortly said - Siegetor by Kovalev
The Canadian Manager's Trial is ready to attack the season.
Last night, the unit formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Costitsyn on the panther from Florida with a shooting fire, which led to a 3 to 2 seats.
Costitsyn, the star of the accommodation, shooted a gate, Plekanec delivered two templates, and Kovalev transformed a passage in this win game, the fourth of the three colors in six preparations games.
Kovalev won the victory by shooting the only door of the whole shooting.
'I'm not still ready, warned the Russians.
I need another game to feel like it. '
'He was too firmed in the first half of the period, noted by Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he got the end of the game.
He received a stirmic case. '
Charest placed on the north
The Prime Minister does not close to the elections before the end of the year.
After the general Assembly of the Liberian Party, Jean Charest was on the end yesterday after Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new Minister of Health Yves Boldu (Linke) tried to be chosen in the today's partial election.
'Move our last large borders in the north': this is the long-term goal that Jean Charest last night with visual resources at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party Quebecs in Levi, where he followed all the guidelines.'
During his conversation, a kind of image mood was designed behind him.
On three large screens, there were spectacular pictures of water power power, mountain works, from Quebec in 'Google Maps', landscape maps, etc.
Great means as during the election period.
With regard to the press, the Prime Minister refused to exclude that it will stop the elections of this origin, even though he believed that his terminal calendar was very full.
The ‘Plan North’ is the fourth element of a 'vision' which has the Prime Minister for Quebec, the 'new economic space', which provides an agreement with France regarding workforces, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it was recently mentioned in the speaking of the Prime Minister, the opening of the North was - the northern area on the 49th largest level - never had been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister was limited to explain why the Northerns were a juwel with a huge potential, but no date, no investment sum or accurate priorities for the future projects.
At least some points of view about what could be done more: especially the water energy, the forest, but especially the mountain industry, benefits from the growth of the weak countries and the renewing of public infrastructures.
The recording of Mr. Charests has the North 'Nickel, Zink, Kupfer, Platin, Gold, Silver, Iron, Titan and even diamonds'.
This 'area two times as large as France' is near us, is in Quebec.
It's not only in our neighborhood, it's in us, he stressed how clear to show that he's looking for a national foundation.
Quebec has grown very much through his connection to the north, he stressed: the street to gold in Abitibi, the Quebecs technology, the James Buch.
'It belongs to us, it is our future', he added after he had placed a theatrical pause to look back to the huge map.
The North, 70% of the Quebec region, closed a part of the Labrador, which has always requested the Quebec, declared the Prime Minister of Press.
'This is a traditional attitude that persecuted all governments.
There is a line where there is no agreement for a long time when the opportunity is offered, I will take this position back in the name of the government.
Furthermore, 'with the climate change we need to remedy our vision from the north,' he explained and spoke about the Northwest Passage that will be travelable because of the iron shoes all year.
Before this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is just a duty to implement this area.
And the inhabitants of the area, the origins and the inuits?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebecs would be very useful with them and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers of various parties, Peter Corbeil and Michel Letorneau (ex-high sinist deputy of Hungary) have already held negotiations with about thirty communities.
One of the major committees of Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and ground estimate) takes an important place, has included the works.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large congregation, 'not indeed a assembly', but a opportunity to ‘man will create a common vision’.
The development of the North will, on the other hand, take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
the North Plan will be 'respective, regulated and environmental', he promised.
Jean Charest describes this 'vision' as if she is a continued manner of the liberal Prime Ministers who were before him.
'When the Liberals, who were before us, we have thought to convert the challenges to new growth and development changes.
This was also one of the re-educated topics of the weekend, opened on Friday with a great cocktail party for the 50th Jubilee of the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the party's leadership by Jean Leage.
One of the decisions adopted aims to rename the power work of Beauharnois in Adelard-Godbout-Staudamm.
"For Godbout, which has created the Hydro-Quebec, we always knew our party to determine the future," explained Jean Charest.
The press was faced by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963, to refer to another conservative project.
With regard to the Eastmain1a-Ruper project, Mr Charest, which is intended to participate in 2012.
'These remains among us, but I've intended to be there', he trusted his members, which was exaggerated in those cases.
The Prime Minister, who said in April 2008, and certainly not to give any elections in 2009, has, in fact, the possibility of stopping this original choice, which is possible by the law, not yet excluded.
He stressed, however, that his terminal calendar is full, especially because of the mission of the Community Council in China and of a gallet between Quebec and New York.
The General Assembly of the weekend, the Liberal Party, made a platform from nationalist plans, especially from the 'the Constitution' objectives that were adopted without further approximation: the PLQ requires the recognition of the 'speciality Quebecs' in the Constitution.
She also wants to call Québec members of the Council of Canadian Rundfunk and Telecommunications, and to have a veto regarding the decisions found in Quebec.
From the sides of the opposition, the directions of the North Plan were included with skepsis.
The chief of the Quebecois party, Pauline Marois, reiterated the policy on the development of the North-du-Quebec, which the Government introduced 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, when she came to the power of 2003, refused to apply this.
If she had done it, "we're going to continue today," Mrs. Marois judged on the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (which the choice is today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ expressed itself to support the adoption of a North Plan by the Government.
'What we want is that this is not only a great idea', the Chairman Sebastien Proulx declared in delegation for Mario Dumont, who returns from the holiday today.
letters - A land engaged
Mr Vic Toews, ex-'Justiz' Minister (which Ironia) in the castle Harper was allowed to say about Louise tree that she is a 'schande' for Canada.
This woman who led to a non-decisive fight for justice and gives us all our admiration to be shocked, says exactly much about the people about the Prime Minister, as about Stephen Parker himself.
We have to do this with a government that has not been able to go home as the only country man captured by Guantanamo in the concentration stock.
A government that did not even take into account that Omar Khadr was a young man than what happened to him.
The only government, notwithstanding the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, speaks to her words and allows a child soldier to be inhuman.
The only person who decides to be a parodi of justice to assess the depth of the accused person.
Let us recall that, in particular, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the association of Canadian lawyers to get home to Omar Khadr, so that he gets a fair process in Canada.
The government also decides the eyes before the torture: it is little interesting that a young adult after so many years will be slowly broken forever.
We are not yet conscious of it, but we are just experienced here a home-to-to-to-to-to-to-leading of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word, the Harper constantly comes to it as a fahn before us, and that spends out of his mouth so unfortunately.
It is therefore the time in which there is no more morality: a Canadian citizen may be unfortunately mistreated, tortured and opened, just after the good views of a government head that is supported by minority until today (if he may belong to a minority after October 14...).
Many choosers believe to find their sanctuary at a party that preachs the skin, law and order. But they do not see that this government has deceived what the call and the dignity of our country.
The damage, Mr Toews, is in this placement and nothing else.
Free view - The oral talk of Barrick Gold
In its issue of 17 September, Le Devoir published a letter by Mr Patrick J. Garver, Vice-General Director of the Canadian Goldmine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and follows an oral logic that the world's largest gold profit society was a declaration of over six million against three authors and a small dealing house, with the objective of opening a 'occupied public debate'.
If it is true that the judges are independent and unpartial, they are not judged of the truth, especially not in the case of distortions, but in the law.
As I hope that this fundamental difference has been completely disappeared by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate is to take everybody into the rule that wants to represent one of the opposite views.
Like the process, the authors and exhibitors of the Black Canada book must be exempt of considerable sums to prepare their defence and fight with very unreasonable weapons against an army of lawyers who are sent out of the nearly unfavourable gold mines.
In other words, the tactics for these inequalities fights are often to destroy the defenders in order to oblige an unfair arrangement that makes the side mundtom and also decrease every one who wants to re-examinate the question.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have to present its view of the matter before the public opinion.
On the contrary to what is in many countries where Barrick Gold works, gangs and ghosts, the debates in Canada are normally expenditured by exchange of ideas and not by smuggling.
It would therefore be sufficient if the gold mines had opened their books and files and had opened a real debate, through newspapers, medias, publications and the financing of independent test teams that would have been able to bring light to this issue.
But Barrick Gold seems not to have confidence in the public view, and the requests and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada with a movement.
Maybe Mr Garver explain how he can at the same time ask for a 'public' debate, and may it misuse the opinions as well as this publicity?
It is likely that in the world of Vice-Presidents this word is only the largely paid applicants, not the Community of all Canadians; a very nice view of the term.
In a democracy, the democracy itself has the right to speak of the offenders.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that publicity supporting the authors and exhibitors of Noir Canada is doing this especially because it rejects the brutal situation of gold mines.
This publicity is prepared to hear and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many of them take as a knife (in the course of the 'public debate' Barrick Gold has just addressed a call to the authors of Noir Canada, where they call for no longer to use this term...).
Unlike the surreal speech of Mr Garver, Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the foundation of truth, which is fundamentally for each democratic society.
It is totally right to quote credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country such as Canada to investigate and discuss the subjects that do not fall to the rich companies of this world, who else can do it then?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead this by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment that we belong is known for a long time to get debates and inconsistence in the griff and to solve conflicts.
The unrelated assembly of Barrick Gold shows that, in contrast to what she proposes, it has no joy in a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it will be time for governments to take action that limits this kind of unfair punishment.
Saving action for the Wall Street - Democratics and Republicans
Bush and the leaders of Congress, Republicans and Democratic Democratics have finally come to an agreement on the broadest economic governance plan since the great depression of the 30s.
The new version of the plan over 700 billion US Dollar to stop the financial crisis that has been threatening the Wall Street for months is still to be adopted by the two Congress Cameras.
The main contents are: a better control of the Member States on the practical implementation of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the return of the public money employed, new available to cover the number of households covered by payment residues, as well as the right to monitor the holders who are payed to the responsibilities of the undertakings supported.
The American Financial Secretariat Henry Paulson, President of the Deputy Chamber, Nancy Pelosi, and the representative of the Republicans, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a second-day negotiation model.
'We have made great progress in the direction of a agreement that will be effective in the market', explained the representative of Bush, Henry Paulson.
'It happened everything to protect the real economy and the American people before the course crisis on the Wall Street', explained the Democratics.
'This is the fundamental point: if we do not, the trauma, the chaos and the disappointment in the daily life of the Americans will be exacerbated,' explained the Republic of Judd Gregg.
The negotiations were accelerated during the last two hours, because of fear of the effects that had renewed the scourge to the stimulation of investors.
The time that was agreed was the opening of the market today.
The two American Presidency candidates, who were late in the negotiations, showed themselves more like a favorite of the agreement, but not to condemn them to express their inadequacy in this extreme manner.
The Democratic Senator Barrack Obama was given on the addition of certain disposals to agree, especially those who should allow the owners to keep their homes, and those relating to the holders of the leaderships of the company saved by the State.
'If the taxpayer is requested to take on the basis of the responsibilities of certain persons with extraordinary measures, it is nothing that could be pleased.
But these measures are necessary, he explained on the American television partners.
When he was asked on another sender whether he would vote to the proposed plan, his Republican enemy John McCain answered: 'I would like to know the details, but I hope it.
'The guidelines I've read, [seeks] that this is one thing that we all have to be resurrected and with which we will be able to advance.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable," he said.
The $700 billion plan is designed with the money of the payer
It comes to a crisis 14 months after it was solved by the place of a real estate blue, which first led to the slaughter of the risks of hypotheken crops (Subpress) before they extended further forms of more broader share (PCAA), and finally in a refrigeration of the financial power and in the rule of banks and money institutions.
A group of Deputy Deputy was that last week the first attempt to agree.
Since the Democratics have accepted that certain ‘giable’ actives of society in circumstance only have been assured by the government and should not be purchased, it is believed that the sackgase is gone.
In order to decrease the vision channel for all of them in the Congress, there is also availability that indicates that if the government should do with this programme within five years of loss, it could then raise new taxes to maintain its capital assigned.
The new plan provides the payment of a first sum of 250 billion to the other 100 billion if the President is necessary.
The payment of more than 350 billion must be adopted in a renewed vote by the Congress.
On the contrary to his aid, Washington's shareholder is granted to the supported enterprises in the case of wine divides and who can sell it again when the storm is overlooked.
The Federal Government will have the possibility to keep the installation procedures related to the accommodations associated with the real estate credits concerned by this plan and to establish the periods for repayment and allocations paid to the employees of the undertakings concerned.
The developers of the plan would like to agree on it today, and then the Senate was on midnight.
Despite all their efforts, it is not sure that her plan will be obtained by green light.
Indeed, last night further votes have been taken against this project, both from the Republicans and the Democratics.
'Cause Washington does not understand us' said the Republican Scott Garett, member of the Chamber Financial Commission, its electors.
'Yes, we have a great financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one there is to ask tax payers to the cash.
The Democratic Deputy Brad Sherman, leader of a group in the Congress, which is called the “cook of the Skeptiker”, represents the things different but comes to the same conclusion.
'For four hundred excellent economic professionals, including three Nobel prices, have written us to share us: we ask the Congress to not put on pressure, and to carefully overcome the way to be struck', he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe we reiterately show that it is a global crisis.
In the case of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced partly the statement of the Fortis banking group for 11,2 billion euros (16,3 billion dollars).
The governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg were necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that they would refuse to buy their competitors, which are in great difficulties, since she lost EUR 2 billion (2.9 billion) in the crisis by the risks of real estate credits in the United States.
Continue is 85,000 employees and belongs to the twenty larger European banks and the ten major insurers.
'This is not a lost money, explained yesterday by the Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Boss.
In compensation, we have a right to electoral and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the spares and households value, now when we announce more time. '
During this time, the British government was just on the other side of the channel to register another bank of the financial crisis.
According to the English Press, the government would take all the current credits to the Bank Bradford and Bringley, with over 41 billion (75.5 billion dollars) from real estate credits.
Last night the Spanish bank Santander announced that they would buy the branches and customers of the British Bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank to Northern Rock, which the British government has to be registered since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - death of an engaged Icon
His beauty with the blue eyes was a long time his trumpet, no one would say his weakness.
Have the American player released the charming laugh from the Narzistic Spiegel?
Yeah and no.
His feminine feeling, his sensitivity and a clear talent have also maintained him from a power that brings the truly fearful monsters to the world.
But what a great long driver!
Paul Newman, who was killed in Connecticut on Friday at 83 years of age, remains one of the last Icons of the American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, whom he looked and for a long time he was a kind of rivale on the Leinwand, more careful in his showing game, and surely there is also more destructive, but exactly a apostle of freedom and the spring of dramatric conventions.
The missing blood has many wonderful children.
He was born in 1925 in Ohio as a son of a German Jew and a Hungary mother.
From its European roots, one of the tranquillious faces of the American dream should be found.
Without excessive Ego, the extreme quality character.
Because in him, a whole country was reflected again in the self-made-man, in the fighters who had been blessed in the war of the Pacific War, who studied the show art at Yale at the beginning of the 50s, and then visited the Actor's Studio in New York before he had succeeded in the theatre, television, and soon in China.
Besides this man, who fighted for citizens rights, was also the driver who was in 1979 at the 24-hour level of Mans II, and also a sex symbol, although he lived together with the shooter Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him also the unknown facets of this secret, retained, engaged, and against the love of the showbusiness overwhelming stars, which the race will never be completely resolved.
A qualified man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death Paul Newman's kino love chairs in Taumel this weekend, while all his major roles were played on the dark screen of the memories.
More than a century-year-old American film art in a constant change, it ends with him.
When the charming cowboy turns back from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) in the memory, and the young man who returned his sensible wife (Elizabeth Taylor) to the Katz on the warm Blechdach, which was formed by Tennesseee Williams in 1958.
It is called a much more shorter memory (1990) that is observed by his sensible Mr. Bridge, who is struck in his age of a marriage, which did not complete all their promises.
So many other Paul Newmans came through the story.
This criminal, stormical, violent, and incompatible boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (A hand full dreck) from Robert Wise, a role that was thought for James Dean, was recovered after the death and made the Newman 1956 well known.
This sympathical ganove in the overwhelming The Sting (The Clou), 1973 with the Oscar for the best movie.
On the wonderful The Hustler of Robert Ross (1961),
This face through the times, he was.
He's still.
In his life course, the epoch is connected.
The young man, especially from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), is Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox trainer of a eishockey team.
His fans found him again in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Brothers Coen in 1994.
With a last role 2003, as the patent of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
On the contrary to several cinema leaders who have soon taken back from the movie world, Newman should remain in the satellite, and then Hollywood, his possessions, his prunk and his conceptions.
The French film employer Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to the 'Sunderplanding' when he judged his all-expressed performances.
The kitchen was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, which flew long-term roles.
But he played rare sunnyboys as a foreign side: neurotics, alcoholics, fieslings or doubts, with the perfect display he reflected his legs and his sights.
As a Governor, Newman enthusiasmed the unknown pages of his true awesome sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (on the Roman of the Canadian Margaret Laurence) and his wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, signed a pleasant women's portal full melancholie.
He who lost his son Scott through a overdose, this 1984 led his movie Harry and Son, a full work of feing feeling and traurity.
In the flow of foods, which were eve on Newman yesterday, his close friend and former weapons, Robert Redford (they were together played in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) expressed extremely: ‘If his presence has improved my life and this country’.
The greatness and satisfaction of life were essential characteristics of the murdered player.
Unlike his legendary career, there is now a large defender of citizens' rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an enemy of the abducted Hollywoods.
We probably have seen him with the feet full of vinaigret, in sauce, cup, or other foods, and this has been very sweet, although we were still nice.
However, the wins from his arrangements were in his foundation for children in emergency.
Instead of smiling on his myth, Newman joined himself to shoot.
He left his five daughters a letter with these verses: "It's ever and until the end your father was incredibly thankful for his good stars.
It was a honor to be here. '
And for us it was a honour to follow the life of a so intelligent and immense American player.
An example of citizens, in the closest and slowest sense.
What has been produced in the account manufacture of adject & anmp; Co.?
On October 8, the negotiations began in the criminal process against Yanos attack and its complications.
The accused shall, in particular, have been proposed to participate in organized crimes, as well as largely driving and business injuries, and other criminal acts, including documentation.
According to the State Authority, the funds bounded from the census were used for their own purposes, while the benefits carried out often have been carried out with false accounts.
State money and subsidies from self-administration - in total HUF 65 million - should be divided into the Fiatal Baloldal boxes of the Fiatal Baloldal Organization, as well as in the private boxs.
As noted by the investigation authorities, the accounts of the licensing of the creditor were submitted, and the complaints should not be complied with their obligations.
According to the Declaration, a majority of the accounts should be false.
The account blocks were purchased on the market of Józsefvaros, the round seals were offered in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies should be issued has been decided on the northern round of the Platte Sea, sent to the Istvane Lados of Yanos.
The Lados Pensions and restaurants should be finished in the trail of this "Accounting Tower".
He requested consumption accounts to be able to provide later accounts based on these schemes for the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social and Labour and the Budapest's self-administration.
These accounts should mostly be manipulated by István Lados and its complexs, András śri, which should have been responsible for the Constitution of the relevant reports.
One of the aims of Lados' "Invasion Tower" was a bierlocal.
As a result of two accounts issued by agression and co in 2003, the Gastronomic Employee has been engaged in the ninety-fourth group of the Convention of Byto Pont Egysület.
Now, however, the chief of the exploitation is that such a large group had not once agreed to the local.
Another account, issued in the summer 2002 on the Foundation Jobb Jövæért, later known as Egyptian a Harmadik Evezredertt, also includes serious form and content errors.
In a Pension in Badacsonytomy, which has only three rooms and is not able to hide more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests should have been maintained.
The fantasy of the accounts was apparently no borders, as it went to the Pigal Kft., a gastronomic company, in which booking documents of the customers Jobb Jévært and Hopaá, according to the accused authority, appeared.
As the director of business Gyśz Farkas of the hvg.hu informed him, it was immediately clear that it was about false documents when he was submitted by the State Authority during a questionnaire.
"Our company name and the tax number were wrong on the steel."
And further: Unlike form errors, the fact was wrong that the operation had to hide hundreds of people after they had in total 11 rooms that offer so many people place.
It has also been indicated on the account, if the restaurant isn't in operation for a long time.
The accounting cases also have been decreased to check that the Budapester travel office, which was taken in their views, offers only traveling to a foreign country, and thus indicated Hungary travels on the payment calculation, which also opposed the accounting practice of the company.
As noted in the course of the investigations, they have also indicated the multi-value tax, although travel offices that relate to a country outside the EU are free.
The amount of the amount of tax was totally in four of the Hotel Revvoleuxp Kft. to the foundation of Jobb Jövæt, as the operation is only 15% of VAT, and the employees will also be issued only machine accounts, but they were manually.
Another error in which the "receiver readers" was that they had indicated in a case of "warn transport" as a benefit, although this was not offered by the company specialized on investment board, the State Authority shared it.
Additional forms - false account format, false stempel - was to thank that the accounts issued in Egypt to Harmadik Evezredert Alapítvány, and the XXI. Századi Culturalis Egyesület and Bizto Pont could be extended as false accounts.
Also, in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the Sportler customer whose business manager had never been able to issue the accounts.
Another "Fehler" is the faults at the HIB Kft. from Nyriregyháza: This company is located at the time (2001) just in resolution that the Fatal Varosoért Egyesület group had to eat there - the masses manager has therefore argued that the accounts did not have themselves.
Consciously false
The other groups of accounting officers are persons who have been aware of their rational accounts.
At the request of the Faatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvalny has issued accounts for the Foundation Együtt a Harmadik Evezredert, in a height of about 4 million HUF.
According to the complaint, the manager of the Collab Kft was overlooked by one of the complainant Ludovic Györfi, to exhibit the fixed accounts.
The moment also in Liquidation, Biogate Kft., should also have worked with appeal and co.: In 2003, the GmbH should have provided the Foundation of Jobb Jövæért Alapítvány, as well as the Vereine Atlasz Egyesület and Vörosfenyō Egyesület with false accounts for the total value of HUF 5 million.
However, there was also little payment movement, since the accounts were immediately disfellowshipped after their exhibition, which were forgotten by the interests in their documents.
The third group of accounting officers includes persons directly connected to the complaint.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the post boat of the Ukrainian business leader of Delta Trio Kft., one in Budapest, but there is no reliable carriage and vehicle traffic company.
The company intended to issue a number of accounts on sales of EDV components in the total value of HUF some 18 million.
According to the investigation authority, the Cash Investment Kft, who is located in Liquidation since 14 September 2005, has been as buyer of the accounts from Kiskunhalas.
The manager of this company was a Romanian who should also be submitted by Iván Kubatov from 2002 to 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov has held a number of accounts on behalf of the GmbH. to the Verneine Atlasz and Hopaá, as well as to Egyptian a Harmadik Evezredert Alapítvány and has hidden its opposite value itself.
The firms Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos-Investment Bt. are to be found on express desires on Iván Kubatov's.
However, the company was not active, which was accused of non-employed contracts.
However, he could benefit from the companies: on request of his complexs, lawyer Zsolt Scente, who had been employed with the preparation of the company's bases, he has issued accounts on the blood associated with the actor, such as Atlasz and Y-Generació.
In total, Kubatov 15 accounts in the total value of HUF 14.2 million in behalf of the company Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linax Trade have issued to the organizations.
The State Authority believes that Kubatov could have decreased 10% of the account sums and the increased taxation.
Kubatov should even have used the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of fixed accounts - in this case, the accounts were added to the complaints of Byto Pont.
In January 2006, the company Y-Generation and Szövetség to Modernn Magyarországent have issued its applications for the common organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA").
Both of them received 500,000 fornts, however, these amounts have been used sufficiently.
In order to make this, they have the TMA five flexibility accounts of the Works Team Kft.
In addition, these accounts were assured in the Ministry of Education in the investigation of the Arpád Kemecsei Office.
The negotiations are now calculated by some complaints with awareness of the procedures of accounting, as they have already been sent before the State Authority.
A sense could be if the principal accused Yanos appeal to a comprehensive understanding is decided.
His previous information was, in fact, less detailed, and even though he had already been assigned to report fully about everything, his understanding is still outlined.
The question is therefore open if this is in its interest if socialists have a package with respect to the resurrection of the majority of HUF's 50 million damage, and whether the tax is ready to take account.
It is possible, however, that the attack plays the "leader" now after his search for mildness of incarceration and house arrests on babies ears.
While other crimes who are attributed to larger damage with economic crimes, and who have not been injured, on the free foot, or at least under the home prison, this appeal remains a chance.
Psychology of the transfer - or why we are ready to pay more
The purchaser is inclined to pay more and to overcome the levy offer.
Neurologs and economic researchers at the university of New York have now been able to discover the neurological-economic basiss of this and apparently irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the "Science" Magazine, people want to have a competition, such as a decrease on eBay and are therefore willing to pay even higher prices.
The researchers have tried to investigate the neurological scheme of this "Spiel" with experimental auctions.
A group of volunteers should play with Lotto, while others participate in a player action, in both cases the active brain regions of the probands were investigated through functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games the participants could win money, however, a increased activity of the strike, a complex outside the brain, measured by the loss of the auction, in which the transition of the enemy plays an essential role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-repayment" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore said that price increase was increased by avoiding a reaction of the strict.
In order to underminue these, the economists in the research group have established further research on the follow-up of the money.
In this case, three groups should be offered against a partner under different conditions.
The checking group was informed the real value of the product, and then they made their inputs.
Another group was also promised to reward $15 for the case they come out of the game as a winner.
The third group received $15 prior to the auction that were also lost in the case of a lost game.
Thus, the difference between two groups was only that the emphasis was on one on the win, while the other were on the loss.
As evidence for the hypothesis expressed by neurologs, the members of the "the loss of the" group were prepared for higher incentives than those in the control group or the "win" group.
"This results are not allowed to react from any previous economic theory.
Indeed, they have found the practices observed in auctions only with joy of winning or risk avoidance.
The resistance between these two theories was resolved by the imaged neurological procedures, so that we have stopped a third statement" - said Andrew Schotter, Professor of the Economic Faculty of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When is the doctor to stop?
Over the world around a half billion people suffer under chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is learned under the leading causes of death.
The number of infected persons is estimated to hundreds of thousands, but only seven thousand are treated, which is often not known that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the term of collection for different viruses, infectional liver diseases.
The symptoms are often similar - hepatitising and glucose are often, however, differently the droughters and the diseases between each other.
The hepatitis viruses are distributed in two different types: hepatitis A and E by transfusion treatment (e.g. by contaminated food or water), by hepatitis B, C and D, the virus can be transferred through blood and other body liquidities (e. g. sperma, divorce or speculal).
Re travellers will be recommended for infringement against the virus A and B in any case, there is no vaccine against the virus C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear about two-third weeks after the deterioration of the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by disadvantages, weaknesses, tumor pains and breath.
Then the skin skin and in the eyes, the steel is slightly, the skin is dark, and the skin can last up to two-third weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die each year with hepatitis B, larger diseases such as lever cancer and lever cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that estimations are only every ten infections in medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated can lead to liver cyrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their illness, since he destroys the lever cells home - in many cases the first symptoms after 20-30 years are shown.
It is therefore essential for temporary prevention, such as regular control studies.
There are three groups in which this disease is more frequent: those who have been subjected to a blood transfusion before 1991 are dependants on drugs and tatowed.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C diseases worldwide is estimated to 200 million.
Since sickness is already evidenceable in a routine laboratory investigation, it is ratifying to visit the home physician at the first signs of unknown origin.
Currently recognised, the disease is healable, the virus can be destroyed, using the infection control and predicting the decrease of cancer.
The 30 September was the World Day of Hepatitis, the first time of patients' treatments in the world in 2004.
The objective of the action is to strengthen the consciousness of the chronic injury caused by virus, their development and the importance of early recognition.
Does the believers have less pain?
As recent research results, the religious faith works as a kind of "anxiety", which has already been able to facilitate the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at the Oxford University have performed an interesting experience: It has been investigated how many of the faith in God affected the painfulness of humans, reported the British "Telegraph".
In the course of the most bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists received electronic chocks, while they studied a mile of the mother of God.
As the results showed, the believers could exclude the majority of the pain.
A brain scan technology could even be demonstrated that Catholics could activate the part of their brain that is responsible for the painful regulation.
The study was the first in a research project, which participated in the philosophs and theologists of various departments of the university in addition to scientists.
The probands were connected to the left hand, which declined the electronic chocks.
The participants were requested to concentrate strongly on two floors: to one image of the mother of God, called by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and to the other Leonardo da Vincis "Dame with Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the view of the Jewish Mary would be called under the believers a kind of religious trance, while they chosen the image of the Vincis, because it was little different from the other places and was calm.
The trials passed a half hour in a MR scanner, and in this time, 20 electronic chocks were totally in four steps, while they should see the religion, or the other places.
The Catholics reported that they would feel "in security" at the view of the mother of God, as if they were "ensured", and they would have recommended "Trace and Peace".
During the consideration of the religious gems, they reported more than 12% less pain than if they had before Leonardo’s work.
Psychologue Miguel Farias, who also participated in the trial, said that there could also be similar effects with other, strong images, even with the atheists, to find the corresponding photo.
"We should find a image that solve very positive effects, such as a mother or father," says the psychologue.
The English Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The practitioning of faith should change our personality, and it is also in many cases," says Wright.
After these amazing results, only the question of what effects a Madonna image Leonardos or another comparable times would have on the pain regulation of believers.
Does the quality youth Maria's highest girl will have better results?
You're what you're talking about.
On the basis of her tenth birthday, Google can say with flight and right: it is to find in the taste of people as well as their heads on the sky: you know where people have passed their holidays, to whom specialists they go, and what they move.
And that's still not enough, Eric Schmidt, one of the Google business leaders.
In the direction of Skepticers, which are placed by Orwellen Horror visions, it will be possible: These would only be viewed by the main part of the web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said that the main objective of Google is to collect more personal data about the users and to draw closer to the original objective of the company, which would like to "all this world's information".
Schmidt explained that Google is still a changed world work after ten years after the beginning of the Information Summit.
After the status Quo in five years, Schmidt said that he would wish Google would be able to ask questions like "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What job really takes to me?", however, the software programs are not yet possible because they don't know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are clear that the search terms would be registered in the way of their Internet research, as well as the IP addresses that have been searched for, and the visiting pages.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to save its own search event and later to make it possible to generate a lot more accurate later, and also based on the same logic the "recommendations" mentioned in which the system is recommended as a result of the previous preferences.
The users, however, ask what happens in the case of a misconduct - "When you see what I do" - some of them are worried about the Google datamonopols.
In most cases, however, it is mostly the potential power represented by the company, which is affected by fear, and less the debt feeling or fear of punishment, the struggle by freedom or restraint against the power that causes refusal in many Internet users.
However, it is a proof that the terms of search are not only stored but not only to third parties, and there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet users in these cases.
A parade game for this was soon the action against paedofilia in Brazil, in the Google of the Brazilian government, collected by the Community site named "Orctus" and also enabled the identity of the paedofils.
In order to take care of personal rights, users could still be able to investigate when Google was successful with the EFF Civil Rights Organization towards the FBI. In the future, Google can also be able to provide information to the FBI on secret requests.
(But the federal government has successfully carried out the production of 50,000 web addresses and 1.000 search terms in reference to the last year adopted youth protection law, but it has been maintained the list of individual users relating to their web and search lists in two months.)
Googles images therefore remain shocked: those who do not disclose their personal data because they fear the loss of their privacy and intimity, the company with which the maintenance of the conservative company is constituted.
Indeed, the American "Geek culture", which is presented in many countries, is encouraging computer fans, actives and users, which are the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, in contrast to Microsoft, which is the leader of Windows, even if both fighting for the same goal.
A possible reason for this is that Google does not require its users in contrast to Microsoft, and its services are free of charge, so that a open, permanently updated source code and program package seems to be attractive, young and cooler than the official practices of the software guiding.
On the other hand, geeks consider the problemtic relationship of personal rights and the Internet measuring - a relationship, especially in the past years thanks to the term 'Web 2.0'.
In fact, "Web 2.0" is nothing else than to cooperate, speaking, the users left on the shoes and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are individually different, the main matter remains the same as the public.
A mean youth can be managed at several Community ports - from Facebook via Xanga, this can be connected to other services such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and all this can eventually be connected to a follow-up system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, you can also connect blogs that are automatically designed by the latest photo galleries on Flickr or Picasa.
And a series of other cases show: In view of the party photos of the last night, the friend’s friends will soon find out whom she enjoyed her unloved friends, or whom the employee will be left, because he only makes his wrongdoer honestly about the company management air - one is safe: the term "Privatsphere" has been re-interpreted in a few times.
Who leads a online life is what he's worthy - so in almost the fundamental ideas could be formed behind the behavior of today's youth.
And whoever trys to keep something secret, or even to handle the Google monopole, it can be like to do - such as with scroogle, a tool that accepts Google's search machine, but it doesn't leave shoes.
Not few people do not register on Community pages so that they are not found, but also the online applications of Google, such as text processing and graphic tools and RSS feeds, can be used with alternative versions that are not connected to no major server parks and therefore not generate the best possible profile by the user.
The public's opinion, however, is expected until Google shows its real face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even before IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 million) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the advertising surfaces of AdWords/AdSense are threatening the income of the advertising agencys, which provides not only Microsoft, but also other software developmenters.
However, critical observers also found the threatening opposition: so, at the time of the convergence, a protest of the employees has been decreased, due to the costs of the strong child garden, which also means the management of the multi-meaning of the employeees to be cost-related, but it would be quiet to say that Google went to the China government even in 2006 and agreed with a agreement, which would be filtered against the good machine.
The internal rule of the concert states that no new service will be obtained before, but only if it is already available. However, some of the events of the next months and years may be strongly rebuilding: while some say that Google's book and magazinscan projects are taking a wide range of extents that the company should immediately interfere with the Supreme Court of Justice, others are more concerned about the "Health" system, which makes a complete health profile based on funding, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database, the next generation of the Sci-Fi authors provides the substance - about "Scroogled", the famous Roman of Cory Doctorow describes in the best oral manner a future in which a person is close to fearing data by Google.
Two youths help the double murderer of Ozd at the cutting
With regard to the double murder of Ozd, the police has now heard two young people who are suspected to have helped with the elimination of the scenes to share the speaker of the police Commissioner Borsod on Tuesday.
The young people were continuously, at the time they were accused of the aid.
According to information from the MTI News Agency, two girls are defending themselves freely.
aid is threatened by a punishment of freedom from up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ozd, a 23-year-old ort suicide man, was taken into investigation on Sunday.
The man is under an urgent suspect of murdering several persons from money.
In the course of the investigations, the 23-year-old debt of a 53-year-old year had increased money.
However, the suspecter did not want to compare his debts, so he locked his believers on the middle of the night on an eye, where he killed him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man planned the fact of a long hand - this also proves that he began murdering with a gun hidden on the murder.
With the experts, the police now investigates the actual weapons and the conditions of its use.
Warschauer Börse shopping box for Prager Börse
Rund 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech chronic crowns offered the warschauer Börse for the hundred percent purchase of the share packages of the Prayer Börse.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warschauer Börse, confirmed the offer that the Poland had made, despite the fact, that they were previously excluded from the Czech than possible owners of their bridges.
This is why the warrior's burse is very common to the State.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Poland State, but they want to declare more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
According to the reports of the Czech day period "E15", the offers of Poland include the highest purchase price that has been offered for the Prayer Börse.
As reported in the newspaper, the Vienna Börse, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Burse and the German Burse offers.
Petr Koblic, Chief of the Prayer Börse, said that all interested persons would probably be the worst new owners, and he did not conclude that it could even lead to the end of the speaker Börse in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prager Börse at 5-10 billion chronicles.
According to the shareholders' agreements, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The Patricia Finance Investment Bank is the largest owner of the Prager Börse with a 25% participation, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7% and the Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5%.
Financial crisis from the view of European newspapers
In their comments on the continued international financial crisis, some European leading letters have already been speaking on Tuesday.
The global financial disaster has been thankful to the American President, said about "La Republic" - the President has never ever been able to make its own party to the draft legislation towards one who should bring some lifting into the slowest situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as the milliardary investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more suitable to speak about a "earth 11 September".
parts of the press in Madrid also run the sinbock in Washington.
The "El Mundo" considers that the lack of political leadership is debt that the world economy is now on the border of the counterbreak.
The American Financial System is still more threatening to gather, including the world.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now after the vote at the Congress, it threatens that Washington hasn't stopped political resources for crisis management.
The world economy is in the air, just at a time, since one of the largest transformations of capitalism.
You can't leave the threat out of eight, but about the gene "day displayer".
However, some States could also provide their currency packs for cash institutions, and the banks save the money of the taxpayers before the bank route.
However, if a domino effect is resolved and more banks are going to be able to help any other financial aspects or other emergency measures.
Long-term EU Member States should be broken over their shadows and centralize the controls on the monetary markets.
On Monday, more than 100 billion euros were paid to weak currency institutions, the winner "The Standard" reminders. In addition, the newspaper continues to be more realistic that, after the Americans, the European taxpayers should also take something deeply in their tasks to get out of the crisis.
Until then, the EU has not severely disagreed with the crisis, which now comes as a Tsunami over the old continents.
The "reserve" should not immediately with several hundreds of billion euros "wednes", but it would be slightly able to determine in what case the money of taxpayers should be accompanied to decrease even more damage.
Intelligent car imits the aircraft of the Hummel
What would be the best method to develop new technologies to avoid accidents if it is not to empty obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, the beasts.
A surprising project was presented in Japan, where the Nissan Engineering of Hummeln was inspired in creating new accidental systems.
In cooperation with the Tokioth University, Nissan has built the biomimetic system controlled by author bombers to avoid a mini auto, equipped with the properties of the beasts, with the objective of supporting the development of a system that prevents any collisions.
In the flight, each kids form their own, oval "Privat Area", which is very similar to our own "Schutzschild", said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for Technology and Research Development, at the exhibition.
The assembled eye of the beasts that can see in each direction and in a angle of over 300 degrees plays an important role.
In order to follow the function of the assembled eye, the researchers pointed out the idea of the lasered distance mediterranean.
This identifies barriers before the BR23C in a face range of 180 degrees within 2 meters, calculates their removal and sends signals to the microprocessor to the board that immediately introduces the coalition prevention process.
The obstacle is registered in seconds burning, and the author booster immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the beasts by turning the rings around the corresponding angles.
In contrast to existing systems, this manual is instinct.
"If it wasn't that, the author could not react enoughly to avoid obstacles," Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the "Moability Laboratory" and the authorboat projects.
The system must be instinct and immediately reacting, since this technology corresponds to the most internal and healthy part of the protection distinction - a stage that is still inevitable within the accidents.
The whole process must reflect the behavior of the beasts when they escape other bees.
And that's got to stop in the brain of a second.
However, in contrast to the beasts, not up, down, or diagonal, it can only be twodimensional, but only in direction of the vulnerability of the rifs.
While the bees are finally opened here, many of the possibilities to avoid other bees, the researchers could only be used to the author-booter for the driving movement, as regards the speed and debris.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are easier and energy efficiency, and therefore have a longer life period than cosmical lithium ionium batteries.
Andoh explained that it comes to the instinct, intelligent reaction, and less on the processing of data, and less on the ability to save it.
This device must be processed only for seconds and react accordingly to them.
It must not save this or produce an intuitive, logical reaction in previous manuscripts so that it will only take a handful KB memoryy.
No gigabytes and megabytes memorys need.
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision prevention technology that will be seriously produced after evaluation of Nissan within the next ten years.
Another application could find the technologie in the GPS satellite navigation by conscious of the driver slowly hinders and leading it to the target.
A name for the student kid
Now the written version of the 700-Mrd-Dollar has a serious saving package which will be applied in several steps and aimed at buying the bad credits of the banks.
The first step is to be issued by half of the money.
At a meeting, which ended on Saturday after midnight in East Coast, the Congress Members, after a period of debates, have been reported to an agreement on the 700 billion dollars serious saving package.
"We have made significant progress", said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President in the American Deputy House, and said that we should only put the agreement to paper.
The achieved compromise on the saving package supported both Presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finnish Minister Henry Paulson said that the program will show effects and will be effective, but you should do more. According to Pelosi, it was not about the saving of the Wall Street, but because of this, the ruler of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the Asian markets were opened, so Washington time Sunday at 8:00 p.m. (M.M., Monday, 2 p.m.), but no high flight was removed on the Börsen.
On Monday, the Deputy's Budget on the draft legislation on the stabilisation of the economy of 2008, then the Senate is on the line.
President George W. Bush spoke on Saturday with Pelosi, and the White House also welcomed the news about the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress achieved in the night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our markets and to protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, speaker of the White House.
The programme, however, depends on the original recommendation of the Bush administration, which the $700 billion should be issued once for the purchase, with creditors assigned value papers.
In a first tranche, the maximum half of the 700-millionary allocations should be issued, where 250 billion are immediately available after the Congress is expected to vote on Monday. This sum is to be used for the purchase of credited, badly value papers, and more than 100 billion USD will decide the President.
The programme is reviewed by a own Commission, which also listens to the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on another decision of the Congress.
In the sense of the law, the Ministry of Finance may also apply a combinated tactic: it can also buy bad credits, hypotheks, and value papers covered with hypotheses, or other "good" credits.
As reported by the Ministerial authorities, the purchase may be carried out directly and directly.
The law allows the undertakings concerned to participate in an insurance programme where the Ministry of Finance guarantees the caregiving resources, and the companies pay the expected damages.
Henry Paulsen said that the law defines the necessary resources that can be provided as an immediate aid for the US financial system if it is possible for the larger purchase of bad resources, its insurance, or the prevention of a system risk that is removed by a larger currency institution.
We put the necessary steps to ensure that we are ready to introduce the law when it was signed, Paulson.
However, the heads of the banks who are in difficulty and who are now attributed to State aid may acknowledge that their deferences called "Golden Handshake" in the overseas are shortened by the government.
A decline of the holder will only be given in certain cases, and these cuts will be decreased from how the Ministry of Finance will help each other.
The currency means that if the Ministry purchases an auction, the "golden handshake" is taxed, except if the extensive bank head is cut into the pension.
In the case of a direct purchase of false credits, the government will be aggressively enabled to ensure that the managers are not transferred.
The image is also that the existing Golden Handshake treaties will not be changed - the limitations relate only to new agreements so that more people participate in the programme.
This is the first case in the American history that torment is regulated by law by managers, the Democracy Barney Frank, Chairman of the Financial Committee, commented on the measures.
The State grants the banks participating, so that the risk for taxpayers will be reduced, as it can also be involved when it goes back to the economy and also the saved bank.
The draft legislation proposes that the President must submit a proposal to the Congress in the next five years, how tax payers should return their lost money from the financial sector.
However, on both sides, skepticers, who expressed their doubts in respect of the plan.
This is not what the American citizens expect from us, the plan protects no case the money of tax payers, as the Californian Republic Darrell Issa.
His colleagues from Ohio, Mary Captur said: The measures were taken by the same persons who are also responsible for the Wall Street colleagues.

No Visum anymore in the USA from 2009?
Kinga Hincz looks good chances for the American and Ungarn Visual Agreement will enter into force on 12 boys, as the Minister of Foreign Affairs declared before the representatives of the Hungary Community in Chicago.
Your view is: "If the electronic immigration control system will still be introduced in the Lake Sea."

Barack Obama and McCain support the saving package for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two Presidential Chairpersons of the United States Party, have supported a severe saving package for $700 billion on Sunday. However, there are also politicians who call for the department of the Finance.
The Congress and representatives of the Government have announced the day after Marathon's discussions that they have come to an agreement on the bank salvation package.
The crisis of the Wall Street, as well as the relief of the frozen credit market, was on the central issues of the presidency campaign.
Obama and McCain - both said to be better suitable than the enemy to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
After recent investigations, Obama was able to continue to build the economic themes, while McCains Hoch, who has decided to be the representative of the Vice-Presidential Chairman Sarah Palin after the Republic of the Convention, is also schools.
At a election campaign meeting in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the Congress will take a serious package of $700 billion.
He stressed that the plan also contains the passengers of consumer protection that he supported.
"We have to act now, as responsible (...) - your jobs, your departures, all the industry, and the stability of the whole economy," he said 35 000 observers.
He didn't want to call McCains' economic visions as "obsolet".

Pressview of German language space
The right placer is intact, only the choicers have been in the layer of self-consciousness - so comments "The Spiegel" the weak performance of the CSU in Bayern.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to register to prevent a red-free coalition.
The spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the online output of the German news machine set on the left, Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the dramatic CSU reverse in its article "Bayern's Revolution destroys their fathers".
According to the named polytologs, CSU's erosion began long before the tragic Beckstein Houber Duo overlooked his officers.
Christians have renewed battles over decades - now the modern citizens are just out of them.
The Epochenbruch is at the same time a problem of Christian democracy, as well as Angela Merkel.
The CSU disaster did not be surprised, but on Sunday something has ended, but it has already been signed about 10 years ago: the untruthful hegemony of a State party.
Because 10 years ago, 1998, the CSU was at 47.7% and the first time since the fifty-year-old market was divided into the fifty-procent market.
It repeated three years ago at the Federal Day 2005, so still in the many quoted staiber era.
The consequent modernisation by the CSU in the Federal State has finally destroyed their own mothers and parents.
Sociologs had prognosed this 40 years ago, but at the time it was significantly estimated, but without effect, the secularization, the results of education, the starting of Eastern and Northern Germans in the prosperous regions of Bayerns, could not remain the faith of the CSU electors.
Modernization is always in line with optional reduction, and it has political implications.
The right placer is intact - only the choicers within the layer were critical and voluntary.
It is unreasonable that in the last few weeks the classic citizen groups just expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the free professionals, the commercial citizenship and the elections, such as high school closure.
The support of the CSU was at least 40 per cent.
Press (depresse.com)
The conservative Wiener’s daily newspaper reports in its "Who with who? Participants continue to continue in Coalition Questions" article on the chaotic internal policy in Austria after the new choice.
The SPUE wants to negotiate with the ESF.
The EVP shall prohibit the injection of the SPUE in internal matters.
In all directions, the BZÖ is open for discussions, while the greens are not to be determined with regard to coalition.
The new choices are over, and now all turns to the coalition; in the debates in the public and legal television, the parties were not looking at their cards.
SPÓ-Chef Werner Faymann confirmed his desire to negotiate with the EVP.
The SPUE wants to show that a cooperation of both parties is very well - in some federal countries and in the social partnership is already the case.
The question whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, who is currently the EBP Chief as a vice-cancer, leaves Faymann open.
As he said, the electioners had chosen the shooter currency.
A repetition of this direction is not in question.
Moterer was carefully reacted on red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, if Faymann tried to be in the internal concerns of the AVP.
Whether his party is opposed, or coalition, is currently fully open, and these questions should be discussed in the internal EBP.
BZÃ-Chef Jörg Haider showed himself in all directions.
"We are ready to take government responsibilities to prevent red-floor," says Haider.
Yaroka: The devil circle of poverty and segregation must be interrupted
Today, in Paris, the European Assembly has started the equality of opportunities, which is directed by the EU-Rate Presidency France.
Livia Yaroka, Fidez-Chairman of the European People's Party, noted, in particular, on the educational segregation, as it is one of the most seriously violations of the laws that the Roman Sweden is opposed, even if this is the greatest obstacle to their implementation needs.
The high-ranging conference was opened by the French Minister of Employment and Social Affairs Xavier, on behalf of the French Council, and Vladimir Spidla, the Commission for employment, social affairs and opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, European social partners, as well as the most important European legislative and citizens organizations in the field of equality.
As reported by the press office of the EP's Fidesz, Yaroka noted that further discrimination in the job search, which the Roma, firstly because of its low-education levels of the labour market, would be reduced.
"The overwhelming majority of the Roman youth has no secondary education, and only a small part of them can reach a high school."
Jaroka further stressed that education is a fundamental human rights, which is a key role in implementing other human rights.
Investment in the early education of Roman kids could strengthen the economy of the EU Member States.
On the other hand, it is important that the partnerships will be aware of the most wide circle possible, such as Rome and non-Roma.
Because early, a Roman student starts the school to increase its opportunities to become a productive member of the labour market; and through revenue and transfer taxes, they contribute to the national expenditure.
"If Union citizens, the Roma must be guaranteed the right to high quality education - the bad and secretary education should be set", says Livia Yaroka.
As the Member stated, a common, objective and negotiative action of the European Union is necessary to accelerate the development process in the educational sector, which is essentially the correct compliance of existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"We must interrupt the devil crystal from poverty, segregation, and unemployment, and give the Romans the democratic possibilities to contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens," said Japan.
Since the Congress in Berlin last year, the Summit will be launched with the objective of a unique forum for the predetermination of the objectives of equalness and discrimination at European, but also national level, in the sense of the "European Year of Equality".
CSU: Good at time
Finally, in October, it will be decided by the shift of the fallen Duos Huber-Beckstein
In spite of the Bairic CSU, the personal debates were covered.
Participant Erwin Huber and Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is only how long this grace is given.
On the switch rate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17% losses of stimm will be decided at the extraordinary party in October last weekend.
But the so-called Duo has already seen that it does not want to clothe on their seeds.
In this way, they want to join the enhanced group and the party's base, which one day after the "bayerian Tsunami" in view of the loss of the absolute majority of personal consequences.
Before five years ago, Edmund Staiber, who was at its career higher point, reached 60.7 per cent, but now only 43.4 per cent of the votes were able to ensure.
The CSU was 46 years old in Bayern, 18% of the German BIP.
The conservatorys remain the determinant force in which the sugar federals also are important for the Hungarian economy, but they will have to be registered in a coalition future.
As the first sign of the participating restructuring, the potential follower Hubers, Vice-President and Federal Agricultural Minister Horst Seahofer will also be joined in the team of expertise, which leads to the liberal FDP, in relation to the legal "Free Elections" discussions on a possible monetary coalition.
One ironia of the ships is equal to that with the "Free Electors" list, Gabriele Pauli entered into the legislation that the anti-stairs have first used the Huber Beckstein Duo to then reserve the targeted political politician.
The CSU leadership now concentrates all its forces on the stabilisation of Becksteins.
In this transitional process, Staiber, who has taken the floors out of the background, is an active role: the former Prime Minister and the CSU president called the "the last day of his political routes".
In Monday, Huber made some gifting comments in the direction of the CDU - his views would have made the CSU more support of the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the distortion as a signal to the CDD and thus to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which has also contributed to a lot of success at the national level 2005, is not re-enabled to a common force act, Merkel may not be a candidate after the federal day election in September 2009.
Merkel, who has not made a heal from its disappointment over the Fiasko, believes that the loss of the land of the CSU will not affect the great coalition in Berlin.
However, what is relative: the lost CSU will not be easier to register, and the crisis of social democracy continues.
With 18.6 per cent, SPD has reached its best results in Bayern since 1946.
Lukacenko Opposition: 110-0
The elections on Sunday have not done the opposition in the Ukrainian Parliament.
The Russian observers believe that this is the welfare and stability in the country carried out by Alexander Lukachenko, however, the OECD constitutes legislative competences in the appointment of the votes.
The OECD, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognized the elections.
The legislation of the 10-millionary-resident state has not been opposed for decades, but the counterparty, in the name of the "Democratic Forces" (ODS), has seen seriously expected that Lukaschenko, who would have been renewed for the electorals and by a Constitutional amendment of 2006, would allow some Members to "accepte".
Therefore, the ODS has even taken away from the previously planned boycoat.
Ukrainian has been increasingly depending on the increased prices in the earthquake import of Russia, and even for the reducing of price increases, and the country has also agreed to the provision of the Beltransgase gas, the owner of the gas pipeline leading by the country to the Russians. In the context of the opposition expected that Ukraine would like to improve its relationship with the EU after Lukaschenko and other high-border political systems because of the anti-democratic systems in the EU.
For an interim dispatch, the evaluation report of the elections of the OECD was concerned, in which the attention was higher on the positive movements, instead of the density, as well as the resolution of a third party of the opposition candidates.
However, the rapid report of the OECD was already criticized by the campaign - which would not be in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition to the vote was not present.
Despite all the oppositions, a political defence has been recognized: political prisoners have been placed at almost free foot, and Minsk is even prepared for smaller conflicts with Moscow by continuing recognition of the independence of the African provinces of South-Osseien and Abschasia, although Russia, with which Ukraine is a federal state on the paper, has been considered as an independent one month.
"We have made two steps before and a back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between the white and the EU has started", said Alexander Milinkewitch to our board.
According to the Opposition Chairman of the Presidential election of 2006, it is a wish to continue, although "the Powers have feared, but only a opposition in the Parliament."
The opposition does not provide protection measures in view of the results, but it is better to try to clarify the need for an economic reform.
"We have been fighting here with many problems - the opposite newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities put us into the way when we shooting stones, but I see that more people have supported the change, even older people," said Milinke witch, in remarking that the most supported stage of pensionists with the Lukaschenko regime is not once agreed with the only service that is the production of social security.
"Thank the debt of the country and the increase in the deficit of trade is just a question of time until the "social security" in the style of a Friedhof begins", says Milinkewitz.
In contrast to opposition policy, Russian observers have called the elections democracy.
Sergej Lebedev, Chief of the Mission of the Community Independent States, explained the news agency Ria Novosti: "The people believe the acts and not the words." The lack of opposition is therefore a evidence for the driving of the Russian electors.
Brunetta: "It's been broken before the work."
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi, there are turning doors for the officers' in- and outcomes.
From today, the measures will be taken into force against the slammers that are first shut up and then go to coffee drinks during the worktime.
The new "Anti-Faulpelz-Seat" was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Ministerial Council.
">" Treasurable doors are a means to increase labour efficiency through a higher presence rate and more services", says Minister Brunetta.
"Now begins a new time of responsibility and transparency.
This is reformism," Brunetta adds again.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the introduction ends in all buildings of the Ministry of Ministers.
Masi says here: "The choice of the turnable doors is also of great symbolic value".
There was no resistance from the officials, assured the Secretary-General: "This process was supported by all of them, the cooperation came from all sides."
There is no breakfast now in the worktime; finally with coffee or Crenti .
Brunetta is in this regard with a laugh: "A good cappuccino works at 7 a.m. is wonderful."
During a meeting of the Supreme Committee of Public Administration (Summit School of Public Administration)
From Rome, the minister announces that “in three months the deficiencies of officers have reduced by 50%, which means 60,000 people per year are present in the work”.
It adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the public administration of Italy
"the loan dynamics - so the Minister, in the last 8-10 years, were doubled as the private area and far beyond the inflation rate."
In addition, thousands of officials were joined in order to work on the Brunetta Decree in the framework of the vocational supported by Codacons.
"When the minister for Public Service is profiled by numbers of lower deferences in the work - it writes the consumer centre - increases the people of the 'actived folks'.
Indeed, thousands have met correct and valuable officials of the public service in order to explain the opposite standards of the Decree."
In particular, the regional administrative court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for working disease, and the planned expansion of the forced home arrest of the hospital workers, whereby control visits and other aspects of the renewment of the minister will be made.
Napolitano: "Prevention against labour accidents is crucial"
Each day in Italy occurred 2500 job accidents, three people died and 27 remain invalid.
For 2007, the Inail's data (National Institute against Labour Diseases) is confirmed that the death accidents were at about 1200.
These paragraphs refer to the importance of a phenomenon, which is almost doublely caused by so many death attacks that were caused by murder.
Today the smile (Association National Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) will take place in all provinces of Italy the 58th national day for the victims of labour accidents, so that the attention of the social institutions and media is to this dramatic situation.
"The concerning leaders, the data distributed by Anmil and the tragic news of these days, as the question of prevention is crucial in the workplace, confirms the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in his communication to the President of the Office (National Mutilati and invalidi of the work) Peter Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses its "a great appreciation for the continuing commitment to prevent workplaces, to protect the lost workers, to assist the families of victims and to sensitify public opinion."
"An "Basta" recommended has taken place; of course, in tragedies, which, in measuring their size order, solve some mixtures in the media and share of the public. But the everyday reality is often faced with dramatic events that can even repeat in their own dynamics."
Napolitano does not refuse that "this has also a resource problem: it must be invested in education and information."
In particular, the many initiatives towards direct conscience in school frame are the young people who are close to the work world.
It is our obligation to give attention to this phenomenon and not to abide by its social relief. We must put into force and improve a legislative standard.
On the other hand, the President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed "as the phenomenon of labour cases constituted a urgent social emergency, which makes the conscience of us all, and imposes all institutions to work on decision-making rules that aim to end the problem."
"The data of labour accidents seem to be a light improvement, but this does not conclude that the number of losses required to work is too high", emphasizes the President of the Emil, Peter Mercandelli.
"We don't want that this "positive tendency" means less attention, just as it causes the tragedy at the end."
"Why believe that you are taking too little on the basis to match the phenomenon of accidents, but you can fight by different actions.
Strengthening controls and inspections are necessary – so Mercandelli, but also more measures to clarify the workers who are already starting at school."
"Another effort is needed - so it adds - to what is the communication and the sensibilization of the public opinion.
However, especially, it is a greater responsibility feeling of the workers' sides of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli was also talking about the "progressed deterioration of the protection of labour sacrifices" and proposed the "remotation of the social system that we fight in the past years".
"The goal is therefore to return to the employer a guarantee to ensure that the sacrifice of a labour accident is not dependent on voluntary or accidental costs that are decided for time by a lawyer."
Mp3 player under charge: Risk of hearing damage
To hear music over a longer period with tragable music devices, such as Mp3 player, can lead to permanent hearing damages.
This reports the European Commission, which is quoted by the EU's opinion of Csserri (the Scientific Committee on the current and recently identified health risks) in a report in Brussels.
"And the report - it is, in a note - it is clear that 5-10% of those who have at least five years of life than a hour of music with tragable music devices are risking the loss of their ear."
"I'm worried that such a large number of youths, which are normally tragable music devices and phones on a high volume, their ears without knowing it unfortunately", says Meglena Kuneva.
"As the scientific foundations – so it is called by the euro – shows a clear risk that causes too fast trafficking.
What really means is to sensibilize consumers and to make these information about measuring.
In view of these scientific expertise, we need to review the already existing control systems so that they are fully effective and keep the new technology step."
Brussels, the independent scientific committee had been employed by young people in view of the broad use of the tragable music devices.
"The scientists - so confirms the EU's communication - that they are very concerned and that the European Commission will now be investigating the necessary measures to protect children and adolescents from traceable music devices and similar devices. "
There is already a European standard that limits the level of the large of tragable music devices to 100 dB and concerns about the damages that could come from a too large load of equipment.
These damages can be extremely limited, in which they are covered to solutions such as the reduction of the volume and the length of the vision.
In their report, the Scientific Committee of the European Union points out that if the users of tragable music devices heard only five hours a week (as far as 89 decibel) music, so that the legal borders are already exceeded, which are applicable to the maximum equipment shuttle at the workplace.
Those who exceed these borders risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
It is therefore 5-10% of the users of such devices whose number can be estimated between 2,5 and 10 million people in the euro.
Rome, Germany, provides the Commission for the future of the capital.
We're going to begin today, in March, we'll be able to take a balance in June.
This is the end set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the capital city of Rome" and the Commission has taken place at the new seat in the morning after the Caracalla themes.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
When the project is completed, the Council will evaluate the analysis and projects to be able to present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "Official Steel" of Capitol and the Supreme Citizen Gianni Alemano.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in her", emphasizes Germany. "They will provide proposals for a Roma development plan which remains politically responsible for the Council.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, just the will to have a place where you can develop a large project for Rome.
In March its task will be completed, and the Commission will resolve, since such projects need to have a timely endpoint.
In June, the Supreme Citizens announces that we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work provided by the Commission."
The Commission's competence in question, since its view is bound to be responsibility, said Germany: "All of these are the work that the Commission will provide and depend on the quality of its proposals.
If it, as in France the Attali Commission, provides qualitative results – and that will certainly be in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
The policy is often employed with the daily problems and emergency that are at time.
However, we want to have a longer period to work seriously in a deep perspective on the development of Rome and the future of the city."
The Supreme Citizens Rome is worth expressing the following: "This Commission is no useless institution, nor a wrack: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens, and it will make us think of it, and it will take us the best head of the capital city."
According to Alemão, "It is necessary to have a strategic plan, which is not hermétically or statistically to allow our city a quality switch - which she really needs - to make a common step in the future."
A future, as the Supreme Citizens Rome, which "do not only be limited to the existing communal borders but also will be seen much further", is not only with regard to the role of Rome as a metropole and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American President?
A famous American politician, who is very independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who was decimated by his decisions that decimated the economy of the United States and who had a relationship with the defended Islamic relations (which is still doing this as a private man today).
The attacks against Obama will always be stronger, right now where the choices are closer.
A woman from Miami wrote on a Internet page: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very fresh: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation that has seen in total two black governances and five black senators!".
In fact, however, these attacks do not have much to say; it is about racial attacks and they do not answer the question of the electors: will he be a good President? And then there are the investigations; everyone says that Obama will win with a great pretext.
There are also people who are talking to the heart and not to the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, has written in their editorials: only in the election box, we will be sure we will know whom the real American patriote will give his voice.
There is an intelligence of the United States that has been hidden until last.
"Cause what you want, then we'll decide to make our crystal or obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we're going to emigr from America.
something you never heard before – just now where the success of the black candidate seems so safe.
In all cases, despite all these considerations, the final weapons for the Democratics is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: What error has Bush started during his office? 89% responded: the war in Iraq.
American changes.
The nation lost 50000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent back to the home with a tritt.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers have lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
However, the Iraqi remains for the majority of Bush's weak point.
The one who is taken his place is before a huge task.
U.S. Financial Success also posted his scenes at journalists: In the newspapers you can already feel the cuttings. And many accused the Internet, the "Promotor" of the press.
Fifty hundred American journalists were asked about the future by PEW Research Center on their situation and their mental controls.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimist about their future.
However, they were not really concerned about the information regarding competencies in terms of general credibility.
You don't feel alone as before.
The problem for American journalists is money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a economic model that has been destroyed.
Additionally, the major problems in which the newsroom is taken, so the area, in which the editors work to collect the newspapers.
This is a problem that must be solved – so the interviewed journalists – if you want to prevent the traditional journalism, as the large public understands it, is not essential.
A clear, but complicated pessimism is now complied with the American journalist.
Six from ten journalists and executive seniors of the press are the view that journalism is on national level in the wrong way.
In the local area, the executives are even 65 %.
Printed by Mr Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine what direction the web is.
The most important segment groups are the way towards the Internet, which is viewed by many as the "motor" of the press press.
The "economic pressure", which the journalists feel, has increased up to 79 %.
The 500 interviewed journalists have given themselves to join the new technology in hope "this brings something good for journalism".
The biggest risk is in the American journalism today between the newspapers and reporters who work for them.
56% of the owners at national level are sure that their reporters share their values with them, while only 23% at the local level.
Some think it's to do with the "security in the work."
The operational leaders who are afraid to lose their work within three years are 47% at national level.
The journalists are 30%.
The theme of the "safe work" in the team (including "editors", Anm. d. Red.) is always a current subject in the United States.
Only 13% of journalists are working under contract.
In a huge nation, as the United States are, with 300 million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and television senders, and Internet suppliers, the employees offer how it is popular to them, so it will be a question of take it or leave it.
Chef provides very often very high wages, but the editor can only receive 10000 euros per month, so pension and insurance payers.
As regards the holiday, the matter will be complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third to reach a certain number of years of vacation.
But the American journalists will be, as they themselves admit, often "ill" during the year.
It's a question of the climate.
UNIPOL: GERICHT IN ROM: DANILO COPPOLA BLEIBLE IN GROTTAFERRATION
The President of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Court of Justice in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to derogate the request of the real estatemaker, which was requested to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It will be identified against Coppola for bankrot in the context of the investigation on contravention in the case of the adoption of the Unipol bank.
During the process against him during the last week, his release from the house arrest was converted into a residence duty in Grottaferrata.
His advisers Michele Gentilni and Gaetano Pecorella had requested to allow the real estatemaker to be allowed from the province in a apartment in the capital city.
According to the Court, the court could give him the possibility to influence his society and reach its complainant proof material.
Elite is in danger
The phenomena had been revealed just a few days ago when the Deputy Chamber against the 700 billion Dollar Sparpacket of the White House was true: a large part of the Americans was more interested in punishing the Wall Street than to save the economy.
This confirms the strict edition of the New York Times, reporting about how the crisis in the course of the Republic of the United States, which is increasingly slow in its old and moderate East Coast Seele, which always favoured the state institutions and the business community, and which "these in Washington" and the financial world are feasiblely resisting, and e.g. in the south and the centre of the States.
This part of the Party thanks the vote I mentioned above.
This so-called example is, however, only a small part of the major changes that are announced or even represented by the current economic earthquake: not only in the United States, but also in the whole west, and may also be affected beyond this.
Even in the countries and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long-term feared events that will finally take and shine in these new conditions.
The first phenomenon is the rediscovering, the unexpected renaissance of the State in connection with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline of bank and financial institutions that have close links to the foreign and also managed an unexpected amount of possessions of private households living in a single State.
This means a immediate political problem for governments: how to be treated against the families concerned, who are also a great choice master.
As a result, the crisis appears to be globally, politically, and it is almost pure national.
The internationalism seems to be able to be in the side and have lost his right to speak: the lightful evidence for this is given by the EU that is not to find a common way because of their division in various national and international conflicts.
Therefore, all with the invasion of the own State, savings plans, new rules, and for example, the distribution of aid funds: Since the crisis has been more seriously, the United States are only in the economic situation to save themselves without foreign aid.
In addition to the funds, they also have the legitimation to use these: therefore, two non-excellent conditions – under certain circumstances – are likely no international organization or no market in a similar manner.
The new impression, which is put on the State-National element, is, elsewhere, in perfect compliance with the increasing importance in the economy recently linked to a closer sector: territoriality.
Paradoxer way is now when we were so convinced of being involved in a devastated global rich, in a kingdom of the always differentized technologies, the immaterial, that we need to see once our future will depend more from the essential material things: water, reward and oil.
Though all of these can be transported from a place to the other parts of the world, they are extremely connected to a closely registered part of the earth – a territory.
For this reason, the person who has such a territory is in the benefit of the person who lives in an unforeseen, unconscious, waterless or oil conditioning area.
I am now coming to the second news, but it is a short deal.
Who Territorium, whose government, whose policy says, says also the Leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to create two convergent phenomena.
On the other hand, there is the knowledge of the need for leaderships, so the need for someone who knows how to regulate the things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of the detection of the existing guidelines, e.g. those of the economy, which have become sufficient and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deeply richer and in a certain sense of undeserved aspect: a loss of confidence, an inaliency, a image of inconsistence, a feeling of the television, which is all a class of managers of the Western countries.
It seems to be the way the conviction under major parts of the population is to be shown that it is not only the acts of the social elite, but already their ideas, the Way of Life, its culture in the most wise sense of the word, whose content of the majority is always foreign and convenient.
The question of Leadership is therefore closed to a devastated but powerful movement of the leading class and the common political stability. This is shown in unexpected "revoltes" of the electioners and in the unreasonable transformation of the collective state of the last time: starting with the resurrection of the conservators in Austria and Bayern, over the slaughter of the work party in Britain, to the rebellion of the American Deputy against Bush (you may also play a role in the Siege of the rights in Italy).
The impression of the old elite, its parties, their programmes, but also their guides, magazines, intellectual believers, some would say their format, more understanding problems and, therefore, less representative in terms of what happens today in the lower social dimension of Western and still strengthened by the financial crisis and even towards overlooking.
In view of all that it would be easy to overcome to speak from a "rebellion of the mass".
But to keep the eyes open, it is not sure.
The super clothes that can get up on the wall
The forces of the weight to be able to shoot with a clothes and to be able to shoot the walls like Superman.
This is the object of four American research centres which are likely to be reached by one of them.
With a clothing 2.5 qcm on a surface of only 2,5 qm, it has reached the researchers to fix a 100 kg serious body on a right wall.
STUDIO – a American magazine has published the results of the researchers of the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material created by the research team is a further development of the clothes already used that uses a special carbon structure, called carbon nano-roads.
"The principle of the Kleber can be presented as a series of races to a staple Spaghetti", states Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have allowed to inspire the feet of the shoes, which are covered by microscopic skins that give the animal a perfect stop.
The tests carried out with various materials such as glas Teflon and slave papers have shown that the new club is ten times stronger than the strength of the feet of the reptiles and the "unfailable to remove from the wall", says Liming Dai, researcher of the Faculty for Ingenieur Sciences of the University of Dayton.
AN MAUERN ANTLANGWANDERN? "This material could be used as an adjustable clothing." Liming Dai adds.
What can be done to bring Spiderman to walls? Maybe the researchers think more about a less fascinating benefits, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nano-writers are also leader of warm and electricity.
Additional application areas could fall in the area of space.
So, for the moment, the superherds have to wait.
Another ART OF FORCTION – also the University of Berkeley, California, is a new type of kitchen.
In a article of the American Chemical Society, the Californian researchers represent a microfasher kit that cleans its hair by movement on a surface itself from the steel, and always maintains a perfect debt.
Medicine: never take with fruit saft
Carefulness for Grapefruit, Childs and Apfelsaft.
These drinks that are consumed as a result of their frustrating quality and their vitamin riches in the summer may result in severe health damages when they are taken with certain vital medicines, as they can extremely affect the inclusion of these by the body.
David Bailey, Professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, reiterates the risk packed as well as fresh fruit pages in connection with the medical insight. In the context of the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he reiterates the alarm: A glass of appeal, persons or grape fruit is sufficient to reduce the ability of certain living medicines so far that the health of patients will be eliminated and that the health of the patients is threatened.
Grapefruit saft was already suspected to be responsible for increased effects of some medicines such as antibiotics, antiasthmatics, cardiac cycle, anxiolytic and neurological means, to toxic levels.
MEDIKAMENTS IN GEFAHR – This medicine Agency had warned physicians and patients two years ago before the risks of this mix, and emphasizes to take care of what is taken in connection with means such as diazepan or metabolism.
IS NON GRAPEFRUIT – according to the experts also contain persons and applesaft substances that may be able to cut the medicines.
The list of active substances mixed by the fruit seven is long.
The appeal by Michele Carruba, Director of the University of Statale di Milano: "That results are generally delivered immediately to the various international manufacturers who are free to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is recommended to always read the packaging appendix and, if there are incertitudes to have no shoes to ask a pharmacist or a doctor," stressed the experts of the Ansa Agency.
Economic Nobel Price takes place to Paul Krugman
The economic price is the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the involvement of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a neokeynesian who taught at the University of Princeton and is known for his regular article for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the major critics of the Bush Administration's economic and external policy.
Some months after the appeal of 11 September 2001, during the Day of Enron Summit, Krugman had stated in a New York Times Leader that this second event was more important for the history of the United States than the attacks.
A prediction that is not a little Polymic as a response and has been preserved for the economist for years later, but today it is very correct.
"I'm surprising and also shocked about how fast the memory of the scandals have been lost in the context of Enron or Worldcom's public vision assemblies", explained end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank is a "economic of great value", but also a analyzer with a "sever aggressive style, especially against the extreme liberalism of the Bush government".
Open Office, it appears the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" packages
The day of publication of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the Open Source Software has won as a free substitute for Microsofts Office, a larger number of users, both at home and in the office, as well as among freezers and public administration.
After a year more intensive work by voluntary developers that are watched by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is now presented with some news to the public: in addition to a revised and now dispattanized initial menu, the new Open Office (Open Document Format) 1.2 format is finally one of the reasons for guaranteed compatibility with the Apples operating system Mac OS x and the support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, which is also the new standard ISO version.
Eight opposed to the compatibility with Microsofts Office 2007, which can be read by OpenOffice.
Interesting is also some new features, for example, that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which makes it e.g. the shipping via email. This includes importing PDF files in graphic editing modules and save the original image of the page.
So it can also generate "hybride" PDF files that extend the typical graphic of the Adobe format to the elements of a table and a text processing system.
The cooperation is one of the most strengthened elements of applications: tables can now be edited by different users, avoiding conflicts in changes; in the case of the text processing system, each editor is given a frame to ensure a better correction procedure.
Some enterprises are just to publish different functions of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud) while the final result in the coming weeks is to be published.
The Italian version is available on the following link to download: http://it.openoffice.org/download/0.0/download300.html. Thus it follows the English version that is located since Friday on the watchers.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the operating system Linux.
On request, the installation CD can be sent home or to the office.
If the expense freedom can be an encouragement to disseminate the program in the private budget, it is just in the field of business where OpenOffice could be able to give great challenges: finally, different institutions of the public administration and schools have already been transferred to OpenOffice.
In fact, it is not even lacking a training offer, which means a optimal aid for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus opens business perspectives.
OpenOffice consists of five main file components: Writer, the word corresponding text configuration program; Calc, the table program aimed at extra extra; Impress, to create presentations such as Powerpoint; Dbase for the operation of databases instead of the known access; and last Draw, a graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads – a goal that can be easily overcome by 3 million and 600 thousands already reached.
Coal also tests positively and thus the fourth double case
It opens a new doping fall in the past Tour de France: it is the Austrian Sporter Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team, who is the third classified one and winner of the trikot of the best clients.
The news published the daily newspaper L' Team on its website.
The 26-year-old coal of the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver, which was positively tested at Cera, the epo of the third generation. Before it was already met with Italian Riccardo Riccô and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analysis from the blood tests of carbon consists of those active in the last weeks of the Losanna and Chatenay-malabry laboratories.
Reaffirming the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place and will be excluded for two years.
The Chief of the French Antidoping Committee, Peter Bordry, confirmed the positive epothesis, and reportedly according to the Associated Press also the Austrian officials.
The 26-year-old Austrians increased behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans on the podium and also claimed the tricot of the best client.
THEMA PARTICULARS: THE NEW YORK TIMES FRAGT: ITALIAN CONSISTIC?
Italy, "the one country of immigrants has become one of the favorite countries for immigrants" which are only inclined to oppose.
Make this from the Belgian country a country of racists? The New York Times is asked in a long article, which is the subject of racism in Italy, and the case of the young, Burkina Faso, Abdul William Guibre, who was killed a month ago in Mayland.
The case comes from what the Times called "Paradox of the North": the northern regions are those in which "the most integration and employment opportunities" is, however, "the highest degree of anti-immigrational sensations and the greatest support of the North Lega".
As a confirmation of the growing shock between Italians and immigrants, the Times uses further episodes of intolerance from Mayland, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation introduced by the Lega against immigration and the rapid exhibition of illegal immigrants will also be identified as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement that also stated by the Pope and the President of the State: "Georgio Napolitano asked the pope at a meeting at the Cyril for cooperation between the Church and the State to combat racism."
Students victims of up to 900-euro per room high prices
The market for accommodations for students does not know any crisis.
According to the last survey of Sunia, the Middle Workshop, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Mayland, 700 in Florence, 650 in Neapel and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already adopted very serious trends. All the weights of students lose their right to study, since their families are not able to support them in this highness," said the responsibilities of the Sunia, Laura Mariani, "in these cities, the great question of students to a deformation of the market, which has also damaged the other people.
Furthermore, most of the Mietang offers include a number of misconducts: free contracts, lack of registrations, without mid price limits, unacceptable submissions.
The Sunia is the need for extraordinary measures to lead to the revision of tax prices to lower costs.
In exact consideration of the research, a bedroom is needed in Mayland is about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in fourth band Negro) and ends 800 euros in the fourth Lambiate, Udine and Fiera or about 900 euros in the fourth Vittoria.
In Florence, a bedroom costs averagely 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate on the university, 250/280 euros are for a bedroom of Netten, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome the prices in the neighborhood around the unit at about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a bedroom in a double room.
It is only a little bit more deep in the fourth century around the other Rome universities: 550 euros in Eastern and Scientificity.
Only those who escape in foreign districts can escape money: 300 euros for a bedroom and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centokelle and similar quarters.
In Neapel, 300-450 euros are needed for a bedroom, for a room, the price between 400 and 600 euros is in the most precious neighborhoods, the polyclinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari a bedroom 250-350 euros, a single room is at least 350.
In the smallest cities the prices are lower, but they have more weight in the urban economy.
In the cities in which the phenomenon of the residence of foreign students is more often, such as Perugia, there is even another anonymity: an average of 25-30% is requested by foreign students.
Reviewing to the old Kino Paradiso – the cities close their historical cinema
The historical cinemas are closed because of the favorite multiplexkinos.
"A city without cinema is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This image of the register Giuseppe Tornator, with effect, describes what is now in the large cities of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of the cinema, which began with the birth of the great multisale complexs in the Periphere, means long-term death for the unselkino in the centre. A process that appears not only unnecessary and inevitably, but also leads to the course of a cultural crime.
The most historical places are full memories, "It is like to lose a friend with a straight of full emotions", says the register of the film "Novo Cinema Paradiso", who introduced the Oscar and the great price of Cannes. It is the history of a citykinos and its nostalgie that is apparent to live in a probably lost cinema world for 20 years ago.
The numbers that the Anec provides central purchasing association speak a clear language: in the past five years the unexpected amount of 316 traditional cinemas have to be closed; these ceilings paid mostly the cinemas in the large cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Mayland, Neapel, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The most stronger regions in the regions concerned are the Emilia-Romagna with 82 loss cinema, followed by the Toscana with 44 and the lombardei with 41.
This proves that the main responsibilities are the multiplexkinos, because there are only these three regions in which the largest number of modern cinema was registered: 195 in the past five years the Lombardei has the lists, 81 are both in the Toscana and in the Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," says Paul Protti, President of the Anec, "as it is useful that new structures are also available, but first the content of the already existing, because a room is closed in the city, not all his seeds are ready, instead of seeking a multiplexkino in the Periferia.
And here remains the lack of state for the fund of the Acquisition Association: the debt charge marked by the State is about 10 million euros.
It is a damage from the ethical and moral position that the government does not take account of the existing laws.
In order to obtain the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros would be in the year of net."
Interestingly, the case of Bologna, the first Italian cities that have decided to protect them by a agreement between the community and the Anec; this is the first agreement in Italy which aims to protect and support the traditional cinema, both in the historic centre and in the Periphery.
The predicted measures also include tax allocations for cinema operators and benefits of public transport: it will be allowed to walk in the transported areas of the centre and also to park for more parking costs.
"It's a joyful initiative," says Giuseppe Tornator, "I hope that other cities will be accompanied by our example and also produce new concepts.
But of course, we also need a better audio and video equipment to give you something to the superpower of the multiplell, as the public is finally more accessible today.
Defence of the traditional cinema has always been an important subject for me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the exciting point that I had brought to establish the "New cinema Paradiso", even if I had been playing with the thoughts for 10 years.
Since 25 years, I live in Rome; when I go through the Rialto or the Kirinale in the National Via, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turned to the side to not to see the stainless placets.
The links between policy and 'Ndrangheta' lead to the arrest of the Minister of Citizenship of Gioia Tauro
"The chief of Gioia Tauro was ready to adapt the decisions of the community to the interests of the Mafia Group Piromallli.
The accused of the advocate of the Antimafia advocate Kalabrien against the Citizens Jorgio Dal Torrione and his senior Rosario Schiavone of the Community, who were arrested this morning for mafia business.
In hand, Joacchino Piromalli, older partners between the clan and the public administration, as well as its nephew: the lawyer who produces the same name as the boss of the Clan, was already condemned in criminal associations of the Mafia, then to a sum of deterioration of 10 million euros.
"All kinds of moral and legal standard misleading," the lawyers wrote, "the two local administrations decided to pay the lawyer Piromallli money for consultation activities."
"In this way, the mafia group was made possible, so the judges were to switch on a official way to the Council's homes and to agree the public management policy."
The President of the Regional Committee of Kalabrien Agazio Loiero does not agree that it is "all other than an exception to cut into connections with local governments and organized crime." "There are places in which the concentration of the mafia is greater than in other areas where such links are practically inevitably.
But there are also local politicians who are opposed to the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta': herds who receive a white West.
The arrests of this morning follow those of the last July, with whom Clan Piromallli police has been engaged.
Since the end of April last, the Joia Tauro Council has been dissolved, but already 1991 – and at that time, the local politicians of their communities were deleted.
Jorgio Dal Torrione, then the Udc citizensman, was chosen to head the Middle Law Coalition after May 2006.
He shouted Skandal when the prefecture ordered the resolution of the Council of Commons.
He was interested in the vice-minister Marco Minniti, who was concerned to have found everything for political and strategic reasons, but the judges explained in relation to the sentence order of today that the Piromalli Clan had even refused to request a change in the A3 project.
A hearing on the case of Dal Torrione has shown the disposal to join the desire of a entrepreneur who is known to be a representative of the large group on piromalli – which has been identical with the interests of this clan."
When the energy goes out of the waves, the larges are slowly up
It is an unfair source of money that covers over 70% of the surface of the planet and now seems to be understood by the great energy companies of the world.
Wells, powers and times are the new renewable energy sources, which are now looking at all, and also to busy, about Gigants like Chevron.
The possibility of winning energy from the movement of the sea is being taken into consideration and investigated for 70 years; these studies have not been significantly intensified since the first earthly oil crisis.
When the oil price in 1980 was cut off the idea of the marine energy, but now the environmental organizations and the smooth oil prices are cut into new impulse in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) estimates that 15% of the worldwide energy needs could be covered by the energy generated by the ocean wools.
This is equal to the duplicate of the current energy produced by atomic power devices.
Furthermore, the traces and times are also available.
Get up at the attack.
The first company, now put on the sea energy, is Enersis signed in 2005 a contract on the establishment of a power work in the northern Portugal.
When this message was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, there are still more companies from the traditional energy sector that are put on the marine energy profit.
"Chevron investigates these technologies" – the speaker of one of the known firms in the Wall Street Journal of America – has the opportunity to cooperate with us."
This aims at obtaining a approval of the American energy committee that is necessary to start a project before the Coast of Alaska.
This is an unpredictable sign, e.g. when you remember that only in Alaska oil is continued to be promoted by the United States, and President Bush recently put the plans for new oils in Gang.
Besides Chevron, the company Verdant Power Inc. from New York and the Ocean Power from New Jersey, who invest in the new sector, are also not known as the details, so the observer speaks of an increased interest.
Still improved technologies.
Experts speak of one of the technicians that are still not injured, since the last doubts of the protectors have not been declared.
For now, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are more smaller and no serious environmental problems seem to be caused.
However, in order to produce energy in a large scale, technologies with a larger impact on the environment are needed.
There are different possibilities: Ocean Power almost uses a system of connected bovines.
The shoe of the waves, which moves the bowls and moves back, is converted into hydraulical pressure within the sweet over the colds and cylinders.
This takes a turbine that works again with a generator.
The electric is sent through subwater guides to the coast.
There are four planned installations of this type, which were waiting only for the public approval, and a part of the woned energy could also serve for military institutions.
Verdant Power has already produced energy for a car rental and a parking laundry with helping undersee turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the time are the turbines that are covered by the motor movement generator.
According to Verdant, long shoes of possible customers are waiting for the necessary authorisations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the times.
A special interest has been given to the Institute for Electric Research at the moment the potential covered in the times.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the times are better predictable than wind flows, sun instraction and the waves, and therefore a more reliable source of electricity.
The current energy is that the states such as New York, Maine, and Alaska and other coastal countries have to invest $7.5 million in 2008 – for 2009 have already been planned up to $35 million.
