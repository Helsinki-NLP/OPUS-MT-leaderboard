The Parliament does not support the amendment that gives the freedom of Timothy
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament in the amendment to the Criminal and Prosecutive Code rejected the attempt to reverse the article condemned by the leader of the opposition, Julia Timothy.
The amendment that would lead to the release of the former Prime Minister in prison was rejected during the second reading of the draft legislation on the delay of sentences for economic offences.
In October, Timothy was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment for the signing of the gas traffic with Russia, which was recognised unfairly.
The sentence is not yet final; the court will consider the appeal of Timothy in December.
Timothy claims that the sentence is a political place of regime; the Western process was also suspicious.
The proposed renumbering of article 365 of the Criminal Provision Code, according to which the former Prime Minister was condemned, was supported by 147 members of the Parliament.
It would require 226 votes.
Libyan winning
In the history of liberation or resurrection, Libya has already been lost.
Muammar Caddafi is shocked in a desert without him.
It is time to determine the winners.
Normally, Islamics are in the country slaughtered; the question is that they died or root.
The transitional Government has announced himself a follower of the ordinary Shariat law, which we have already heard.
Libya will become a country without criminality, since the punishment of the rule is the departure of the hands.
Women may forget emancipation; potential residents will be punished, etc.
Instead of the dictator of the society, which is covered by the confronting clans, the Coran will be united.
It will be a order that we can't imagine in Libya and who wouldn't desire.
Anyway, our image of life is not the only one in its own, nor the best and probably wouldn't come, for example, to the population of Libya.
In fact, it is surprising that the Islamic fighters have received assistance from the unbelieving.
They are their only fair injustice that NATO had guided not the American General, but God, whom they were glorified after each shooting.
And if we are looking for winners in Libya, west is not in their number.
We participated in shocks, served Islam, and our policies were released from the dictator, their political union, without any guarantees of benefit.
In view of the recent tragic experience of Afghanistan and Iraq, we decided to reject the military occupation of Libya.
The local population, therefore, does not need to worry about the expulsion of the "creanocies".
Although without occupiation, Libya's black gold companies are practically expenses?
It may not be obtained, and then the West will finally be able to defeat the unreasonable protection of civil rights.
If only Shariata's followers do not end this.
Starting a new Water of Crisis
France and the rest of Europe are now in the centre of investors.
The statistical shore was over Europe on Tuesday.
A number of countries have generated GDP data in 3 quarters.
In comparison with the previous quarter Czech economy, Germany and France demonstrated growth.
And today, the long market is cutting backs.
Investors have already seen in Italy not only, but now focused on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
Statistics offices of the European Union in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries have generated their preliminary evaluation of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany has increased in 0.5 per cent expected; France is 0.4 per cent.
Both countries have also adjusted data on the second quarter, in which Germany was better expected (0.3 per cent instead of divided 0.1 per cent). France reported a small decline of 0.1 per cent (the minimum information prescribed stability).
In the third quarter of this year, the Checa economy has shown an preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent.
However, compared to the previous quarter of GDP was in the state, and in accordance with the Czech Statistics Bureau, this confirmed the tendency to increase economic growth.
The results were worse than the analysis were predicted.
Key events:
In the third quarter of this year, the Checa economy has shown an preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent, but it was in the state of the state compared to the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, the third quarter of Germany's economics increased to 0.5 per cent.
From July to September, economic and European Union has demonstrated growth in comparison with the previous quarter of 0.2 per cent, corresponding to analytical prognosis.
The economics of Greece have demonstrated the preliminary reduction of 5.2 per cent.
The responsibilities of 10 years are 28.45 per cent.
The importance of Italian and Spanish situations is close to the critical note.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, and so on.
Despite the deterioration of the situation in the region, the income of the 1-year-old Czechs remains around 4 per cent.
In Germany, the ECB is the last creditor who can save the situation.
The Czech Republic has chosen in Europe.
They winned from 1:0 in the Black, and celebrated unexpected payment in 200 million.
The national team has successfully succeeded with the most complex task of the season!
Thanks to the magnificent Chahu and the beautiful hole Peter, they wined with account 1:0.
In the second time, the Chairman team was able to maintain significant advantages after the home-to-responsibilities, and it will again participate in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz observed the match and composed a detailed report.
Practically, nothing is not noteworthy in the first time and a big luck in the second.
The Czech National Collection, part of the struggle of the team at the end; the Great Chuch; and the Heroic Iraks; wins 1:0 to the Black, and celebrates the outcome to Championy of Europe.
The Predefensive Defence of the Czech team allowed the Black Army team to create a dangerous moment only in the second half of the game.
Damianovich and Ucinich became the most unfailing couple of matchs after they left two great opportunities.
The Great Peter Chech is one of the reasons that the Chech National Collection will not pass the Champion of Europe in the next year, and the chesian football has about 200 million Czech chronic crowns.
From the first minute the game was very pressed.
Both teams have experienced difficulties with combinations; a large part of the time spent in the field center.
This also explains the lack of pressure from the household teams in the first time, and the further shocks on the defence line have been accumulated by the Chech Protectors.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They created a living shield.
A number of hundreds of universities have created a living shield around the nuclear power station in Iran.
They also wish to express their support for the nuclear programme of their country before the possible attack by Israel.
On Thursday, the students prayed for the arrival of the building after the prayer of the death of both the United States and of Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundreds of universities have created a living shield around the Uran Institute.
Thus, they demonstrated the willingness to protect the nuclear programme of their country's value of their own life.
In its last report, the International Nuclear Energy Agency (IAEA) indicated that all evidence that Iran did not have the attempt to obtain nuclear weapons.
The possible nuclear attack in Iran was discussed in Israel.
On Thursday, the students prayed for the arrival of the Urban Hurry Office, following the prayer of the death of both the United States and of Israel.
In the case of the attacks aimed at the maximum paralysis of the Iranian nuclear programme, Israeli presss, both in Isfahan and in Nathan, where the uranium is carried out.
Question of children suffering from grain: No breakfast and breakfast at dinner
More than a third of the children from 9 to 13 years of age are more standards; while 9 per cent of schools have weight, 5 per cent suffered from gender.
According to the last study, children suffering from illness are usually from families who lead to a disorder of life.
We reiterately see the importance of environments and modes of conduct towards the person ' s conciliation for his or her healthy development.
For example, the colobase appears on the tables of children suffering from hepatitis almost two times more than in families with children who have normal weight.
More than 19 per cent of the children suffering from grain, eating at the dinner cardel Fry is not an accidental investigation regarding educational event named Oldation.
Moreover, the family of children suffering from gender is not sported, but the majority of the family of modern schools was only 15 per cent said that their parents have time for sports at least once a week.
A study was conducted among 900 children.
The study was conducted at the end of the last year, and about 900 early students were involved in all the Goddomians.
It was not an accident in the second year of ship, with the support of VSCHeobecná zdravotní pojišovna and Unilever insurance company.
At this time, more than 12 000 students of 4 to 8 classes were attended to the project.
The legal food and the sufficient sports burden are the main factors that have a huge number of children suffering from the weight or from illness.
"For example, only half of the visitors said that they eat five times a day on a breakfast breakfast breakfast, and that's one of the unprecedented conditions of right food," says one of the findings of the study.
No channels and balls at night
Experts warn that even related details are important for health development as a permanent family breakfast.
Only 23 per cent of school families in the Czech Republic are cooking together.
The majority of families are all breakfast for individuality.
The worst opening was that people are not even breaking in every ten family.
But the morning is the foundation of the right day ratio.
A study showed that the feed is more useful in families with children suffering from gender.
Only everybody — unless weight — is drinking sweet smells every day (70 per cent).
Although more than 40 per cent of children regularly employed, the number is lower than two to 15 per cent when their parents are talking about.
Create your own menu.
Another part of the study of the selected children (204 boys and 172 girls of 13 schools) was proposed to compose their own menu, from the proposed products and on the basis of their shops and preferences.
"Food Mediums in Chesh children under 12 to 15 years of age from ideality as regards healthy food."
Their loved food includes a large number of muscles, sweet and smells.
“The accurate concern causes a great popularity of smelling drugs,” says the final part of the study.
As a primary meal, the past wins a bird with a small sweet.
However, children have not expressed their interest in bobing, fishing and vegetable observances.
Towards healthy life
The study also showed that children are willing to change their food addictions, provided that they will be provided for relevant information.
"My major investigators demonstrated significant use of healthy food preferences when completed the channel after the treatment of Olgage is not an accident," says the project.
This was particularly noted, for example, in the case of smelling drunken drinks - more children were pretending to preserve their waters.
In addition, children have often observed birds and fishes, limited the number of smells and drinks.
Stilists must also be a good psychologist, claiming professionals
In the first article on the styles training, I visited the number of information on income occupations.
I didn't know what the next will be.
Lectures of three experts in this area; clothing advises for unrealable stores; and the seminar on how all of this works in real life.
There's more.
As far as we are closer to the final review, more information and practical tasks are expected.
Training takes every Saturday and Saturday, but it's really a meal of information.
At this time with Alanka, director, we discussed how one woman whose body is not perfectly symmetric.
Most women are not completely symmetrical.
In one short shirt, the other child's figure without appropriate forms, another weights more standards.
The stylester must know how to reduce the wide shoes, to smell or to add the unsuccessful amounts.
We gave advice to emphasize the figure of women such as Jennifer Lopez, that is, the owner of a swimming grain and poor, and the skin of the talents, and it would not make them too sweet.
For example, if the difference in the number of talents and the poor is so large that it is impossible to shake a cup or a brown, it should be one thing that comes to the order.
You will not obviously be grateful of the materials set because the perfectly sit clothing is unworthy.
In the summer, you will feel much better than those who are going out at the top of the coast, find the talents and etc.
Youth fibers, on the other hand, may be clothes with shoes, applets, swimming or composite.
In view of the use of such information and type of graphics, I'm glad I have a whole week to understand it.
But I'm afraid it's too much, taking into account the home task we received.
Each parte of the course had to be able to plan two places for any famousity: day and night.
We need to learn their modern outer species, their styles in clothing and figures.
It's me one of Mirando Kerr, which you can know about the advertising campaigns of Victoria's Secret.
I'm glad about myself because it's much simpler than I say, Britney Spirs, Christine Aguiler, who recently sloped to the ton (because I'm overwhelming) or a very young Selen Gomes.
We need to get clothes out of the magazines or find it online, print and process with graphic programs.
Mudbord is called the result of the work -- then reflects our own style and the relationship to graphic image.
It is important to keep a graphic style in the head.
The style is not simply aware of real people but creates product pages in the magazines (which is based on specific indications such as modal tubes, palto and etc.).
That's what the styleist and designer Mario Camenik told us.
But it was just Sunday.
Style needs general knowledge
The Sabbath Lecture on Figure Information has lived three specialists in this area.
Stilist, Honza Pocorn; a modern designer, Jacob Polanka; and a model photo Ben Rench.
Jacob reminded us that the model is the illusion and the style must use the data.
Good style has one object of clothing to use.
In this case, diversity is key to success.
For instance, the palto-tratch can normally be loaded, the surface of the jains and the footballs as a palt; but it can also be put on the left body without slowness as a shock.
Another opportunity is to cut the hand or shoot the door, and the entire image is completely changed.
"Gay with him," he stressed.
Anyway, I was more grateful to the following counsel: "You must know the rules for your work perfectly."
Then you can begin to violate them," said Jacob.
Here I finally understand why we're going to use all definitions and rules that are to compare with what and why, while in moderate magazines, we often look different.
Don't talk about modes.
From Ben, the photo, I learned that the style is prepared to have more options than the number of photos he had to do.
Yes, for a model review on 10 pages (equivalent to 10) I have to be ready to create as a minimum of 15 images.
Now I also know that on the picture of the clothes, it often looks and works in combination with others not just as in reality.
We have to mean that when we create images.
Honza Pocorna confirmed that often mine and half of the success were successful.
Look at Madonna, who does not belong to a shock, but her gang and marketing have transformed it into a world star.
The relationship to the Stylist Services in the Republic of Czech still remains quite slow.
Even known people often think that it is unlikely (and believe that it is enough to be a specialist in something and how they appear to be secondary).
And if someone finally allows us to create these styles, we must expect that they call us the other (lower) size than the one they really carry.
Then we're talking to Google and explaining if there's something that's not written to the tablets about some of the famousity of the pool, the smooth, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario focused on the fact that the style is not sufficient for a mode and to be able to switch.
Our work is mainly a relationship with people we join; therefore it is important to be a good psychologist.
To evaluate people, not create them and maintain their views.
"If the manager asked you to look at her clothes and add a few beautiful things, you can't get her out of the whole gardeow, said to her that her clothes is horrible."
"If you can praise a few things you can, and suggest what you can bring with them."
He also showed us that specifically the worker should be placed.
It's a tasting that you're connecting around the talent to bring everything necessary.
Besides obvious substances, such as legs, rope or English sheets, it must be a neutral neck (styles use it with some objects, such as shoes or shoes), special clamps to strengthen the snake if the clothing is too large (bottles and similar objects are prohibited because they carry clothes) or a snake for snake.
To get away from the lessons and get some practical experience, we learned to do correctly a taxi load on the snake.
Even during the shooting study, where the swimming feet, the shoes can be damaged - not talking about sweets on the street.
And here we got a snake.
You don't have to do with the legs to not export them.
This requires real masterity.
I was glad that Mario loving my work.
The qualities mentioned haven't come to me in the soul.
This is only part of what we heard during the second part of the weekend.
I'm starting to understand that being a professional style isn't so easy that they wouldn't say.
V Need for Speed: Ride in America.
Operation
What had to be an unfortunate passenger, it was converted to a ruling morning trip to work because of a series of completely unreasonable and unfair errors.
Ambassadors were satisfied before a certain stage, but it was not important because no one had obviously wanted to do a clear job.
Before the new version, the subtitle "Fire" connected great hopes.
It was expected that the previous versions of Need For Speed would be recovered in a new direction; the demonstration versions proved that the game would take a suitable place in the jump of gono games.
We were pleased to see the part of the game where the main hero comes out of the car and fly.
As often this is with NFS, it is a lot different from what we expected.
The game represents a very poor arcade, but the general impression causes a number of unnecessary errors that are present in this game for a few years.
It means, in fact, that is not a mistake, but a declaration of an unexpected piece of developers.
It's very good.
You are part of the story, the main heritage, Jack, to solve some personal problems by participating in the illegal gang through America.
You sit in a car on the west coast, San Francisco, and your job is first to reach New York.
A number of interesting features of this idea.
Marshrut consists of ten stages separated by over fifty hole.
This means that each board is walking on its route, and individual stages are in a variety of and interesting environments.
So there is no feeling that the game always happens.
Despite the graphics at the same level as in the previous parts of the series, it is pleased to look at some traces.
However, the game does not cause strong emotions.
Although a car is driven through the desert, it is very pleasant to be in the swimming mountains.
Furthermore, the shoes lived a bit of time.
For instance, in the desert, you will fall in a swimming snake, a significantly decreasing visibility.
On the other hand, the mountains must be careful so that they do not fall under the lavine.
The individual rings are very well arranged.
There's a few differences, but it's enough.
Sometimes you're trying to smell a few of them (in the existence of the ordinary ring); then you'll try to improve the time (standared threshold with secondary); or you're going to ride with one opposer.
Besides what else you're looking at the police, which is still more complicated with your task.
Outdoor components are new.
It's just an interactive animation where a large part of the time Jack runs from someone and you must help him click on the necessary buttons for time.
Nothing complicated.
Although it is surprising that these fractions are much less than you could expect (all three to be accurate).
It is true that it is good for the game because it does not require it; in view of all the above, it is one of the things that make the game more careful.
The honourable model is following the previous models.
That means that it doesn't mean anything special, but it can't be considered inadequate.
If you're looking for a real life, you'll have to look at another place.
However, this model of shipping is very worthy of the dinamical holes, although you can find better options on the market.
It's very good.
However, at some time the problem begins.
Rather than the models of starting, it's not so good.
You don't expect complicated conversions and kitchens from that game, but if you don't understand what you're going to do with an object, how your machine will be driving something wrong.
Usually, shooting or walking a car in a medium flow, you sometimes are slightly related to another machine, and sometimes in practically similar situations your machine begins to be sweetly distracted.
Or the shocks were shocked.
This is not so important as the restart system is, but it is enough to export fun.
Restarting is so that if you're kicking or get away from the trass, the game will return you to the point where she stops.
However, for each hole, only five restarts are available.
If you're using them all, you'll have to start a ring since the beginning.
It's useful if something is not obtained, but you can't be fully trusted.
Sometimes the restart is inadequate, and you have to learn to spend a separate part of the hole.
The important deficiency of the game is the fact that the same things often occur in the same places.
For instance, some turns need to be a certain way, otherwise you're not just writing.
In other cases, you will meet civil machines in a certain place in one and the same configuration, independently of the first, five, five seconds before or a minute later.
This is especially disappointing in situations when you see your companion spends easy between two machines moved into the opposite direction, while when you are there, the machines are already located so that you need to spend them or slow them speed.
It's not important when you get close to them; everything has been set so that the situation is always happening as a time before your skin.
The counterparts have other advantages.
During the game, you will find some places where, despite time, one of the same partners will shoot you at the same place.
This is especially obvious at the end of the game, on the long bridge where you eat in opposite direction.
Surely, your covenant must stand before you, despite nothing.
The case is that when he goes before you, he hurts you a review that leads to one or more authors in this area.
You can understand the attempt to make the game more interesting and full adrenaline, but it is so obviously that it begins to make a divorce.
Because, despite a simple model of ships, it is employed and sometimes so fun, that you have no time to focus on the event around you.
It's not important that you don't lose - a concept of 50 unique traces, a hole or something else.
The idea of changed the machine during the shooting is uncomfortable.
You need to follow the path contracts because, in fact, your car can change, despite most of you already have, is completely enough.
The machines are shared in three categories.
Sporting machines go to towns; powerful American machines - for direct shoes; and exotic super-sporters for technological shocks, for example, by mountain traces exploded.
The main history mode mode is closely linked to the mode challenge mode; it's a count on individual parts that you know when you're playing.
Here you are inquiring for your personal affairs as well as shocks that are common for the challenges and history regimes.
Many of the possibilities are available to obtain higher levels: starting from the machine and finishing profile data.
In addition, the profile linked to the Online Autolog function, which compares the results achieved with other players, and provides a connection with the public.
This is another deficiency that is difficult to understand; it is an example of the last point in the next time.
You and your car will fall in the metro tonnel (that's what it's so) where you're laughing in the darkness (I think it's so).
Your spydometer shows digits from 150 to 200 km/h (that's what I think so) when a metro train is on your back, converting your machine into a metal board.
Over a few days, our edition discussed whether nobody really thought at the creation of the game or its creators really considered us such a torment.
The technological game is not a special game, but the general impression of the videos in most parts is pleasant, sometimes even awesome.
Despite the regret that in some critical moments the quality of the records, sometimes very strong is low.
This applies in particular to the events with a large number of participants where the good records would not also help you.
It's okay, Saundreck's for the lovers.
To enjoy how much more young audience is possible, Saoundreck's compounds of different styles, but not many people buy a game because of her music.
Overall impression of Need for Speed: shoot is quite uncomfortable.
If the game was obviously avoided unnecessary errors, we could honestly say that Shump is the best part of the NFS in the past few years.
Anyway, the game remains incomplete.
Of course, it's a good disappointment, but prepare for the shortcomings to shut you as a airport driver.

Ambassaded to the EU Assessment:
The reputation of non-employees and skeptics on euros.
"The Lisbon Treaty conveyed significant differences between individual organizations."
"I didn't expect to be such a cruel war."
" The need for five or six years before the situation is stable, and all the games are inclined to their new roles, " ambassadors EU Millena Value began hardly their study at the legal faculty.
She proved to how simple and understanding her girl "Yes and open for Europe" was in the first part of its lesson, where she described individual EU institutions and relationships between them, as well as many readers with the CU legal school.
Furthermore, the Acknowledgement welcomed the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompey:
"The first critics said he was a series of official museum that couldn't play any role; I should say that all were surprised how good he had done with his role."
"The man who can listen to twenty-seven participating countries at the same time, is nice to share with them and has a clear presentation of the part of the EU's development."
She explained its new position for international relations and security as a response to the question: "Who is the European Union? what number I need to call?", that is, how important step is towards the integration and greater transparency of the Union policies in respect of countries such as China or India.
No one's going to prohibit our skin.
The evaluation has continued to focus on the EU ' s key programme in the past, the present and the nearest future.
She called the successful Chairman ' s presidency in the past year.
Chechs had a case with the emerging financial crisis; they overcome this crisis and organized the Somit of Eastern Partnership.
She said that the departure of the Government was at that time a negative manifestation of the deteriorated damage of the Czech Republic.
The representatives of Czech in the EU are now very busy.
As the ambassador said, and the presidency and the following financial crisis have now expressed a continuing burden.
It is also necessary to adopt a new seventh EU budget, which is very difficult, taking into account the modern crisis.
Whether the budget will be sweet and economicly, which areas will provide; those countries will receive more support and less support; all of these issues are in the next programme.
The Ambassador recalled the key lounges she brought to Brussels: "O Europe, understanding language."
"I really don't like the reduction, foreign words and jargons that no one understands.
As citizens can understand that in Brussel, people do not try to sell crystal or circles, bananas of different sizes, or that someone will prohibit our shoes."
It will also use the EU environment more effectively and engage more chaos in European organizations.
Multidimensional Europe is our future.
The soldier claims that the Chiefs are considered euro sceptics, as well as those who are more negative than positive.
She wants to be involved in more representatives of the Czech Republic in European organizations.
It believes that there are a number of factors in this regard: for example, the modestness of our candidates and their incapacity to write a motivation letter, and at the same time with a small support to the Czech side.
In addition to the successful presidency of Checa, she noted the power and cooperation of the Vice-Gruppe.
"Cree that when I meet somebody from Poland and Hungary and join us, the French is close to me, "Hey, what kind of congregation is it again?"
In the future, the Evaluation is expected in the new strategy for the budgetary policy of States parties.
As compared to the new European Federation, it is considered to be double-sized if it is not a more realistic Europe.
"We have both countries and parts of the European Union."
"We've got a Seunghan zone, and we've already got a Institut of Force Cooperation."
"In the first time it was said that countries who want to join, while those who do not want may remain in the side."
"The number of such institutions will grow; this will be the actual double-sized Europe", expects the Value.
In this regard, she stressed the role of the Czech Republic as well as Herman Van Rompey in promoting the rules which, according to which all the issues relating to the whole of the EU, should be discussed by all countries parties, not only in Europe.
Brenda history:
The IBM involves the second stage of its existence.
If someone wants to find a word that will be better expressed by the IMB strategy, the nearest might be "forever".
For the wide public, IBM is a symbol of technological revolution; the company is considered very modern, although it was based for more than 100 years ago.
The duration of the company was put on her first boss, Thomas J. Watson's old man.
He believed in her girl, as many world problems could be resolved if people want to think.
His “Dumai” logo thus became a stamp around which was a future guigant life (and also the name of his internal magazine, which IMB began to publish in 1935).
Moreover, it was the foundation of the corporate culture that Watson was deeply expressed.
"For us in the IBM, long-term idea means a permanent movement towards the future.
IBM lived and prospered for hundreds of years, because it remained faithful to his initial values, although it was not afraid to change everything around himself.
In our first hundred years, this allowed us to convert technology, business and company.
In the second hundred years, we hope to get even greater,” says the current leader of Samuel J. Palmizano, in the case of Jubila.
Common system
In the 1930s, Watson addressed the concern of the employees as Batia in the Czech Republic, IMB staff were one of the first American servants with payable department, assets of employees, an elegant university and a complicated bonus system for best researchers and entrepreneurs.
These are long-term IBM relations with consumers.
From the beginning of the company, there was a huge use of talented people, which was one of the first world companies that eliminated the entire discrimination that offered its excellent choice.
The anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan, in accordance with which the woman, Virginia Romitty, changes Palmizano in the next year.
She worked in IBM for thirty years; she currently was the Director for sales, marketing and development.
In recent years, IBM has organized meetings, online brain stores, in which many future innovations have occurred.
It is unexpected that many ideas in the company work about halfmillion people.
Organization with a good reputation
The strong position of the company in business is ensuring strong internal and external immigration.
From the beginning, IBM's concept was better than the technological company, said the Economist of the Harvard Business School Professional and the author of the IBM Disabert Moss Canter.
"IBM is not technological company, it is a company that helps to solve business problems with technology", adds Joe Coloni from the Forrester Research Corporation.
As we say in the company, there is a difference between starting and creating it.
For hundreds of years, IBM, or "Global Giant", as it is called in the United States because of his logotype, has become one of the largest companies of the world.
It seems that this is the most universal technological company, the developing and software assurance; the infrastructure; the heating and the consolency services, from servers to nanotechnology.
It has the largest number of patents among all American technological companies, five of its staff received the Nobel premium.

With $220 billion, according to market capitalisation, IBM became the second majority of the technological company (the first place in Apple company) since 1996.
Show forward
Not all of its products came to the buyers and were written in the epoch. For example, IBM suffered from its operating system OS/2; prodigy online service and IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is determined forward move, you can't emotively be engaged in the past," says Samuel J. Palmizano.
That's why IBM makes the bases on several platforms - if they do not work, it rejects them.
This is different from its Microsoft competitive, which is based and suffers from Windows, its operational system.
Prospective technologie
The main income of IBM is obtained from services, some fifth in each case from computer programs and devices.
As in 1990, with the capital at least two, she was the stronger manufacturer of the equipment.
Since 2000, IBM has sold 15 billion dollars low income assets, and at the same time 58 billion in purchase prospective technologies.
She continued to invest even after 2008, when the current economic crisis was the first in peace.
IBM should be an example of his first director, Thomas J. Watson, who increased the number of investments in the Great Depression years.
It seems that IBM did not cause any damage to the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, the IBM share price increased by 120 per cent; the purity of the company is constantly growing.
The corporate nine of IBM is to change everything, except its own values.
So it can be expected that even if another crisis is raised, this smooth guiant is in the situation.
IBM's history: from the leg to space flights.
The IBM (International Business Machines) was based in New York hundred years ago, and its original "Corporation, Tabulation, Records" was very complicated.
She took the name of IBM in 1924, which was originally called Brand used for company offices in Canada and South America.
The IBM's maintenance of four companies, with the history of the 1880s.
They owned technologies, such as legendary "Tabular hours, i.e., physicianing hours when staff come and get out of work.
The architector of the new company was an entrepreneur Charles Ranette Flint, who also entered the company's council until 1930.
Flint took the director of the competitor company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him manage the company.
Then the leader of the IBM founder in the darkness of Watson's idea remains the base of the unrelated corporate culture and identity.
Watson resigned the company until 1952.
IBM, as clear from the name, began from the manufacture and sale of different machines for business, from green legs and meat to cash devices.
In the first quarter years, the shipment was doubled to nine million dollars, and the company has started a wide expansion in all continents.
Watson was so important for the company, that almost 40 years after his place in the headquarter, Thomas Watson's Chief.
Under its leadership, IBM began to develop art intellectual technology and created the first language of programming.
In the 1960s, both the staff and the IBM computers helped NASA to control space flows - at Mercury, Saturn, and 1969.
In 1964, IBM developed the first computer family of IBM line System/360.
The classical CPC, which determined the computer standards that time, as IBM 5150, appeared at the market in 1981.
After twenty years, IBM sold the production of the Chinese company Lenovo computers, purchasing the Price Waterhouse Coopers Consulting, thus fully focused on the consolency and services with high value.
In the past three years, the IBM has made great success with its concept Smarter Planet.
Its aim is to use technologies in areas where it was not planned and to improve the road situation and urban management.
In the field of trade, IBM recently presented Smarter Comerce platform, which helps entrepreneurs to control the whole trade cycle.
IBM traditions are strong even in our country.
In the former Czech Republic, as the first country that was at the same time in Central and Eastern Europe, the IBM was based on its office in 1932.
Today, IBM CZ has also managed by the Strategic Absorption Centre in Bruno.
The Apartment of Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, where it also works with a world-level research group that recognizes the speech.
Resurrection of his unbelievable husband:
Ivá, let you go, I don't need him anymore!
Darin Rhitarjwa (53) said that it was over!
After her husband Joseph Rhitarg (53) became a guarder and loved Ivá Bartosh (45), Darina still hoped that he would start and return home.
However, she did not want to wait, and has defined the clear rules for his future life.
"Pap can return home, but not as my partner," explained Richtarje.
When Darin Rhithtarjov provided in his house of Bartosh, she probably had no small idea of what would happen to her marriage.
And even though she let Eve go from Ritchan 30 days later, Pepa did not leave the beast.
Moreover, he acknowledged publicly that she loved her.
After some time, Darin had come to make a look that had died with the Roman man; and now he finally forgive him.
I'm going to smile with whom his wife is.
Even if Rhythtarge and Bartoshov ever disappeared, his wife would not take him with a deceased behaviour.
"He's my son's biological father, and if he wants to pass his last days in our house, no one will get out of it."
"When he ends his days, not as my loved, lost and found old dog, but a man with whom something is connecting me," said Richard, adding that she has already been released from my husband and just spends on the coasts.
Before Joseph had nothing against his wife, he was rejected.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Ive, I won't change it."
"My wife decided to leave a marriage on the bowl, and I respect this decision."
Our Union continues to work; I'm responsible for repairs, gardens, houses and choppers.
"I'm just not going to share bed," Rhythtarge magazine Blesk said.
He claims that if Rhitarja finds a new love, he will not hinder her.
"We're not sleeping together, and I'm still where she goes, with whom she has a friend.
I know it's my fault, I loved Eve, and I have full responsibility," said Joseph.
Women's badness: Are they chasing you?
When you ask men to call some kind of women's bad appeal, they are generally counting all of them.
Dear ladies, do you know yourself in the next lines, which describes a few women's affairs that make men evil?
Shopping
Your second half regrets that you're always walking in the shops?
Do you have to buy as minimum one thing every week?
Do you like to purchase the largest sales?
If so, your shooting can be considered a stupid shooting.
Some women recognize that they need to control their strike to the shopen.
But who of you is disbelieved from the shops of clothes in the search for perfect clothes and for its examples?
It may be a hobby for the majority of women, but for men it can be the only fool.
Just remember how many times you said your second half to wait for you outside...
A Real Unfortunateness
"I'm too sweet?"
"I need to leave as least five kilograms - maybe I start to do a hymnastic?"
"There's still with me?"
Do you know these phrases?
Yeah?
Then you will enter the group of women who have been involved in your external way.
Not to stop following yourself, but many men in literal sense have been alergic on permanent complaints of partnership on their own external nature.
The strong floor also agrees that women are more than more than their complaints.
The most important order and cleanness
It's like an unconscious story.
Mocka steel, shooting pileso, my pool, the resistance of the powder, the sweet cleaning, as at least two times a week.
Do you criticize your partner because he comes on a clean caffee in the clean bottles; kids in a clean cancer, and the depths on the window of the guest in the guest, which was so difficult to clean?
If you are suffering from this “circumcision”, try to realize that you are extremely injury; and that the order and cleanness of your family must not stand on the first place.
Indeed, cleanness is a threat to your relationship, as well as your whole family.
Commanding
"Brow the white in the corsin."
"You're going to get the smells tomorrow?"
"The Marshall Potter must not stand on the ground."
If you make comments to your partner several times a day, it may be very convenient.
Of course, you have good purposes, you just want to make it perfect.
Maybe, if men understood that, women shouldn't have so often commanded them...
Skills
Some women like to smile, struggle, and smile towards others.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss where, with whom and why.
It's like, from time to time, each of us shoots the shoes.
We'll be open, so the visible nature of all women.
In any case, there are more shoes, women who are often shocking and presuming others, especially in women ' s working collection, are a major danger for their environment.
The resulting transfers of Yaga and Worcek helped Philadelphia to win
During the NHL shop on Monday, two resulting transfers of chocolate attacking Yagra helped Philadelphia to win 5.3 on the ice of Caroline, and again became the most outstanding chessian game.
In both cases, he used the experience of thirty-year-old stars and added another transfer and was announced by the best match game.
Two resulting match transfers were also part of the player in one team with Yakubu Worchek.
After the Yagre Match said to the foreign journalists that he predicted the great night of Jorah.
"I told him to the match that he's gonna forget the heat trick."
"I felt it."
"Atime you feel like that," explained Jagre, after whose action Jüri had killed a hole at the first time that Flyers gave.
Shortly later, the second team also had the Chesh switch.
The remarkable Harrikains Worches had a shirt and delivered her to Maxim Talbot, who slaughtered between the circles.
In seconds before the first interruption of the home game, Patrick Dwayer has reduced the explosion with a number of advantages, but at the start of the second secret, Flyers again had Flyers.
Especially Jerusal.
After the resulting expense, Igree killed the third hole; his next shoot was converted into the fourth Wayne Simmonds.
"I like to play with him."
"I don't mean he's the best player, but he's precisely in the trick of best", said Jagre, loving his center.
"I never thought that at the end of my carriage, I'm going to play with a cookie player like he."
"This makes me happy."
"I want to support him."
"All these years in NHL, my team friends tried to help me, and now I'm on my way," added Jagre.
Carolina made a more dramatic match using Tuomo Ruutu and the Duyer panels, striving a strike to one ball.
More complications prevented Matt Rid, which increased the disappearance to two points.
"Pronger has worked well in our zone."
"He shocked the shirt, I speed, and Rid moved on a distance."
"I'm in him and glad that it's worked," Described Workes my impression from the last hole of the match.
The wine was transferred to the first place in the Eastern Conference.
The protector of the Montreal Chat of Yaroslav Spacks did not complete the shop with Buffalo; he left the game in the second period because of the worst of the superior part of the body.
However, with the experienced protector of Canada, they lost their double advantages and lost 2.3 after the series of tools.
Thomash Plecans couldn't forget during one of their attacks.
More than lost eyes, the home trainer was shocked by a larger number of traumas in the back, because the shop was completed with five protectors.
"That's bad."
"We've been finished with only one experienced player, the other were young people."
"Whatever, we can't do anything to do with this, we just need to be dying with this," said Jack Martin.
"What's the replacement, it's been fair and we couldn't oppose."
"We had to simplify the game, move the shirt out of our zone."
"What was our weak side," added the protector of P.C. Subain.
After the thirty-first attack of the Chechish Holkipper, Henjai Paul helped Vinnipegs to win Bailey 5:2.
Jets' hands, who stopped the fifth series of infringements, were killed by five different games.
Dinamic prices since 1989
Before 1989, only five public tourism agencies were able to work in the former Czech Republic: Šedok, Sportrist, CKM, Recreation and Autoturist.
As travels to the West were strictly limited, the tourists were mainly sold to the social block countries.
Thus, in the Czech Tourist Canadians, they went to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Society, the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (the two countries in the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balaton).
The only exception was from 1962 to 1972 when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia, and then the Yugoslav regime returned to the West, with significant limitations to the traveling of Czech Tourists to Yugoslavia.
Most socialist paradoxes were that the socialist blocks (e.g. and Czech Republic) were not allowed individual travels to socialist countries.
If the Czech Republic wanted to go to himself, for example, to the Soviet Union or Poland, a letter of invitation was needed from that country; otherwise, the personal journey was impossible.
At that time, tourist agencies proposed travels to the West, but they had to stay all night, with a bedroom, or have "good friends" in the office.
And it wasn't yet.
The full permission was needed to travel to the West, and it was not issued by the political uncertain people who had not yet been allowed to travel.
The currency was not freely converted; without monetary permission, it was impossible to obtain money (west currency) for travel to Western.
In fact, a large number of kitchens and flight houses had been carried out in the house.
After 1989, tourism in Czech survived the real revolution.
While our travels were culminated in the GDR or Bulgaria until 1989, in the past year, 4,5 million leaves in countries around the world were held in Checa.
The Great Paradox, which we do not understand, is that until 1989 we could not be freely visiting the most popular today of Croatia because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
At the beginning of 1990, the need for visa in the neighbouring of Western Europe was cancelled, and it began a great deal of short trips in Vienna and Germany.
Czechlandians couldn't have been traveling to the western, and everyone wanted to go there even if they were in the midst.
For example, in Paris the cheese tourists sleeped in the parks, as their income was not enough for a guest or a pancilion.
The typical feature of the Czech Tourism in that period was to bring its own food (consertions, salts, etc.) to seen money.
Another important moment is the introduction of a freely converted chessian chronic, and our tourists can finally buy the western currency.
Our life level and the average income increased, which resulted in another important situation around 1997.
Since 1997, the growing demand allowed tourists to prepare regular aircraft transportation, compared to the past, aircrafts have now become unreasonable because of the possibility of advertising optimities.
Until the end of the 1990s, the visa was not needed to visit almost all developing world countries, except the United States, which has made our trips more easier.
The following significant events in the history of the journeys after the revolution occurred in 2000, and the largest demand was historicly launched the first direct channel of the Czech Republic in the exotic country in Thailand.
Since then, direct chair racings have brought cheese tourists into warm ecologic countries, and this winter fleet from the Republic of Czech will be sent to twelve exotic directions.
Currently, about 1000,000 Czechs visit the exotic countries every year!
And another important event of this period, symbolized by our development after the revolution, occurred in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States rejected the need to receive a visa for the Chesian tourists, and our country has thus joined the world's most developed countries.
In the first history of 2008, more than half of their leaves were passed outside the border (50,3 per cent), and in the first history, more than 150,000 chrones were expenditured during the displacement, including their expenditure.
The General Assembly must elect the President, the threat of the patent is returned
For some five months, the President of the Chessian football has no risk that Ivan Hask, Chief Field Association Chief (FAśR) will not even be appointed after another external meeting held in Niemburg on Sunday.
There is no consensus on the rules of election to follow.
Without this vote, one of the three candidates will not begin.
Idridges Rail, Miroslav Pelt and Tomás Pazlick want to call the chess football.
Gashek went out of his stay in June, and he called his colleagues to join and find a strong personality that would call a football in the future.
However, the era of Gasheka reloaded a football in the distance of two associations palates that couldn't choose a single candidate.
This was clearly 16 September when the new President had to elect.
The delegates of the general congregation came to the National House in Prague, Smihaw, because the negotiations remained blocked, not only the election procedure.
There was no agreement on the person who has the right to vote to the general congregation, only legal representatives or officials who have granted authority.
This moment has been partly resolved by the recommendation of the State Institute and the Law, which is impossible for the representative based on the power provided.
The arguments relating to the election rules, however, continued.
The Executive Board does not also help too much, although in its congregations, both in general and indirect, it is mainly employed in this issue.
Submissions have changed several times, but the key issue remains the same.
The question is: How to move to the 3nd round and avoid the patate?
" The spot is to follow the established standards or find another model," said one of the Vice-Presidents of the FAhaan Subod, who represents the professional football in the association management.
Based on the model prescribed by the 3nd round, the winner is a candidate who receives a large support for the palace from which he speaks by the candidate.
As it is said, Moldova agrees to the compromise to consider the winner of candidate elections with the most common number of voted in both palaces.
The Czech party calls on the conditions that, in the general percentage of the winner, two thirds of the vote should be obtained.
"But however, two previous rounds would then lose their meaning; it would have fully rejected the concept of two palates," the Freedom agreed with the arguments of Moldova. He said that it would be better not changed the rules and voted in accordance with existing rules.
A few unexpectedly, Tomás Pazlick agrees with his view, although, according to the assessments of the election rules, Pelt has more than other candidates.
"I would like the elections to be slaughtered."
"I want to avoid all possible representative stupidity as in the previous general congregation," said the owner of Victoria Plulian, who first is a candidate; and in his statements he was mainly opposed by Pelt.
Pelt remains optimist.
He believes that the new President will be known in Nigeria; he also hopes that the future candidates will cooperate constructively.
"All emotions will be calm after the expected outcome of the national collection in Championato of Europe."
"The football will be rejoiced, people will work more willingly," says the representative of Jablonic, who has more experience in the football management as well as at regional levels.
Rail's more detention.
"I hope to the agreement, but the situation is very unlikely."
"This is not between the representatives of Bolivia and Moldova, but there is a attempt to adjust the rules."
"This can call another shock of the general congregation."
"I hope the good meaning will win", said Rachel.
It was not so much time to the parties to reach the agreement.
Some information shows that certain negotiations went directly to Black Norwegia, but who knows whether a football unit would be reached.
The supplementary race, which was to add, in addition to other, the Vice-Presidents, Dajir Kucher and Ryan, was not fled from the Prague of the morning for technical injustice, and the alternative was called to bring part of the Executive Committee to the place of a relucting match.
At the end of the meeting at the ministerial level, which is expected in the medium, may be a decision-making.
The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport, Joseph Dobesh, would like to be the most powerful sports association in the country.
There are many: government subsidies; creditability for the football; and the general STV meeting planned with the new Czech sport directive after the financial problems of Saskat.
Pacific enters the presidency because it does not see a suitable candidate
If, before the outcome general meeting, the head of the footballists of the Pulni Thomash Pazlick would see a strong candidate that would meet all his requirements to the President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAśR), he would not even claim for a high post.
"If it would be a suitable candidate, I wouldn't be involved in the fight."
"But that man hasn't been found before," said Patty.
Pacific's motivation to fight Miroslav Pelthoy and Indorschmid Rakhlem is to try to prevent Pelt, preferable for elections, to enter into the FATHR management.
Furthermore, Patrick stressed that in the event of the victory, he remains the President only until 2013 when a regular meeting was planned.
In the future, he would like to take the experienced fuel-menger that is not too bound to a football life.
"I've spoken to some people who could mean it."
"I was horrible to hear how some of them said that at this time they don't even want to have a relationship with the Chesh football."
"I would like to change this opinion," he said.
Currently, the main difference between Pakistan and Pelthoy is in connection with the recent relationships with Rom Berbro, President of the regional football Association in Pullen. Berlin is a anti-oriented reputation that is known as a influential lobbyist to influence the vote of the delegations of the general congregation.
Pacific therefore considers it unacceptable that Pelt becomes the President.
"If he wins, the current situation remains without change, and the football will not move forward."
"In the support of the Barbara, the capable businessman, it would be even more smooth for the football," said Patty.
He advises that a few years ago the name of Pelt was recorded during the hearing of telephones in the investigation of corruption; Pelt could avoid a sentence.
"I don't know what's the premises of the Pelt's victory would bring to the football."
"And as we looked at the EUFA and FIFA," said Patty, "and now he does not mention his previous statement that he will sell the Palestine club if Pelt becomes President."
If Patty wins on Thursday, he could present cooperation with Peltho in the future.
This opinion is part of another candidate, Rachel, whom Patty supported the general meeting in September, the finance of the Fiasco.
"He would be the first whom I would call."
'He's very powerful.'
"I can imagine him in the head of the assembly."
"But he can't control the association."
"I also don't know what I do," said Pazlick, who brought a large number of attention to myself in September, when supported the removal of the courtyard of Lude Macelloy, who changed Dumkay.
Pacific claims that he's risking to manage the association.
He refers to his experience of the management of private companies; since the past summer he managed the Plunch team, who was using his first triumph in May.
"I have a power to make a football environment changes, to support her change to better."
"Restrict the influence of some groups of persons who are strict to affect the discipline and appeal advice that leads to distortional situations," said Patty. He does not hide his antipathy, for example, to the director of the Space Daniel Krythine.
One of its priorities will enhance the relationship between the FARC and the Czech Olympic Committee, with which he will assist at the higher political level to put more money on sports from local collections.
"This is one of the key moments to be taken by the new President."
"In the case of taxes, as the political party claims, I understand their arguments, but they should declare clearly where the money goes, " he said.
The Pacific does not consider its relationship with the Palestine Club as a burden, although he claims that President FAивR should be independent.
Pelt has been connected to the Yablonians, and Rachl with the Prague Dukley.
"It's not a perfect option."
"But I don't know what I'm going to do in the hidden transmission of my Plucky club to someone else, when I'm going back there for six months," says Patty.
Palta promised the new rules of FAśR to avoid the Elected Party
Two days before the general meeting of the football Association, one of the candidates at the President, Miroslave Pelt, promised that if it would elect, he would fight for the new rules of FA caught in the future to avoid controversies regarding the election rules.
Before the negotiations in Nimburg, the Yabulonian official remains optimistic and believes that the attention of the prevention of our football collection is depressed by the expected success of our football collection today.
Before the lost elections in September, Pelt promised that if he wins, he focused on both representation and financial resources.
He decided to participate in elections at the last moment before the last common congregation, and the two-month delay could therefore be useful for him to resist his ideas about the football in a broader context.
"There are all levels in the football for a long time, and they're expecting that the President will be known on Thursday."
“They feel that it is now the time for someone to make a association,” said a man who was mainly related to the Yabulon club; but he has spent many years in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Association.
This gives him the reason to predict that he is sufficiently experienced to manage the Chesian football.
He believes that the present problem is called the aforiah reigned at the time of the Ivan Gashek rule.
"Nevertheless, the rules that were not so perfect as we all thought were adopted in the general congregation in June."
"If different ways of representation were not adopted, we would have already been the President from September," said Pelt.
He resigned the key instrument of civilian association as a false goal for delegates.
"If I become the President, I'm going to consider that my personal task, and I'll take personal responsibility if this trial is unsuccessful."
"This is a fundamental question that we cannot exist without", says Pelt.
Besides, he says he's not trying to split himself on the background of the skills.
In the past, he stated that he could have been working with the Indigenh Ryan, whom he values for legal education; he acknowledges the fact that his co-advisor must become his first vice-president.
For a long time he didn't attack Thomas Pazlick, who has always criticized Pelt.
"He has made a certain success in the football more than a year."
"Where it was, his attacks were unfair, and many people were surprised by the methods of his pre-selection campaign."
"Besides, some of them are now doubtful in his real personality," said Pelt about his competitor, and he himself claims that he is faithful to the declarations announced in September.
He considers its main weapons of knowledge of the football, from the lower level to the national collection.
The National Collection should represent the entire football.
"I would have also tried to stop all incidents, starting with the case of gods or the consequences of the last year corruption scandale."
"I would focus on negotiations with both private and public sectors to ensure enough money for the whole football," the candidate said two months ago.
Then he promised that his election at the head of the football did not depend on the voluntary personnel.
"I need to know the official instructions of individual staff." It was his message to Strahav, where the duration of the period between the authorities causes an understanding of energy.
Despite the present catastrophic scenarios of the planned general congregation, he believes that the delegates will not come to Nimburg on the fourth day.
"If the only question is how to take elections in the third round, we can do so."
"The Football needs confidence that he can get, only elected his leader at the end," says Pelt, who remains optimistic for two days before the key day of his carriage of the officer.
Rachel promises that its leadership will start actively working
If the Vice-President of the Czech Field Association, in the meeting on Friday, the Vice-President, would be the President of the Chechef-Fotball Association, and many people in the Association, listeningly, will be unwanted.
Rachel promises that if he chooses, it will start a hard work.
He wants to establish a change in the system and to make members of the Executive Committee responsible for the individual football areas.
He also promises to address the problem of gods; to improve the relationship with the EUFA, both with the FIFA; to bring more money to the football; and to continue the work of the previous President, Ivan Hashka.
"When President, I would like to focus on a football overall."
"The international contacts with the EUFA and FIFA, to national collection, professional football, and youth football events."
"I don't mean what I'm doing myself," said Rachel in his interview for TDK.
"I am the command player, and I want to distribute the power to the Executive Committee so that each member focus on a specific area. "
"I'm precisely distributing the task, so that in each of these segments football makes great steps forward."
"It must not be liked by many, because it will mean hard work, but not just the critical work of others," he added.
The atmosphere of the football moved him to doubt in his candidate.
"or I know I'm working 20 hours a day."
"But I have to know if there is any meaning in this, and that I will not be around people who put my shoes into the wheels and who have taken my step under doubt," he explained their doubts.
"But yet, many people told me that I shouldn't be able to go, no matter they'll come to others."
"This is the confidence I can't leave," he said.
Moreover, he says that his motivation is to continue his work with Hask.
"A lot of work has been done for that two years, and I don't want to overlook all this."
"There are starting processes that could bring results over a few years, and I don't want someone else to stop them," he said by fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelt, will be elected, the situation in the Association can return to the one that was to Haska.
"I believe in systematic approach, and that's what is not the competence of Miek Pelt."
"He's around people who would work with a football so that it's available only for the chosen."
"I can be accused of a lot, but it's not exactly substantive."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to do a football available to each one, because then all will take good time, not only the chosen minority," said Rachel.
Furthermore, he checks the accusation that he would be only President of Checa.
"There are many people trying to turn back, I'm planning to make the maximum for Moldova."
"For example, it was time to think about the second lines on the Czech and Morbian parts, whose winners would continue to fight in the first liga."
" This will prevent the current situation when there are only three Moriab teams, which are the problem for youth players in Moldova," said Rachel.
While the presidential struggle entered the Palmish Pack club, Ryan is not intended to evaluate his chances of winning.
"But yet, I still feel strong support in the Czech Hall, which has chosen my Vice-President, and I see that I have achieved some clear success, " said Rachel, and he was talking about the economy of decades of millions of crons in unexpected contracts, the negotiations on TV and the negotiations of the Lottery Act.
On the other hand, it is partly responsible for non-association.
Ascertain of the "excluding credit capacity to return the Chesh football process", he is considered the second counterparty, the Pacific, a strong candidate who has to propose.
"Nobody can doubt that he worked well in Puren this year."
"If he will choose, I hope he will continue to begin Ivan Gashek, without significant care changes in the committees."
“It wouldn't be telling the facts for his benefits,” said Rachel about his companion.
The most beautiful baselines of Europe
Skip to water
Eulya Stanek
Children's bathrooms with universal voluntary optics and state baskets in Budapest, which can try an incredibly European water - and decreased the body that was left in Jacuzzi after the excursion of the city or passing.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
Without one thing, Iris Meder couldn't be able to walk during his research trips last half of the year: without its purchase costume.
On the left of the water, she looked at the top with a shocked cup, shooted to marmoric horrors, waiting for her in the area of the bassin and loved carefully rebuilding baskets in the ar-weapon style.
She tried to add every favorite baseline to its block, with the important details of the building and the history of the building.
The architecture Meder has reviewed more than 200 platforms, and now he collected impressions in his recently published book Badefreuden, where all of the public basins in Munich to his historical shopping houses in the Black Forest and the "functional beton buildings" in Taunus.
She traveled through 13 countries, including Germany, Austria and Switzerland, as well as the Czech Republic of Italy, France, Slovenia, Slovenia, Slovenia, Romania and Poland, and one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
46-year-old author is the real enthusiasm of the purchase culture.
She experiences very little enthusiasm about sports, says Meder, but in the water it is all different.
The unique deficiency is that swimming worshipers must be peaceed with the bleeds of coffee and cloud, while flights can smile the shock of cows or listen to the joyful birds of birds in the park.
"After I asked why the swimming baskets should always be so terrible," says the living in Win Meder.
"So I started collecting beautiful baskets."
When the surface turns up the architecture
The swimming in the baseline and the searching oil in the sauna is a health factor in the purchases that means, as Meder thinks, it stimulates all the feelings.
And swimming baskets can be very pleased to eye if the buildings take such work. "Instead, the water surface of you."
"Breakness is very surprising, but also reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is ridiculely reflected: high shoes, colour sleeves and tramps.
The illustrated “Radocity of purchase” publication on 190 pages contains valuable information about the architectural and cultural history of the health oasis, and calls for you to swim into water.
The Meder Water Collectioner has found a number of exhibitors during the study in Hungary.
It has found a rich water nitrogen in the cartle pearl in Miscalz-Tápolis and a thermal bain full of milk water in the building built in the form of the bottles (Városi Termalfordô in Yasburen), and great therapeutic purchases, such as the 100-year-old Sechine purchase in Budapeste.
Many of the open baskets in Switzerland and Australia, on the other hand, are opening a shocking species, and you can see the whole Zurich from the shopping shops, or look at the swimming Arberg from the open bassin in Sant-Anton, and there's a window that allows to see the events in the sea.
The most innocent design is likely to wait for buyers in Langenfeld, and the aquaculture in Ectale appears to be NLO only in the Alpine.
The winter is up to three of the open cancers, which are very small on the bottom of the Ectal Mountains.
Algamber in Swartzwald
The Countrier of the Meder wasn't meeting the clouds in each bassin.
Many terminal purchases are shocked by a series, and the copper names of Arcade in Becketschabe are so shocked with the oil that you may be hard to believe you are in a health source.
Hydrocarbonates in milk water. Water is nearly black from ice to the hair when you are loading in the bassin, a health experience of a certain type.
Iris Meder, however, was a certain moment in his search for beautiful purchase places, and when she tried to visit the open basin of the Chesh shops in Lugachizis, she found that the territory was printed.
The coppery projected by Dushan Yurkovid was closed in 1902.
When Meder looked at a red-white-year window in the ar-week style, she saw a shoe that grows between caffees.
One of the places where the destruction was stopped by the heat, the surprising placing basin in Schvartzwald, the Dead of the Term water in Bad Wildbade.
The Bassians have already been through three stages of construction, and you will find not only the non-roman elements of the period after the construction in 1844, but also the Maurice Hall in the Algambro style added in about 1900.
After a prestigious reconstruction in 1995, the Term Garden is a loved swimming bassin of the finding of the Iris Meder bass and not only because she was born from Swartzwald.
"This real achievement is so master to combine such different architecture styles", said Meder.
The nervous of the terminal basin in that door is apparently an incredible occupation.
Agricultural training
Finch Bank is investigating the trade in agricultural products.
Christian Tivs
Doech Bank stops to trade agricultural product?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Joseph Akkerman has given the task of investigating the impacts of the poor worldwide.
The Executive Director plans to make changes in January.
Hamburg -
For the German citizens, the situation is clear, according to a study, 84 per cent of the Germans are inacceptable that the banks are equipped with agricultural products such as birds and cucuurs.
Two thirds of the requested persons require that Doych Bank and other banks stop the marketing of agricultural products because trade affects the problems faced by the poorest people in the world.
The conclusions were made in the study conducted by the Institute of Social Research and Forza Statistical Analysis by the consumers of Foodwatch.
The study is based on the report submitted by Foodwatch in Middle October.
The report author Harald Schuman shows that the games in world goods are higher prices and banks, thus participating in global hunger.
Consumer protection campaigns are directly directed against the head of the Duke Bank Yosefa Akkerman, although large bank houses, such as Hodman Sax and Morgan Stanley, are buying the same.
Product rates were originally considered as a means for the protection of traders from the collection of prices.
In any case, most experts now agree that the games have rejected the proposal and demand rules and are used by the poorest ones.
Unlike the competitors in the United States, Akkerman replied to the criticism, he promised to investigate the accused and said that there was no trade "no risk of a good reputation of Doech Bank".
In accordance with SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group currently examines the accusions contained in the Foodwatch report.
The survey should be concluded until the results are submitted to the Governing Directors of the Danny Bank, with the recommendations for action.
The Head of the Bank then plans to declare the changes after the investigation at the end of January.
Trade of goods may be decreased or completely stopped.
Akkerman works on his immigration.
The President Foodwatch Tylo Bode has enjoyed news, emphasized its critical attitude to the financial sector. "The increased food prices are an example of the unexpected example of banks today operating against general interests."
As the main lobster of the bank at Akkerman has a specific duty, Bod.
"The Bank must remove all investments that make money rates for food prices from the portfolio," said Bode.
"It doesn't matter whether it's about hungers or the reputation of the Danny Bank."
The early reaction of Akkerman was surprising, but the director would like to have an unforeseen edge all over a few months before the end of his stay in the office.
Finch Bank announced on Monday that the Chairman would not be in the observing Council as planned.
The declining of the speculations on the market of foods could improve its nigs.
He also does not need to take care of expenditure - with the consequences of his primary.
Each second would refuse to invest in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep pressure on the manager.
Today more than 30,000 Internet users were joined to the organization campaign.
Bode published a study in Thursday, which was conducted for the Institute of Social Research and Statistics for Forsa 7 and 8 November, and 1001 were involved.
Not more than 11 per cent believe that investments that make food price rates are acceptable for the Danny Bank.
Many bank clients would also take concrete steps if they found that their bank is involved in such trade, and according to the investigation, each second would send contributions to the specialization of goods.
43 per cent would be recommended to leave from the bank, 49 per cent said that they thought about the closure and transfer to another bank.
21th century house in Vienna
Pavilion on the New
Winsbowski Injeborg
Architective history with planes, falls and happy ends, and Pavilion Austria for the World Exhibition of 1958 in Brussels, became a museum in Vienna, desert, and was buried.
Now it will be opened again as an exhibition centre.
Pavelon Austria, designed by Carlo Swancer for the World Exhibition in Brussels in 1958, is an example of the modern post-architecture with its simple forms, strict strikes that expressed the faith in technical progress.
Pavilion Swanzer has bought the Gren-for-architecture in 1958 for its light-scale building of its becomes and strikes.
The building is considered a cluster in modern architecture.
The architect was so popular that he also built the Palilion of Austria on the next World Summit.
At the end of the end, he glorified the whole world in 1973 his legendary BMW and her sister as a chash building.
Pavilion, as a building for temporary exhibitions, was transferred to the Switzerland garden around the Southern Wayne, converted and opened as Museo of the 20th century in 1962, and often mentioned as "the 20th century House" for this reason.
Anyway, the building had not agreed to the museum on technical and space views, and there was no shooting in which arts could be painted, and a bad air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until the modern art in Vienna had received a new house.
The house was desolated since 2001, and its status was worse and worse.
Architector Adolf Crishanitz has reset the pavilion, which was called "the 21th century House" and will be used as a modern art Museum.
This museum is the Belveder Museum Division, which opens the first exhibition on Thursday night, in all senses, a joyful event.
Agnes Hussein-Arco, who became a new director of the Austrian Galerie of Belveder in 2007, contributed to the new beginning.
Hussilyn-Arco, a historic artist of art with a young physician in Sothebys, the Guggenheim Museum, and, finally, became a founder and director of the Museum of Modernity in Salzburg, convinced politicians and guards to continue reconstruction, engaged public resources and private donations and decided how to use the building.
The new museum was to have a permanent exhibition of the Fund of Friza, Café, and a bookshop along with modern art, and a official building should also be built.
Strong Control & Limit Budget
Crishanitz was then a perfect candidate for the implementation of the project.
He was known, due to the restoration and expansion of the Vienna Session, Joseph Olbrik and wins competitors, but he also learned in Swanzer at the Vienna University of Technology, and Palilion was a "excellently important place" for him where he visited the exhibitions "until week".
He knew the original design and knew the tasks that were before the building, the building that had already lost part of his greatness and easyness when it was transferred to Vienna and transformed.
The last rebuilding problems were very serious, and the building was a "energy pump", says Krishanitz.
The window profiles were replaced by a strike fascinate, a forced sleeve safe sleeve was placed, and a high-speed slipper was replaced.
The traduction of the heat bridge was reinforced or replaced, and the bridges were burned.
Two stages below have created a space for the new use of the building, shooting between the building and the streets, which provides a clearness of almost new buildings, but continues to be made by the Swanzer pavilion.
The original doors were stored, and the building was cast into an old red-root color protection against corruption.
The kinotheater is the same as before.
This is all with the strict control of the museum management and with a limited budget.
"We often had to find a material that was good, sweet, and would be accepted by the museum management", says Crishanitz, pointing out a slight shock in the subcarbon.
The building remained flexible and light, despite limitations, problems and preventions.
Krishanitz recently noted that the pavilion of Brussels was a typical story of "Capels in the city".
This architecture is not always on its own place, but it wants to "move the real understanding".
At the 21st century, there is a very right place because in the planning of the city there was an unexpected luck, and the full rebuilding quarter of the main vacuum, with offices and housing in movement, grows around the Switzerland garden.
At the 21th century, there may be a second happiness of events: after the second building of the Cristina, the Francisk Collectioner of the Habbsburg, has acquired the Interim Exhibition Hall of Berlin and, as it is reported, the negotiations with the city on his location near the Swiss garden.
Deutsche Bahn plans a multimillional winter anticrisis package
Deutsche Bahn has generated an anti-crisis plan to avoid the eradication of winter trains.
The number of staff must be increased by two.
The costs are millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Germane Bahn will cost more than 70 million euros in this year to avoid winters and late trains.
In response to the internal anticrisis plan Germane Bahn, the Billd newspaper reports that up to 2015 an overall investment of EUR 300 million was planned.
Investment is allocated to enhance locomotives and smoke networks even in extreme weather conditions.
The number of own and dedicated staff in the shipping of snow and platforms will be increased to 16.000.
The aim is to clean the platforms from snow and ice before the start of work and 90 per cent of the necessary pillars from four to five hours.
Rudiger Gruba, head of German Bahn, warned the possibilities of cancelling the winter journey at the meeting with government leaders and industry two months ago.
Last winter Germane Bahn had experienced significant difficulties with passenger transport because it was not sufficient to reserve at the time of deterioration of weather conditions.
Many of the new regional trains have been expected to accept the Federal Economy Service.
Some delays were also delayed by ICE trains.
In many years, German Bahn has also been increasingly checking the ICE trains as a result of one of the ICE trains on the main airport in Kelene.
Reach Bank will pay a million feet of storage in the United States
New inquiries resulted in the concerns around Joseph Akkerman, Director-General Danny Bank: The Bank has threatened the shock in the United States in millions of feet of sterlings.
In fact, Duke Bank had few problems in the family, and the past industrial guigan in the United States has now been sent to it, and the Bank is paying 145 million dollars (106 million euros) to enhance the controversies resulting from banking during the financial crisis of the five major credit unions.
The problem occurred around the sales of hypothetics.
The National Financial Market Office (CNUA), the Financial Market Regulator, condemns a number of larger banks that they have used false promises in order to impose credit unions to buy their financial products.
The amount of funds has slightly declined during the financial crisis and has led down credit unions.
"We are glad that we have solved this problem without treating the parties in court," said the representative of the Bank in New York.
The bank's agreement did not recognize its fault.
The same is true for the Citi-Gruppe, which agreed to pay $20.5 million.
The President of the CNUA Debbie Mattz welcomed the operational reaction of both banks.
The National Credits Management (UNC) is responsible for the United States credit unions and is involved in banking processes to protect consumer contributions.
CNUA is struggling for compensation of losses resulting from billions.
This is the first agreement of such a kind.
The regulator also focused on other major banks and summer cases against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
Summary hypotheticals are named “value papers” firms.
They supported internal business.
This decided to judge a number of financial companies, when in 2007 a poster on the market of non-motiveness in the United States.
The American Investment Bank Lehman Brothers ordered to live long in September 2008 for the financial crisis.
A few years later, banks in the United States are still fighting with a shock.
Investors and regulators have made a large number of claims, demanding compensation or employees.
The Federal Agency for Employment Financing (FHFA).
It accused 18 major international banks that they have acquired $200 billion in the United States credit organizations Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
The Bank is also under the threat of the judicial proceedings by FHFA on several general value agreements of $14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator requires that the bank from the Franckfurt apartment bank takes the responsibility for "community losses" but has not yet indicated exact amount.
Doych Bank rejected the claims as unfair and reported about the purpose of opposing them.
Warren Baffat contributes 10 billion to IBM
The Baffat Financial Gulf is actively invested in the IBM IT Companion.
Since March, he purchased shares for a total of $10 billion.
The largest American investor Warren Baffat has always stated that it was not inverted in computers and ITs because their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, the annual report of IBM has changed its view of investment in this area.
According to Baffet, it was much to understand that IBM first proposes services and purchase computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Baffet has been evaluated as the market.
The IBM, Véteran of IT, has now received the title "Sister IBM".
In the United States business channel, CNBC Baffit reported that from March he acquired IBM shares for a total of $10.7 billion.
His investment curding Berkshire Hathaway became one of the largest IBM shareholders with 5,5 per cent.
Baffit said that even IBM had not known anything about his participation before the recent time.
He endorsed the mining that was able to achieve even during the financial crisis.
"They have done a great job," said Buffet, with a view to the mining strategy.
The significant time of IBM was focused on high-earth IT services, such as the centre date.
The main component of the computer area, which has been proposed for more than 100 years today, has also been proposed to provide software and consultative services, as well as powerful business computers.
Buffy has still avoided technological companies.
He claimed that he invested only in the company whose business he understands.
and invested, for example, in the shipping shipping, in the production of soft materials and in machine construction.
His coldging Berkshire Hathaway has a long list of larger companies, such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (ex-munchener back), along with about 80 own daughter companies.
The 81-year-old has acquired a small textile company of Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and made it based on one of the most precious companies of the world.
His shadow of life, however, remained modest,
He made it cultural figures for innumerated investors around the world.
His almost unfair instinct in money has brought him the name "Oracula from Omachi".
The IBM share price increased by one per cent before the opening of the market after the Baffith investment announcement.
The Golden Giant, called the IBM, is more than 220 billion dollars on the funds, which makes it one of the most precious world technology companies along with Apple and Microsoft.
But Baffit said that he wouldn't be invested in Microsoft.
Her founder Bill Gates is his close friend.
Inevitably
After the detection of the twenty-earths in Zimbabwe, the Turkish media became doubtful in the authority of the Republic of Germany.
One of the newspapers speaks of the "clear ideology", which is now up to the surface.
The murder of the eight tourists and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 was the result of the right of extremist ideology.
The fear and concern reacted to this message in Turkey and the German and Turkey community.
For many towers, this news has been forgotten for a long time, and such orthodox orthodox attacks on turk have not been shocked in Meln in November 1992 and Zolyngen in May 1993.
There has never been doubts, however, that xenophobia in Germany exists.
However, the right-extreme network now has such a scale that is not yet completely recognized.
"Nation of blood ideology?" was the title of the Turkish Haberturk newspaper's Internet version.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, notes that one of the criminals was a secret acknowledgement of the Secret Services and expresses concern that the German authorities may be a legal illness.
Turk community in Germany (TGD) has reacted calmly, with the victims of racial hate of silence against the Brendanburg gate in those weeks.
Over two weeks ago, the Turkish community of Berlin at the ceremony with the participation of the German and Turkey political politicians noted the fifty-year anniversary of the Dual-Turkey Dual Agreement on the Find Working Force.
Cooperation between two countries has been represented in a positive light, as a history of success.
The publication in some Turkeyn media was as a sweet. "Dead from Germany at the fifty-year anniversary" was the name of one of the articles on the Turkish Internet Haber X, the commentary situation of a series of murders.
The German publication of Heritage has not been allowed to carry out this parallel.
The "National" is the name of the Ahmet Culaji column.
He notes that the murdered persons who paid taxes and their work have contributed significantly to the conversion of Germany.
The police ' s conduct and the successive area of the German and Turkey ' s Internet forums were criticized.
The authors questioned why the German authorities had not previously thought to follow suspects in law circles.
Some authors have reached a very rare rhythm. "If they will continue to act so unlikely, the migrants will have no other choice, except the armed self-defence."
"This will be the best self-defense."
"The Mother in Germany is very depending on how all the network and the justice of punishment will be hidden", says "Selen".
Crimes in Meln and Zolyngen in the 1990s were example of the peace in Germany under threat.
The photos of the cuts in Zolyngen were deeply printed in the memory of the Germans and the torch.
No other events have shown that the tourists are so obvious that there are dangers on them, and the Germans are that infidelity and equality may be a real violence.
However, these crimes have increased the feeling of the one tower.
Do not repeat past errors
Turkey’s press was mainly condemned by the German police after the attacks, and Germut Cole refused to visit the survivors in Meln.
He sent a telegram to the President of Turkey after the slaughter in Zolingen, but participating in the Memorial Ceremony in Kelene, his Minister for Foreign Affairs, Claus Kinkel - Kinkel, had been subjected to the taxes paid in Germany,
Like he determined the value of human taxes that he pays.
The current revelation in Turkey’s media has reaffirmed how the incredible incredible of many German towards the current German State has been.
He clearly showed that it was necessary to do more than the efforts to identify and revival legitimate terrorist organizations in Germany.
Bank Scanda on the Cuban Lake
Most European banking policies are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
The UBS had not been confused during the financial crisis, and since then it has been struggled with another crisis.
Now returning him to a faithful course must be Germany.
Alex Weber probably didn't suspect that he had the role.
In July, after his effective departure from the Federal Bank's head, he was declared that in 2013, he would start working at least an effective post, the Chairman of the Directors of the UBS Summit Bank; an unexpected and profitable carriage.
Alex Weber was obvious, honored Switzerland for her beauty, the UBS for a re-designed reliability and made several friendly comments in the address of his future colleagues.
"UBS could change to the better."
"I'm glad to wait for the opportunity to work with Castpar Phillipher and Oswald Grabel."
But in September it was clear that everything would be completely different.
The UBS trainer in London was covered by the bank security system and spends about EUR 1.7 billion.
The Executive Director of the UBS Oswald Grabel bankier, known not only in Switzerland, had to go.
Since then, the Chairman of the Directors of UBS is considered sick, and everyone wants to know, when would Alex Weber finally be in charge?
Weber must consult the bank from February 2012.
And, as the bank stated on Tuesday, the Chairman of the Board will take in May, not in 2013.
It's not easy for Alex Weber.
He is an economic and specialist, not a traditional banker, and there is no need to be time to adapt.
He was soon responsible for the bank strategy, which has proved that long ago the calling "the main bank scandale in Europe".
UBS, from one part, has been very large - until recently he has managed the world's most largest assets, and has not been able to benefit from scandaries for other years.
It seems that the Swedish Bank doesn't shock anything.
Everything started during the financial crisis.
Up to 2007, UBS had a beautiful reputation.
Bank has connected the image of a hidden and sustainable, but at the same time a smooth management as an ambitious goals and the effort to become the largest player in investment banking.
In 2007, UBS managed 1.6 billion, so that it was in the management of more money for state customers than any other bank in the world,
And as an investment bank, the largest banks of the world went into.
That was a impression.
Hans Gaeger, an ex-banker and professor of banking business, who has long provided to the Institut of the University of the Banks, explains, "I have always brought my students to UBS as a picture of a good bank."
"What we know now, you can ask how I could do so wrong."
He's really very wrong.
Only in 2007, it was clear that there was something wrong with UBS.
In the middle of the year, the executive director Peter Wofflee, who was considered an extraordinary intellectual, and at the same time a literature banker, was unexpectedly out of his place.
A few months later, we could suggest why he was gone.
The Bank's Investment Unit tried to play in substantial price shuttles and was required to write billions.
You want to believe, no, but the UBS reported about the increase in the capital for 13 billion Swiss Frances to oppose the crisis.
The Bank was really aware of finding investors - but investors whose services would have recently rejected, - one of the very unproportional Asian Sovereign Funds from Singapore and one Arab Sovereign Fund that was hidden so much that even the name was not reported.
It was just the first shot.
In April 2008, everything was worse.
Bank had to announce new billion losses, and the Chairman of the Directors of Marcel Opel, second on the payment rate of the Chairman of the Directors Council in Switzerland in 2006, left away.
In October 2008, a disaster began, and because of the lack of investment during the financial crisis, the UBS was threatened by the struggle, and the State had to save it.
The National Bank has purchased a total of billions of dollars in UBS, and the Swiss Conference paid six billion Swiss Frances for the convergence of compulsory convergence to become a owner of the bank.
The whole Swedish was shocked: the country understood the dramatic consequences of large banks in a small country.
At the end of 2007, the UBS final balance was five times more than all production of Switzerland (see graphic).
"We can't save UBS in the second time," says the bank analysis of Gaeger.
The second disaster came quickly after the first.
A few months later, UBS funded tax controversial with the United States and stated that he was ready to provide state customers that might have been able to give taxes.
UBS also agreed to pay $780 million from the reimbursement of unjustified revenues from business and costs.
The UBS therefore acknowledged that it was a instrument for tax torment.
At the same time, the UBS lost his advantage to combat rich customers, the secretity.
After that, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same than before.
The Executive Director and Chairman of the Directors after that, and
The customer's money started.
In a few months, the bank lost confidence in both main areas of its activities - in investing in because of losses and management of assets, resulting in aid and promotion of tax relief.
And it's all over, and it's been like, that the UBS could slow up the situation as this disaster happened with a trader farmer. The single trainer left EUR 1.7 billion before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
The risk management of the investment office is clearly not working.
"The Adoboli Institute clearly showed that risk control was not sufficiently changed", says Martin Janssen, Economy Profesor and Finance in the Switzerland Bank Affairs Institute of the University of Cuba.
The Financial Director of one of the largest German banks is also not doubtful: “UBS has no risk control tool.”
It has been careful for Switzerland's larger world shareholders for a long time - not a risk of risk, but the security for money, without whether the world has been disappeared outside the Alpine Republic or not yet.
Swiss banks have become a symbol of unreasonable confidence, as Lindt and Springli symbolize the shocked shock.
The UBS apartment stab in Cuba still corresponds to the image of the pleasant Swiss private bank, just a little more.
She's the same classic.
The Headquarters of the Bank is located in Zurich at Banhofshrass, which leads to the main coast to the Zurich Lake, in the area of Switzerland's snow snakes.
The buildings here are grown, and the shopping rates are one of the highest in Europe.
Among the traditional Swiss business type of Confiserie Springli, you can find young companies like Tiffany's.
Switzerland's banks have been here for hundreds of years - from the National Bank to the port of Keith Suis and the elite private banks, such as Julias Bar.
The hard door leads to the UBS.
On the floor of the murder, the star stands great hair shocks, with the snack of a big seed bank.
The UBS knows that he needs his customers, it's reliability.
But both Switzerland's largest banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, in some moment rejected the Swiss banking idea - or, as the head trusted in one of the Swiss small banks, they delivered them.
He wouldn't want to see his name in the newspaper, as well as all Swiss bankers, to cooperate with two larger banks.
He believes that UBS has become too larger, in particular in investment banking, where English is very active.
He's thinking that the Switzerlandns don't want to add anything here.
"And if there's something, they've been adapted to the anglacksson practices for a long time."
Indeed, the English banking has changed the UBS, bringing him the first big arrives, and then the fascism, and no other financial institution of Europe has lost so much money in the Jungles as the largest Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparently 15 October 2008.
“In that environment, a small country's right coalition with the population of seven million people has undertaken the greatest rescue operation in the history of the country,” wrote Lucas Hessig in its book Khat UBS.
Politics approved 68 billion Switzerland Frances (e.g. 45 billion euros) to save the bank from banking.
How could I get before that?
If you ask Swiss banks, they will say that the problem is mainly in the UBS size.
Two of the three larger Swiss banks joined a large group in June 1998.
There was a bank education that had already been too large for the Switzerland little, and a bank that has continued to grow.
This helped also to add two UBS banks to each other, one was rich but a steady bank specialized in Cuba for the management of assets; another was not so rich but much more internationalized.
Internationalized investment banks have immediately received access to a large number of money that they could use to move all the powerful route.
Two names are related to the growth of the UBS: Peter Wolfley, Executive Director of the UBS Group from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Opel, Chairman of the Directors Board.
"I always thought that Wolfly and Opple were a dream team," says the bank analysis Hans Gagger.
"Wulfley, which is intellectual, modest and deeply comprehensive models and statistics, and Opplel with his internal instinct that passed the whole way up, starting from the staircase in the bank."
But Opel was finally put on Wolfly.
And Wolfly could make a critical mistake. "He decided that his models were reality," says Gager.
"This is tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
The honour is the infringement.
The servants of the UBS recall the meetings of the government members on which Wolfly has always repeated one and the same lounge - to submit Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At that time, he declared the "turn table" in which bank success was made.
The UBS wanted to spend on the top of this table.
He was able to make a part of that way.
UBS was the larger player in the trade of currency and public valuable buggers.
The authorized management advisers, however, indicated a weak place, and the option called " Permanent Income", was far behind the largest banks.
UBS had lost in American hypothetical products.
To shut the dark, the UBS entered the autumn, who hadn't ever been in his life.
As a result of growth, the bank itself and the hedge Fund invested in American substantive papers.
This has been developed in a large mechanism, which combined the value papers based on American and powerful credits and continued to sell them, and continued to bring risks.
Even when other banks have been looking for a way to get out of the process, the UBS has not stopped.
"The UBS has struck up until the summer 2007 when the American market of non-motiveness has already been fired," says the bank analysis of Gagger.
More than growing, it is deeply deep.
One manager had to go on when attempting to put the bank into order was more difficult than first.
The posts to UBS have become a child game with stales, and the current remains insufficient.
Before anyone who launchs this big bank, it is almost impossible.
He must find a bank strategy that has returned to all existing business models.
Hager's bank analysis already has an idea - rejecting investment banking, focusing on the management of assets and forgetting their Switzerland rains.
The bank, however, is not ready to go so far.
However, it is obvious that investment activities need to be substantial.
The new head of the Sergio Ermotti bank plans to submit its future strategy on Tuesday.
51-year-old Swiss banker was actually considered only as an temporary decision when the bank was unexpectedly disappeared with his former Grabel.
In the past, he was grateful to show the nature, and now, as he stated on Monday, the UBS continued.
Ernotti plans to return the investment bank to the state in which he was in the mid-90s.
He reduces 3500 jobs.
But it's not enough.
UBS needs the concept of development.
What is UBS?
How is he planning for money?
These questions must be taken by Axel Weber.
He's still publicly told only that they're looking for a apartment in Zurich.
The next year.
Preoccupation in recession in Europe lows the American Fund
The moved recession in Europe has deteriored the development of American investors in the beginning of the week.
The change in the Governments in Athenach and Rome had no great effect.
The decline of industrial production in the continent was hoped that long crisis could be overcome.
The overall relief followed by the Governments in Rome and Athena, has not been strengthened.
Euro has fallen in relation to the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek stakeholder still considered half full, not half of the empty -- but now the problem goes back to the first plan, said Mark Luskini from Janney Mongomery Scott.
Financial shops, in particular, were in the sales list.
The Industry Index Dow Jones closed at 12.078 per cent.
The barometer of the market was between 12.027 and 12.170 points.

Industrial trumpets are filled with the city
Greats are considered difficult birds in many places, and today experts say that these very intelligent birds are not able to get out of towns.
Some like birds, others would like to be removed as soon as possible, and the troops of centuries were part of the city landscape, but the people who complained about the smiling and the smile are increasingly in many populations.
The problem of birds, however, has not been achieved.
At the first symposium, in Ler, the experts said that the player was no longer able to get out of the towns.
Specialists and all Germany have discussed possible decisions.
Search for urban alternatives
Conservationists claimed that the root problem in the cities was in migration with special protected games, indicating that the use of chemicals in the agricultural farm has been stronger destroyed the traditional drought arrays.
The wheel that expanded the building and the shooting of the traditional trees involving the birds has complicated their lives.
The troops are safe.
In the city of Zest in West Fari and northwest in Yevere, Diplom, Ahima under Bmen and Lere, there are large colonies of over 600 parents.
The unacceptable project of the vulgar shooting in Lere made unacceptable newspaper titles in 2005.
Critics described the wood of birds in the woods and shooted them with their balls as a special cruelty.
"The good movement and the powder aren't giving nothing." - "The architect and the Landscape Designer Verner Cliver from Lera said.
The shock of water snakes or trees are often unwanted, said an expert on the protection of the environment of Manfred Kaiser from Lara, Baden-Vurtumberg.
"The lives are disappeared and large colonies are shared and distributed in other areas."
Population may only be placed in exception from hospitals, homes of pre-aged and schools.
"We have to live with them, we'll be free from them, it's not a option."
Mr. Ler Wolfgang Kelner will not be resolved in the departure of the areas of the city.
The combination of birds disappointment from the needs of living areas and their encouragement to return to other areas could be a way.
"Information murders instead of Benzopil" was a lozing proposed by the psychologist and etnologue of Utoia Marie Yürgens, who speaks for a completely different approach to birds. "We should be sure to live with this problem."
Jürgens was one of the founders of the training routine in Asherberg in Slovenia, where information about the lives of very industrial games is provided.
The draft has already been interested in tourists.
Jurgens also expressed his view of the pleasant grieves made by birds. "The Sum transmits a lot of information, and they have to say much to each other."
The snake of these birds entered the legends, and the snakes often use no weapons for the shooting shock, but also the weapons themselves.
Recently, researchers at Cambridge University protested the shock of birds on four games.
In one experiment, birds quickly understood that they had to spend on the skin to obtain a skin.
Without special training, they learned the size and shape of a stone that was necessary to cut the rain.
Another experience of constitutive games had to address a more complicated task.
For researchers, a small bicycle of prayer was placed in the vertical cylinder.
The birds couldn't be able to get a bull.
But the researchers gave them a piece of shooting.
All four birds were used to make a snake and use a snake to shoot the hands and switch it out of the cylinder.
Three of the four games have been done with this since the first trial.

Massive murder - Human measurement
The pressing and very good new book of Peter Englendo 'Craso and pain: The personal history of the First World War's, starts a long list of those who are in the heart.
This is the counsel to read the following: Be carefully cut this page and use it as a bookmark.
You will meet these people very closely in the events of Mr. Englendo, and this list of active persons will be your GPS, your magie at the time when, like one of these men and women, you'll get out of the way and lose in the dark war.
Mr. Englendo is the Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also a new permanent secretariat of the Sweden Academy, which condemns the Nobel Prize on Literature.
The book he wrote now is unreasonable, he describes it, precisely as "the work of anti-Historical work".
There are few known names, important treaties or famous battles; there is almost no message, a smooth journalists or the discussion of tactics and war technologies.
It's not so much book about what it was, he explains how much "letter of what it was like." It's about "the senses, impressions, concerns and the state of the spirit."
The book of the Cruz and Diseases was a single experience of more than 20-year-old military men and women, both of the front line, from school schools and firms to alpinists, doctors, fast assistance drivers and staff.
Some of these people will be heroes.
Someone's going to fall in the leg, lose his hand or feet, get out of mind, or die.
Their lives are dead here as church snakes: new are added to many others, and some of them are at this time.
The book of Mr. Englendo is the outcome of the historic book standard.
This is the amendment to imagine that the First World War was only a weak occupied war on the Western front.
The "Praces and tribulation" has been able to give to the panoramic other military theaters: Alp, Balkan, Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The troops in this book fall the legs; one of them meets the Christmas in Egypt under the piramids; the unresolved problem is the shock.
It's a worried book, almost from the beginning.
The war covers the lives of these people like a natural disaster, such as the uragan Catherine, who slaughtered by an unmatched pork.
When you're closely hearing canoned, and you're a woman and you're home with children, you're gonna stay in the place or flee?
Or otherwise, who's going to it?
There is no one who understands what happens and just why we have to fight in this war.
"The lack of facts," observes Mr. Englendo, "complete with records, suggestions, hopes, fears, ideas, theories of interview, dreams, cosmetics and listens."
"Create and pain" takes care of the judge of people like Florence Farmboro, the English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpff, a young German Floth of open sea.
Their history is taken primarily from memories, letters and other already published materials.
Discussions of their lives may be horrible or shocking, but they are higher than lived by Mr. Englendo, a small moment and a cut-off detail.
Many of them are about punishment and how to do them.
When he told the history of a German school, he said, "Erzaz, the doctor."
"Amentorcofe, separate aluminium, hate rains, paper links, wooden pugovians."
He continues to tell herself in Germany.
He describes "the meat of the presumed quality of grain grain (and a false skin made from tree); a table made from the roots and the swimming sweet skin shoes; eggs, shooted by tree."
He notes that there was “837 registered meat replacements for the production of cowboys, 511 registered coffee substitutors”.
Some stories say honor and refreshment.
One american observes its own debt to cruelness and says about the war: "You feel that, at the end of the end, this is what men have been created, not to sit in good crystals with smoke and whiskey, night newspaper or freezeler, and to say that this indicator and there are civilizations and under your narrow shoes are not hidden. "
The British soldier, on the contrary, notes that he may have died and no one will not see and smile.
"When a person is mourning with the thinking of self-offering, he would like to think that it will happen before the public," he writes.
But that's a horrible thing, it's like a man who's secretly condemned.
Other comments relate to the old Europe, which is disappeared and the new kind of fear.
"The Conflicto has become more economicly devastating", writes Mr. Englendo, "the war plants".
He emphasizes the coming of those who are called "a new species in the early century: a beautiful and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a well-known shooting snare that stirs the snake, sit in the written table."
People act unexpectedly: low effects as much as heroism.
Mr. Englendo told soldiers who were always trying to follow the prostitution of veneritic disease to avoid the prior service.
"There is a pleasant expression in the trade of gorgeous gnome that soldiers have buried and diged in themselves by genetics in hope to get in the hospital," he wrote.
"There were the very disappointed ones cut him into the eyes that often led to a lifestyle."
Mr. Englenda's sweet Peter Gravez was sweet, but it was slightly adapted to his humanist task.
In the decades of small scenes, he shows how the war "freeth completely uncontrolled forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People start to ask why their leaders put them to fight.
The best books on the I World War were often indirect, such as "The Great War and the Modern Memory" Paul Fassel or Romans, such as "The Western front without change" Erich Mariah Remark, not historical works.
The book Mr. Englendo enters this unfortunate pantheon.
His book has the most exciting finish that I can remember in an amazing literature.
I won't tell him.
But that's like he got out of the book to the page of a person's list, cut it into you from your hand and the shooting.
After the previous error, the speech is precisely estimated
hundreds of police officers have been employed in the operation, some in protected shelves.
The night hours from Monday for Monday were chosen because in Zuokothy Park there should be less people at that time.
Operation was held in secret from all, except a few high-employed officials, and the other first said that they were going to learn.
The police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was in the centre of events, and his presence stressed the importance of the operations of the Department of Police.
It was not possible to repeat these episodes last weeks, such as the use of the switch gas against the protesters, which opposed the department rules and urraged the sympathy public to the occupants.
Thus, after two weeks of planning and training, the police operation was started to be released from the protesting Zekoti Park.
The authorities were ready to observe how the occupation was disrupted in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis teachings were conducted on the Randall Island with calculation in Zuckott.
The authorities have increased the number of trains called in cases of terrorism, which provide a rapid movement of a large number of police officers to be called below Manhattan.
The last train was on Monday at the East River side of Manhattan.
The command to enter the park came in the last minute, and told the source known with the commands in which the order was mentioned only as a "truck".
"There are some of the police I know and called on this case, they didn't say they've sent to the Zoothy Park," said the man who talked about anonymity conditions.
"The only ones who knew they're going to Zuckotty Park were at the highest posts in the Department."
One of the reasons for secretity was a lesson that rescued the city.
On October 14, the authorities wanted to clean the park, but they departed from hundreds of protesters who cryed inside before the designated period, listening to these plans.
In Friday, the officers of various police offices, including the police teams, were used to control criminal districts.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost as at work, come out of the park during the day, which makes an appropriate time for arrival at 1 a.m.
"It was well to do that when the park was less people in the park," he said.
Saving machines with drivers and voice speakers, gathered at Pyck-Slip and Franklin Roosevelt-Draw, near the Manhattan Mosque, before they turned forward.
The dictator and previously registered statements from the speakers seemed to have threatened many protesters.
When the officers of the administrative units in their blue winds were in the park, many protesters simply collected their things and left.
The police reported that the pillars did not throw up until 1:45 night, giving the protesting time to collect things.
Other police groups, as witnesses, gathered at the perimeter to enter in case the arrests were required in the park.
Journalists in the park were put to leave.
Paul J. Brown, representative of the head of the Department of Police, said that this was done for their security.
But many journalists claim that they did not see how the police works, and that the police were struggling with them.
Mr. Brown said the TV machines on the Cherch Street, over the west border of the park, could take a picture.
When the police went to western through the struggle of personal protesters, including cups, plastic boxes, and polyethics, full clothes, the officers of the Department of the Sanitary shipped after it, collecting what was broken.
Some protesters who refused to get out of the outdoor, the photos of the internet quickly appeared.
The main group of protesters took position next to the kitchen camp in the park centre.
Some have been prepared barrifugs, and the police was inside, methodically arresting them.
About 10 men in the episode of the camp were shocked together.
And two men took themselves to the trees, said Mr. Kelly.
In order to cut the signs, rescue officers were called.
There were no arrests in the park until 3:30 in the morning, Mr. Kelly said.
Clearing operation was completed about 75 minutes and reported the police.
Mr. Brown said that some 142 persons were arrested in the park.
Most were arrested for "infringement of public order and opposition in detention," he said.
The highest officer was Joseph J. Esposito, head of the Department and senior officer at the Department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the department, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, although he was present, "not directed the operation," said Mr. Brown.
The Second Police Group was waiting for the east of Broodwey, between Liberty Street and Sidar Street, if necessary, if it had to be entered.
The loans were placed on the Cortland Street, the northern of the park, and the Pyn-Strate, the southern quarter.
The observers saw the expansion of the police’s positions even further over the Zoothy Park border.
At one time, observers saw as a police group, many with shields, endured people further.
About 28 people were northern perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night have occurred to the south of the park.
About 5 a.m., one of the protesters shocked a police machine, and others, in the words of the witnesses, pulled air out of the police shore.
At a moment, the shooter flyed a piece of fans.
As a result, one policeman and one of the protesters were hosted.
Professionate for Services of Schools in the Court of Exemption
The Professional, representing hundreds of school staff personnel lost place in the last month, plans to provide a city court in the midst, claiming that freedom was not necessary and discriminated because of non-proportional impact on school where poor students were taught.
Judicial election is likely the last means available for the 37 environmental provision to abolish freedom.
Sixty-seventy-two school assistants, parent-coordinator and other officials, who were among the lowest employees in the city, lost their place on 7 October, as a result of the prosecution ' s calls for political response to their refusal to give the city access to medical funds managed by the workers to closure the latter budget.
The citizens were classically rejected by the accused.
During the hearing of the People ' s Council last month, Denise M. Walcott Officer said that there was a part of the budget they signed in June.
One of the members of the Board said that there was no indication in the budget that the supporting staff of the school would be released.
Representatives of the 37 environmental Council reported that they had requested the notification of recruitment, warning the Department of Education against it; the press conference will be held in the midst to announce the formal expense to the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
As respondents, Mr. Walcott and the Department of the Education of the city will be indicated as a result of eight temporary employees, all of them are black or Latin American women, as well as most of the assistants who lose their place.
Elizabeth Thomas, representative of the city's legal department, said that the city had not seen the search and could therefore not comment on its specific provisions.
In accordance with the preliminary version of the complaint in New York Times, the professor focused on a number of volunteers in the poorest towns to support the claim of injust treatment, claiming that the poor schools had lost more asylums because they were chronically unfinancing.
He indicates that there was no volunteer at the State Island, and there was little in the high schools of East Side or Tribeki, 17 support workers had lost place in the 23th district in Brooklyn, Brooklyn, and 46 had to go to the districts 8 and 9 of South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five of the eight school assistants working at Harlem for a average school in 36 in Harlem, where 68 per cent of the students live in poverty, it says: “These are no areas of state parents who can find money to fill the losses in the budget.”
P.S. 36. Budget was raised to 3.26 per cent in this year, and it also lost money when the city has changed the way to calculate additional financing for each poor student in school.
The Professional also claims that the director of the school could be introduced in a false language of notification authorised to free work coordinators with parents.
The notification used the word " exceedance ", although it is often said when the teacher from the school payment state moves to the list of existing employees who pays the central office.
" Sixty-six work coordinators were allowed with parents," says the black shock, "not just translated."
Mission End, Congress is ready to agree on Libya
It seems that the Republicans and Democratics at the Capitol golf are finally ready to agree on some of the resurrection in Libya.
All that was needed is that the slaughter could get, the long dictator Muamar Kadafi was taken in and killed, and the American intervention has been completed.
In Friday, the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs should consider the resolution issued by President John Kerry (democratic, Massachusetts) together with Senators John McKeyne (Republic, Arizona) and Joseph I. Liberman (Independent Connect), which honors the liquors for the slightly resurrection and the American armies for “reaching”.
"The purpose of this resolution is to give respect to the courageous people of Lewi when they begin to restore their country," said Cury.
"This is the confirmation of the support of their democratic instruments from both parties."
The language may be unfair, but there was no further discussion on Libya.
In this year, both the lawyers of the two partys were held with the White House on the formulation of a series of resolutions endorsing or condemning the role of the American army in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McKeyne presented a resolution that allows limited use of American armed forces in Libya.
The draft legislation was rejected by the representatives of the Palestinian large majority of the two parties and did not vote in Senate.
However, the same day when the draft legislation was launched in the Palestine, the hall also did not support the proposal that would increase the financing of the American Operation in Libya.
This was left by the American mission in a manner of legislative cleaning - when the Congress was sufficiently discovered to criticize the Mises Appeal, but not so slightly to elect a message in its footsteps.
Then the events of the Congress were unresolved
In August, Tripoli was killed by the liquid forces, and Kadafi was killed on October 20.
The UNO Mission has been officially completed on 31 October.
The Senate may now be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs "promotes the people of Libya for his unreasonable schedule to strive to freedom" and endorses men and women of the United States and their coalition partners who participated in military operations for the protection of the liquid people for their uncertain courage and professionalism."
The resolution also “affirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and unreasonable transition to democracy in Libya”.
Do new measures will be fully supported by the Foreign Affairs Board or will the legislators, as the June Legislative Project?
The last version of Senator Richard G. Luguer, leader of the Republic of the Committee.
The representative of Luger said on Monday he did not see the last version of the draft legislation.
On the other side, the Chamber of the Palestinian Representatives should vote for the constitutional amendment to the balanced budget, the main legislative priority for almost each Republic and for some democracy in the Congress.
This measure proposed by the Party of Bob Gudlat (republic, Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other who will be issued to the plenary vote of the Congress.
Other legislators have not been able to make amendments to the plenary meeting but not because they did not try.
The amendment of Gudlat is only one of 68 Constitutional amendments affecting the wide circle of issues that have been introduced in this conviction.
Some duplicated, one of the same legislation was introduced in the Palestine of Representatives and Senate, and others had a few options.
At least 15 versions of the amendments on balanced budget are amended only in the Palestinian parliament and some of the “Federal Expenditure Control”.
Some of them are also identical, but they give their authors, in the main part of the elections of the Republics, who want to steal their resonance, the possibility of expressing the proposal.
The Act on Budgetary Control, which was held in August, requested that the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate voted for the amendment to the balanced budget.
On March 58, Senators proclaimed the necessary resolution supporting the idea of this amendment.
In addition to the budget, some congress wished to limit the duration of the power of members of the Congress, and the members of the Chamber of José Serrano (Democracy, New York) want to derogate the limits for two terms for the President.
The Congress of Jessie L. Jackson-Mediter (Democratics, Illinois) proposed a number of amendments to ensure, including, the right to quality education and health.
The amendments that prohibite single marriages have been proposed for many years, as well as one that prohibits the fleet.
Some legislators also want to authorize the cancellation of federal laws if they reflect two third States.
As the members of the Congress have even tried to propose amendments, they are not faster than in the past years.
In the 111th conviction, the legislators proposed 77 such amendments, and 66 were introduced at 110th.
This time was compared to the beginning of the 1990s when members of the Congress, according to the Senate Library, regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years.
But they've been successfully done more than now.
The last amendment adopted, 27th, was approved in 1992, but was in fact introduced to the Congress in 1789.
"That's slaughter, but you're not convinced," says Gifffords in his first television interview after the pursuit
10 months after the armed person shooted in it to the public event in Tusson, the members of the Palestine of Gabriel Hyffords (Democratic Party, Arizona) appeared in the federal channel on Wednesday, with a melanchor from the Broodweek show, and said that he wanted to rebuilt more than returning to the Congress.
In the 20/20 programme, Aye-bi-s-News and Diana Sower, Gifffords made proposals and needed assistance in the course.
The program showed her difficult way to rebuild after the trauma shock, which developed the heads and tried the left side of the brain, from the front to the back of the head.
Three months later, she returned unexpectedly to the Palestine of Representatives and triumphically proclaimed by the Act on the Debt.
In his first television interview after the shooting of January, in which six and 13 people were killed, Hifffords smiled, smiled and smiled, and called her "that's difficult."
The question of Saeer, how she feels, the 41-year-old Gifffords answered: "That's good."
In interview with Gifffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the time special "20/20", which was shown by the new "Gaby: history of courage and hope".
The Special Office reported the restoration of Gifffords after the shoot of 8 January.
On a video that Kelly has covered in the first few weeks, she is on a hospital kitchen with a brain of head and a long shock on the lab.
She can just take up one or two fingers on the request of a husband.
A few months later, we see how Hifffords sits in the box, and the physicians taught her how to do simple action.
Shut up the head.
Get out of the legs.
And then her first word, "What."
A few days later, Gifffords made a second word, "tost", requested to change the bedroom menu.
A video shown by Abby-ss shows that music has played a central role in Hyfffords reconstruction: we're seeing the Congressman with "Dawski's just want to enjoy," Sindy Lopper and "Free Cave" Tom Petty.
Soyer Gifffords, who spent two hours a day on the procedure, said that he would not remember the day of the attempt.
Her husband told him that he had read a article in the shooting newspaper on 12 March when she stopped him to ask for the first time of the six murdered ones.
The suspected attacker Gerr Le Lafner is in the prison of Missouri and has been sentenced to the court ' s expectation.
"My people died," said Hifffords Soyer.
"That's hard, it's hard."
One time during her recovery, she said, "I'm convinced."
"And I said, Gabe, you're not convinced," said Kelly.
You're just killing.
And you're going through this, you're rebuilding and returning stronger than ever.
The war feels more compassion than respect
The event was a Wall Street feast, which collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sleeped a ballet of incapacity, disappointment and loss.
A few hundred soldiers, marine soldiers, aircrafts and sea peaks were built around him.
The audiences in the shockings applauded him.
"But the military servants looked like heroes", said David Salzman, who organized the wedding collection of money.
The Old Military Officer on the concert, who was also the Chairman of the Headquarters Committee, Amedral Mike Mallen, saw the role of the army on the other.
"They were treated as cyrhooths," wrote the officer in an electronic letter.
I'm sure the organizers wanted to be better.
I know it.
But in fact it wasn't respect.
Comprehensively contradictional impressions illustrate the unfair relationship between the army and often equivalent, sometimes discovered by the American publishing.
The wars are expensive for their victims.
But the favors have their prices, they say the soldiers.
The publication is increasingly conducted, as is the form of mercy to people.
"We are not really victims," said the brigade General Shawn B. McFarland, who commanded armies in Iraq and soon goes to Afghanistan.
"But it seems the only way for some to show support is to do with us as with the accidents."
This is a sensitive topic for military soldiers who do not want to appear to be ungrateful or unlawful with the society they serve.
They also understand that angers with which the returning forces in Vietnam in recent years were much worse.
As a result, the majority of the discussions on pestilence occurs quietly and only between the fighting veterinaries.
After the two of his sons returned from the fighting action in the coast of the sea, the embassy Mark Kanshan warned them that people would not be looking at their service from two points of view.
Some will look at them with sweetness because they shouted the murderers and were in ecologist places.
Others will think whether "the wicked veteran's wicked veterans" would be hidden, said Kanshan, who slaughtered in Iraq and returned to a high government post in Washington.
While he looked for work, he said, he felt that some interviewers were carefully asked whether he could strive the responsibility of the work in Washington immediately after the battle.
Kanshan recalls how he said to his sons: "When you're talking about your service, you should be counting on the negative effect."
The infringement experienced by militarys is partly from the American invariation to wars.
Battle winners are typically pleasing from the country that has little knowledge of the army and sees few direct benefits from war in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, are no longer valuable for military heroism as it was normally in the II World War", says the general Letnan, who commanded the American troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the enhancement of political and publics is mainly focused on the deeply suffering of military servants.
The soldiers are assessed by the number of flows that they have done, by the number of friends they lost or by the loss.
Army faces the narrow pressure of the parties to combat violence
This week, at historical judicial hearings, should be decided whether 28 men and women would be taken against the army for the non-proliferation of violence.
If not, hundreds of pieces are built in the next way.
At the first class of Elizabeth Layman, 25 years of age and 11 weeks of pregnancies, on her approval, his servant was forced.
It was in October 2008, she returned to her card to the Miramar Aerodrome, north of San Diego after dinner with a friend and met a man who had a packaging of 12 bottles of bird.
He asked if he could come to her in the room.
"It was a red band," says Layman.
But the birth of Texas was aware of their fears.
I thought, "No, he was 19."
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I'm glad I didn't listen to my instinct."
A few minutes after they went to the Layman room, the man came back to her, fled and forced, she claims.
In this week, 18 November, Layman and 27 of the current and former military servants will wait for the decision of the Court on the historical hearing in Arlington, Virginia, and whether they will go to the court, which they have issued against the former Minister of Defence Robert Gates and his former Donald Ramfeld.
It is said that Gates and Ramsfelt did not have been able to deal with a widely distributed violence in the army in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February, a lawyer Susan Berk from Washington, D.C., initially included 17 lawyers, but increased up to 28 in the following months - 25 women and three men, who all claimed that they had been violated or threatened by the employees, and that the army had not been investigated, not injured in court or insured the appropriate justice after the attacks.
Berke says she was shocked on the top of the army because the problem starts with them.
"Armia is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are those who can destroy the culture of violence?
Berke also said that in February about 400 other victims were connected with her, many of whom can participate in future scenarios.
She's strategy: instead of gathering all the eggs in this matter -- to class all the eggs into one corner, so she will open a lot if needed to support pressure.
The defence team from the Ministry of Defence under the leadership of the Federal Prosecutor Nila McBraid took steps to stop the case.
The judiciary documents received by Newsweek opened the protection strategy in the main sense that the former or current soldiers cannot predict the complaints of the army for harm in armed forces.
According to the doctrine designated by the Supreme Court of 1950 by the Federal Government is not responsible for the damage caused by persons in the military service.
" Promotional damage relates to the risk of the military duty service", says the documents.
The Ministry of Defence refused to comment on this story.
The situation has changed since the 50s.
Although women are still officially prohibited to participate in the battle, this section is only in words: the modern wars have a clear front line.
And in Iraq, and in Afghanistan, women ' s teams play a more important role, especially in contacts with local women in the fight zone.
Result: 150 soldiers died during two wars, two thirds in their battle.
The army is also time to become modern, says Burke.
It is not alone in its fight; in addition to its search, three others are prepared.
The Veteran legal seminar at the Yellisian legal school prepares the case against four larger military academics in the promotion of the domestic climate.
Apart from the non-commercial association of the American war veterans in Vietnam is preparing a search against the army, in the centre of which the " personality change" diagnoses are victims of violence to remove them from the services, generally, according to the words of activists such as Ana Bhaghiti from the Human Rights Group of the Women ' s Action.
In December, her group made the search against the Veterinary Affairs Office, accusing it in discriminatory practices to consider pensions from persons who claim that sexual violence was threatened during the service.
Nine individual legislative projects proposing a number of measures were introduced in the Congress of Senators and members of the Party of both parties.
In 2010, the Service for Warning and Combating Sexual Violence was reported on 3.158 attempts of violence.
But, as you know, the attacks are often not reported, and Pentagon's estimates are about 13.5 per cent of the cases that had occurred in that year.
The report published in March also investigated the percentage of the court cases: 20 per cent of the known cases have been reached to the court, two times less than in the civil justice system in 2010.
Burk's provinces call their attacks only the first in a number of other traumas.
In the case of Layman, she declared that infringement in military police was less than a hour after it happened.
On that night, she said she was asked to tell the details of violence at one 11 times the police, doctors and commanders.
She collected a complex of evidence of violence, and the blood of the attacker was found at her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Layman settled before the judge, in which she asked whether she had sex with her friend before the day of the attack.
Six persons gave a positive character of the accused who was finally justified.
"I remember the day when the verdict was read," says Layman.
"I thought I'm growing now, I've gone out of the court hall with a cricket."
"I was in the psychiatrist office, and when I came out, I remember my commander said, "I wasn't a judge on him, it was a judge for me."
Layman was ordered to turn to an military psychiatrist who finally diagnosed the change in his personality, which made it unacceptable to the service.
In January 2010, she was authorized with an unpleasant formula that did not allow her to receive any assistance.
If the case was forwarded by Layman and her search friends, it's a complicated question, says John Terry, Professor of the Rights at the University of George Washington.
However, he notes: "I think they can go forward."
Among them and the verdict, the doctrine is criticized since it appears.
I've criticized the Doctrine Ference.
The army has been declined for decades, because it has no stimulation and retention of the responsibilities.
He adds: "The Championships are greatly against them, but they are important to try."
These things are only changed when people want to fight.
If the listening will not be useful, Berk, the lawyer, will collect hundreds of other cases for future affairs.
"We will continue to fight with the army on this issue until the reform will be restructured," she says.
Or until we die, depending on what will happen before.
The wall has the eyes: how the researchers will study you at Facebook.
Before being a new person of the right extremism in Europe, Anders Bering Breewick was a general man who expressed their anti-immigration views on the Internet.
On Monday, Breweyk, who was aware of the mass murder in Norwegia in July, which had led 77 people to his first open judicial hearing.
Although Bravik could act alone, he wasn't a single network: he had been ready to attack his computer with millions of nationalists who support the legal groups in social networks.
After the summer tragedy, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Let's just go to the Facebuck.
"We have understood that it's not really complicated with them," says Jaime Barlett, who has recently published a report on the European Cyber Polysm of the British DemoS research center.
The stock of personal data on Facebook is so large, Barlett says that researchers could easily use the public website to identify the necessary demographic group with scientific accuracy - that marketists and marketists have been done for a few years.
The Bartlett team found a half million fans of the legal groups throughout Europe and then subsequently advertising, but instead of showing a new group or diethic product, the advertising invited the user to investigate what their education issues were about violence and optimism in respect of their own future.
By Facebook and his colleagues, more than 10,000 members were able to ask for 14 extremely legal parties in 11 European countries, not even from office.
"This is a new way to conduct research," Barlett says.
Some results are not so discreet: the online-largement of the legal groups, mostly all young men, are unnecessary inmigration.
But unexpectedly, "They who join their online-activeness with the offline-active, are more discreet, democratic and less aggressive than those who are hidden by the monitor."
The DEMOS work is only one example of Facebook becomes a new popular instrument in the hands of scientists.
Scientific centres, researchers and politicians use websites to study all the light - from health issues to social trains expressed in Lakes, wall positions and updates.
More than 800 million active users who add a medium-third-third record, the Super-Actual Information Facebook calls for a research boom, increased the number of scientific articles in the title of the website by 800 per cent over the past five years.
For some researchers, Facebuck has the opportunity to study people who could not go on the street with the blocknote.
"If you wanted to ask people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them."
"We should come into the party, and they would never have taken you", says Barlett.
"Face Buck excludes all of this, you're going to call them directly."
Others say that this site could be identified and investigated on social health.
The last study by Dr. Megan Mornon from the University of Viscina, Madison, and her colleague showed that students who discussed their drinking submissions at Facebuck were significantly undermined to alcoholism than students who prayed for this matter.
Morno predicts that students, for example, would be able to monitor the website and to help students who are too often updating the drinking status.
"You can't solve the problem, not detected it," reported Washington Post Dimtri Christkis, co-actor Morno and Director of the Child Health Center, conduct and development at the Child Science Institute of Seattle.
"We found a way to identify children from the risk group that wouldn't be found."
Facebuck also continues to extract a different type of data on its users.
The website data processing group has processed the statistics of the status and the day of the Holy Valentine, a electioner in the midst of 2010, as well as the National Index of Happiness (in the main use of information that they have only available, the Cyber liberty champions had long been able to make their broad data collection available to research).
But Facebook users know that the website looks for them, they like it or don't, in the way to play Scrabbl with a friend that is thousands of miles from you, the website can process your personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of the research that they don't even know?
While the researchers have a strict number of standards for investigation, online data are available.
"I don't think that many users may think that the researcher can watch their profiles," says Neil Selvin, a sociolog from the London laboratory of knowledge, about the research he carried out in 2006 with the use of the general available students pages in Facebook.
"When they represented themselves, it was just between them and their friends."
Then there is a question of methodology.
There is no guarantee that the research objects are precisely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know what number of information on the profile and page of the user is true.
"What you say on Facebook, and what you're doing beyond the Facebook borders, is two absolutely different things," says Servin.
This is why, despite the years of its technological research work, Selvin believes that blocks and hands are still the best research tools that can be used.
"There is no way to replace out of real peace and relationship with real people," he says.
"The social research is the social and the majority of the social population is still offline."
"Horr and inhuman": Anders Bering Breewick will first be present before the court
Anders Bering Breweek, a person who acknowledged the organization of a double attack, who lived 77 people in Norwegia in this year, describes himself as the fighter of "resistance" during the first public statement in Oslo.
"I am the military commander of the Norwegian Resistance Movement and the Ryzare of the Norwegian Tampliers," he issued before 500 attendants in the court hall.
"I reflect the court, because you have received your mandate from organizations that support hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize acts, but I don't recognize guilty."
The judge Thomas Neshaym stopped Bravik during this monologist, because he "assumed not to give Bravich the opportunity to use it as a scope to express his own views."
For the same reason, he refused to authorize Bravik, who brought the previously written talk, to call to the parents of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Neshayam also commanded the police to keep Brevik in custody for more than 12 weeks, prohibited access to media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would take control of all visits and records for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and the families of the victims visited hearing.
Some came to hope to look at Blavik in the eyes, others make sure it's under the shoot.
Everyone came to find answers to their questions.
"I thought he looks cold and inhuman," said the Norwegian NRK channel one of the survivors in utoy.
"It was uncomfortable, but personally became me a little more easy after I saw and heard a suspect."
In the dark coast and blue blue, Bravik maintained peace and professionalism during the whole hearing, and looked at journalists and survivors when he entered and out of the building.
Despite the strange idea of Bravick that he was part of the great " resistance", the judge decided that he was not worse, and said that there was no evidence that he acted with the messagers.
Some may calm that the 22 July attacks say the work of one extremist, not the radius group.
But this does not reduce automatically the tribulation and disappointment that the whole country now feels.
"I would like to look like a monster, but it's not so," said the family of one victim.
"It would be much easier if it would be so."
7 lessons from the lost interview Steve Joses, shown in the theatre this week
After the death of Steve Joses, on October 5, some compared him with Henry Ford, describing the technical guest as the Great Researcher of Modernity.
But what Apple fans can read the most important opening of the recently recovered interview, which was reminded of the prevention of the main markets in this week, is how much this creative mind had been understood in business processes and production technologies.
He, of course, was a designer, a dream and was considered a skip, but he was also a pretty organizer and a modernist of the production process, who believed that many business leaders had suffered from "ills thinking that the idea really is 90 per cent of work... the great idea of the product is a large number of artistic works."
Returned in 1995, Bob Cringley created the Triumph nerve television on the outcome of a personal computer, and he spent more hours with Jobbs for a unique long-term interview.
At that time, about 10 years since Jobbs left out of Apple, he had worked in his new NeXT computer company in waiting for the Internet's mass release.
While a small part of the Cringly interview was used in the Norways, he said that the original interviews were lost in the carriage.
Only after Jobs died, the complete VHS copy was found in the repository garage.
The 68-minute movie of Steve Jobbs was a basis for this 68-minute film: a lost interview in Landmark Theaters in this and Friday.
For a person who has known his hatred to a detailed interview, Jobbs seems to be inadequate to express its technological philosophy and business strategies.
And it's unbelievable.
In four different moments, there are large intervals between questions and answers - meditation for 10 to 15 seconds, where Jobbs clearly expresses its thoughts to say exactly.
There are also moments in which the perfectionism of Jobbs is on the surface where it seems to be dispersed about Clingly, which makes it rapidly move to matters or outlines of more importance.
As far as Pixar, Egghoes and Iphones of the Postian interview, there is something bad to be when J.B. appraises what different companies do right and wrongly, and offers their own vision of future information technologies.
One thing to read about the death assessments of Jobbs, but there's something premature and inspiring in Jobbs, which we see here, a threatening smile on the shock of the shock.
He has a vision of what things might and should be.
Soon after he said everything here, he went and did it.
Small conclusion of seven significant conclusions of the Perdido Interview:
The way he learned to guide business:
"Why are you doing this? And the answers that you're receiving, "Oh, that's just doing so."
Nobody knows why they do what they do, no one thinks very deeply in business.
That's what I knew.
Jobbs continues to describe its attempts to rationalisize Apple reporting.
The way to record the costs, which was often started by the "standard costs" which were taken from the shooting, and then complemented by the "totalization" he created an automated structure that ensured that they would be able to monitor expenditure.
About the shock of the Pap:
Jobbs's details about a box box that he was shocked with Steve Wonnick, a device that allowed people to effectively interrupte the phone company and call freely on large distances.
A lot of the devices had been written before, but the ephorium of Jobbs is here in describing the box's son as an act of authority.
He tells how he and Visik tested a box using the automatic phone, ordering a conversation and then connecting one AT and T to another until they were able to connect more stations.
"We've got the earth's chair half a day, and you've cryed at the automatic phone, and that's passing a minute later at the automatic side," says Joes with a sweet.
"We were young, and everything we've been able to imagine something that could be controlled by billions of infrastructure in the world."
We two knew a little, but we could imagine a little thing that could control the great thing -- it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think that without that, I could ever happen Apple.
Jobbs continued to describe details of a famous journey with him and Visingham, calling in Vatican through the blue box, and asked Daddy's phone, so all the forces were trying to copy Henry Quissenger.
When several members of the Catholic Jersey were called in the night to speak to the American diplomat, these two were disappointed directly before the Pope himself was taken to answer on the phone.
About Technology Love (and cold launched by Bill Hulet):
When he was 12 years old, looking for safe details for the collection of frequencies, Bill Hulett found in the phone container and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone conversation, Jobbs received a summer record in Hulett-Pacard.
"It was a strong impact on me, it was the only company I saw in that age, and she formed my view that such a company and how well they were related to their staff."
Jobbs later became one of the HP staff visiting research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first named computer".
He was the size of the chaod, he had a small monitor with an e-commerce tube, and I loved him.
I often traveled to a youth in HP and moved around the car and wrote for it.
About innovated innovation:
In a few places of interview, Jobbs says about the development of new summer products.
At his carriage, when he went to sell the monastery payments, one buyer asked him to collect the whole computer.
Only 30 days of credit, he was supposed to think and assemble, and providing ready devices.
Then in Apple, he recalls the difficulties he had faced by developing a computer mouse:
"I remember growing controversies... they cryed to me that it would take five years of the mouse that would be $300, and I was slept on the ball, and I went out, and found a designer."
Twenty-twenty days later we had a mouse that we could collect for $15, which was incredibly reliable.
About large companies that lose energy:
Since Apple was resurrected, Jobbs predicted exactly how many leaders were wrong in the vision of the situation and lost control over their part of the market.
"Do you work at IBM or Xerox, so you're doing the best cop or printer, and what?"
You have a monopolie on the market, so the company does not become more successful.
Sellers and marketing make it more successful, so that [the types of people] who finally come to the company leadership, and people who make the products are experiencing from the levels of decision-making.
The guiding of the product, which brought to this monopolist position, is exacerbated by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products, the required masterity.
That's what happened with Xerox...
Xerox could take all the information technology industry.
He could be 10 times more, maybe a microsof of 90.
They received a shock from the victory.
Innovation as a form of art:
"The great idea of the great product is separated by a great number of artistic work... when you cut a great idea, it changes and grows."
You know a lot of her smells.
There are compromises that you need to go - some things you can't make electronics, steel, jobs or firms.
You have to keep your head 5,000 ideas -- these concepts -- connecting them all together...
Finally, it's all about the skin - it's trying to express himself better than ever made people, and then try to bring it to what you're doing.
Picasso said the good artists are coping, the big artists are struggling.
We've always been awesome to struggle great ideas.
The part of the famous Mcintosh was that people who worked over it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, and historians who have become the best information technologies worldwide.
If not information technology, they would do trigger things in other areas.
Scalya and Thomas eat with the opposers of the Health Act until the Court considers the case
On the day when the Supreme Court was gathered for the closed doors to discuss a political controversial question whether he would listen to the Division of the Act on Health of President Obama, two of his judges, Antonio Scalya and Clarens Thomas, who had been on the dinner of a legal company that would be held before the Supreme Court.
This case occurred on the past Friday, when all nine judges met to discuss the requested consideration.
One of the agenda items was the request for 26 States to oppose a health review adopted by the Congress last year, which combined conservative activists of the whole country.
The judges agreed to consider the process; indeed, the reverse debates at 5 and 2 p.m. were expected to be in March 2012, and the results of the presidency will be shocked, which would be very disappeared at the time of the judicial decision.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and claim that the health law should be cancelled, perhaps Paul Clement, who was Vice-General Prosecutor during the presidency of George W. Bush.
The legal company of the Clement, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two thirteens of the company who helped to discuss the annual dinner of the Federalist Society for a long existing group that continued to retain conservative legal principles.
Another company, who has spent dinner, is one of the trade associations that opposed the law, the National Independence Federation.
Another sponsor was Pflizer Inc pharmaceutical guiant, who had a great financial interest in gravity.
The dinner was held in the Washington Hotel after a few hours after the court meeting.
Among the other, Mrs McConnel, the leader of the Republic of Senate and the known opposer of the Health Act.
The guests at lunch?
Nothing new: Two judges visit the events of the Federal Society for many years.
This is not the contrary to the ethical standards.
The judges are effectively free from the Code of Conduction which regulates the actions of the lower federal courts.
If they were subjected, they may be under the Principle 4C Code, which said: "The Swedish may visit the legal and other organizations, although the judge may not be a rapporteur or mention in the programme of such events."
However, the clear closeness of Scalia and Thomas to two legal companies in this case, as well as the company with great financial interests, was sufficient to activists of the government.
" This is a devastating violation of the ethics and non-interference to the code against the statements of some judges that the court remains faithful to the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the General Deal.
"Their dinners were drunk and dinner in official action on the collection of money with lawyers whose cases are now considered in the court."
Their exhibition and assistance in the collection of money for this event is unacceptable to all statements of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalya and Thomas are taking the attention to critics that say that they are very willing to interfere the case of the courts with the figurous groups of the Federal Society.
And my wife, Thomas, Jeannie, is a famous conservator activist.
Moreover, the observers claim that this is an ethical issue against the judges of Elena Kagan, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the primary legal office in the Obama Administration when the first judicial expressions against the law were granted at the level of the Court of First Instruction.
Her criticism required that Kagan refused to listen to this case because it was too involved in the protection of the law at the time to be impartial now.
The Kagan didn't show her to do this.
Boeing receives recursive 18 billion aircraft order
Emirates' companion claims 50 large foss-food rays of Boeing 777 and may be more than 20.
Boeing also sell six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, more than $1 billion.
This is just a news that the company receives a 50-unit of its product.
But this is an important event when the company is Boeing Co., and the presuming price for all these 50 flights is $18 billion.
However, it is so important where Boeing received the order: the Middle East, increased the golden lives of future aircraft orders.
In the prediction published on Monday, the Chagage company notes that the Middle East will need 2,520 flights to 450 billion aircraft in the nearest 20 years.
Boeing anonymized his most biggest $$50 in these weeks to evacuate the commercial aircraft, 50 two passenger flights Boeing 777.
The incredible order was made from Emirates Aviation in Dubai.
The aircraft also has the opportunity to buy more than 20 flights that will take up the overall pre-scale price up to 26 billion dollars, said Boeing to Abiashaw Dubai 2011.
Later, Boeing reported that Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, such as Dreamliner, which could be significantly enhanced by the fuel economy and passengers.
The premium price for six flights is more than $1 billion.
"It's really good for Boeing," said an analysis of Morningstar Nil Diaor.
"The quantity of these specific purchasers is very high."
Many of the south-East aircraft have oiled countries.
Consequently, they have no only money to pay for aircrafts but also increased fuel prices, which usually causes aircraft damage, as it is one of the largest articles, is not so violent because the country pays money for high oil prices.
This is important, as they are less likely, except other airlines, to abolish a plane when the prices grow, said Dire.
"They have natural protection," he said.
The Emirates commands to strengthen Boeing's leadership on the broad-floor aircraft market and helps not allow a SAS Airbus co-operator to be dominated with his A350 aircraft.
Four months later, Boeing's winners on the aviation had occurred after Airbus claimed that he would delay the largest A350, which is a counterpart from 777-300ER.
He put the debts to increase the weight burden after purchasers needed to increase the cost of the floor and the furtherness of the fleet.
Boeing Co has grown up to $67,94.
Sister of President of Mexico apparently played for elections in Michoacan
Luis Maria Calderon claims that drug traffickers have helped the opponent Fausto Valeho from the IRP in the predicted gang.
The sister of the President Felipe Calderon seemed to have not made a request on the location of the Governor of Michokan during the disaster of State elections, and she declared on the lunch that drug traffickers had helped shut up a shock for one of its opposers.
For the preliminary results, the leader of the Western State's Governor is called Fausto Valeho from the Institution and Revolutionary Party, or IDP.
" The participation of organized crime during the whole election process and especially last night is concerned not only for Michocaan but also for the whole country," said Louise Maria Calderon in radio-interview on the next day after the resurrection.
"They were threatening our candidates, our employees in the elections... they were lacking urges to vote, hindered... and let people vote."
IDP managed Mexico for seven decades until the Presidency was lost in 2000.
She's ready to return, and the victory in Michoacan is a important step in this attempt.
IDP hopes to win the presidential elections in July.
Valeho seems to be just a little defended by Calderon, who urged the rays to the day of elections.
Calderon, a candidate from the National Action Party, or the PND, envoyed by her brother, refused to recognize the Victor Valeho.
Sylvano Aureoles, a candidate from the left Democratic Revolution Party, or the DDP, now belonging to the Gouvernant Cruz, was the third, a serious conspiration for separate and uncomfortable left before the presidential elections 2012.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the preliminary results.
Valeho, former master of Morel State, rejected drug traffickers and urged other candidates to recognize the results.
In Michoacan, drug carriages were long dominated in marihuana, heroin and metalphetamines.
This is the parent state of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacan to initiate military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
Violence still continues.
Mr. from PND was killed for a week before the elections he acted for Luis Maria Calderon, and a few candidates were out of the local pre-selected box for fear.
For the IRF, however, the electorals in Michoacan would be horrible, but the victory will give the movement of the party.
The man who should be presented by the IRF in the president's horn, Enrique Peen Nito, speaking from Washington, welcomed Valeho and said: "I think that this winning should be very encouraging in the warning of the next year."
ABR avoids Asia to help save the euro
The Asian Development Bank forced India and China to help Europe to save a long-term crisis in order to avoid a long-term decline that stops the growth of Asian economy.
Mr Nag, director of the AVR Office in Manila, said that the two most rapidly developed economys should "deal all that can" to accelerate the rebuilding of the currency block by means of the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRIC countries looked at the difficulties of Europe ' s " overspot," and said that Asian financial assistance to the European leadership and resources could help avoid a long-term decline in global economy.
"We all do this."
"There is useful to help Europe get out of the crisis," he reported the Financial Times in the course of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some stage, but it cannot be unlawful."
"So if China and India can help, this must be done."
The European Monetary Union was strongly undermined by a long-term European crisis in the past months.
In recent days, Italia has grown more threatened, and the Prime Minister and Italy, as well as the Greece, have been departured.
The long-term crisis in Europe generated fears that it could bring a world economy again to recession, and brought the calls for leading developing economies to meet together to help the Euroon to find a decision.
Mr. Nég suggested that any Asian assistance would be carried out through the FMI, but said that bilateral cooperation was a type of purchase EU financial assistance fund, a means to ensure financial stability in Europe - provides great strength in the negotiations of Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Minister of Trade of India, said that "India will do everything that can" to help the euro, since its own economy is now suffering the reduction in export and the reduction of foreign capitals.
"Nobody wants to remain instable and worried," he said.
"We have major tasks, and we have to support the high level of growth."
"This is an unable option, it's a binding condition, because where we find work for decades of our youth and girls."
Others claim that India's development economy is not a meaning to help rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashitosh Varshni, Professor at the University of Brown at the United States, said that it would be very complicated with the political view to provide European assistance to the Indians of 1.2 billion people in which about 800 million lives a day or less than $2.
"In some moment, they will know that Greeks go to pension for 50 years and travel to the sea feasts, and that's not going to be fine," he said.
Li Howell, director of the World Economic Forum, also asked why Indian reservations should be used to contain Greece's numerous and well-bearing employees of the public sector to work in bad organized, lost enterprises such as iron roads.
Mr. Nag said that the European crisis threatens the "important direct consequences" throughout Asia.
ABR ' s 7.5 per cent growth in Asia in 2011/12 has now faced "low risks" because of the threat of Europe.
He said that the vulnerable developing markets need to be " emergency plans" to protect themselves from the fall and significant rates of capital from their economy.
Pentagon ' s suffering warnings on potential defence expenditure reductions
The Minister of Defence of Leon Panette was a midday at the convention, causing that the expected automatic reduction of the budget would affect national security and the financial reaction from the Pentagon Corinthians to the fight fields in Afghanistan and the Civil Assembly.
Pentagon has already been decreased by the reduction of $450 billion in the coming decade, but it is concerned that additional reductions of 600 billion or more may be inevitable if the conventions are not able to arrive in the expenditure agreement.
" The consequences of these reductions will be devastated for the Ministry," reported Paneta in a letter to Senator John McKaine, Arison, and the Republic of Lindsey Graham, South Caroline.
He said that the congress could not be able to adopt budget agreements and that resulted in the so-called seventh sequence is to initiate a comprehensive reduction of 23 per cent and to end many new projects.
"That strong decrease that is so unexpectedly makes most of our shipbuilding and construction projects -- you can't buy three four ships or buildings -- and cause serious damage to other attempts to modernize", wrote the Senate Panel to Senators.
"We should also be able to let many of our state workers, and as the reduction will be made so fast, we must almost be able to leave the states to achieve the goals."
"These changes will affect those who support our army and cause a serious damage to warfare."
The decrease in the final account will be cut by military parties, said Paneta.
" The military financing in the Refugee emergency operations did not affect the direct seminar, and the achievement of the military suffers seriously from a serious shock in the main budgets," said the Paneta.
" The contract staff will be decreased that the delay of contracts and the supervisory treaty which supports the army will be decreased."
"State staff will decrease that it will bring repayments to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be violated."
Two senators wrote Panette 10 days ago and requested details of the possible automatic reductions in the Ministry of Defence.
" The seventor in the Ministry of Defence will become a rapid attack of the United States as a leading world military force. "
"We are strictly opposed to these dramatic actions," reported Senators in a joint statement on Monday night when they were born by the Paneta letter.
"It's not the way we can live, and it's not the way we have to get up."
"Seekest is the threat to the interests of national security in the United States, and this cannot happen."
Whether the Paneta or the last warnings of Senators to the budget committee will be made or will increase the calls for the release of Pentagon from reducing, so we will see later.
The Paneta was absolutely honest about the possible reductions, although he had been working in Pentagon's headquarters after many years of budget expertise in the Congress and Belarus house and recognized that it was a difficult choice.
The Press Conference last week, the Minister of Defence wrote an unilateral picture of what could follow, a troop with a ball but without nuclear.
"It's a ship without marine."
"It's no ball."
"It's locked a plane without enough trained pilots."
"This is a paper tiger, a army with charms, buildings and bombs without sufficiently prepared soldiers to carry out the mission," said Paneta in its entry observations in Pentagon.
"This is the power that suffers from an insufficient war spirit, bad preparation and unable to fight potential enemy."
"In fact, it promotes aggression."
In annex to its letters to McKeen and Graham Panet, new details have been made about the reducing of significant operational risks: reactions to crisis, conflict and disasters; seriously restrict our possibility to be first in the development and reaction of the world; and it leads to unacceptable risks in future war operations.
Paneta said that some of the largest defence projects could be covered by obstacles, including those already tested, and only some at the early stages of planning.
The list includes the only F35 shooting, planned by a new bomb ship, a new generation-based ship, a new ship of coastal coastal zone and a new terrestrial war vehicle that Army and the Sea pool need to replace hammers.
The end of the further development and test F35 may be $80 billion for ten years, but its parties say that it is a vital step to improve and combat the potential threats of China and other opposers.
How to get a lie
The last chapter shows how serious and universal lies and lies are in daily life.
The Chairman of the Republicns of Herman Keen is employed by oppositions in sexual convictions against several women; each party is a lie accused of another.
The University of Pennsylvania was pronounced to a false witness, since they were able to hide that a football trainer had raped the boys.
Last week, President of France, Nicola Sarkosi was captured when the president of the United States's microphone said Baraku Obama was that the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Nanyahu, was a liar.
The lies destroys the carriages and strikes the country.
The New York Congress and Antony Wayner's Internet Exhibitionist Entony Wayner was ridicule, rejecting its exits, which were quickly checked by unrelated evidence.
The former candidate to President John Edvards was pronounced in financial maquins during the campaigns related to the opening of external communications.
And again, no one who lives at that time will never forget a medical cycle with President Bill Clinton, who is lie about their sexual relations with Monique Levinski during his second time.
The history of smiling in school and college is a common case.
There were cases when the teachers gave the answers to the tests to have a good evaluation of their activities.
The employees who should teach the opposite are sent a message that the lie and the fairness of the acceptance.
What number of lies do we face?
In one day, as the research shows, you can lie from 10 to 200 times.
Now it is expected that the major part of this is a lie in salvation.
Another study showed that no-known persons were swearing three times in the first 10 minutes.
Detection of lies or lies is necessary for both persons and professional purposes.
Unlike the room game, like the chairs, where it is to be called “Food”, the identification is a serious direction of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in the prestigious universities in all the research projects, especially on psychology and physics.
One study is that most of the old meffs of lies have been developed.
The lies look at the eyes.
They're not always thinking, shocking, reding or breaking.
It should not be concluded that the liars are difficult to notice and deal with.
The experienced false dispenser can reach to truth by observing the structures of approval, mining, questions structure and temporary characteristics.
I have conducted a few years by studying scientific openings in a wide and continuously growing segment of lie knowledge, and clearly that the identification of lies is a modern thinking that is easy to learn and help in our complex world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include recruitment, knowledge, negotiations or management.
Good false ones are best able to read others, putting them to feel unfairly, to control their own feelings and feelings intuitively as others understand them.
We know from the study that the extraverts are more angry than the introverts that men lie more about themselves, while women of others, generally to protect some feeling that marriage people are less swear to their partners than the unmarried (and the lie they say most often).
We also know that if you're a liar, others will feel less guilty to you.
How do you understand that someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your object.
This is called "determination of origin".
This helps us to ensure the shipment point to assess the changes further.
Watch your object’s voice, smiling, and voice.
You would be glad to know whether a person is constantly smelling in a normal state, then you will not make an unfair accusation when you see a shock of feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then search for a group of false virtue and incomparable acts.
Regard these groups as red bands, not the evidence of lie.
The handlers can fix the top of their body when trying to remember their history, they can put their steps to the door, turn out, changing their bridge in a certain way, or demonstrate "facility after the interview " - this slow air of facilitation and change of positions when all complex issues are behind.
The followers often fascinate the finishing of the question to simply see the facilitation after the interview.
So look at your object.
It was known that Scott Peterson had passed and used the past while claiming that his murdered wife was alive to find her throughout the country.
Advertising people may also use a distance: "I have no sexual relations with this woman... Mrs. Levinski" or to repeat a complex issue completely.
The most typical virtue indicators are smooth.
Someone can use a qualification language when answers the complex question, "That's good... in the truth I know... how much I know."
This makes it more emotional than real, and it is often a red flag.
There is no magic means to detect lies, but it is possible to have the powerful discovery of the lie.
These thoughts increase the opportunity of each person to not be victim of art juices in professional and personal life.
The counter-building plan needs to be revised after the threat of the United States to delay it
A few days later, after the Ombudsman’s Administration expressed the threat to derogate the planned oil-based from Canada to the Mexico Valley, he called on the angry of professions, but urged the environmental protectioners - the company to build oil, claims that it would like to revise the project to restore its work.
TransCanada reported on Monday that it would take the planned oil from the environmental sensitive area of the Nebrask Holm area and be sure that the project will still receive approval.
The company heard this decision at the press conference in the Capital State of Nebrask.
The official representative of TransCanada Alex Purbas said that the company remains confident that it will eventually receive oil approval, although other routes.
This happens after the statement of the State Department last week that he will make a decision on the project at the federal level until he studys new possible routes that are not affected by the Nebrask Valleys and the Ogal accommodation, a large subterranean water stock.
"This is a real step forward," said Fox News Congressmen Le Terry, the Republic of Nebraska.
The new environmental expert, as stated by the State Department, may be denied by decision-making until 2013, after elections in the next year, although the authorities refused that the policy was prohibited.
In the written statement last week, Obama called on the appointment of the State Department and expressed support.
The oil is 1.700 miles long from Canada to the Mexican coast.
He must transfer 700,000 barriles a day from the province of Albert to the Petrolean oil plants in Texas.
In order to do this, he needs to move six states.
He hates environmental protectioners, but loves professionals who hope about 20,000 workplaces related to oil.
However, Nebrask lawyers, who speak against the plan, consider the draft legislation to accelerate the movement of the Peachholm and the Ogal avior, the principal source of drinking water and rhythm.
The current study of the State Department on Environment showed that the project would only be limitedly negative effects on the environment, but the source of the energy industry stated that the Department ' s audit was assigned to a specific examination procedure, focusing on two issues.
One is whether transCanada, Paul Eliott, was an advisor in Hillary Clinton campaign in 2008, is a conflict of interest in the programme.
The other was whether the company was chosen to conduct an unreasonable initial study as it was linked to TransCanada.
To Patti Label, she was sent to the court because she was calling the child to be pregnant of fear.
The family from New York claims that the Discover Discover Patti Label began to be in their home lobbles in Manhattan, fearing their young daughter to the extent that it was worthy of fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" executive strive to the 18-month Geneva Monk so strong that she had brought "changing personality, sleep disorder" and "the strong fear of no-known people", says her family in Manhattan's High Court.
This occurred on 10 November last year when the work scene of Kevin Monk, his wife, was a child garden, Rosanna, and Geneva was going to go to the family journey.
When Kevin Monk took the car, Roshan Monk went to the building lobster at Riversayd's ball with their bag, just Geneva.
Rosan Monk said she stopped around the door and left her daughter in half a minute.
"Another one went to me and said, "You know what your daughter does?" I said "Yes," and I went to get her, she said.
Label was a heartfelt discovery of a pregnant woman.
"It was aggressively said, "You shouldn't have left your daughter outside the door," said Roshan Monk.
"I said to her, "I don't care what you're talking or thinking."
She came to angry and began to use the rugment - the word C and the word "F" - on the higher tons...
She had a bottle of water, and she began to shoot water from the bottle on me.
She said that Geneva started a sterilis.
"I said this woman, "See what you've done with my daughter," she said her mother.
LABEL slaughtered the mother, who still holded Geneva, and her companion had to keep her in the waiting car, said Roshan Monk.
The boy shouted so strong that she was standing and added.
The family later sent a note to Label with the apology requirements, but no answer was received.
The lawyers and representatives of Label do not respond to the calls for comments.
The amount of compensation for the damage is not reported, but the lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he was taken free of charge for this case and that the family plans to provide any money that will receive, for the goodness of children, a ill cancer.
"The goal is to make Patty Label answers for his progress," said Devis.
"We are perfectly unable to do this, especially in relation to the child garden of the 18-month child in the hand."
Climate problems have delayed the economy
During the first year of Mario Lopes' rule, unemployment in Sinala increased and the illegal labour market was reduced and the economy has been decreased.
2011-year, which is in the economic history of Sinoloa as a first year related to the Government of Mario Lopes Waldes, also called a year of change that generated great hopes for economic development, but, taking into account the unfair climate conditions of the year, growth was not registered, but the reduction of the main economic development indicators was registered.
The lower temperatures in February were not only losses of millions for agricultural sectors but have limited the possibility of increased public economy, resulting in a reduction of economic activity in the general 3,6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly because of the historical fall of 31,16 per cent in the agricultural farm, which has affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the report on areas affected by the Council of Mexico on Sustainable Agricultural Development, 835.582 hectares, of which 78.03 per cent had suffered from the totality and 21.07 per cent of the remaining population suffered in part.
The growth of unemployed unemployment in the State had been fixed by November by the National Statistics and Geographic Institute, during the first three quartals, with the rapid growth of unemployed unemployment, from March 55,053 people of Sinala were unemployed, from 4.53 per cent of the economic active population, in the second quarter of the population increased up to 5.28 per cent, and from September to 6.19 per cent, the percentage of the population was less than 74.000 in the Sinagonia unemployed by 18.9 per cent to the first half.
Decreased liquidity
The unemployed in Singapore has been discussed by many factors, for the economicist Gerardo Lopes Servanthes, director of the Economy Faculty and Social Science of the Autonome University (UAS), the growth of unemployed employees can be explained in space and in public policies.
"What we are now seeing is the growth of unemployed persons who are linked to a number of factors, including the loss of the market for the limitation of the resources set in the Convention to fight the distortion of money, as those who are illegally possessed by dollars, are not easy to work with them, invest and use them in something," he said.
Stopped immigration
Lopes Servanthes said that there is still a democratic factor in the growth of unemployed people.
"The number of people who leave the states in the search of border work was limited in the United States, in the first way because of the income complexities, and in the second way, as, once in the course, they have already faced very many difficulties in searching for work, so the group remains and requires workplaces in the State, resulting in the growth of unemployment levels," said he.
Infringement of formal requirements
The Sinala's work market analysis is worse when focusing on a large number of violations in the working conditions, SENGI, 60.38 per cent of the active population of the state is working without being mentioned as employees in any institution of social protection.
In addition to unemployment and violations, another reminder of work in the State is submitted by low payments; in the state, the lower payments in the country, in accordance with the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Safety and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
The average income of the workers of Sinagonia was at September 5.352 weights, largely below the country's average, which is 7.375 weight.
Reducing the PYI
In addition to the fall of economic activity and the high rate of unemployment in 2011, the largest rate of foreign direct investment in the past 10 years has been fixed by the Ministry of Finance from January to July, $630.697, which shows the fall of 87.74 per cent compared to $5.143.312 during the same period.
From its part, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State has fixed only 17.280,000 investment fish during the year, which was mainly a service company.
Doulga
In July, the Government of the State requested credit approval in the State Congress for 3 billion peso, which would be used to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to live in the economy, at the local level, a total of 2.600 million weights had been granted, and there was no debt benefits expected in any sector of the State economy.
Reactions
For the first year, the Government of Mario Lopes Waldes demonstrates the lack of Government opportunities.
Mr. Loredo Lopes, President of the National Training Facility, said that in 2011, it was not sufficient to agree on the desires of various sectors, including the Government of the State.
"The effectiveness of the economy in Sinaloa was really low in this year, it is to work to return the positions lost this year, in 2012 we must duplicate our efforts, we have not able to agree to all efforts and, above all, the good and synchronized work of the new government team, we hope that the next year will be better", said he.
Economy delay
Lopez Loredo said that events such as premature overwhelms have stopped the economy of the state and its effectiveness and growth in this year.
"The number of economys are the results of a number of events, including smooth, one of the main effects was a late economy, which is not enough to create an economic dinamic, which allows us to have the acceptable level of process, goods and services and, therefore, we close it at the end of the year below," said he.
View direction
Theodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Conference of the Workers of the Mexico Republic of Sinaloa, said that the State had to continue the most dynamic productivity.
"In general and in general, we have found that we have worked about this, we believe that the long-term programme, which will re-determine the direction and economic course of the state, needs to mobilize all material and human resources in Singapore, " said he.
Sustainable work
The Chairman Koparmex stressed the importance of identifying the future direction in order to improve the efforts of the Government.
"In general and in general, I would say that the Government is trying to be successful in various areas, there is a small progress in economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme", he said.
He noted that the current Administration has demonstrated progress in its own manner of public policy.
"These are facts that let us say that the Government begins to join the work, and I can say that some work has been done, and I think the Government understands that much still needs to do," he said.
It is sentenced for 8 kilograms of marihuana
Five years of prison and sperm income for 100 days, such a sentence was made by Navolato for the guard of eight pounds of marihuana.
The General Prosecutor reported that the accused drug trafficker, Omar Alexis Valensuella Sandal, was sentenced for a crime against health in this case, in order to disseminate marihuana.
In the case of AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI, Valensuella Sandal was arrested by the Mexican military on 7 June 2010 during the patrolization of the Cypno Valdes Street, before post No. 80 in El Castillo, Navolate.

We need to make contributions to the work
The general work on the programs such as Rodin, Saving the public spaces and 3x1 for migrants is risked to remain incomplete or long-term because of the lack of resources, said Mr. Angel Lopes Miранd.
The Director of the Municipal Social Development indicated that, although the work programmes have been developed, they are in danger, since the Government of the State is not able to make relevant contributions that are the amount of 11 million weight for all three programmes.
He noted that the overall financing of all three programmes is approximately 50 million weights, with the state of 25 per cent, and yet only the Federation and the municipality have provided resources for work, so it is still possible to delay with their finality.
"They have to put about 12 million, and although the year is finished, they didn't give us any cops when they had to give us part from July at the beginning of July," he said, "to do not leave, we've started working and they've been very good, but we need money."
He recalled that in the past year, during the government of Hessa Aguilar Padily, the State did not have the contributions he had to take, so at the beginning of the municipality's rule had to make money to cover more than 7 million, the amount that was not provided in the case of the State Administration.
" This happened with us in the previous administrative because the State had no financial opportunities to participate, and the programs continued to develop, and in this year, to get access to these programmes, we need to find resources to closure what was to be left," he explained.
Although the State authorities have the obligation to deliver these resources, he said that the request was made on behalf of the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villeral, to increase the efforts to ensure that the percentage of them arrived as soon as possible.
"They should put about 12 million, and even though the year is ended, they don't give us any cops."
The Court will approve digital television transmission in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of digital signals is one of the most important changes that have been made in the past few years.
The Supreme Court (US) rejected the constitutional claims issued by Senate and the Pallate representatives against the presidential Decree, which brought such a "transmission to digital television" from 2021 to 2015, since eight votes were not received for its cancellation.
A minority of the four ministers, including the President of the Court, Huan Sylva Mes, observed that President Felipe Calderon had not exceededed its authority, making the decree a detailed description of action to transfer to digital earth TV.
Consequently, the constitutional claims declared by the Senate were rejected by the absence of the majority qualified from the eight votes necessary to ensure that the court was issued for constitutionality or non-constitution of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft declaration prepared by Minister Olgoy Sanchez Cordero proposed to declare the decree of non-constitutional, since the regulation of the radio programme and television is a law enshrined by the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel) in violation of the principles of the Jerish subconstitution and the legislative reservation.
Only Salvitar, Horchee Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sanchez Cordero proclamed for the project.
According to this argument, and the House of Deputy held two constitutional debates in order to check the decree and support the complaints, Minister Sanchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all actions mentioned in it with regard to the transition to the digital message.
The Ministerial Meeting was also decided to reject the request of the House of Deputy, not entry into the draft discussion, as well as under the responsibility of Minister Sanchez Cordero.
In his subject, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, meaning that the Federal Executive Authority could not define the general rules for the preparation of the State Administration.
"I also don't think that if this happened, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and recall that planning of public policy in strategic areas such as telecommunications has a relationship to the federal executive authority which has a constitutional mandate, the Government's administration.
The replacement of digital signals is one of the most important changes that have occurred in recent years has improved the use of the radio and electrical sphere, the best quality of the signal and more channels.
The transition allocation, he said, would mean the allocation of benefits from the conversion into a digital form which includes satisfaction of public needs, which is not only technically measured, " as it covers economic, social, political issues and national security issues".
These questions, he said, "we need the work of the whole system educational in the principle of public economic management, includes a group of authorities which the Constitution combines public executive authority."
He recalled that a large number of countries worldwide have already been overlooked to digital service, and that was done by the executive authority, despite the existence of universal technical institutions.
It cannot be noted that the Government, taking the debated decree, which, in any case, affects the competence of the Congress, provides administrative compliance with the legislative laws adopted by the congregation.
In Michoacan, it is analyzed the possibility of reporting the vote by vote
According to the data transmitted to the CPU, the difference between the first and the second place to the Governing Elections is totally 27 per cent, even without a number of votes coming to 879 from the total number of protocols at 6.074.
The possibility of the “session to vote” is real, as regards the election process in Michoacan this year, where the difference between the first and the second place in the Governing Elections is of 27 per cent, even without a report of votes from 879 from the general number of protocols at 6.074.
In the light of this Chairman of the Secretary-General of the Institute of Electorals (IUM), Mary de Los Angeles Lynderal Saragos reminded that a few days ago, 9 November, the election Corps adopted the package of principles to agree with the local rules of the federal election reform.
As should be reminded, Michoacan did not adopt the Constitution or Electoral Code of State or the Electoral Law, since the Congress of the State had adopted reforms immediately before the time of their entry into force in this election process and the Governor Leonard of the Kingdom did not include its publication in the periods defined in the Official Journal of the State, claimed that it had some objections.
On the same day, on 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice adopted a decision on the constitutional claim made by the local legislative congregation and called “invalid and illicit” vote of the representative of the State on constitutional reform, since it had no right to “resolve or support them”.
In an interview on the possibility of vote, Mary de Los Angeles Linderal said that, with the adoption of the appropriate principles by the General Council, the IMI would be possible to submit a partial or full account of the votes by the local election body.
Similarly, the Part Recounting of one or more election urn may be made in conditions that: the results of the protocols are not matched; no vote protocol or reporting documents in the urn or is not in the Chairman; or if there are clear errors or corrections in the protocol.
Furthermore, the general counting of votes in all elections may have a place where there is a sign that the difference between the candidate of the elections concerned and the one who received the second place in vote, less or equal to one per cent, provided that in the beginning of the session a request from the representative of the party and/or coalition that has issued the second of the candidates mentioned.
The overall votes will also be reported if, at the end of the normal calculation, the difference between the winner and the candidate who has taken the second place is less or equivalent to one per cent, provided that there is a request from a political party whose candidate has taken the second place when the election routines were excluded by the partial list.
It should be noted that there are elections in Moldova where, according to the DDP, the difference between the first and the second place is only 0.16 per cent, even 129 votes from the general number of protocols in 923.

The new Italian Government will be formed in the medium
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monty, is meeting tomorrow with the President of Italy to submit the new Government to the crisis put by the country to the degree of economic disaster.
The named Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, is meeting in the medium with President of Italy to submit the new Government to the crisis put by Italy on the basis of economic disaster and the damage of the whole euro.
The statement from the Chairman said that Monty, appointed at Sunday, was meeting with the President, George Napleitato, to confirm that he could form the Government.
It is expected that it will present a technological office, although it is unreasonable when the new Executive Authority will take its positions.
Monty said he would submit to the President the results of its negotiations with political parties in his attempt to formulate the Government.
"I want to confirm my full confidence in the capacity of our country to get out of this complex period," said the former European Commissioner of the reporters.
Monty did not say that he was able to form the Government, but the ton of his comments showed that obstacles were overcome.
"The Structure is now well shocked," he said.
Monty has finished the process of preparing the Government less than three days, which is often less common, as Italy had struggled with a political and financial crisis, which has increased their debt at critical levels
The Administration under the direction of the former European Commissioner Monty should adopt a green economy package required by European leaders to return trust in Italy.
On the basis of the pressure on Monty to accelerate, the instability markets have been established by the BTPs Italy for over 10 years more than 7 per cent, the level of which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Markegalia, the leader of the Italian Workers Federation, reported to the reporters after the meeting with Monty: "We said we will be actively supported by the Government."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this critical situation.
Shanes Monti had succeeded in many ways based on the support of the LDP Party, Sylviao Berlusconi, which was forced to leave the Saturday for the crisis.
“We believe that the efforts of Professor Monty should lead to a good outcome,” said the reporter Angelino Alfano, the secretariat of the Centralist and Rights Party.
LDP support, the largest party in Italy, is important, since many of its members have opposed the government majority of the technicians in Monty.
Parliament support
The new Government of Montenegro should be a strong parliamentary support for reforms that may probably be unpopularable reforms of the economic.
Any blocking or stopping of these attempts may lead to a new and destructive attack on financial markets.
The Italian Bank Association increased pressure by warning that the loss of Monty could be a disaster.
Monty began its consultations on Monti on Monday with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as with young and female organizations.
He finishs his meeting on Tuesday night.
Monty was appointed on Sunday, Napolitano, which allowed the extreme rapid transition to the crisis.
After the short transfer at the end of the last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi was going to leave, the cost of long Italy has now reached a critical level on the background of incertitude if the new Prime Minister would be successful.
The saving of Italy with a long period of EUR 1.8 billion would be too much for the modern financial protectioners of the euro.
Monty said that his Government will exist before the following elections designated for 2013, despite disseminating prognosis, that policies would only give him time to reform before the designation of new elections.
Monty said he would like to include policies in his office, but the main parties argued that he should only be composed of technical specialists, the evidence of their involuntaryness that the financial situation affects the process.
Political sources reported that mutual infidelity and inconvenience of the parties were difficult to include political figures.
Spain's game experience is more than Tisco

This figure was reached last Friday in the game against Panama (0-2), at the stadium named Rommel Fernandos.
Spain footbolists playing in Liga all the stars and strong British Premier Line clubs were very active during this year in the liga and local cows, and they are the high-level games in European cows and Championships.
This should be added to the experience of the Spanish fraud in a complex qualification in Europe or Championship of the world.
The Tisco players, however, have a limited international experience in the area of ConcacaF, which is considered the lowest level in the FIFA.
We see that the list of the Spanish Collector Icker Kasillez, who was on Sunday against England (match 0-1 played in London) has repeated the refund of an ex-golper Andony Suiziarret, with 126 international machines.
Casillas plays today against the Tricolar and will establish a new refund in 127 international machines for Spain.

The Spain swimming game David Villa with 50 legs, for which Fernando Torres should be 27.
For Costa Rica Brian Ruiz, he was more than the two times more than Carlos Ernandes and three times more than Roy Mury and Parks.
Quintat included the country in the honour of the twenty-first year
The trip to Costa Rica is a forgotten dream.
In the exceptional interview of the Viva Basist, Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam said that the group was ready to give one of the best concerts in the next Sunday at the National Station.
It was more than 20 years of expectation, but the group says that it is also a dream that makes reality to play in this country.
This was the approval of the Basis and founder, Jeff Ament, which gave an exceptional Viva interview from Brazil last week.
The Group is on the territory of South America in the tour of the twenty-year work and on Sunday 20 will make its only stopper in Central America.
To this day, they will be held at the National Station, starting from 7:30 at night, together with the team of Los Angeles The X and the local group Las Robertas.
This is a switch from a full decryption available in The Nation.
For your fans of Costa Rica, is this a reluctant dream that Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica?
The trip to Costa Rica is a memorable dream and for us.
It's our only second visit to South and Central America, and it's all right.
I was in Costa Rica just one time - in a departure, it's a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
So we're very glad to bring our music there.
I ask it, because there is some loyalty of the group; the fans live in pressure for days before the concert.
What do you say to your most faithful fanats?
Thank you for having been with us all these years.
We needed almost 21 years to reach Costa Rica, thank you for waiting so long, and we're sorry that we needed so much time to come here.
Some people, in the expectation of your concert, relate to it as the biggest show.
Does this add some tension to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows that we have played over the last 21 years have been during the last two weeks.
We've spent a few great shows in San Paulo and we hope that this has brought us into the form of this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we want to play here very much.
We love this country, we like serving and jongle, as regards these two things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you know about Costa Rica and her snakes for serphing?
We have a lot of serfer friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the warms are incredible here.
My friends are always training to work in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, and in Mexico, are good places for the serfing, that's how we learned about this, from those who love serving.
Looking at the tour, you can say that you've made a majority show with a lot of songs.
What have you planned to say in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there before, we have no restrictions to what we can do.
We're trying to make the best show of the possible songs; we're trying to play several songs from each album and to imagine our fans a great variety of repertoires.
You never repeat the repertoire.
How do you get that?
I think it's partially because we have nine platforms and we can play more than 120 songs and each one likes different songs, so it's easy to choose what songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we have not played sometime, it keeps us in the tones and surprises us, because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved these songs and what we could forget.
This makes the show more interesting for us, and so I think it makes it more interesting for people.
This tour you're noting 20 years of carriage.
When you look back, it's hard to believe in everything you've done?
Yeah, of course.
First, I think that no one of us could never imagine that we're in the Royal Group and that we do this for more than 20 years is like a dream.
We welcome our luck and we are very encouraged to continue to create music together.
We all love each other and love music.
We are happy to travel to the world where we always wanted to go.
It's very difficult for us.
What does you mean to be a significant part of the grain race?
It was always the honour to be part of this group of great collections.
We are good friends with Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
Well, when the movement gets out of the friends' group, it's uncomfortable.
From time to time one group appears, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups appear at one time in one city.
We are honoured to be part of the Seattle Group.
I'm still playing with some of them from time.
Last year we were celebrating Alice in Chains, and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we are happy to be friends with all of them and to be part of the sound of Seattle.
It is also strange that the group of yours remains together in the same time.
Yes, four of us were together 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which is very much more than many groups.
First, I think we were happy that we were still alive, and second, we're worried about others.
We are all very close friends and, as a result, were also opened musical ways that give each experiment freedom.
We trust each other in music, and it couldn't be better.
Your relationship to the word of glory was unfair, but you have been able to do everything you wanted.
How do you get the balance?
When we grew up, it was easier to find the balance.
We're worried about being too long at the tower, because it's easy to get in this game of big balls and people who love your music.
As you remember that people here for music, it reminds you that you have to respect the music and what it has been done, not to be famous and to be a rock star, but that's what no one of us do.
What do you remember your other project, Manother Love Bone?
I think we're writing good songs, and it's been great at the beginning.
We were a group of almost three years and we have not made any album, which affected Andy (Andrew Woods) to die.
It was a lot of disappointment because it was so long, and the most important thing is that we have yet been close friends with Bruce (Ferweser) and Gragom (Hilmom), who started with us in the group, and when I hear a song or see a photo, I think about an incredible man who was Andy, and how he made me laugh, it was always pleased to go to work, smiling, talking about music and football and a lot of friends.
It was a wonderful man, and we're missing him.
The local team of Las Robertas will be responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
That's true that you know her work, especially Eddie Water, and then you chose it to open her?
Yeah, the producers sent us a few video sets, and it was a group that liked us all more, so we're not trying to see that Las Robertas can offer food, and that must be very comfortable.
Why are you constantly changed words in Yellow Ledbetter on the ports?
It's the question to Edddy Water, so I don't know.
He's hunting her and I think he's using the first thing he's coming to his head.
Who has affected you as a basket?
They're so much.
Among the first ones in mind, Gizer Batler, John Entzill, Sey Jay Ramon, John Dow, Paul McCarney, Chack Duckski...
They're so much that I can talk all day about the basists I love.
How did Pearl Jam have been successful in maintaining the accuracy of the grid, despite the fact that he wasn't in mode?
I think we're all feeling a little nervous from the words of Gring.
When I think about it, he recalls me of the groups I mentioned before, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana, and all that happened at the same time, and if that's important now, I think it's wonderful because it's a music that you should listen, and the teams like Mudhoney make now better than ever.
At first, your music was more funny, and now she becomes more positive.
How do you explain this change?
It's interesting, as I think, there are several songs in the album that can be easier, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe, which are very drunken, although they can feel a little positive.
From both, when Ed played them, I cryed when I heard them, these songs were very drunken.
I think when you grow, and in your life, you've lost family or friends, these events start to influence your creation and music, and these two songs, of course, reflect that for me.
So, I think you can be a happy man, and everybody knows how to create a laugh music.

Columbia guarantees the extradition of Portugal in the United States
President Alvaro Colum said in Thursday that the extradition process of Alfonso Portylón began to respond in the United States for the wage of $70 million.
This ended the process that Guatemala responded to the request of a northern country that requested portuguy to judge it there.
At the Press Conference of Colombia, his decision was related to the independence of the court and executive authorities, taking into account that the Court of First Instance had already signed an extradition.
He argued that during his mandate he did not "stop hands" to legal decisions and adopted all extradition procedures that he had ever known.
Nevertheless, Portugal Serquio Ruano Marrowin will be extracted for murder and serious physical damage, as well as Edgar Estras Morales and Victor Esstrada Paudes, both for the lost of drugs.
What was done by the Columbia shows the executive process after the exhaustion of all legal and constitutional courts in order to persecute States exemption from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CP), Portugal will be extracted once, with a decision on its legal status in Guatemala and the guarantee of its human rights.
Portugal was recognized innocent Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence during the Presidency period, which was a process that was previously extraordinary, but the Ministry of Public Relations has appealed and again opened the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people from the risk group
Organization was established to prevent young people's marginalization without education
The results of the first 25 years of Trinijove social support organization are important: 6,000 young people supported the social isolation have helped to survive complicated situations during the fourth century.
This should be added to more than hundreds of workplaces for this social group.
The country has served the results of the ceremony held in the old factory Fabra I Coats, where more than 300 people arrived.
Trinijove appeared close to Trinitat Well in 1986 in order to help young people with lack of education, lack of work and drug problems or substantial marginalization.
Last birthday, Sant Andreu collected a large number of responsible organizations and institutions that had cooperated with the association in these 25 years.
A different political presentation during elections showed the unique nature of Trinijove's work.
After the President of Generality, Arthur Mass, and his former Hordi Puhol, the ceremony, were visited by the Exhibition of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragal, and the Ex-Letter of lady and the current ecocism, a member of the municipal Council of Ricard Homa.
In Fabra I Coats, the current social welfare adviser, José Luis Cleris and SSEO on La Caixa, Haume Lannap.
He said that Trinijove appeared at a very difficult time and that the current period was also difficult, but added that the work that has been still done "is a good basis".
The President introduced Trinijove as a example of fighting against bad circumstances and enhancing hope in people who experience difficulties.
"The crisis is not new for the organization and work done by her," he said.
The hidden building, where the Mass festivities were organized, is evacuated
11 of the 13th buildings on the Balmes Street, 51
12 Occupants left the building last midday without fighting
It seems to be a cosmart who lived by neighbors who lived in the 51th Valley Street on the end of Balmes.
Twelve men were voluntary to leave the building that they were illegally occupied and where they organized fellowships that disfellowshipped neighbourhoods on the decision of the court without the police.
When the operation was completed, the door lock changed to prevent the recurrence of the situation.
"After this moment, it's going to be a slow control", said the manager.
The clouds, which were covered by 11 from 13 stages of the building, the rest of the buildings, brought all electricity and part of the water, detection of the walls and leave the sequences of different kinds, especially the banks from alcoholic drinks.
The first three stages were a board for the Mass festivities that longed up to two days and disappointed the owners.
There is a night club, Balmeus 51, which has also been damaged.
The owner, Mary Pantinat, reported Europe Press that its income was decreased from 80 per cent since the building was occupied.
The club's owner says that the buildings' chargers have put it into an innocent dealing, as they sold drinks for three euros, as in the club for 10.
Furthermore, the owner of the disk should be answered to the complaints of neighbourhood, although it noticed, the sound was called by non-club visitors, but the people of the crowd and, above all, those who visited the celebrations that were organized there, the frequency and the intensity of which grew, as they said, disgusted neighbors.
The club said that inquiries were so large that she even reached agreement with the owner of the ownership, and that's now nine months, as he "mised" to pay her assignment.
The Civil Police also confirmed that the last weeks more complaints were received from neighbouring.
The President of the Municipal Group of PP, advisor Alberto Fernando Diaas, needed the last week "needly evacuate the building to address the problems of coherence and the general spirit in the neighbourhood and degradation".
The Popular leader explained that only one stage of the building was busy before the summer, but in the past few months, the crowds were invaded in all stages and practically in each placement and some of them had occurred.
In this sense, he added that "we need to put the end of impunity and strictly resist the uncultural created in the building".
So, the police members evacuated the building in Nou Barris yesterday.
In 1530, the police went to Montreal Street, 35 after receiving a call from the neighbor, which noted how four men were in the building.
Four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
Archives agree with the possibility of competition after the contributions
The Municipal Competition on 16 doors re-debates on the role of Colossello in Barcelona
In the midst of the 80s, the Administration printed a list for the Colsella.
The booklet described the mountain as a large park of the capital Barcelone.
Moreover, this was compared with pictures with the New York Central Park.
After the death of the SCB, the park re-established in 1987 as the higher point of Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few who are not directed to the northern and upwards (more).
The position of the Colsello as a natural park is contrary to this idea.
The prototype was not the Central Park, but the Yellowstone, with the wild cowboy of the Jogg Mediterranean.
It was so until September the Council did not declare great conspirations from 16 concurrents to a multitude of other gates in Colosselo.
The park's idea is under the doors, unbelievably.
Of course, somebody wants to put the door on the field.
One question: Colsello? Park or mountain?
The creation and their organizational side and their impact on the city are the theme to discuss all the architects of Barcelona.
This is not the most repeating theme when two members of the chosen cluster know each other in the lift.
And this is just one of the few matches between the three architects of Barcelona and the scientists who were present.
Michael Roldon, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayon: the defence is appropriate
For Roldan, after reaching the sea line, it is “need” to discuss the “previous part of the mountain” when the proposal of the Ildephone Serda, with green balls, was not implemented.
"That's the biggest Barcelona Park is the beach.
Moreover, thanks to his beautiful access.
The college is more complicated," says the architect, for which the head of the Colsello's door contains a word wood, and we don't have to think about them "the income in the park, but as the limitation of some areas where we have to operate."
The model, as Roldon and Bayon experienced in the city building, called the proposed "Intelligence task " with " some dangers".
The risks that have come to the "indetermination of public space" after the experience of the 80th century, which ended on the Forum's "living song".
The first fear is the limitation of borders where it can be built.
"Restriction of something is the preparation of the next step," means transition.
"We should think of new urban planning instruments, since the current [quakes with regard to the General Capital Plan] may lead to real disaster."
In addition to the case, Modolo believes that simplification of the Colsello Valley may be understood as a park, Barcelona, not as a clean toxic question.
Modolo recalls that there is already work done on the borders of Calcello, which "not to miss the ear," although he thanks for the possibility that Mary proposes his profession to enter the project from the beginning.
It also understood that the nearness of the mountain to the city is a path that allows the architects to enter into the debate, but it is doubtless that this technical profile is whether it should lead interdisciplinary teams ("success"), which should be created: "Architectors should be only a tool".
Byone believes that the answer to the question that this part is set, as the rules of competition are not sufficient for the general type of Colosserola: "There are 16 cutting competitions, he says, in the sense of the sea hole, but there is no prominent reader here to see and understand the area as a whole."
This implies at least 16 complaints.
On the other hand, the project for some doors can be transferred to the program and defined by the architecture project for neighbouring doors.
In your view, the Council should ensure that the slope of Ronda de-Dalt should be provided in its entire area to create a swimming transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrasaball and will be released
After 72 days, the Judge Representative Red Casino forgive Mr. Montrey in the case of the prosecution prosecution.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrasabal will be freed after the legal representative of Red Casino gave him forgivement to the Second Criminal Court, which leads to the complaint process against the brother Mr. Montrey.
After the bombs of Casino Royale, Red Casino, Serquio Gil Harris, published a series of photos and videos where Manuel Jonas requested to pay the economic contributions to Monterrey’s secret operation in the home.
After the public condemnation, the State General Prosecutor opened a criminal case against her brother, and on 2 September, he was arrested and sent to prison for 30 days.
After four hours before the Office of the State Minister for Heritage Crimes, he was sent to a temporary prison situated in the old part of the capital of the State.
In that place, he remained 49 days following the second order for the prohibition of movement after the prosecutor excluded crimes of arrest and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Cadetta for the demand of polymilion peso to Red Casino's owner, but he carried out only a few hours in prison with a medium-term isolation of prisoners because he was threatened to death.
The authorities allowed him to continue to leave in a municipal prison in San Nicholas in Garza.
25 October the arrest order was issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court of Criminal Court, Horchee Yannes, who said that after almost two months of investigation, sufficiently clearly evidence of Jonathan's guilty, such as the appointment of 1.5 million weight with the representatives of the Buckmeckers in the exchange of permission of operations.
In the Monday, the legal representative of Red Casino, Victor Aldo Harris Gomes, was present before the judge José Louis Peshin to ask for the brother of the region, so that at the next hour he could be free.
During the court examination, the State Prosecutor Ramiro Arias asked Harcy Gomes to repay if he had lost and who of the partners of the game home gives a mistake, although the lawyer tried not to hear the name.
Based on note 197/2011, the legal punishment was given by Jonathan Larrasabal, and then it cannot make any claims on the process planned against it; no reimbursement of damage and punishment is also needed.
After listening to the legal representative, almost 1550, it was ordered to release Larrasabala Breton immediately.
The official court, Horchee Yannes, was sent to the municipality of San Nicholas in Garza to inform John that he was legally forgiven and his case will be closed.
He will also notify him of the immediate order of release signed by the judge.
The Minister of Dionicio Pers Haccoh reports on the details of the disasters where the Minister of Internal Affairs, Francisco Blake, and the seven people were killed.
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (MST) reported that the results obtained in an accident in which the Minister of Internal Affairs of Francisco Blake Mor and the seven other people had demonstrated that the helicopter had been shocked directly on the ground in full integrity, without trying to make a pilot accidental flight.
During the Press Conference, Dionicio Pers Haccoe, Minister of liaison and Transport, said that before the aircraft was upward, the pilot found that the weather conditions were appropriate for the flight.
"The elements that seem to show that the ship had a number of contacts with the land, the ships have entered into contact with trees up to 25 meters, where the fleet has lost."
He also reported that 19 persons were maritimely appointed, accordingly, to the necessary requirements for transportation of persons.
He also said that the investigation carried out in the shock area did not report about the existence of parts on earth.
"The investigation reports that there is no ship components in another place, a structural integrity has occurred.
"Wertolet was appointed for 19 passengers to meet the appropriate requirements of passenger transport.
The earth has seven to 30 degrees.
At that time, the secretariat said that the results were mainly obtained as soon as possible; however, the study may take several months or even one year.
In particular, Gilberto Lopez Meyer, Director-General of Airports and Aids Services, said that during the attack, the presidential helicopter had been driving to the cressure speed, and that happened to a mild swimming flight.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of the normal summer maneuver at the time of the shock," he said.
At the Press Conference, the owner of the SCT, Overs Hakow, counted six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aircraft rules, the race was implemented under the visual velhice rules, which means that the team should be visibility during the field and the landscape.
Available conditions:
The AICM reports identified appropriate conditions for the flight when the aircraft was sent to the border territory between Mexico and the Mexican State, where low-level clusters were observed.
Selected routes:
The team may have searched for a lower height and a greater visibility in the Kuernava Valley because of the environment.
The place of the shooting.
Coordinates of the shooting and the last records with the aircraft are likely not losses or changes in the direction of the flight before the shooting.
Small cuts on a small scale:
The information available shows that the shock was on the front and the side line.
The disappearance of the clusters understood that the helicopter was covered with the earth in the conditions of structural integrity.
No apparent signs of fire or explosion were found:
There is remained unfair evidence in the ships, any explosion or fire.
The results of recent research show that the earth could be multiplied.
During the work of the place, there were pieces of aircraft at 9.200 feet above sea level, and the earth has a cut from seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The images show the follow-up to which it was disrupted in the way.
Information contains facts that seem to show that helicopter could have a number of counts with the earth.
After an accurate survey on a larger territories than the area covered by a disaster, there was no discovered parts of the aircraft that enhanced the situation of structural integrity.
MSS declares the geno-research programme
The Social Protection provides research on the search for gender gender in children and youth; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Social Protection Institute (MSSI) announced that the study was conducted in order to discover the genes of children and youth, which was received by the Genetics of Child Feeding and Youth age, which would be reported to the signs related to loss weight.
In his statement, the Head of the Office of Biochemia Medical Studies of the National Medical Center of the 21th century, Michael Cross Lopes explained that a multi-profile team of therapy, nurses, physicians and social workers was gathered.
This team contributes to specialists and asylums of the National Institute of Health (NIPH) and the Centre of Science and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Political Institute (NPI).
In the study of the population (disciplined or not), it is invited to participate in the sports centres of MSSI participating in the research, in the Mexico Valley, where each Saturday, from 8:00 a.m. will be tested with children's participation.
He stressed that the protocols were started to take place in the sports center in Kuwaitmok (which state of Mexico), and from 8 October the events were held in the sports centre in Nepal (east Mexico).
After the goal of accession from 500 to 600 children, the study continues in the sports centre of Independence (South Mexico) and, finally, in the sport centre of Morelos (South Mexico).
He explained that the purpose of this study was to understand the composition and importance of genetics for the development of gender and to establish a risk factor between children and youth mexicans to prevent chronic degenerative diseases
On November 14, the World Day of Diabetes will be noted, and the main objective is to gather three thousand children and adolescents from 6 to 14 years of age with their parents ' s appointment and their appointment to fill individual nutrition analysis.
They also ask for physical activity and the history of family inherent diseases to avoid risk factors caused by diseases such as diabetes or sexual inadequacy.
He explained that on Saturday, anthropometric measurements will be conducted for all participants (weight, growth and grain), blood pressure and levels of glucose, grass, colesterin and insulin and genetic analysis (to identify genius related to child glucose).
Cross Lopes said that this study reflected the concern of health professionals about the careful increase in the weight among children.
Medical studies reported that over six years had been increased: 77 per cent of the boys suffered, in case of girls 47 per cent, as regards the lost weight, there was also a significant growth in the area,” said the MSSI specialist.
He said that the reason for the search of branders was based on the difference between the population of the country and other peoples in their genetic history.
He concluded that the average Mexican was 65 per cent of the posts of the American Indians, 30 per cent of the European descendants and 5 per cent of the African descendants, and that is the condition of genes related to diabetes and loss weight.
He explained that, mainly, the results of genetics of fertilizing is the incapacity of the body to defeat the loss of energy we need (calorie), and it was declined in the form of grass.
The investigator explained that the direct benefit for the participants was a comprehensive assessment of the children that could determine whether there was a level of weight or heavyness.
He even said that the existence of dark pieces on the seat (actors) and precautions means the possibility of violating metabolism and even predicting.
The information relates to the whole confidentiality, and the doctor is transmitted to the parents in writing to which they explain all measurements and changes in the lifestyle that should be undertaken to avoid disease.
Cross Lopes explained that there were three main reasons for lossing weight, heavyness and other chronic diseases: sit life, or lack of daily physical activity, a major part of the home before television and the use of transport in small distances instead of swimming.
This is also due to high-consumption of calories, i.e. increased use of coal and carbon (tamela, clothing, pizzas, hamburgers and etc.) with the main content of grass and proteins and genetic precaution analyzed in the programme.
UNAM Assfalt can avoid thresholds
Rafael Errera, researcher of UNAM Chemical Faculty, has developed a polymer-motive bit to produce the best quality of the environment and temperature.
If the signals sent by the road cover were given attention, it would be necessary to repair about 2000,000 miles per season of rain in the Mexican Valley, says Rafael Errera Nahara, a researcher of the UNAM Chemical Faculty, and adds that if the construction and content of the asfalted road is regulated, the amount of oil may be reduced or incredible to the nucleus.
In its study, the technological consideration of the bones read under the International Chemistry Year, reports that the labs with which it is responsible are developing a polymer-motifized bit for the manufacture of massage with the characteristics of the vitamin but with the best resistance to both high and low temperatures.
Errera Naher said that this type of modified bitum could be used in places where the weather is extremely shocked, as in some northern cities to improve the quality of the road and, therefore, contrary to education.
He explained that the bitum, the most serious part of the oil, is the coefficient of carbon carbon molecule, one of the high molecular mass called asfalten, and other low molecular mass that are called smaller, which jointly produce the road cover of its characteric liquid behavior.
The vulnerable behaviour of the bitum is that at high temperatures of about 180 degrees it leads to himself as a heavyness, with 120 livers very high, and at 50 degrees per celcea he maintains a almost strong condition while the bitum becomes low at the temperatures, he said.
This means that the resistance of the asfalt is not permanent, but is changed during the day, depending on natural conditions and temperatures, said a chemical engineering specialist.
The scientist noted that the streets of Mexico were mainly covered by a smooth strike, consisting of six pieces of material, including three lasts of its bitum.
Among the top shoes, a bitum consists of small stones covered in the bitum and then splitted.
Each stone that composes it, he said, was shocked in the bathroom.
In the movement of vehicles and efforts, this helps forces to distribute a very well-distribution in the road.
If this would be modified asfalt, they would be better distributed, said the chemical engineer.
In the asfalt crystal, he added the latest steel, which is called a slight of a small stone, which is actually swimming in the asfalt.
Because this slide, which will contact the transport routines, must have more resistance than asfalt strike and ensuring a road train.
As part of the road currency that will receive and disseminate the data of the efforts, the source also requires appropriate interpretation and is necessary to take into account the material which it is prepared.
Atmosphere, especially ability and transactions of temperatures, also are very important factors for consideration, especially water, because it has a significant impact on the situation of asfalt.
When the soil land, water flows in the shore, and it is difficult to get out of here, it causes the expansion of all clouds and, therefore, education.
In education, he said that the first seed is found, and only then it affects the bitum, but the damage is not mentally, the process that should be focused on the first signs of the current reparatory programs.
The member of the National System also explained that transport was another important factor in the education of the dawn, and therefore the interpretation of each area should always be associated with the vehicle load and must ensure that the requirements are implemented in order to prevent frequencies appearances.
Rafael Errera said that there is still a lot to study and to do, for example, biological emulsions that are already on the market in other countries and even helping to act with light and without high temperatures.
What wasn't the candidate of Vale to become a new Miss Columbia?
Analysis of the reasons that Serne Merlyn Ramirez stopped receiving Mrs. Columbia.
The representative of Vale received the title of the princess 14 times.
The Vale del Cauca was only desired to acquire the king of Miss Columbia.
On that occasion, Melin Ramirez Serna had to be satisfied with the submission of winners with a golden king and a ring that proclaimed her new princess of Colombia.
In view of the results reached last night in Cartahen, where Miss Atlantic wins the king and the skipper, the department constitutes 14 titled princess, and Melina joined the legione of women from Vale del Caucas, who were close to the king, but were declared by the princess, including Mirias Ospina Benoit (1947), Clare Borero Dominges (1949), Patricia Belini Ala (1979), Lauren Alvarez (1981), Rozé Barza Altesa (1983), Oghalia Arena (1987), Bálala Lanka (1988), Marshall (Alaska), Al-Alaska (Alaska) (1989).
Question, which is now taking many:
What did it not have? Because the result is a major favorite, which has demonstrated each of the statements that she had everything to be the new Miss Columbia, not just chosen by the Queen Police and the most beautiful person on the version of the Vogue-titlel of the Kingdom, such as Tatiana Vargas or Navarro, who received the king of Miss Columbia.
The first factor playing in the jury decided to condemn her the title of the First Prince was that she was not able to answer the question "What book characterizes you and why?, as Martin Muriel Gomeus from the literature society, let us read.
She answered the questionnaire:
"I'm reading a lot, I believe in literature, and I think it's an university form, and I certainly think that the book that characterizes my childhood is a very deep book.
Today, I read "Prevention and Punishment" is the chief of the world literature, which all of us should read; and at this time I also read the book of Irina of the Nemorrow, Russian writer, a wonderful book called "Harre of Blood".
The answer that did not like the jury because of the term "exuberation" and, secondly, because it did not explain exactly how each of the procycted books characterize it.
But after the ceremony, Maryn said that she was calm and satisfied with her result: "Only wise is what must happen."
And you all, please, read a little bit, "The Small Prince" is a great book."
Among the sound hypothesis - Vale is shocked from favorites.
The reporter from Bogotá suggested that, because they prefered to meet the events, and she was a candidate who received all the pre-rewards (collection of Osters, a brain vote for the best national costs, and the Queen of Mati), " which rebuild the zeal of other candidates, constituted stress from the Queen, and that the result was not close to the scene".
And it was noted during her first show in the Hillton shopping area and during the two of her colony night.
Although both she appeared to be sure, it was noted that it was lacking of power and energy demonstrated by the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico.
Ariel Osrio, a journalist of the "Kick House" in the RCN channel, said that the fact that Milene was called the princess, "it means that the candidate who wins more rewards during the competition is not a king."
Furthermore, the representative of Vale recently avoided the press communication and was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that the representative of Vale has been trying to convince the prisons in his social interest in the social work, which is finally accounting for the integrity of the National Concours of Crassock.
This is why two days before the election of a member of the international jury, Lucy Dotti, said that they are looking for a woman engaged in the social needs of their country.
"There is not enough for Ms. Columbia, we must not only look at the outermost but also focus on public consciousness, before they take part in the competition, they must already be involved in the projects," she said.
It is also suggested that the representative of Vale had been inflicted by grains and fibrosis, which was seen in its animals, but it was compared, as the judiciary had noted her as a candidate with the " natural beauty ", taking into account the healthy body, the good food and responsible physical work.
The Consultant of King Horkin Orosko notes that Melina had no better body that had, "no matters of fibrosis on the animals that weren't very noticed for me, let her lost the skin in the last day."
In particular, a journalist of Gvideo Oyos from the magazine of Cromos believed that the error of Vale de Caucash's representative was that it had been a surgical involvement.
"Operation is good, but Vale's representative doesn't know how to do it.
Her body never had her best, and she was sentenced here.
With regard to the first part of the organizations of the National Beauty Competition, the brutal prediction last night was said that it was a girl who Raimando gave Melin as a compensation for her lack of joy to obtain the coron.
Thus or not, the fact that Melin is starting today not as a Queen, but as the princess, the position that gives it the opportunity to submit Colombia to one of the international conspirations specified directly by the National Concurrent.
However, it comes to the story, as one of the kings, who, despite its predominant exhibition on the competition in Kartahen, had faced complications in receiving the king.
This was the work of a man who identified the body of Alfonso Cano.
The criminalist from Kali entered historical history as a person who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these officers is key.
On 4 November, CTI criminalist Kali entered the story as a person who confirmed the identity of FARC Alfonso Cano's head to compare his fingers.
For the seven CTI criminals this week, Elizabeth Gonzalez, a man from Porto Tehad, who held 21 years in the case of the court.
At the beginning of his carriage, Gonzales worked in the cities of Choco, where he was often going over five days through Jungle to reach the place where the body had to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Vale and after the end of the relevant course, he became a criminalist in the field of criminality where he studied the skin training, i.e. Ladone and steel.
In the week of the operation of Elizar for human recognition, known as Alfonso Cano, he was said to be the brother's clothing not more than three days.
It's a big thing closed.
On Friday night, he arrived in the helicopter from Kauka to Palmer.
He knew that he would have to identify two bodies, and one of them, as it was supposed, belonged to a man who resigned the older party war in the world, so they asked him to take ten pictures of Gilermo Leone Saens (the real name).
However, when he arrived with the research group in the place where the body was, he did not identify it in the outside area; he was very different from the media.
He was without struggles, he was like a local farmer, without spectacles and significant smells.
But the impressions aren't laughing.
By using a large shooting, the shooting, the shooting, and the shooting, and the shooter, Elizar composed the prints of the faces of the body with those on the pictures.
His eyes weren't understood. It was Alfonso Cano.
On the same night, the representative of Puerta Tehad requested to confirm the Minister of Defence of Huanun Carlos Pinson that it was the leader of the CIS
Find Find Press
For a specialist in the field of the datescope of the Sijin Office from Kali recognition received by President Huan Manuel Santos Elizabeth Gonzales at the Press Conference on Operation against Canadian, it is particularly important.
Many people don't know our work.
Ductloscopia is a strict science, without error, that can play a key role in the discovery of crimes.
In addition to the identification of the body, donkey specialists participate in investigating crimes such as robust and murder and establishing the personality of detented.
In detention, many criminals have detailed certification or have documents.
We're taking the impressions and searching for them in the base.
The researcher said that in the case of the murder, he had to put a piece of house walls, because the strike was shocked with the hands to possess the seef, the full values and the money.
"The walls were hard to work because they are not good surfaces to remove printings, but in that case we can make a picture of all the ladon and set up the personality of a criminal who has participated in several ships," he states.
Expressions also help to exclude or establish the privacy of suspects in cases related to murder.
Recently, a dead man was found with a bottle under the library around him.
During the event, a family could be suspicious in the crime and, in fact, the printing of the fingers on the bottle corresponded.
Although this does not guarantee that he was a murderer, it proves that he was on the place of murder.
The CTI adviser explained that the place where there are figures is a chemical or physical reactor.
When they are shown, they are used to remove them.
After that, the printing pictures are sent to Asif, which is the base of the criminal data, or in the register.
"There is that we still have a lot of unexpected colombianers," said the CTI expert.
He explained that it wasn't all that was shown in the CSI TV program.
Just as it's not the gold that smells, it's not everything you're swearing, it's left on yourself.
However, if possible, comparison is produced.
The "reasoned people" calls the authorities of New York.
Hundreds of Protestants have destroyed the camp before the Zokkotti area.
Some protesters heard the decision of the court on demonstrations from the area and moved to the Neighbourhood Park.
Members of the "Shaughter Wall Street" moved to New York's calls on Tuesday, when they tried to shoot again, under the judicial protection of the Manhatten area, where they were evacuated in the shooting attempt to get another large Yablo Park.
Hundreds of protesters were packed in the Zookotti area where they wanted to pass through the judicial order that allowed the "dismissed people" to destroy a camp on the surface until the other part of the movement was reacting to the disappearing park in the northern city where further arrests were held.
"Our idea is that, once the court does not allow us to destroy a camp on the surface, we're going to develop the camp somewhere else and continue to fight for returning to Zuckott and through peaceful seats and demons," said one of the representatives of the movement of the Wall Street Mark Bree.
Bray explained that the response of the "dismissed people" to the evacuation of a Palestinian city, which was sent by Mrs. Michael Blumbergom personally issued by Mr. New York, was in court where the judge Lucy Billings issued a decision prohibiting violent evacuation in the area and allowing demonstrators to stay in the camp.
Furthermore, the "dismissed people" began to have a new park situated on the centre streets of Canal Strip and Sexth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tonnel, which joins New York and New Jersey, and is in the property of the Church of Trojan.
At least at times they could take this place, but then the police arrived and began to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray couldn't call the exact number, but Ephes said that he saw a number of journalists who were also employed.
The Organization believes that several hundreds of persons were standing with palaces in the place where the delegation of religious leaders had sent to demonstrate the support of movement members by trying to speak as a mediator in police negotiations.
Between, the area of Zokkotti, which is a private ownership, remains close to the waiting for the judicial hearing appointed to that Tuesday, which will be considered the law of the Protectors today.
Some of the protesters who were sent there took and distributed at the same time copy of the court and even gave the copy of the police, safeguarding area, which led to a few small pieces, said Bray, who stated that some of the police violets were demonstrators.
The judiciary prohibits the authorities to evacuate the movement of the "Share Wall Street " members and to require the implementation of "legislatives issued after the start of the closure, or to prohibit the demonstrants to re-access access to shops and other ownerships previously used".
Mr. Blumberg said reporters that the Court of Justice had stopped opening of public space and demonstrates on this issue, but local laws did not allow them to redeploy palates and beds.
Member of the Municipal Council personally justified the removal of Protectors from the Zoothy area, which was carried out at about 200 arrests, and the decision was adopted because the protesters were "in violation of the law".
Blomberg said he gave the order to clean the area because it became "the place where people were going to be protested, but to violate the law and, in some cases, to harm others", as "also some companies have been threatened" and the neighbors were threatened to "the damage of the quality of life".
The evacuation carried out this morning was devastated and shows that the soul of Blumberg is more interested in protecting the financial interests of the American workers,” added the representative of the movement which condemns the master for “no respect for the freedom of words”.
The responsibilities for the Reddit Wall Street also indicated that they would like to organize " cross-border action " on Thursday, in association with public organizations and professionals, to remind the last two months of protests that began 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Dewe Maria's special birth TV show
Instead, with Michael Bobby and other Canadians, it appears in the TV program of Russell Peter's Royality 1 December.
Canada Pamela Anderson was a Assistent Tim Allen in the "Big Reparate", a Savior of Malibu, Banni in the Prayboy, a wife of Tommy Li, and now the activist and model of Dewe Marie will become a special birth show in Canadian television.
The CTV private television announced today that Anderson, together with the baller (Ballery Executor) Michael Bobby and other exhibited Canadians, appeared in the television program "Royality of Peters" on 1 December, as a very special role in Mary.

Japan, returned after the earthquake
The GDP increased by 1.5 per cent through internal consumption and put the end of the fall of March
Since March of the past year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed and has yet been devastated by a devastating earthquake that is a threat to the terrible disaster of the sun from the second World War.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokio, the material losses of $300,000 were a shock that seems to be in spite of a world situation.
After the three lost quarters of the currency of the currency internal product from July to September, there was a certain help to turn the page: GDP increased by 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter and by 6 per cent per year of calculation.
The second quarter registered, for Japan's finance year begins in March 2012, also the fastest growth rates from January to March 2010.
The recovery may be explicitly explained by recovery of machine equipment for reconstruction of areas devastated by the earthquake and the following tsunami.
Indeed, the company increased its investment in 1.1 per cent against 0.9 per cent of capital costs observed since January, the first reduction after six months of improper growth.
However, the real switch in the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Kennethian impulse, which calls for use of a crisis for enhancing or restructuring infrastructure, using lies to grow from zero.
Japan has, mainly, been developed by the development of household consumption, which is now 60 per cent of the Japanese GDP.
The rate increased by 1 per cent by increased costs of cars, travelling and relaxing.
Cleve and smell
Tokio provided the internal market when the Japanese currency became one of the "money refugees" chosen investors who want to be freed from a long crisis in the euro zone and negative prognosis regarding the United States, the prize that will give as a stone on the account of export companys.
In the more stronger currency, the price production is a shock that is a serious shock for the country whose economic course determines the healthy of large technological companies.
Toyota or Soni, for example, exemptes the mine in its low indicators from July to September.
As long as the market continues to be shocked by EU peripheral countries, the Government of the Esiquico Noda does not decrease illness.
We should be aware of the remaining risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the introduction in Thailand and the slightly increased value of the other, said the Minister of Economic Policy of Motokis Furukava last night.
In fact, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that most participating countries had demonstrated clear signs of economic activity in September.
The indicator, which predicts the breaks in the world economy, shows that the main forces are delayed.
Then he slowed four decades to 100.4 points compared to 100.8 in August.
The Eurozone even slowed the average value at the level 100 after it was violated by eight decades to 99.13.
Athena's re-e-mail for doubts
Pasoeros said that the correction would be approved, but the containers would not sign any written obligation
From the peripheral premiums of risk and indetermination in the park, Greece continues to flee through the lab that leads to a large European crisis.
The sense that the "concord" of the new transitional government of Ella has been soon linked to the requirements of Brussels, whether the real conviction of political forces is to be reaffirmed by facts.
While the new Prime Minister Lukas Pascaleros yesterday warned that the alternatives of structural reform are not and that a hundred-day period agreed at its appointment may be sufficient for their application, the leader of the Conservation Party, Antonio Samaras, believes that there will not be a new strict economy-measures in any case and renew its demands on the new elections designated on February 19th.
The main task of this Government is to carry out the decisions adopted on 26 October, said Pascalismo yesterday by opening parliamentary debates that will be able to believe in the new executive authority tomorrow.
The 24-year-old package for people ' s employees, the educational code reforms of State servants and new measures to combat tax torment will be the first.
However, the message of Samarus does not explain doubts about his position: "We are ready to help the transitional government, but we do not promise anything."
Leader of the Conservators made a more step in its positions concerning the EU and the FMI, organizations that would develop 8.000 million, which were urgently needed to Athena, and explained that he would not grant any letter to the application of the treaty requirements.
But the European Commission, having still experienced the disclosure of the effects referred to by the Papandre's referendum in the style of all or anything, repeated last night that its requirements are unilateral: it will not renew help if the new Government and leaders of Greece would not subscribe "the written agreement without any doubleness and as soon as possible".
The representative of the Ministry of Economy Altafay said that the trick inspectors could return to Athena to discuss with the new Government "what should be done for the payment of the sixth tranche" in the amount of 8.000 million, although the exact date is still not marked.
In the Greek club, the skin is still a few times.
Madam Sofia: "This is the instrument of progress and hope"
The king emphasized the "based" location of Spain towards this type of financial
Spain "developed a visible place in the microfinancing world."
The Queen of Sofia recalled the last two decades that the country had become a second donor towards the tools of cooperation which she had said that it was “the tool for social progress, justice and hope for the best future of all humanity based on faith in people”.
The king opened the Fifth World Summit on Migration in Valied, with the conviction that " there are no doubts" that such activities are "perfectly necessary" to achieve the goals of the United Nations Millennium Summit to 2015, and "in particular the aim of reducing the dual number of people living less than one dollar a day, the level of the "quarter poverty".
Spain “all is still working” to enhance the network of recipients around the world and take this task with all the“ appropriateness”, says the daughter of Sofia and hopes that the efforts and achievements that will continue to be achieved by the fourth anniversary will “assure the creation of new ability and best opportunities for the poorest people and especially for women who are the "based recipients of these sentences".
There's a lot of achievement and a lot of difficulties with which we face.
The Mikrodivision Summit is not only a platform for disputes but also a platform that contributes to "two main objectives".
Her Majesty thus explained that it hoped that 175 million families were used by these financial services and hundreds of those households will be elected from the poverty they are expensive until the end of 2015.
The impetus to establish a system of micro-education in Spain and in the rest of the world "is on the way the beginning of the years ago," Mohammed Yunus emphasized Mrs Sofia as “the act of justice and recognition”.
And she described the father of this instrument as a "relative idealist in the general area of fighting against poverty" whose work was known for 15 years since the Queen sent to Bangladesh to study his credit policy.
This experience in the year following the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings, such as the events in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and “I have seen an unprecedented development”, said her Majesty, whose link to the project had brought her the title of the "Family Words" assembled in Valaidolid.
Finally, the Queen of Sofia concluded the statement, urged the attendants to participate in the debate and to find decisions to go forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethic Empire"
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Trinidad Hinenes said that solidarity is "ethic Empire" for each democratic state.
In this regard, she said that it would be an error to link cooperation with developing countries with the time of economic paper, as it was the “permanent commitment”.
Chemistry concluded that mikro-radiation was a series and strong course to eliminate poverty, and now " more than ever " should work in accordance with solidarity criteria and not allow it to be victims of reduction in expenditure.
For Spain, micro-education is one of the main areas of development cooperation.
The State Secretary of International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, highly appreciated the success of the "certainty" of people who were closed before all the doors, and Mr. Valyadorlid Havier Leon de La Riva welcomed all presents in the city, which "opens its doors with the spirit of solidarity".
The HDR proposes to choose the President of the European Union by a general vote
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union (Christ-Democratic Union) in Leipzig, on Monday 14 November, had no significant challenges for the Chief Angela Mercelle, who is also the Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future Europe has not been planned in the programme, but it has been a decrease, in particular to satisfy activists who believe that government policies are not so close as today, as to Greece and may be tomorrow about Italy....
The draft resolution on the presidency in the European Commission, which was conducted in the discussion of the guideline, was adopted almost unilaterally.
From 1001 delegates were only nine voted against and 10 abstentions from the vote.
The standing continued for a few minutes, which had been paid by Angel Merckel and for a few hours later Volfhang Shileb, Eurofil and Minister of Finance left no place for doubts.
The main idea of the Officer and draft resolution is expressed in the lonzung: the real response of the crisis is "not less Europe and more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but because "two million workplaces are directly dependent on euros".
For the office, "it's been time for passengers in Europe."
This may mean changes in the Lisbon treaty that can make control of the European Union on the financial policy of Europe, but that may also affect the elections of the President of the European Commission by the general vote "to bring European face".
In any case, it is one of the proposals of the draft resolution adopted by the Congress, which apparently belongs to the Volfgang Shaleb.
Of course, the twenty-seven countries are soon agreed with this decision; the United Kingdom speaks against it, and the leaders of the HR believe that Nicole Sarkosi is also against it.
But you're ready.
Similarly, most delegates rejected the proposal to urge each country member of the European Central Bank in the management of the European Central Bank, in accordance with the size of the economy of each of them, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
She was glad to calm the situation in his party, and the Chairman increased the number of references to Conrad Addenauer and Helmut Cole, but did not try to affect the conventions through the "low-European countries" or countries that are seriously criticized by Germany.
Although the whole paragraph of the draft resolution on Europe is the importance of the German and French friendship, Angel Merckel did not mention France.
Just walking.
Remember, two centuries ago, Leipzig became a scene of blood battle.
In fact, it was one of the lowest invasions of the Napoleonian army.
What's angry with hospital letters?
As a result of money posts, the UMP and the Government have started an invasion to hospital letters.
On 15 November, Nicola Sarkosi will arrive to Bordo to visit the fund for the allocation of families and to discuss the issue, which is periodically highlighted since 2007, on the struggle of social assistance.
In order to help this invasion from the desire to seen in a difficult situation, but also a part of the re-electing campaign to the President, the majority wants to focus on hospital letters.
First, in terms of the budget economy, the Government is intended to spend private companies on the fourth day of non-payment until the expenditure begins.
Obviously, without the special consent of the employer, the employer will lose the payment for four days, at least 15 per cent from his/moon income.
Mea that is threatening to generate a angry, but which, according to Les Echos, will lead to the economy of EUR 280 million.
And that would be subject to other measures with more symbolic effects, namely, to bring public servants a day without illness payment (the State officer has not yet been expected to wait for payment, not from the three-day expectation in the private sector).
Now, when these issues are discussed, most reiterates the subject of malnutrition, which means abuse when extracting sick letters.
The control will be more heavy and swimming, if you get it, you must return all the unlawfully received payments", Whey Bertran warned at the RTL channel on Saturday 13 November.
In other cases, the effects of the declaration were insufficiently a number of real abuses with sick letters.
Since 2002, they have been subjected to a permanent control and political attack that brings their fruits.
People in France are not more sick than anywhere in Europe.
Let's first look at the numbers in the country.
According to the National Medical Insurance Fund, more than EUR 237 million were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute of Health Economic Research and Documentation, daily compensation costs in 2008 were EUR 11,3 million per cent from the general health costs.
The amount of 46 per cent was related to decreased decrease and unfortunate production cases and 54 per cent of the illness rates, which consisted of 6,2 million euros.
It was therefore 2,5 per cent of health costs.
France was conducted in a medium of 14.5 days in 2010 compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to the Alma Consulting Group study.
Another study published by Monster.com on the site in 2007 showed that 75 per cent of 40,000 French employees said they had not taken any day in hospital.
Another study, in this case, claims that 37 per cent of hospitals had been less than 8 days, 15 per cent from 15 days to one month, 15 per cent from one to three months and 11 per cent has been further.
If comparing these figures with European neighbourhoods, it is clear that French workers are not more striking to be sick than the employees of any other country.
A long study carried out by CNRS two researchers in 2010 showed that between 1994 and 2001 the total level of lack of work in France (for health or not) was 10 or 11 per cent, compared to 20 to 28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom and 16 to 18 per cent in the Netherlands.
The level of fraude related to hospital letters is very low compared to the “serial” occupation.
With regard to the weakness level, he is very low.
The deterioration of the law after 2002 has resulted in a systematic testing of diseases over 45 days.
In 2008, 1.5 million CNAM tested cases established that 13 per cent of 285.000 short-term illness prisons were "injusted or too debt", which is 37.050 cases.
In the case of systematically verified hospital letters, more than 45 days 11 per cent of the cases of 1.2 million were " unfair or unexpected " (132.000).
In general, 169,000 cases were " unreasonable " for millions of workers receiving hospital letters.
Numbers that show very little comparisons, for example, with the "serial" occupation digits.
According to the Deputy UMP Dominican Tian, the author of the report on this issue in June, there are 9 to 15 million euros of unexpected budgets in the year, which exceeds the general costs for daily compensation, and therefore unprecedentedly above the loss of fraud.
Paciente: Greece must follow the new resolution plan
Greece needs a new settlement programme to save its economy.
In this regard, on Wednesday, 14 November, the Prime Minister Lucas Pascaleros, added that 100 days of his coalitional government was not sufficient to carry out this task.
"In order to achieve the goals of economic saving, we need to support our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the Head of the Government, who made his first public statement by opening a debate on this confidence in Parliament in the Middle East.
The implementation of the decisions adopted on the Eurostat itself on 27 October should be the "based task" of the new Government, since the presence of the country in Eurozone has been placed on a card", he added.
Consequently, Pacific provisions a reduction in the budget deficiency of the country by 9 per cent from GDP to the end of the year, at 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
The rights reject the new Government
On Monday, Antonio Samaras, the Leader of Rights, expressed its support for the measures already adopted to try to get out of a long crisis, but warned that his party would not support additional strict economies.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at the meeting with Members from his New Democracy party.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing deficit and long-term and combating expenditure, but also with the inadequacy of any rate that prevents the rebuilding of the economy.
Ollie Rene, the European Commission responsible for the economy and the financing, who warned that IIF and the EU had not dislocked the necessary credit for 8 million euros without written guarantees from all parties that they support planned measures, responded that his words were sufficient and that it would not sign anything under external pressure.
The Committee of Experts should be readilyified for euthanization and self-assault with bilateral assistance.
Canadians refused to die, claimed in the report of the Kingdom Society of Canada
With regard to the Palliative Medicine, the Committee claims that the Government, the health institutions and the doctor are working together in order to ensure better palliative assistance, and that is not considered to be cancer.
Canadians refuse to die.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to say to their doctor when they want to die and take steps in this direction.
This is one of the impressioning conclusions of the Kingdom Society of Canada, in which six experts participated in various areas, including ethics, rights and medicine.
The Committee proposes to the Government to change the criminal code so that self-assault with bilateral assistance and evatanism when the choice is bound to the circumstances, and the patient can be considered competent to adopt such decision.
For the beginning, experts refer to the recent study of the Economic Expert Office, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries in the world.
Although Canada is on 10 places, the study notes that “the medialization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people fear to face death”.
Because of the medicine or not, but 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative assistance, they report experts designated by the Kingdom Society of Canada.
68.6 per cent of them have died in the hospital.
The highest indicator in Quebec, where 86 per cent of deaths are in the hospital.
On the specific question of eutanasia and self-assault with bilateral support by the authors of the report, the conclusion that is contrary to the position of the federal Government, which has already stated that there is no desire to change in the Criminal Code with respect to Eutanasia and self-assault with multilateral assistance.
Now, experts who have also studied the position of all countries where such actions were legitimated or decriminated do not prove that this decriminalization is a misuse in the use of euthanasis or self-assaults with bilateral assistance against persons who may not or do not want to take such decision.
On the contrary, he confirmed the teleconferency, which presented the report, most of these cases were in countries where Eutanasia and self-suicide were not legitimated with bilateral assistance.
It is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.
In Canada, where it is unlawful, the self-assault is carried out by Josephine Dawni.
Canadians for Euthanasie
85 per cent of Canadians speak for eutanasia, since, according to Angusa Ray's survey in 2010, they believe that this allows people to facilitate their suffering at the end of their life.
And 66 per cent believe that euthanization is not a sign of the life of older persons or persons with disabilities is less valued.
With regard to people who have helped themselves, 41 per cent of the requested believes that they should not be pursued in criminality.
As regards the proliferation or termination of medical treatment for sick, the situation is less important, the authors of the report.
They also propose, in addition to their other recommendations, that the Criminal Code should establish that legally stopping medical infringement is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also requires that health specialists have been trained in the spirit of respect for the refusal of medical care at the end of the life without the fear of criminal persecution.
With regard to palliative assistance, the Committee encourages the Government, the Institutes of Medicine and Medical Services to work together in order to develop the best possible palliative assistance, not only in the case of cancer.
Finally, with regard to a palliative or terminal ceremony, which is already widespread applied in the Canadian Health Institutes, the Committee requires that it be applied when it does not serve as an enduring physical pain, such as euthanasie, and has been limited to the same.
Notes of other experts
Some health legislative experts have already commented on the conclusion of the report of the experts of the Kingdom Society of Canada.
Mestra Pierre Deschan, health legislative specialist, described as a " extreme " position of experts signed by the report, because, among other things, it does not limit the use of evatanasis of death cases.
This opens the door to the situation where everyone who has been slept from life and whom more than 18 may ask for self-slaughter, the meter Deschan, who has discussed the summary of the report last night.
Metro Desham also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to be an independence above all other values of society.
He said, "The society has warning signs and bans."
The health legislation specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "a catalogue inconvenience with the conclusions of the report, which it called "Euthanic Manufacture".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Kingdom Society of Canada, has, in particular, the report on abuse in some countries where evahancing and self-suicide is readily readily readily, such as in the Netherlands and Organo.

On their part, the United States welcomes the "expansion of consensus against Asad and the action of the Syrian regime " followed by the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the Liga of Arab States and the countries such as Turkey, have taken a more severe course on the repressions in Syria, noted Mark Toner, representative of the State Department.

Russian scientist helped Iran ' s nuclear programme
The Russian scientist Vichelau Danielko helped Iran to develop a detonator for use in nuclear weapons confirmed in the lunch of the American Agency specialized in the field of nuclear danger.
The Institute of Scientific and International Security (ISIS) is referred to the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents of the United Nations Agency to establish the identity of this scientist.
Last week, the IAEA expressed concern about the possible military aspect of the Iranian nuclear programme

He then cooperated with the Iran programme from 1996 to 2002 before returning to Russia
In its report, the IAEA recalls "a clear sign that Iran's development of nuclear detonators " has facilitated the work of a foreign expert who was not only known to the technology, but also informed the Agency that he had worked a large part of his carriage on this technology within the military programme of his country.

Twitter changes its platform and becomes like Facebook
The Twitter Mikrob site has changed in the presentation of its platforms that allow users to see the activeness of those who follow that server is similar to Facebook.
The new "activity" tab and the other "name" allows you to follow more easier and directly on the activities of other Twitters, the Internet users whose messages are tracking, and those who follow you.
This provides an opportunity to recognise if they publish a message if they are signed to new accounts, if they have selected communications, etc.
This new form of Twitter was protested "in the small percentage of the users in August" before a large use of all the weekends, AFP has stated that AFP press secret to Twitter Caroline Penner.
Twitter, who has been known for a long time as an intuitively unreasonable and as an uncertain term (RT to overcome any other community, #followfriday for the recommendation of monitoring other users), is mainly the satisfaction of the experienced users, thus opens himself to a broader audition, representing the users something closer to the popular Facebook and Google+ social networks.
The users discussed this new entry via Twitters in the Internet.
"It's not useful, sweet, and the sweetheart remembers Facebook."
The functional activity helps me monitor certain elements of my flow on Twitter, wrote @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction in the Constitution of the 'solar rules' of the budget
The leadership of the great coalition of social democratics and Christian Democratic Democratics in Austria decided to register the budgetary " solid rules " in the Constitution to reduce the budget deficit and thus avoid the possible reduction of the rating agencies of the State credit race of Austria (third A).
The Social Democracy Officer Verner Phyman individually announced this decision at the end of the Council of Ministers, while the Austrian State debt is 74.6 per cent, which is significantly higher than the higher standards set by the Mastritic Treaty, but below the State debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria's payability was only one paragraph, with AAA to AA+, we should pay for more than three million euros each year, bringing the argument of the vice-Canner and the Minister for Foreign Affairs from Christian Democratic Democratics Michael Schendelager.
As a result, Austria complies with the requirement of the Summit of European countries members in Brussels, the heads of States and Governments needed a reduction of budgetary deficiencies at the end of 2012 and return to balanced public accounts through constitution or equal law.
The establishment adopted by the Austrian Government recalls the "German model" because Germany was the first European country who had accepted this "just".
The structural deficit of the State budget should be reduced every year to 0.75 per cent of the monetary internal product (PIB) and the structural deficit of the federal State in any year should not exceed 0.35 per cent of the GDP and the country, as well as the Communities, be submitted to balanced budgets.
The objective is to put the State debt down below note 60 per cent of the Mastritic Treaty to 2020/2021.
Ethico Noda
threatens the new monetary market interest
The Prime Minister of Japan Ethico Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would carry out new monetary interviews, if the value and cost continued to grow.
We interfere as we have done this last time when Mr. Nod Senate explained the excessive flexibility of the exchange rate.
On Thursday, Ina grew nearly to the historical note that built the authorities of Japan to the interview of October 31.
To this day, Tokyo sells a $1,000 in a large scale to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which has established a new recursion since 1945.
However, since that time, Iona has grown continuously in purchase of investors, who accept it as a "refugee" in these smiling periods of economic decline around the world and a long crisis in Europe.
On Monday, the dollar fell below 77 yen, and the euro falls below the symbolic plan of 105 yen, nearly to the level that the last intervention was incurred.
The current financial crisis for 2008-2009 was about 120 yen, and the euro is more than 160 yen.
The growth of the Japanese currencies affects Japan's export, since Japanese products make the Japanese products more valuable and reduces the income of Japanese companies because of the escape when converting into a national currency.
"Japan is struggling to restore themselves" after the earthquake and the tsunamis of 11 March, which destroyed the Toko region (south-south-east), stressed Mr. Nod, who fears that this growth will be killed by a slim rebuilding generation.
Third in the world, the economic State has renewed growth in the third quarter to 1,5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, first by exporting and consumption of households affected by disasters
However, the Prime Minister feels that the high price and the prices do not reflect the fundamental economic indicators of Japan.
The Minister of Finance of Dzun Adzumi called the Japan Bank (BoJ), which opened the two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Board, to take all necessary steps to deficiency.
However, the Vice-Administrator of the Hirochid Yamмагuti warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken the " appropriate steps", understood that no additional relief should be expected.
The last meeting at the end of October, the Emilious Organization increased 5,000 million euros (47 million euros) to purchase channels, up to 55,000 million euros (519 million euros) to buy different financial instruments to sell the market.
Eurozone
Growth rates, funds are collected
The risk of infringement by a long crisis affects European index.
Despite the appointment of new heads of States in Greece and Italy and the improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in instability countries continue to grow
There are still concerns for the stability of the Europeans, the European coasts went on Tuesday, 15 November, a little further in the negative zone.
In Paris, 10 morning, 40 per cent of the CAC had lost, and was completed by 3.064 items.
DAX in Francoforte was 0.4 per cent, and London was 0.1 per cent.
With regard to new difficulties with the payment of credits by the European countries in difficult situations, the fund markets worldwide continue to lose part of their recent achievements.
"Investors are just too worried about the risk of infringement", explains Terry Pratt, the institutional IG marketets blog, quoted by Reuter.
The Tokio coast closed by 0.7 per cent under the load of new certain market participants towards the ability of Europe to maintain a long crisis.
" Japan, like the rest of the world, has slowed its view to Europe, and the beaches will follow each other in the corner of strict changes until the investors have confirmed that the situation has been stabilized", said Misshie Akino, the fund manager of the Iiyoshi Investment Management
This return of concerns about the future of the euro is a single currency that continued to fall in the Sunday.
Euro reached its submarket for half months.
The European currency was $1,3570 at 10 morning, slowing 0.4 per cent.
According to the brokers, she fell after the Chairman's Chairman Angela Mercel HDS party on Monday, which has been adopted a resolution which provides, in particular, the opportunity for the countries in a complex situation, to leave the euro without leaveing together with the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates significantly above 6 per cent
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at the level of large fears.
Today, in the morning, the arrival of Italian ten years of age reached 6.85 per cent, and the income of Spanish ranks at the same time reached 6,2 per cent.
These complications with the percentage rates in Southern countries, but also in France continue to investigate the fears of participants.
The chief of the future Italian Government Mario Monti requested time to restore the situation in Italy under the threat of paralysis under its debt.
The new Prime Minister of Greece Lucas Pascaleros confirmed that the implementation of the decisions adopted on the Euroon itself on 27 October would be the "based task" of his Government.
Spain was shot by the market before the parliamentary elections on Sunday.
Among the percentage rates of the 10-year-old commitments, Germany and Spain reached a new historical maximum.
In the expectation of growth rates in Eurozone
France has fixed economic growth to 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, little better than 0.3 per cent, due to the increased consumption of households.
Insee, despite this, has revised the side of the second quarter decrease, with 0.1 per cent of the currency internal product instead of stagnation.
Economists are most concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany, at the same time, has fixed growth by 0.5 per cent for the same period.
The first assessment of all euros is expected to be at 11 morning, the European Commission warns the risk of the new recession.
Energy Policy:
Facts should be over the dogs
If there is a theme to decide that cannot be taken after a continuous discussion or under the impact of emotions, it is an energetic policy.
The accessibility and cost of electricity directly affects the purchasing capacity and competitiveness of companies.
It is a healthy trend that the election meetings are a matter for the consideration of the share and places of nuclear energy.
The spot will not produce fruit until all the proposed economic, social and environmental consequences will be studied.
France should build its view on objective facts and rational data.
Now, seven million people on the planet, the demographic development is due to the reducing of electricity needs until 2050, if only a large part of the world's population is not free of vital elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to comply with the higher deficit of coating resources to continue to generate electricity constantly, without forgetting the most important need to reduce gas emissions in order to combat climate disbalance, a subject that has disappeared from environmental debates.
The accident in Fukushima does not change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains one in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
This is not the case of Belgium, which makes its decision depending on the need to find a source that can replace nuclear energy, or Switzerland, which is intended to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil are only few of those who are decisively continuing their projects.
The United States decided after Fukushima to add one installation to its complex, rebuilding the station that was stopped after the accident in Tri-Mill-Iland.
Although the German model, based on renewed energy, is sometimes an example, the reality of this argument is contrary.
The election of Berlin will have an increase in the value of electricity, increased energy dependence, increased the need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, the coal scale of carbon gas emissions in connection with the construction of gas and fuel stations.
After a few months, all of these unpleasant effects will be sensitive.
The example of Denmark should be considered.
The Champion of Europe on the construction of the turbine from which it receives 30 per cent of its electricity, is the largest consumptor of carbon and gas from the throwing wind; the emissions of carbon gas and electricity prices respectively by 65 per cent and 50 per cent above the average Europe.
On the other hand, thanks to our energy policy, our neighbors pay 40% more electricity than French households.
As the globalized energy price is a key factor for the competitiveness and the loan of industrial equipment services in the national territory, the French companies benefit from the very low electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in nuclear energy will lead to a great increase in the value of electricity, which will make illustrating beautiful statements on the new industrialization of our country and the protection of the purchasing capacity.
The price that most French members refuse to pay, more because they do not reflect this kind of energy in principle.
It should be remembered that the country's energy policy has made it possible to create industrial sectors in 125,000 direct workplaces and 410,000 dispatched.
Heavyly-oriented exports, it affects the whole part of specialized in international trade of small and medium-sized enterprises and creates a lot of workplaces that cannot be moved to another area.
If France decided to reject nuclear energy, it should be offered to a large number of companies and to lose $6 million per year from the French export of nuclear equipment and services.
What electric engine will command EPR to work for sixty years if it is planned to close its manufacturer?
In order to solve energy equality, it should be recognized that there is no god or divine sources of energy production.
The development of Areva's decisions with low carbon gas emissions, nuclear and renewed gases, shows compliance with energy sources.
For nuclear energy to support the higher security level, it is a vital matter of life
In France, we have a security body that performs an uncommon and transparent control of existing energy centres such as Flamenville.
Our teams whose professionalism is generally acknowledged are full of the same security.
In the course of 50 years, the atomic industry survived three serious incidents.
Only one, Tri-Mil-Iland, has occurred in normal exploitation conditions, but no effects for human or environment
A reactor and an insufficient human error in the Blackbola caused a tragedy.
In Fukushima some people seem to have forgotten that accidents have occurred in the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented force that have affected the death of decades of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector is a lesson from this accident, as has been taken from two previously.
The part of this step and cooperation between the security bodies, operators and French and German constructors, EPR presents a project that enabled to oppose such manifestations.
As it is considered by all energy specialists who want to build a reactor, the stop of its construction in Flamanville will be a wonderful gift to the Areva and EDF competitors, cleaning them the way to lead in an unevitable development of atomic energy.
We need to search for the best combination of energy sources for our country, but it would be indirectly possible to enable emotions, dogmes and manuals to be obtained in the conflict, which is so important for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration is a burden or good for the economy?
The immigration policy at Nicola Sarkosi was critical with various parts of the transfer of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the digital policy and the coherence of this policy with the French self-proclaimed status as the State of Human Rights.
Then, the administrative adherence of foreign students who had been launched in news when the Minister of Internal Affairs (Liberacio) said that France “not needed for foreign talents, stones and officers”.
But it is very rarely analyzed with economic perspective.
The right and left in this issue are manyly agreed.
From the right tone, Jacques Shirak was issued, who said in 1976 that "9 million unemployed people will not become a problem in the country with 2 million foreign workers", and from the left, Mikrow Rock, who explained in 1990 that France "is not able to take poor ones from the world".
Difference only at the generosity level
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the Territory Oor of the Poland Water drivers had been acknowledged and left and right.
Both parties see burden in immigration for French economy and French society.
The difference is only at the level of generosity that they will enable immigrants.
In its François Programme, Olland was limited to the banalities, said that "the joint work to address our immigration problem".
This representation of immigration as a burden and a problem may provide electrical advantages, but the economics are very precious.
As we recalled by the economists of Jan Holdin and Jeffrey Cameron in the recent book on immigration (On people: How migration has formed our peace and determined our future, May 2011, the publication of the Princeton University, 352 c.), there is a comprehensive consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, employed payment and employment in the countries that are engaged in immigrants.
Immigration restricts growth and decrease employment.
The fears for immigrants are based on a substance that they are able to replace local employees, especially low-capacized, providing retail reduction.
However, experience shows that immigrants are more complemented than replaced by local workforce by carrying out work that lacks local work.
Incapacized immigrants are working in sectors that do not touch local working force and the most qualified are in dynamic sectors where education is not related to work proposals.
Positive impact on payment
As the surgery would be difficult to work in the country where there is a lack of anesthesis, complementing between local and immigrants, brings positive influence on the arrival of immigrants to the payment of local employees.
Jovannie Peri said that the growth of 1 per cent of migration flows increased by 0.6-0.9 per cent of real long-term wages.
This is without account of the fact that the diversity involving immigrants contributes to the creation of new ideas and economic growth (from the Northern American Lawreats of Nobel, the great part of the natural immigrants, and Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo - all were based on immigrants).
Migrants also produce pure income to the social security system, giving average 1 per cent of the overall budgets of European countries.
Assessing the World Labour Organization, such as immigrant in Germany, has been 30 years of age, will provide the public budget (minor expenditure revenue) in the average of EUR 1500,000.
Nicola Sarkozi was going to “dents” at the beginning of his mandate to be insufficiently growing points.
The dentists used to defeat immigrants were extremely contradicted.
Europe has developed democracy and remains aware of European democracy
Democracy is a valuable acquisition, but the same time.
The European Continent should remember that in the 19th century he had survived the tragedy of the World War I, the Talitar regimes, the Holocaust, the Gulaga, and the Franco in Spain, the Salazar in Portugal and the Powers in Greece.
Some believed that that democracy finally repressed against their enemies would be sufficient to vote and to make it so direct as possible.
Since Napoleon's time, he knows that this happens from the surface of the thought.
The general vote, although it is a binding condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition and may even become a "formation tool", as ever said by the Republican filosof Etienne Washington.
No, democracy requires a lot of other public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of authorities, education, Provision, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis we concern is an economic crisis, but first of all this is a political crisis and a democracy crisis.
In this regard, the philosophy of the true-friendly Greek referendum will have a double dispatch effect, demonstrating the need for a serious change in the policies, as well as the unfortunate sense of its inadequacy and inconsistence.
This duality needs to be condemned to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line of democracy has now been struggled, and many of the Republican soldiers are now not in that side.
We do not win anything, pursuant to a series of national referendums that are worthy and haotic.
"Cart-Blunsh" for an absolute European monarch or a shock with related feet to lose nationalism - what choice for the citizen!
No, we are not dreaming of the gluotine legs, but of the implementation of a joint, clear and unprecedented, choice and democracy at this time at the general European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and there is no doubt of how much more they should be counted, because there is only one crisis - Europe's crisis.
All Europe is subject to the dictata of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its weakness and lack of solidarity.
All Europe has been decreased at the international scene.
Many are concerned about the transmission of the sovereignty of Europe, but all Europe will slowly lose its sovereignty and each of its nations.
It should be urgently restructured by the European project under the national sovereignty.
Because only the joint work of the European people will be able to reduce the duration of each person, free from the market and prepare for the future, investing in it.
The outcome from the crisis is needed to make decisions at the general European level, and it cannot be taken without full democracy without bringing us to disaster.
After a long discussion of the proposal of socialists and Jacq Delor, the European Economic Government now requires.
Let it.
But to represent it without a stronger economic, political and democratic integration in life, it is a disagreement and a new stink.
We have to start a new stage of Europe's construction.
In order to establish a Republic in France, the Republic of the Republic had to “remember” the Republicns.
Revolution would be inadequate.
This lesson remains in force.
We have to build Europe, one at the economic level.
This can only be done by creating more democratic Europe at the political level of the present national sovereignty of Europe.
To create Europe, let's create Europeans.
Bad cards are distributed all the wide.
The World Chip Card Exhibition is opened on Sunday in Vilpent under Paris in the atmosphere of optimism.
In fact, 2011, 11 per cent of global microprocessor sales (bank phones, SIM cards) exceeded, according to Eurosmart, 6 million units.
The worse sector of uncontact technology that allows to pay public transport or purchase is simply a card on accounting device.
This year, 460 million uncontact cyp-cards will be sold in the world against 320 million years ago!
Their share is growing in 2012 (as expected to 580 million units) and is almost 10 per cent of the world Chip Card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe, a long time away from the Asian and Pacific region, is now forwarded in the field of uncontact payments.
About 26 million bank maps Visa have already been obtained by this function, and 750,000 terms are taken.
France has more modest positions: 400,000 Visa maps are treated.
But the big shops are shocking the shoes.
In this year, Carrefour released 2.5 million uncontaminated MasterCard Pass.
To move to higher speed, the banks need to be able to use their customer equipment.
"The two major organizations in France have promised to systematically distribute between their clients of the bank maps that were available for free-contact use,” reported Gerar Nebuy, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
The banks test payments using a mobile phone.
But this is only the first stage of the future payment means a mobile phone.
As long as few devices are equipped with NFC technologies (Nearland Communication), necessary for such transactions.
"They were resigned.
"But they're going to be shocked in the next year."
"We account for world sales from 80 to 120 million units in 2012, explains Mark Berten, head of Eurosmart.
But the banks are going forward.
Tonight, the Agriculture Credit announced a experiment from December to June next year in Canadian.
A total of 200 iPhone clients and staff will be obtained by cheshllas that provide uncontact payments.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marcel.
The General Society also stated yesterday that it would prepare a proposal for its customers to pay through mobile phones.
The terrorist front is distributed from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the connections of the Islamic Magrigab with the Boko Haram Sect.
Reaffirmed the long-term link between the terrorist group Al-Qaida in the Muslim Magreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Boko Haram Sect.
On Sunday, the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even stated that the Algerians are now certain.
" The user of these two organizations, and the secret services reports show that they are actively cooperating, explained without details.
Paris seems to come to similar conclusions.
Two connections were identified in January in Nigeria.
In the restaurant in Nieam, close to Aqmi, Antonio de Leokur and Venezuela, the next day, with a number of guests during the operation conducted by the French specialists, were killed.
Among the locks left after the operation, French and Nigerian researchers found several phone seminars belonging to terrorists.
This is the terrorism.
The analysis of the calls had indicated to several partners in Mali, Nigeria and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), researchers are especially interested in two numbers; one indicates that the Nigerians who lived in Midigury, the city in the northern Nigeria, the coasts of Boko Haram, and the other to men, as they say, close to Aqmi and sect.
"This step forward, but it must certainly be more reliable evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"No, it's possible."
" For many years, he knows that the sect receives financial and ideal support and that it is increasingly active, " said the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuvo.
In the past months, this support has become more clear on the action and statements of Boko Haram and its methods, which now include the use of deaths and the more complex explosive devices that Aqmi uses.
The international community, in the head of Washington, now shows the pressure on Abu, to take attention to the problems of Boko Haram.
The case is that the Nigerian authorities traditionally considered the group as a community of educational persons that were not interested.
Quick Success
Based in 2002 in Midigury with swords, schools and foundationist Mohammed Yusufe, Boko Haram, which means "the western education is sin" - preachs the establishment of Islamic Emirates in the northern Nigerian Nigeria.
The organization has made rapid success in this poor region.
It is politicized and requires strict compliance with the chariot, and its activists have started fighting against the wicked central government.
It is mainly on the church, bars and authorities.
In 2009, activists of Boko Haram have demonstrated special activity by a number of attacks against the police office.
Abugie's reaction is normally uncommitted.
The army blocked the city and left 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, who was taken alive, was killed in prison.
Now, the sect is radially rooted and goes beyond the borders of its northern cocktails.
In the past Christmas, she was responsible for the action that was killed by 80 people in Jose, and then for another in Abuage.
In June, Abujan Boko Haram organized the first attack on the police headquarters.
In August, the local representative of the United Nations will become their first international purpose.
The creation of a terrorist ass in Africa, which is from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is concerned about all security experts today.
Today, when Aqmi strengthened in Mali and Nigeria, and the Somalians from Al-Shabab act in Kenya, Boko Haram is a new threat to the continent.
Last week, at the interview with Presidents Gudlack Jonathan, Alan Juppe warned about the danger of Boko Haram and expressed its willingness to share all the information available.
The world is seeing the Republican candidates to the President
With regard to China, Iran and Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Keen and Rick Perry are incompatible and incompatible.
Can a weak American crisis lead a complex world through simple and accurate ideas?
If you listen to candidates to the President from the Republicns, the elections could believe in this.
A few days ago, Mitt Romney, Herman Keen, Rick Perry and the many other, but only detailed statements on the external policy, which traditionally are a strong part of the Republicans.
Lozngis related to China, Iran and Israel are often disappointed.
Mitt Romney, whose best chances were to move from the Star of the Good Party, threatened to give China's complaint to WTO and accused them in " manipulation of its currency " are a feeling topic for America, which was developed by the entire sector of its industry in Asia.
It's worse that if this leads to the trade war, he said.
John Huntsman, former Ambassador of Obama in China, and the only candidate who is in a complex external policy, was not able to fight a position that affects emotions.
He called on a strong, but constructive dialogue with Peking (on the current position of Obama).
But Hansman, who holds in the lower part of the ratings, remained unexpected.
Reagan style
Romania also promised military attacks against Iran if the sanctions could not stop its nuclear programme.
"If you're gonna get me out, I'll stop Iran, he said."
"If Obama will be resolved, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to strengthen Israel ' s military assistance, accused of Obama to fulfil the promises for the partner.
Employee Herman Keen, second in the candidate racing, demonstrated that the case was unconscious.
He recently called against China's military threat, because Peking is trying to get the nuclear army, - apparently I don't know that China has her since 1964!
Gouvernant Texas Rick Perry, who supports Israel and seeks military attacks against Iran, said that it is ready to use the American army in Mexico against drugs.
In 2009, Caine, Perry and Candidate Michel Baham are also recommended to be assaulted in terrorism.
All of this is far from the Republic of 2008, John McKeyne, the degree of external policy.
The opposites of the current President respond that Reagan had also had simple ideas and that he wins a cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was a lovers and that he had to cut the ton against the fight against terrorism.
They are fairly inclined to the fault of his imminent dialogue with Iran, at the premature conclusion of the "childs" of Iraq, his routines in Libya, which brings him the reputation of a weak policy.
But the invasion is not so simple.
The population considers the positive balance of national security at Obama, which eliminated Ben Laden.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military interviews that are involved in the sand.
And as it said that America is necessary to rebuild economics in order to restore its leadership, Obama's right.
The North River, new doors for Russian gas in Europe.
The North River, which connects Western Europe and Russia, is running directly on the day of the Baltic Sea.
It is estimated for gas equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, Russian guiant manufacturer of gas, wanted to divide this event with sweet.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of States and Governments, participated in the last Monday on the Baltic Valleys, between the orthostors and the scanning purchase, the opening of the North River, the new gas drive which directly connects Russia and Germany under water.
Cantor Germany Angel Mercelle, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francois Phioon and his Dutch colleague Mart Röthte, together returned a symbolic winter that controlled the income of Russian gas into the Western European network.
At the new gas line, 27.5 million additional cuban meters will be carried out every year in Western Europe on the first pipeline of 1 224 km, connected to the Leningrad area with the Meclandburg land.
The second pipe should be prepared at the end of 2012, providing a total of 55 million cubic gases equipped with all French consumption.
And the possibility of building a third pipeline is already discussed in the same direction.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project is the winning.
The draft met a terrible resistance to Poland and the Aboriginal States.
The northern river really allows gas to be transferred directly to Germany, avoiding passing through the third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries lost part of their authority: they will be more difficult to influence Russia by shutting access to Western European markets.
In the most pressing moment, Warshava was not stopped comparing the North River with the new German and Soviet Covenant, aiming at occupying Poland in 1939.
That means that the issue is politically sensitive.
In support of this Russian project, western Europe has pursued more security for its delivery.
But the price of Europe's energetic punishment is because the project has created a brown between Eastern and Western Europe.
Russia has been able to achieve the understanding of the direct Union between Russia and the rich Western countries that need a large number of gases and whose own stocks are already expenditure.
"This is a part of Russia's cooperation, it is a new artery that organisedly connects us", said François Fion, opening gas guide, demonstrating, to which extent large gas contracts are important and political and economic.
All this explains the wide smile of the heads of Gazproma, who are present in a large number of loved numbers, of the gas arrive.
The use of this gas drive is also technical shipping.
The subconductor was made from the beton prison in order to protect it from the ships.
It stands on the day of the sea, in the middle of a 200 meters.
In order to build it, the mining fields remained from the second world war were needed.
“The hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a warning,” said Yens Muller, the secretary press of the North River.
It was also necessary to take many steps to protect the fauna and the floor.
The trailer is a long metal sound of weight, the equivalent weight of 242 Afeel baths, without explosions over all his length, without winds and without swimming stations.
The control platform was planned in the Sweden area, but the management project was rejected by it, since Sweden was not slaughtered from the Russian public company to reside forever in its beaches.
"In the accident, we'll close the gas flow less than for a minute," says Yens Muller.
In the case of the disappearing gas that is in the gas drive, it is going to be in the air.
But this seems to be poor to the constructors that have planned the shoes that were covered only 100 000 years old.
Gas-condition control will be carried out by a subconduct work that switchs, for external monitoring, as well as a circle circle inside the gas driving.
The smoking device is introduced inside the tube of a diameter of 1 meter, and is pulled forward by the gas flow.
After three full days of travel with speed of 3 meters in second, he provides accurate information on any deformation of metal.
The gas management was designed for work for 50 years without the need for a small restructuring.
The gas circle is performed only through its pressure.
It consists of 200 bars for shipping and 100 bars at arrival.
Five companies joined the efforts to implement the project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which has 51 per cent of the capital.
These are German E.ON and BASF companies (15.5 per cent), the Netherlands Gasunie and the French GDF Suez Group (9 per cent each).
These five companies have established a joint company called the North River, which was mandated to build and exploit gas driving.
His headquarters is in Zuge, Switzerland, where the tax situation is particularly proud.
Then, Gazprom gave the company to the aircraft for twenty-year-old years, with the possibility of extending the whole amount of gas transport.
"The Gazprom will pay for a full amount, independence on the actual amount of gas will be carried out", says Yens Muller.
Gasbuilding was funded by 30 per cent of shareholders and 70 per cent of bank credits.
The overall value of the work is 7.4 million euros for two pipelines.
GDF Suez investment will be about 240 million.
But the mining shareholders are sure that they buy their costs because Gazprom is at its own risk.
The gas leads out of the Baltic Sea in the Amomin on a swimming beach with swimming pool trees.
The intents are 4.5 m higher for the weekly terminal of gas.
The Dutchs measure the pressure, temperature and the specific features of gas before changing it into German gas driving.
From Tuesday last, the terminal receives a million cubic meters every hour.
This will be 3 million per hour, and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine Bronnette
Moleskine, created by the Italian company 15 years ago, will return to a letter.
He has an aroma of availed, hour conducted by a letter on the light of the leg.
Moleskine's block is easy to know about a rectangular black box, a rain, on a white-speed page, like a shooter with time.
However, the book of Moleskine, we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian Mode company in Milan decided to start in sales of design blocks.
Marie Sebergondy, then the company’s adviser, took responsibility for the launch of a new product.
Blocs are inspired by the old manufacture technique, which is milk-based-children's skin used, for example, for shocking.
It is convinced that this type of blocks appreciates the writers and travellers.
"Moleskine brought in line with today's old and forgotten substance, which was cultural for the Avangarist artists to the XX century", said Mary Sebergondy, who since then became a dominant breed in mode.
Successful.
From 2006 to 2010, 25 per cent of sales increased and reached 12.7 million tonnes.
We've been far away from the production of the first years when only 3000 blocks were produced.
Moleskine moved to the border of Italy and exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
The profile of a typical purchaser has been hard because the blocks are equally affected by businessers, students and persons of free professionals.
The purchasers of Moleskine are spatial, have wide views and education.
The small Italian company, who had only 12 staff, now has 100 and two offices: one in Milan, and another in New York.
She distributes its blocks in Fnac bookshops, shops in small cities and has been able to get a wide knowledge.
"We followed the spirit of time and this new requirement in a letter, despite the e-mail appearance," explains Mary Seborgdy.
This characteristic cultural spectrum provides the development of Moleskine; brend recently organized a "Our path", where architects and artists demonstrated their own blocks.
In August, he also launched a leopard box on the case of the film featur in Locarno.
By using their success and cultural aury, Moleskine has differentiated its products that now include skins, hands, tastes and computer skins, including all types of support.
Success that was born: October 2006 Mode was purchased by the SG Capital Europe investment fund, currently Sintegra Capital, which wrote a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the amount of unemployed persons such high?
About 19 per cent of persons with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week of disabled work is started today.
In spite of public welfare policy, started in 2005, the rate of unemployment among persons with disabilities still remains two times above average, namely 19 per cent against 9 per cent for the population in general.
Does it smile?
"No, it emphasizes Eric Blansch, Director-General Adapt, a organization that organizes a week of work for persons with disabilities."
"For 15 years, a significant progress has been made."
"In that time, the share of the unemployed was not 2, but three times more."
"There's still a lot of work."
It should be said that, for disabilities, there are still many obstacles to employment.
Among them, 37 per cent of 50 years older (17 per cent in average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80 per cent of the bacalaur and 2,3 million students in higher education are only 10,000 persons with disabilities.
Finally, a long unemployed unemployment is very distributed, which is 85 per cent for persons with disabilities against 38 per cent in the average.
Unfortunately, these are all the criteria that are very complicated to return to work and which are a problem", says Christine Graapen, Director-General Tremplin, association established in 1992 to help companies to take up disabled employees.
This is some of the obstacles.
It is not necessary to say about the mentality that changes, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS Interpreter on the order of the City showed that the requested managers had a low level of knowledge of disabilities and "represented individuals in colleagues or psychological or mentally invaluable".
The results are private companies with more than 20 workers are still far from the goal of 6 per cent of disabled employees adopted in 1987.
The recent known figures for 2008 are 2.6 per cent.
" We are about 3 percent each year," says Peter Blan, Director-General Agefiph, organization responsible for the collection of taxes from companies that do not comply with this law.
Results: The number of “budgetary” organizations, as well as the amounts paid, has decreased from 590,000 to 46 000 organizations (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"Jack 2005, which has led to tax, created a strong pressure on the company, explains Peter Blan."
"But this improvement also reflects the growth of consciousness, in particular on large enterprises."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of the organizations with the number of employees from 20 to 49 are disabled employees against 82 per cent, with the number of employees from 100 to 199.
Azar: "What a happiness."
Before fighting with the Blue night on Tuesday (2045) Ed Azar and Jorge Leckens did not cover the satisfaction they received from this friend's match.
We won't come before saying that there was a secret conspiration among them, but the picture is symbolic.
Situated close to the Aran Stade de France, Jorge Leckens and Eden Azar died.
Five months later, after the exit of his attacker in the shop against Turkey, the Belgian trainer can only honor it.
"I'm very pleased with Eden, his movement, and with the fact that he's a Belgian."
"I want to go further," believes Lill player.
What is the contrary of his achievements in the club and in the gateway, it is justified.
"I'm finding a round year in Lila, and Belgium isn't there."
"I've got to spend the shoes."
The rest of the stock, in the warning of this shop with France, in the game against Romania on Tuesday night, Azar came to San Deny to end up.
Don't forget, however, and the concept of satisfaction.
He supported the Blues from the age of seven and winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I always supported them, he confirms.
This also increases the particular nature of this match.
And especially what the mother (Djishi), Johan (Kabe) and Adile (Rami) are on the other side," he remembers.
"We're on our ways."
"There's a chance to play against them is a clean happiness."
Leckens welcomely recalled the "goodness."
"God" to play in a "speak match."
"God" also claim as a neighbor, that France has become a very high-level team" over the whole year after the trauma in Nazna.
"Loran Blan was like a shooting shooting, he smile.
Now when Belgium is going to pass the next Euro, the technological Sports will fly in one flight with the Blue Guide... in Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians will grow," he stressed.
"We're struggling, amazing games, they're hungry."
"You're convinced in the future shops, including this against France."
Portugal is very certain in itself
Portugal, Paul Bent, begins his responsible shop against Bosnia (22.00 p.m) in that Friday in Lisbon with great optimism.
The two teams seemed to have lost their reality.
"In the end of these 90 minutes, we're a happy team and that the most important, happy country."
Paul Bent has already seen himself in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt that the College, whose rule is from September 2010, is qualified for Europe 2012.
Portugal in 90 minutes of happiness.
But there's a piece to play, and Bosnie who has to win.
As a result of 0-0 in Friday, Zenja's idol is clear that the game has not been completed.
Although Portugal has finished more than a hour, she could not achieve the goal that would relax her.
"This is a good result, but is a certain risk."
But, at its slight stadium de la Luz in Lisbon, the portugues are convinced that they will go, at the eye of the public that must be shocked, even though the match will be very pressed," said optimisticly, but raised Bent.
"We are waiting for a very pressing match, but we are convinced that we can win, " said a 42-year-old Portuguese trainer.
"We still have 50 per cent of chances for Europe in 2012," discussed the Prime Minister Carlush Cairosh.
None in Friday requires the winning of portugalians.
No one could make the bosoms.
"This is a good result, however, some risks, - regrets Bent.
"We will play against the teams with many technical dignities and players whose personal dignity is, " he added.
As already in Zenja, portugalians are going to show maximum pressure on the bosniers since the beginning, "not give them time to think".
Good idea, only this time she'd be realistic.
