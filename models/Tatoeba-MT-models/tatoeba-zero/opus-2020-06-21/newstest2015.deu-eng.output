Resignation of the very American idea of the work rights as human rights
The Congress Members Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a legislative proposal to enable the organization of workers as citizens.
"Comme workers die, the Mediterranean jobs also died," said Ellison, a democracy from Minnesota and the Chairman of the Progressive Caucus in the Congress.
This is why I am proud of John Lewis' law on employees.
This detrimental law provides workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination because of the organization of workers as in other forms of discrimination - and stops such anti-operational forces.
The complement of the national Labour Law in order to create a possibility for discrimination to organize a cooperative association in order to complain the justice before a civil court, and to obtain harm or punishment, is an initiative that is sensitive and necessary.
But with security it is no radical initiative - in any case, not according to American standards.
In fact, it is the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors proposed in their legislation, the link back to a very American idea.
Despite the retreats of the workshops in the past years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries in the whole country - the United States have encouraged one world to recognize, enlarge, and maintain labour rights.
There was a time for millions of Americans to remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of press and the law of association.
When the United States established after the Second World War of Japan, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his stage encouraged the country to adopt a Constitution to ensure that the military autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full consciousness of the fact that workers and their workshops had a role in creating a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognized that "the rights of workers are guaranteed for association and common negotiations and trade."
When the United States decided after the Second World War of Germany, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his stage stripped the Germans to write a Constitution that would ensure that the Fascism Adolf Hitler would replace a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers should organize, and their voice should be in the new nation, the Germans set a clause that explicitly recommended: "The right to establish associations to ensure the working and economic conditions and to improve each individual and every professional or contract.
Agreements restricting or aiming to deteriorate this right are null and unnecessary; these measures are unlawful.
When the previous Prime Lady Eleanor Roosevelt accompanied the Chairmanship on the International Commission on Human Rights, which was designed by the General Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement in 1948, Roosevelt added a guarantee that "all of them has the right to form workers for protection of his interests or to participate in them".
Since generations, Americans accept the fundamental press that work rights are human rights.
When the other countries are talking about how they could form civil and democratic societies, the Americans explained that the right to establish a community - and that this cooperation should then be protected by collective negotiations as equal partners with companies and government institutions.
After these rights in the United States, it is really wise to re-eye the American idea, thus the working population must have the right to agree and to hear in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said,
The story is a wonderful master.
Now everyone knows that the movement of workers did not limit the strength of the nation but increased.
The increase in the standard of life of millions of people has made a market for the industry in wonderful way and increased the whole country at unpredictable production level.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but the story keeps them.
The story remembers, and we should do that too.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights and the enlargement of the protection of citizens' rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of employees.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renewed the ideas that the United States have made great in the past and resolved the promise of democracy.
The Judge stops temporary law that all dismissing clinics in Louisiana could prevent the closure
On Sunday, a U.S. adviser stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana, said by the applicant that it would probably lead to the closure of all five delaying clinics of the State.
This measure, which was taken by Bobby Jindal, the Governor of Louisiana, was taken into force in June and was intended to enter into force on 1st seventh, would force doctors to purchase their practices in a hospital home within a radius of 30 miles.
However, the decision of the judge means that the doctors can continuously carry out legal delays while calling for such a law.
"The applicants can continue to develop legislation while trying to achieve these rights," wrote the Federal Director John deGravelles in his judgment.
A hearing for the Judiciary will be established within a month to make a decision more durable for the law.
The decision that recently in a number of judges against similar measures had been welcomed and said that doctors had so much more time to obtain hospital education rights.
"The current decision means that women in Louisiana have been taken a decreased law which would like to take their health and rights to them," said Nancy Northup, President and Chairman of the Centre for Reproduction Rights, which had claimed on behalf of three of the five clinics of the State to hold the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also tried to the doctors from the two clinics that were not connected to the complaint and also requested instruction rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 States who have adopted similar laws, which recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi for non-constitution.
The keys of a texture law, which had struck the majority of the clinics left in the State, were stopped on Friday by a federal director.
The American Medical Association and the American College of Ostritrians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, agree that the right of instruction of doctors requires unnecessary restrictions.
Delayers agree that the measures to protect women's health, although some welcomed the effects of closure of clinics.
Only one physician who performs delays in Louisiana has patients' ability to share the center of reproduction rights.
If all the other doctors in the State are obliged to carry out any delays, this doctor would not carry out the operation with fear of his security, said the group.
In their argument against the court, representatives of the State of Louisiana said that no doctors would be punished for the implementation of delays while their applications were still dependent on patients' rights.
Delayed diagnoses and lack of access to the best treatment opportunities to lead higher mortal rates through iron tock cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have set a video home online for her mother, which was shocked in the 2007 icestock cancer.
For women in rural areas, Australia is a higher risk to die to egg cancer than for women in towns.
For researchers analyzed the medical data from more than 1100 Australians in which 2005 was identified, and found that only 25% of the years after diagnosis were still alive.
The research leader Susan Jordan, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institutes, said that for those living in rural and distant regions, the death risk during the study was up to 20% higher than those in urban areas.
CLEINE STUDY: New medicines may delay lungs and icestock cancer
The researchers investigated the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman at the diagnosis, the type of icestock cancer, the pre-related diseases and the social and economic status also affects the survival opportunities.
For older women and those whose cancer at the time of diagnosis had continued, the survival rate was lower.
For those who lived in rural and distant regions of the State, the mortality risk during the study was up to 20% higher than those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women died outside the city with higher probability of icestock cancer, Dr. Jordan caused a late diagnosis and the lack of access to the best treatment centres as possible.
"This disease will be treated most of the ginotechnological stages, and these are mostly to find in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedical services in order to resolve something, it suggested that, as possible, strengthening the service of drought doctors to give specialists the opportunity to give women close to their home, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that the study, independently from the geographical status, was a bad long-term survival rate in women in the iron tock cancer and stressed the need for better treatment and precaution strategies.
The study financed by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years of the gold coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of irontock cancer.
Garden centres deplore swimming houseowner payments
The decline, together with a increased sense of the number of householders under 35 years, could lead to the loss of ten thousands of pounds per year when the current young consumers under a study of the HTA, as reported in the Financial Times, reaching the "Charnal Group for Garten Products".
The report indicates that a average of 55% of the liabilities that employ people with their own homes for their gardens.
The increase in people living in high urbanized areas without gardens, the popular procedure, the pre-parks of parks, and the sharp garden size are other factors that threaten the sector, which is estimated to be implemented annually in the sale of 5 billion £.
In London, where the share of householders from 61 to 43 per cent over a period of six years has been decreased, the lower costs for garden products are indicated per budget.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society pointed out that residences to midnight or small gardens do not mean that people can not be planted.
Guy Barter, Chief Gardens Adviser for RHS said: "Container Customers, for example, are very popular with meats because they can take their plants with a shopping."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age of the garden trade" because of the increased domestic numbers and economic well-being from the late 1980s to the midst of the 1990s.
He also prognosed for this year a improved market situation because of the best weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.

Police Chief of Magalif of Corruption
On Friday, the applicants presented the office of Mallorca's State lawyer for pressing by police and employees of the city of Calviá.
The chief of the police of Calviá on the Ferien Island Mallorca was arrested after corruptions of business lawyers and Barbesitzers in the favorite Binge drinking hotspot Magaluf.

"It's no longer about money, it's about surviving," said one of the business offices to the Court.
Let our base of life out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
In this summer, Magaluf made a viral video of YouTube international slaughter lines, in which a 18-year-old British tourist was shown, who completed 24 men during a superturn Fellatio.

The first spring morning with swimming and stirming weather conditions affects flights from the airport Adelaide
The FRUHLING has caused an winter surprising, with heavy shooting and strong wind, the flights of the Adelaide airport.
On night until 21.00 p.m, more than 5 mm rains flew into the city, after 6,6mm, which were already slowing to Sunday night.
The last shock was the result of a series of short-storm shoes, including a guest that began short before 20 hours and cared for almost 4mm shocks in about 10 minutes.
After the winter last week for a premature dose, the temperatures in the city returned to a maximum of only 15.8°C at Monday.
The bad weather conditions probably have led to the late load of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The aircraft had to be taken short after 19.30 hours, but was taken by a shock wind - a slow change of wind speed or direction through a short distance - and had to start.
Winds at this time reached about 50 km/h on the ground on the Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the aircraft had to be started at a second country flight, finally at about 20.40 p.m.
The delay resulted in the late delay of some other flights, including a Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
A maximum temperature of 16°C is prescribed on Thursday, with potential shoes.
Matthies means: Maximum time to large networks
In view of the galopious technical progress that threatens our affordable home in high-tech centres, our colonist Bernd Matthies comforts with a super confidenced electronic access.
While I write this here, my eyes fall on the sculpture cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I think, "Boah, how back is that?
But in that way, it was a surprise: if the cable wasn't, in recent times all the ears would be slowless to the house, and that would be significantly more back.
Unless it is applicable to the ekeltronic (ekeltronic)?
No, Tipp errorr: electronic) the rule that the world's newness of today's electric shooting is buyed - healed.
And, for example, who has a roaring shop today in the living room, who only tells him that he rejects the TV fundamentally.
Why are these discussions?
Because the Android of the Ifa at the function tour in this week brings us back our absolute incompetence in electronic issues.
The Laie, who was blindly dominated by the previous washing machine and CD players, does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are distributed with an unfair expert talk before him: "Connected Home, Weatherable, Health Care and Urban Technologies" is the press site.
Yeah, are you all right?
What should you talk to people who are obviously voluntary to extend such a quarter?
On the other hand, there are some 20 years of maintenance that we are going to connect our house.
To make the Joghurt himself resigned, so that the burning newspaper in the holiday reports us to the maledives that it burns grade in the work room.
And it wouldn't be wonderful if we're from the office from the air conditioning at our rapid arrival ...?
Yes, however, this provides a climate arrangement.
But a dream will first be true: We have our arm offering, you say "Saugen" - and go home to the staircase bottle.
Ire.
Everything works on nothing more than a revolution: "The borders between white and brain goods are disappeared," a industrial skiller, you can connect the wash machine with a head listener, the dampgarer sends the weather report and the data book shows how long the pizza is still needed in the backup, but nothing uses because we are in the stage.
In the daily practice we also know: If a new device is really urged to use, the battery is empty.
Another reason is that the sculpture cable on the phone will also survive the next functional samples.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the regions near the Gazastrephen returned to schools on Monday after they spent the summer in air protection spaces, while the Raketen and Morder Committee on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, and the schools remained closed to Gaza, while the area of the fighters was recovered.
The school launch took a feeling of joy and expectation, but the signs of the battle are still fresh.
In the Southern city of Ashdod, workers of the "Pashosh" garden, who was taken by a rat, before meeting the students of granat drivers from the walls and walls.
"We have a little fear, but we're surprised," said Ronit Bart, a inhabitants in Kibbutz Saad and there's English teacher.
Many children from our area need back to a rutin.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it feels a little funny to go back to school.
"These were difficult times, and we didn't go out of the house," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the border of Gaza to provide support.
Until the war last week, thousands of people who lived in the borders like Saad remained in their homes, or left their homes to get away from Gaza and get out of the smoking and murderer fire.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a community near the borders of Gaza, where a four-year-old young man was killed by a Palestinian murderer, still shocked with the back.
The Ministry of Education shared some twelve families have not yet been returned.
Your children were promptly taught in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu visited a school in Sderot, a border city in Gaza, which is difficult for the Palestinian committee.
He called the children to learn a lot and said, "We will ensure that they get knowledge and provide security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on the last Sunday to an unexpected armed stage.
The weapons were careful for an immediate end of the battle; however, important problems remained unsolved, as the demand for the Hamas after the resurrection of the Israeli-Egyptic blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel requires a disarmament of the Hamas and the transfer of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the battle.
A new indirect conversation will be expected to be started in Egypt in this month.
In the war, more than 2.100 Palestinians were killed, three four of them civilians, and at least 494 children according to the estimates of Palestinian and the United Nations.
Israel shall adopt these information and estimate that at least half of the murderers are fighters, however, there was no concrete investment for these information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza slaughtered 4.591 rakes and grains during the battle against Israeli cities, most of the south of the country.
During the course, Israeli army carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of households in the Gaza area and about 250,000 people seek refugees in more than 100 UN schools, which were converted into provisional protection spaces.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the protection spaces and delay fights, educational authorities moved to the beginning of the school year.
"I hope that the school is soon open to learn, as well as the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who is presently living in a school in Gaza City.
After choosing in Sachsen: CD-Vize Strobl provides NPD prohibition procedures
In view of the losses of the NPD in Sachsen, the CD-Bounds Vice Thomas Strobl was expressed before the Federal Constitution Court.
Berlin - According to the CD-Budget Thomas Strobl, NPD should end up before the Constitution of the Federal Constitution.
"The NPD is worse than the last time," Strobl, who is also the head of the CDU in Baden-Württemberg, is "Leipziger People's Zeit".
This is a joyful development in the right direction and development, which can lead me to the result that the NPDs are politically fighting and not against the Constitution.
The NPD was totally shocked on Sunday at the fifth percentage rate.
A first start of the prohibition of the extreme law party was denied in 2003, since the Constitutional Protection had also been in the NPD spectrums.
In December 2013, after long preparation, the Federal Council introduced a new request in Karlsslaughter.
The Federal Government and the Federal Day are not closed.
Harbourg: Zelte for new refugees
On the New Countries, refugees are now undergoing in villages.
The centre of first rescue for refugees in Harbourg places out of all neighborhoods.
Now the Internal Authority has left three cells of the Red Cross.
The district policyers have been informed recently - they are little slowly encouraging.
"This Hauruck action continues to preserve citizens and does not give the district policy a opportunity to integrate constructively on the human submission of refugees", says Britta Herrmann, President of the Green Group in the Harbour Administrative Assembly.
Your party requests that the management of Harbourg currently provides unnecessary households for sublime.
96 Refugees may be carried into the three cells.
The reason for the completion of the first record is the establishment of demanders - and the fact that the authorities are not able to provide sufficient places in follow-up institutions.
Many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months.
The house prices have experienced the strongest winter growth in seven years, showing a broader observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for own homes in the Australian capital increased to 1,1% in August, so the RP data from Monday.
This increase is the total increase in June, July and August at 4,2%, the largest increase in winter months since 2007.
Annual price increase was 10.9%, more than doubles than the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but increases were not distributed equally over the country.
The research leader of RP Data, Tim Lawless, shared Sydney and Melbourne's two-divided markets.
The numbers of RP data indicate that the home prices in Sydney in the past year increased by 16.1% in Melbourne, however, at 11,7%.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices in average increased by 5 and 6%.
At the other end of the scale Canberra, which has been hard taken by the inputs of State expenditures, and where prices in the year only increased by 1.4 per cent.
Mr Lawless continued to observe the increase in the real estate for sale for the next months.
"If you consider the high rate of the auction prices, a generally fast sale rate and the low rate of interest costs, it is probably likely that the home prices will continue to be further increased in the next three months," he said.
In an opinion to the New Press, he opposes the statements of the manager Peer Medau and confirms the "come a fieldherr".
The style of high school is not this, it is in the communication.
If the family Medau is already "Mite June is urged to be informed about the responsibilities of the high school.
The answer that the plans have been known only in July is definitely wrong," says Pötzl.
At the same time, he pointed out that the plans are not "preferences or decisions", however, "preferences".
Anyway, the necessary development of the small road to close is less dramatic than the Medaus is feared.
From a nine meter wide road and it is not the speech.
It takes about 5,50 meters from the current position, which is a metro wide than ever,” says Potzl.
The argument of the Medau providers that their free and sweet parking areas in the future will not be used only by students of high schools, but also not to apply.
The parking will not even be parked because it is possible to solve intelligence with other public parks.
Think of the people
The children's crippe Bergwechtel, which is on the floor, and which would lead the parking to the parking, would be "not affected".
Moreover, he says: "There is not only about children's cripp, but also about the people in the income to Friedrich Stribs and the 800 students of the nearby real school.
It is therefore much more than the particular interests of Mr Medau", says Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the child's child grippe, with the development of the road, would be right to "the small-determined fleets of Coburg," is "to be able to decide the reader himself".
At the beginning of October, Pötzl wants to inform the city directions of high school development until 2020, together with the State Bauamt Bamberg, "and speak to the importance of the new resolution in this context."
Peer Medau has informed the parents of the children's crip about the high school plans.
This will lead the passenger to the new Parkdeck, not as far as over the campus and the Friedrich-Streib routes, but through the Medau margin.
Thus the small street should be built on about one kilometer long two-year lengths.
According to the higher calculations of the Medaus, the transport in the park of closs hohenfels would decrease this.
From about 2000 vehicles every day the speech is.
From the sides of the city, they did not want to be expressed to the project.
Glandorf returns from handball national team
Holger Glandorf is no longer playing for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old age of the federalist SG Flensburg dog was mainly addressing health problems for this decision.

His ideas and approaches have encouraging me as they will also be able to overcome my long-year-old players and my followers.
But for my club, I also want to be healthy in the coming years, so that there are longer regeneration rates that do not allow the current double charge.
The left country had to be afraid after a pheren infection in 2012.
Because of the difficulties of aching, he had allowed himself to treat teams of the German Handball Connect (DHB) with a cortison shock that later had solved a strong disappearance.
An emergency operation and two other invasions were followed.
Then, Glandorf had announced a complaint against the manageart, the interference ended with a comparison.
Twelve years Professional and 11 years National Humanity Carriages do not pass into any body.
I have some healthy buildings that I can't ignore anymore.
After the three infected foot operations in 2012 in short distances, I never got my blood pressure right into the griff.
There are some other disadvantaged complaints.
Soon at the beginning of the year, I noticed that I control my head, but I can't lie my body," Glandorf, in the interview, explained the Magazine "Handball Time".
For a computation, he would only be prepared in the absolute emergency.
"I'm always ready to talk to all strikes," the two-fold family parents explained to the machine.
However, I can tell the years in which I can play a handball.
I have also to say that after my long hospital residence in 2012, I have also become very modest about my health.
After my career, I would like to go at least a few times.
Besides the WM title 2007 and the winning of the Champions League 2014, he took 2008 (HSG Northhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo) the EHF Pocal.
In 2012, he was also safe with Flensburg to the European Pocalizeer Pokal.

Unfortunately, it was not so many participants as the event was expected, something probably was on the bad weather prognoses and on the morning rain.
"We're seeing again in 2015 when we're waiting for a beautiful weather on August 30, or for another weekend," the rail drivers, however, talked to return to Munsterland, and the events planned a new reservation.
Constantine Wecker's unpleasant honest memories
It's actually more philosophical witness than biography, what has brought Constantin Wecker, lingermakers, pathists, political activists, ex-hotels, on 287 pages.
Not chronological, but more thinking feeds for thinking feeds, the munchers born on June 1th, 1947 had not written his memories, each chapter referred to by a suitable song text.
And he is unreasonable: from the Onania as a gymn Asian to the loading steel and drug consumption he does not allow human weaknesses.
Also, to show how he has learned tolerance with his fellow believers.
Width rooms are also distracted, but there are more meanings: love, soul, ego, his now, spiritity - all that he is trying to go on the ground, very philosophy, but also very personally.
And he also explains his patifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and also how it has not only expressed music (the operator has become a soul and rock music), but also his prison residence.
Last time the Lebemann Constantine Wecker also closed to the asketic mosk, which is "subtration" as he says, "If you leave all the unnecessary."
Among all the high-spot views, however, there are slow-to-scale to earth: about swifts in a GI frequencised local or a swimming car where it was frontally viewed by a tree.
He's also unreasonable.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me into the arm.
He never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of the seven children of a Yamaikaian immigrant family in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry tried for a commodity, Rudy's Rare Records, which was partly based on a imaginative conversation with his father and was found on the radio series 4.
The sound track is a mixture of Reggae and Rap, with living melodies.
But Henry had to work for some difficult childhood.
He visited therapies "wealth" after his mother's death, and Henry is desperately about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to meet him.
They never saw his face, just listening to his voice, "On with the snake.
Leave your sister in calm.
Move on!
I want to look at Cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were grown up when I was a child - went with him in the skin and talked about things such as the form of the beerglas or the beauty of a cricket.
I never had such a conversation with him.
A majority of my life he was this serious guy in the edge that reads the newspaper.
In the meantime, Henry opened a snake in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at the time of his father, he won a view of how life would be for him.
It's now something lighter, but they're dark, weird, deep steady labyrinthe with flaming and fuming and much rush.
My father was just in the cart and then slowly heard him how to sing, because he was able to smell the skin from himself.
When I went out there, I was clear that he had done the year to bring the food to the table, and my respect was greater to him.
However, Henry was a child without his parents’s loved witnesses.
My dad never burned me, he never said "I love you."
Before my mother went badly against the end of her life, we're trying to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
By his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he could share the love he missed as a child.
Can you stop with the "I love you"?
Shut up to smell me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
It is still pleased with French whom he was married 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetesian.
That took place with her death.
So when I was very overwhelming and showing symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You must be radical.
So I moved this fatnessing and had to do a drastic diet to turn the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's strict.
No one's enjoying cards.
Henry's career change may be shown in his elegant, short-cut bar.
Since he was promised by the critics for his othlello, he was closed by the theatre.
It followed the committee of the irruptions, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is another experience than the Sitcoms and Communities who have filled its jobs.
He started with only 16 years of age when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on the bridge when he inspired people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the midst of the seventy years. "I was for a very long time the only black immitator/Comedian in the television."
He learned in professionals.
I had to grow up not only before the eyes of the public but also learn from 1975 to 1985 how I could become an effective Witze account machine while I was a star through the television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had the right of the Black and White Minsterl Show, a light-leavened entrepreneurship program, where the people "smile" were "smiling", Henry took his comdy there over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I wanted something that would never happen, but I don't think I did it.
It was an extraordinary position for me, but I worked on ricane projects with and learned how to do with a great public.
But this "from years-preceding light sample of British television" was also a "great black parodie."
By the introduction of figures that the British black culture was shocked as well as celebrated, Henry worked in the eighth to an alternative comdy circle.
The first series of Lenny Henry Show went to sending 1984, and in the nineteenths he was known as the kitchen Chef Gareth Blacklock in the Comedyseries Chief!
Advertising, documentarfilms, TV series and film rollers predicted his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008, he thought: "What do you as the next, Len, because it feels all like you bring the time rum or a little at the place."
Then a documentary for radio 4 with the title What's So Great About ...?
The first result turned around Shakespeare.
On Shakespeare, I was regularly allergic.
I never had learned something right about him in the school, and I was able to hold him in front of a domain of the middle class, white in electrical powder and a carbon head before it.
So I had great fear of it.
All we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try it once.
Don't make it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take a few words in the mouth, and then you will understand why we all love the Shakespeares.
Henry took 20 lines from Othlello's last talk for the documentarch film and he was shocked.
I felt that I could do it.
It was almost like someone would finally put me the head right.
"It's why it's a serious thing, take them serious, learn your text, search a little.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They looked like to wait for a car accident, and that didn't happen.
And soon he came to the committee of the banners.
Soon I was at the National Theater, and I couldn't believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you changed."
There was a technical error, and Henry felt instinct that he should hold the public.
"A little voice said to me, "You're gonna have to overcome 10 minutes, while they're reparing the computer."
Instead, the chief declared that the idea continued when the problem was resolved.
I went from the cup and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for it.
I can leave someone else.
"You play in a theatre, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences on Duchess Theatre
The text to learn for Fences was right.
Panic is very good, that strengthens the blessings.
It's also good, so it's like a great shield of gods that say to me, "This is your determination."
He says this, of course, with a DONNERNING voice.
So I'm staying there.
I really love that.
I like it to be in a sample room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation has been overwhelming by humor-free disorders, while he still empits people again.
I have decided to do no stand-up comedy because I find that this kind of immediate satisfaction of a room full of foreigners is dangerous.
If you're always looking for this, you're going to walk before a wall.
Sometimes I live in the Apollo when I enjoy it, but the whole thing isn't like me so much before.
I ask him if he's going to make a standup commodity again.
The joy I have in a room with a government that helps it to form a start, a medium and the end of a trip - I don't think I want to resign it again.
Is this his new incarnation here?
I think.
I'm a player.
It's fun.
You're always talking about a story, and that's great.
I love the stories.
People love the stories.
Huthi-rebelles block streets in Jemens Hauptstadt
In the conflict between shytic Huthi rebels and the Jemenitic government, Huthis called to civilly unrespectful in the capital city of Sanaa.
Huthi-leaders had been located on Monday central streets in Sanaa, said a speaker of the Huthi-Partei "Ansar God".
It has also been blocked to Parliament.
Jemenitic media reports of a chaos of transport in the capital city.
According to the online output of the Yemen Post newspaper, Huthi Leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi had called on Tuesday on the measures.
Huthi threatened by the blatte with a further sculption of the conflict, it should not be satisfied with its requirements.
The scytical Huthis fights for more independence from the sunnitic ruling Jemen and calls for the government's return.
The population of Huthi has been raised by the Jemenic capital for just two weeks.
Rund 30,000 rebells have built Protest Layers on the large road of Sanaa.
In the round, it's always coming back to battle with the Jemenic army.
Kenia registers Beamtes to develop "Gesterned"
Kenya has thus started to register all State officials biometricly to remove "great-building" from the content lists of the government.
Workers who do not register in the next two weeks would not be paid anymore, as a government communication.
The Government condemns that thousands of people are also received after their decision of the public service and of the maintenance payments.
President Uhuru Kenyatta agreed to fight corruption in the public service at its 2013 office.
In a test at the beginning of this year, at least $1 million (700,000 £) per month, on payments for "greated" and by other misleading financial practices.
The government claims that detentors are still paid on accounts after a person died or leaves the public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports for the BBC from the main city of Nairobi.
All officers must now appear in the next two weeks at identification centres to ensure that their data on the biometric registers were included in a government report.
All those who did not do this without a credible excuse from the content list continued the communication.
"But this action is essentially involved in rationalization of the public service by determined the actual number of officials and the content list on two government levels, so the "greaters" will be eliminated," said Anne Waigru, the Secretariat of Cabinet in the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The scandal about the artist Helge Achenbach is negotiated first time before the court on 11 November.
Five heritage from Berthold Albrecht, son of the Aldi Greens Theo Albrecht, requested in a civil process in the Düsseldorfer Landgericht 19,4 million euros of Achenbach and two of its companies that are insolvent procedures.
This shared a court speaker on Monday.
The record indicates that Achenbach has affected the purchase of artworks and older names and Berthold Albrecht has calculated higher than the actually paid purchase prices.
The arranged provision should also be higher.
Achenbach has purchased 121 million euro values for albrecht.
Childs need roots and legs
44 years old, he was in school service, 23 of which.
From that time, Manfred Judgers knows many standing Petershauser and colbachers from their time as a student.
His methods sometimes were unconventional, but they were always able to see the people in the school.
The Sneehead is the most famous mountain of the Riesenberg.
Manfred Judger loves the motive with the motive from his home.
Judges were born in 1930 in Trautenau/Nordbows, today Trutnov.
Soon with 14, he was interested after four years of high school for teachers.
A year later, the Southern Germans were adjusted.
In half an hour, the family had to leave her house.
After a few months in a camp in 1946, we went to Bayern - in the boat ship.
Thus, the judge moved to the top-Fennish Senkendorf.
The training was placed in Bamberg.
Manfred Judges had six times a week to the next train station, with the train to Bamberg, where 3 miles (3 km) to school through the whole city and at the end.
After two months, Manfred Judges in a Red Cross heim in Bamberg took a sleeping opportunities: together with up to 15 colleagues in a bed hall.
In 1951, he made the first and 1954 after three years of educational officers the second state review.
Since the illness had no free teachers for him, he was on top bairs and came to the school in Collbach on November 1st, 1954.
The "Freulein Room" was his first "service" in the school house.
In 1958, he was in the new-building teacher house next to the school a three-room service.
This house purchased Manfred Courter 1980 after the school was dissolved in Collbach in 1968.
To date, there were three classes in Collbach in the school group Petershausen-Collbach and in Petershausen five.
Since the school year 1968/69, these were together in Petershausen in the present Council House.
When the Inderdorf School Association was founded, the primary school remained in place.
In order to get back to the school now smaller, the then rector Georg Sigl changed to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Judges became his followers.
But Peter's house was breathed, and so the children and their teachers were able to relate to the today's construction that was extended by the Courts of Pension since September 1982.
Manfred Courter is the incomplete movement of the former citizensman Ludwig dentz, who made further workplaces on common costs and in the extension of 1997, although it was not subsidiable to the directives for school manufacturers.
"The Devil of Citizens was very grateful," the judge recalls.
In his whole career, Manfred Judger never forgot the account of a government-master who had responded to a report on law and justice: "It should never forget the love." Manfred Judger put on what he had heard as a young teacher.
"It must be told the children twice: roots and legs," says the 84-year-old boys today.
And he had to learn, "This doesn't always happen." If he only means his students or exactly his six children, it's not quite clear.
In any case, judges were sometimes unconventional.
When students tried, they did not find him a criminal work and were not distributed to posture.
At the cost of the community, judges had made two pairs of box hands and left the two contractors to face each other, even if it had to give it a wheel.
In the work of the school, judges joined as a rector a good relationship with the former Master Ludwig Götz (CSU).
This moved to the participating judges after the pension of 1996 to claim at least as last on the CSU list for the Council of Communities.
But the judge was chosen on six places and the CSU was involved.
180 km in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 drivers in the curk of Bad Salzhausen and shoots
If Radler makes its tour in Bad Salzhauses or shotten shoten, it's not special.
On Friday, however, only the number of rasters were impressioned: the 700 participants of the hr4-radio tour together accompanied a breakfast in the lower park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under free heaven in the Scoteburg Park.
Under the Motto "Radels and feasts on new discovery ways between Nidda and Kinzig" the participants took place on Thursday at Bad Vilbel and there was a concert of Van Baker & Band.
On Friday, it was serious: the Radler took the first step, 60 kilometers through Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and continued to attack.
In Bad Salzhausen, the Sports of the Citizen Meeter Hans-Peter Seum, who was launched in Bad Vilbel, were welcomed by the leader of Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
For the refrigeration of body and spirit, all were prepared to good things: the agriculture girls from Ranstadt and the Nieder-Mock City had backed 85 Blech apple, sweetchen, strike and coffee swimming swimming powders.
"Solche kitchen can return only to land girls," a participant from Aulendiebach lovered, while he ordered another piece.
A cold refrigeration could be made at the level of the Turn Convention of Geese-Nidda.
The "Duo Bravo" supported visitors with known melodies from operates and musicals and rejoiced applause.
The beautiful environment of the park was effectively comfortable.
In addition, one of his partners was a masses of head mass: "What he has winned, finally he has reaffirmed a bicycle chain that has already been cut. "
In this way, the citizensmans and the managers were still working: they were interviewed at the breakfast before the reporter Rainer Janke's drinking house and used the opportunity to purchase in the Bad Salzhausen radio.
Promotion Chief Tobias Hagen, since the first hr4-radio of 2004 as a tourist leader, could also be able to spend a short time, but he was able to do with the technology in place.
His pickup trick, in which he wrote through three phones and a band with his employees and the 15-bottle motor radstaff of the police Hessen, had also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants are from the Rhein-Main territory," he said, "but also from shoes or Fulda, from lauterbach or to Taunis, and even from many cities in Westfalen, raids have been shocked.
The number of participants shall be a few of the overnight capacity available.
In category I the participants are undertaken in Hotels, in category II in collections.
From the course, the Radler had a good impression when they turned back after a half hours: "Thos!"
"It was beautiful in Bad Salzhausen!" they wined.
After the arrival in the shoot, the group was able to set a short salesspause.
But on the evening, the radlers were requested in the idyllic Alteburg Park.
Under the region of the Scottener Society for Tourism and City Marketing (GTS) the park had received a nice celebration environment and, of course, had been prepared for leckerees, about flaming cubes with well-friendly frozen fever.
Master Susanne Schaab, GTS business manager Markus Hosfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his function as a member of the ADAC Hessen shows welcomed the visitors.
The three were apparently pleased about the "willing operations in shoots".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance bubbles.
The opportunity to smooth movement under the free sky was slowly used, despite the sportive confirmation on the board.
Among the guests, growing citizens, which were made by the good smiling as well as the great crowd of the rail drivers.
On the second day, the stations Birstein, Weatherbach and Bad Orb, were included in a concert with the trainwalkers - on the program.
Last night, after 180 kilometers of Radeln, the sportors returned to Bad Vilbel.
twenty-third Turkish police for "conspiration" against the government
The total of 33 police officers in Turkey, due to the suspicion of the "conspiration against the government", reported local media agencies.
The police authorities did not comment immediately.
Under the prisoners, 14 high-range police officers, reports the Honour Dayly News.
Some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government employees, including four government ministers in December last.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested because they might have founded a organized criminal association and accompanied telephone numbers.
The Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan, who was then Prime Minister, described its action as part of the activities identified by the Islamic church fethula voles against him and other people in power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost all in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally a important day for families, and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents brought the Prime Minister Arseni Jazenjuk his daughter in the school.
There he was waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened that he had decided to defend the country for future generations:
The September Festivals were not held in each school.
The heaven is not peaceful over all over the Ukrainian.
We need to fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian citizenship, must fight for a peaceful heaven.
Aleksan Pastukhow, school head of the school in Slawjansk, who visits Japan’s daughter, spoke about Russian.
We hope that peace will end up here and that the children will receive a education that will be useful for them in further life.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with the children's guarded hairs, the ballons keep in the hands and give their teachers flowers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director that she needs.
It applies with a proud sleeve from the bank world, the media management and the internal circle of the Tory Party.
And she has his own front.
Their careers began to change Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was headquarters of the Financial Times for seven years and came back when the top posts of the mother company Pearson went to a young man colleague.
Your discharge was almost 1 million £.
It is also solid for her political rhinking.
She was recommended by Lord Browne, the previous President of BP, when she searched for more private knowledge in Whitehall: she was as an advisor of the cabinet.
Your husband is a former Tory Council member.
Soon in May, I described the task of the Chairman with a forgiving cup.
It is not only the BBC as a huge and complex unit in the heart of the public life, but there is also a internal paradox in its structure.
The confidence works in two directions: inside the first garden of the BBC's own management hire, but also outside as a voice of public concern and dishes when things are wrong.
This provides for a almost untenable Duopol demanding complete reform.
But what new chairman would be risking to happen, to struggle, and to join a institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynamic, while he may bring himself to his job.
It's a difficult task.
And as it wouldn't be enough, there are still many interests in seeing the BBC reducing - obtaining power, money and status.
While competitiveness is closer and new technologies are threatened by older, attractive security, the ongoing negotiations of licensing costs for BBC is associated with special risks.
For the reasonable amount of 145.50 £ per year, the British public is buying in the world's most powerful media company.
The BBC tells a good story: she says that it reaches 96% of all households and it is only 40 Pence per day.
And apparently the BBC will grow up to the top level: 53% they support today, compared to 31% for 10 years ago.
The View and use habits for BBC have changed: I receive today's news lines on my phone and see packed programs later on my iPlayer.
But she remains a very loved and attractive institution.
She needs a beauty President - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says that the delaying Twitter was not authorized
A tweet from the official user account of the Republic of Texas, Rick Perry, took a decreasing comment on the democratic government adviser, which is at the center of a criminal accusement against him because of the abuse of the officer.
The Twitter was later removed and replaced by another by Perry's user account, which delays the previous.
A tweet from my account is sent out that has not been authorized by me.
"I don't accept the twitter and have removed it," he said in the later news.
The workers of Perry did not respond immediately to questions for comments.
Although the Twitters of Perrys official user accounts were not clear, it was not clear who actually was feed.
In the previous Twitter, a unprecedented image of the Central County advisor of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, was signed in April 2013, which was sentenced to the tax for the turnkinity.
Perry took a veto against a financial promotion of her office when she refused to return to a complaint against Perry - the most likely President of the presidential candidate in Austin before a Grand Jury in this month.
The text of the Tweet says: "I'm not always striking with the three-fold authorized alcohol level ... but when I do it, I shall complain Goberneur Perry when he explodes it."
I'm the worst democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not undertaken with the leadership on the investigation of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was conducted by Michael McCrum, a special lawyer of San Antonio, elected by a Republican judge.
Perry's not guilty, and the appeal was called a political trick.
His high-classific team of law representatives requested the judiciary in the case of the complaint and argued that the law, which was introduced against the Serviser Governor in the history of Texas State, was unconstituted.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of government money to the Public Integrity Unit of the State, which is acknowledged in Travis County and identified in cases of state corruption in Texas - as Lehmberg refused to return.
This Veto was careful for a public complaint on the left side of the Watchdog group.
Perrys official user account is often updated - and sometimes famous.
After he concluded in the election meetings in Iowa during his 2012 presidency candidate, Perry went to speculations that he will stop by posting a tweet of his photos near a sea, with the words "South Carolina, we come!"
Berkeley explains the accommodation market for "normal"
One of the most prominent farmers of London pointed out that the accommodation market in South England was back to normal level.
Homes in the capital city were heat and a huge price responsibilities in which the Bank of England was engaged in putting up the above limits for hypotheken credits in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the high-classed construction company Berkeley said on Monday: "Seen the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the 2013 maximum."
The real estate market in London was well established during the decrease, as foreign buyers were cut into the capital city.
According to the information of the Catastrophe Office, the prices in the city are only 18.5% springing in the past year, much more than the average increase in England and Wales.
The average sales prices in Berkeley's private, prices and students were around a fifth in the past year and the end of April was 423,000 £.
However, in the past months, a stronger pound has made the real estate property in London less attractive for foreign buyers - some of them have also been affected by introducing new real estate taxes and political Rhetoric for a possible "villial tax" before general elections in the coming May.
The London real estatemaker Foxtons warned in the past week that the Hypotheken market report for April, which has been presented lower credit payment schemes, would also lead to lower market growth in the second half of the year to sell as well as to prices.
New data from the Bank from England from Monday show a decline in the hypotheke authorisation in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is coaling.
Hampions International, another real estate agency, corrected its expectations for the increase of the real estate prices in London for 2015 below 3 per cent, based on a weak house competition.
The transaction volume in the most important areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair, and Kensington has returned to a fourth year for a year, so the Macler WA Elis.
However, the desire is a blessing after a home in the capital city for Berkeley, as the accidental amounts for Terminal sales are at more than 2,2 billion £.
Mr Pidgley added: "The question of the right, well planned product remained stable to the best places and, as a result, the term sales remained stable."
In June the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year until the end of April - almost a third more than the maximum of 2007 before the crisis.
Annual preimbursement result increased by 40 per cent to 280 million £ per year, the overwhelming by 18 per cent to 1,6 billion £.
In a communication on Monday before the year meeting of the company, Mr Pidgley said that the income for Berkeley in the past year would be in line with the current market expectations.
The analysts are estimated in accordance with the annual preimbursement result of 450 million £.
Berkeley shares were held at 23.96 £ at the afternoon in London trade.

Jennifer Lawrence income at the 85th Oscar delivery.
Nackt photos of Oscar Prizess Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker to have a "master list" of images more than 100 starlets.
One representative of the Star from "The Tribune of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real and complained the hacker because of "eclatarant violation of the privacy".

The pleasant "Masterlist" of the Hacking offer includes the name of two women stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstett and Mary-Kate Olsen, reported BuzzFeed.
It is not sure how many of the images are real, although Winstead, Star from "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those of you who look at photos that my husband and I have taken in the private environment of our home for years - I hope you are so satisfied with you," wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeonians "iCarly" and "Victorious", however, concludes that there are pictures on her hands and tweeted "These named Nackta pictures of me are GEFÉLSCHT, people.
Let's just get the starts. * Word games take account*.
Buzzfeed reported on Sunday that a speaker of the Popstar Ariana Grande depends on the truth of the pleasant photos from her.
Excluded outcome from Howard Jacobson's highlighted new Roman about love and the letters "J".
They throw up, so you could describe the best, they slowly solve themselves as a swimming card that you left in the rain.
He said to him a woman that he was too serious, tender, intensive, distance, and maybe something crazy.
And then he protected his hand.
He knew the crowd.
He was sweet like in Igel, yes.
The last sacrifice of this stability was a just starting business that was more promising for a delay of his life’s long-term life was more than another, and may have brought him even a certain satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a sedimentary sharp beauty with unreasoned hair and a flattering heart from a village on the northern island, which was even more distant and rare than Port Reuben.
She came with an older lead to the south, who took the Keverns for her tank, and who had generated a floor in a smooth but Paradise Tal with the name of Paradise Valley.
Over a few years, no one lived in the house.
The wheels were nice, in the bottles were still springs, nacktacks had left their shoes on all windows and believed, heard all this, and the garden was grown up with disgrace, which was like a huge coal head.
It was like the house from a child market, threatening as shutting, a garden full secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose Roman "J" is on the long list for the Man Booker Price 2014.
The list is announced in the next week.
Kevern had seen with Ailin on the cutting legs in high grace and a uncomfortable spring lunch. Both have been in the service console, which supplied the country with quiet music and sweet news, when the view of its crucified brown bein him to an old song forgotten black Entertainer, who loved his father to be closed in the house.
Your feet are too big.
The songs of this type have no longer been played on the console because of their extreme aggressiveness.
Not prohibited - nothing was so prohibited - just not played.
It was successfully obsoleted, as it obsoletes.
The general shock made what was never done with the release and the rules, and as the people in books chose the balls in the Vom-Telcher-Tom-Milionary Memories, Cook Books and Romans, so they chose the balls at the music.
In the Euphorie of the day, Kevern began to play a imaginative club and to meet great feet in a large-community Serenade Ailin's.
Ailinn didn't understand that.
"This was a famous song of a jazzpianian named Fats Waller," he explained and automatically put two fingers to his lips.
That was his father always done to stop the letters J before he came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was small.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told him.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it costs a penny.
It wasn't been a very sweet game at that time, and it was not very nice now.
He knew that this was expected by him, it was everything.
It was supposed to explain what Jazz was.
Ailin had never heard what.
Jazz was not played, even if he wasn't prohibited directly.
Improvising was no longer modern.
It was just a place for a single "wann" in life.
People wanted to be safe at the beginning of a melodie where it would end.
Like the mind.
His inheritance made people nervous.
And Jazz was musically expressed.
Although he had been 10 years old without hearing by Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about Jazz from the half secret collection of old CDs of his father.
But at least he didn't explain that Fats Waller was black.
In her age she probably couldn't remember at a time, in which the pop singler wasn't black.
No laws or interferences again.
A compliance society means that each element of this society was grateful to the principle of grouping - thanks to the switch.
People with afro-karibian origin were suitable by temperature and body construction for entrepreneurship and sport, thus read and cut them.
People who originally stood from the Indian subcontinent were blessed by the nature with electronic talents and were intended to ensure that no family remained without functioning service phone.
What was the rest of the Poland Community, it was concerned about the channelization; the rest of the Greeks was destroyed.
Those from the Golf States and the Levant whose grandmothers did not quit rapidly as WAS GESCHEHEN WAR, WEEN HEES GESCHEHEN WAR has fallen from fear of being accused of fires by fear, even the flags would be seen as the next – had opened the Labneh and Shisha's Pfeifen restaurants, and were depressive.
Everyone after his ability.
As she heard only Balads, Ailinn was hard to understand how the political words that Kevern had just foretold her could be shocked.
music was expressed by love.
"These aren't really ridicule," said Kevern.
Besides people whose feet are too large.
My father has never played anybody, but he loved this song.
He was talking too much, but the uncertain garden gave him the trigger feeling of security.
There was nothing to overcome the shock of the huge cold floors.
Ailin's not yet understood.
Why should your father love this?
He wanted to say that it was a jury, but he was able to put two fingers back to the lips in their presence.
She didn't even think he was something else.
"It seems quiet to him," he said.
She protected her head incredibly and disappeared the view of Kevern.
There was nothing else in the whole world to see than you're inconsistent rabbit hair.
There was nothing he wanted to see.
"If you say it," I don't believe it.
But that's not explaining why you're thinking about me.
They seem to be honest.
Are my feet too big?
He saw him again.
Your feet are not so direct.
Maybe your kitchen, a little bit...
And you're saying you hated me because my shock is sweet?
You hate?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just that stupid song.
He could say "I love you," but it was too early.
"Your cup is exactly the reason why you're wrong with me," he tried.
I'm a little perverse.
That wasn't right.
It should have been funny.
When he tried to be ridicule, he often in difficulties, because he did not have his father’s calm charm that he needed to deal with the sweet graceness.
Maybe his father wanted to be grausam.
Maybe he wanted to be, Kevern, that's it.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomon was red and was cast out of their lift, the console drew up and slaughtered the wine they were slaughtered.
The wine of wood, so the turnestness was not for him apologizing.
In their reception, they seemed to sit as palmweed in the storm.
"And your copper is exactly the reason why I feel perverse to you," she said...
Except that I'm not here.
She regretted him, both because of the unnecessaryness of his words and the fear that she showed in her eyes when she refused against him.
Did she think he would shoot her?
She didn't tell him of the life on the cold northern architect, where she was grown, but he had no doubt that it was so important as here.
The same huge and heat ocean took place here as there on the wood.
The same condemned men, with still a skin and a tremendous skin after DEM WAS GESCHEH WHAT it had been their past as smugglers and beach pumps, moved from Kneipe to Kneipe, always ready to shoot the hand against a woman who rejected or slaughtered them.
Dickcopf?
They would have shown you a thick faust if she didn't wake up!
She only uses - the use of the most commonly used word for an erotic association force between men and women, a contradiction to the unfaithful balls of love from the console - they only use and then shoot.
According to Kevern's view, this was an unnecessary defense, since the use of itself represented a act of violence.
Ailin Solomon gave him a sign through his body.
He took himself out of the snake as a old man.
She also felt angry, but the weight of his dreams surprised her.
That wasn't the end of the world.
They didn't know.
She saw him how he was away - as from a room in the top Stock with her companion with him - a man, smiling by something he himself had succeeded.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
She felt a slow pain for him and men in general, although some of them had led their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, shocked, shocked, without fighting - why was it a view that she seemed well to know when she couldn't remember at one time when she had seen something like this before today?
When she was back alone, Ailin Solomon looked at her feet.
A number of years ago, a intelligent and encouraging 32-year researchers under Ofnow, the illicit supervisory body for public stimulation, worked at a short debate on the continued violence at the lowest and medium-level level, in exactly the country stages where their reduction, if not decreased, had been expected, in view of the money and energy that were invested in the extinction of this violence.
"It was already done much, and it is still to be done," she wrote, "to skip the native aggressiveness of a people who led to thousands of wars and won most of them, especially in the distant edges of the country, where the sweet breath of human friendship historically seen, despite the high demanding warmth between the heats.
But some of the properties are unroticable.
The higher of the crystal, so it seems to be lowering the suffering he continues.
The population urges at the hearing of sentimental ballades, smiling in stories about overwhelming difficulties and endorsing to believe in the centuries of home and family lives, but it is not only the former morality of the rural communities as well as our urban accommodations, but there are also a degree to get a new and resident combat to home, at the place of work, on the streets and even on the playing fields.
"They have had an unfortunate tendency to overcome," her mentor said when he had read the whole report.
I propose you read less Romans.
Esme Nussboum was on her head.
I have to ask you too, are you atheist?
"I think I don't have to say that," said Esme Nuss tree.
Are you lesbic?
Esme reaffirmed her right to privacy and refusal of the statement.
Feminist?
Shut up again.
"I don't ask it," said Luther Rabinowitz finally, "for I would be against atheism, lesbentum or feminism.
This is a predictable workplace.
We serve a predictable society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which are absolutely acceptable and loving, may deteriorate the results that you have imagined.
You themselves have clearly predicts against the Church, and these things that you call as "hinterest" and "root" could also be interpreted by others as well as the expression of natural power and viability.
If you are on the retreat, WAS GESCHEHEN, WHEN THAN THIS GESCHEN, like if it had happened last night, it means to take the country its essential life power.
Esme Nussbaum saw the murder while Rabinowitz spoke.
In his head, a LED recording in Flamingorosa repeated the Councils that Ofnow had granted to the country in the last 40 years or longer.
Call your neighbors, value your partner, listen to Balade, visit musical, use her phone, speak, explain, vote, apologize.
Speaking is better than sweet, the sweet word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you want out," answered Esme Nuss tree with a quiet voice as she was sure that her offerer had finally spoken, "and I say nothing else than that we are not still so effectively healed as we did ourselves.
My concern is that, without warning, we would like to find out how we repeat the errors that have only led to DEM WAS GESCHEHEN, WENN IS HEESCHEHEN.
This time, however, are not the other to which we leave our wrath and our faults.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with the hands.
To show an angel's pacience.
"It's going too far," he said, "if you describe acts as "error" who may have started our grandfather or even not.
You're going too far if you'd say that they would have left their "good" and their "misstraus" to "other".
Indeed, it should not be necessary to remember someone in your position that, when we understand the past, such as the protection of the present, not "we" and "other" is speaking.
There was no "to" and there was no "other".
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"For the one, if we are honestly to us," said Esme, "no part of the society can be able to have a good behavior.
I don't blame anybody.
If it was bad or well done what happened, it happened.
That was then.
There's no need to be said anymore - we're in a position.
And just as no debt must be acknowledged, there is no fault to be blame if such a trail would be appropriate and if there is a way to cut it.
But what the past needs if we don't learn from this?
The past serves for us to forget them.
If I can tell you something...
Luther Rabinowitz left his pyramid together.
"I will think of her report," he said and decided.
On the next day, as she was living to work, she was driving through a motor driver who, as described by passengers, walked on the foot.
There are accidents.
Leotho-Military Member states that no State rule is planned; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Official representatives of the army in Lesotho have planned a state troop to the struggle of the government and said they were going towards the police, which were designed for the weapons of political fans.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled from the country and shared that the country's army circled its office and placed government buildings in the capital city of Maseru.
The first one took his family into the border of South Africa after reporting the attack threats.
Military speaker Major Ntlele Ntoi said that it was not a state rule that the army reacted to the threat by the "political fans", whose army was promoted by the police.
"What happened this morning that the stage of the Defence Forces of Lesotho was acting after he received several secret service reports that a number of elements in the police really wanted to weaken some of the political, partial, young fans who had soon faced a deterioration of harm," he said against Voice of America.
The South African government speaker Clayson Monyela said the military ration had made the impression of a shift.
"Even though nobody has argued to have disrupted the government by violence, all reports are agreed that the activities of the Defence Forces of Lesotho until now are marked for a state rule," he said.
The speakers of the military of Lesotho shared on Sunday that the soldiers returned to their castle and the situation in the capital city was quiet.
Interimly, the Vicepresident Mothetjoya Metsing takes government governance during Thabane inconsistence.
Thaban shared that he believed he was because of his trial to fight corruption in the country.
In Lesotho, since June, there have been great challenges following Thai parliamentary meetings because of the negotiations in its unity government.
He said his actions wouldn't have been unfinished by the government, otherwise, with condemnation.
Production in the euro area on a 13-monat table
The increase in the production in the euro zone was the lowest point in the last 13 months, so that a specific study was observed.
The final market in purchase management index of the producing shop (PMI) was 50.7 in, after a state of 51.8 in July.
An indication over 50 provides an expansion.
New contracts came back and factories experienced burdens at a time of increased spending between the EU and Russia through Ukraine.
The figures shall be held before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
The markets are expected to be a clear plan for the transfer of the euro zone and for the threatening deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There are speculations that the chief of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information in the past of this week whether it considers a quantitative facilitation for the euro zone, in accordance with those employed by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.
"By though a small growth is better than no growth, the intensive impact of the growing economic and geopolitical insecurities for the manufacturers has become clearer," said Rob Dobson, leading economic research scientists at the market.
The German Fabric SME, the largest Russian trade partner in the EU, was the deepest position in 11 months with 51.4.
In the interim period, in the second largest economic activity of the block, France, the SME was at 46.9.
France remains a preoccupied child, as well as the Italian decrease from a solid expansion to the stagnation.
The fact that growth sareizes in the key industrial mechanism of Germany and Spain and the Netherlands are not also calm," said Mr Dobson.
The decline of the industry probably causes the fire of the analysts expecting other monetary or fissual encouraging.
A positive message was from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI increased at 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, Chief Insight expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing that you can say for the sales manager in the euro zone from August is that the sector continues to grow."
He added: "Producers in the euro zone are obviously very difficult, since the current geopolitical expenditure increased, especially in relation to Russia and Ukraine - insecurity in the remaining difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased insecurities have clearly affected the economy, especially and the confidence of consumers, and it is likely that some contracts are delayed or even disrupted, in particular large contracts.
He said that it will be "ever more likely" that the ECB should finally introduce a type of QE, "but we believe that this will be limited."
A decade of hell of the survivors of Beslan: ten years have been passing since the slightly placement of the school, as the children who have been disfellowshipped today.
Ten years ago, more than 1.000 Czechian Military people were taken as a grain in a school in Beslan in Southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them, were killed in the three-day Martyrium that the world was shocked.
We have returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had died in the classroom.
Just a decade after the accurate place of Beslan School, 334 people, including 186 children, warned the held survivors night before a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
As a fanatic Islamic terrorist kids and parents on 1 September 2004, the beginning of a new school year, they took and killed, it seemed to be the badest of the wicked.
The tragedy joined West and East in Abscheu, and then wonderfully turned into action and hope for the future in the worst end.
Ten years later, we were returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had died in the classroom.
We found surprised young people who have surprised the opposites, although the memory of this terrorist hell will be persecuted forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that the Ukraine is now home - and in the children as they die - now finds a end.
The girl who was photographed at the attempt to return to the shooted school chain
She was photographed by the Russian Starfotografs Dimitri Beliakow when she was only trying to return to the shooted school chain after a mine was explosed.
People confusioned, Aida searched for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were guarded for death, but they survived.
"A woman said to me that I should go to my life, but I couldn't," said Aida at that time.
My legs were blut overflow.
I was standing up and clotheed again to search for my mother.
A soldier took her in safe.
After a number of operations, she was fully healed, but he said yesterday: "For three months the pain returned.
I'm afraid I have to be operated again.
Some granat drivers are still in my knie.
Its goal is to be a dentist to help people how you were helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't destroy me," she says struggling.
"This happened to me, and you can't change it.
One time in the year, I was always in the sport chair to remember the remaining ones there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it at other days.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and future class camera, Dzera Gapoeva, was killed there.
We played together when we were little, and we dreamed about going to school together.
"I don't want to marry until I end my study and start my career.
I think about a family later.
She says that the allocation will always be part of her, although the memory will be something weaker every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our fears and we are so grateful for the help that we have received from people in Britain and all over.
If I see the photo of me online, how I turn to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and contribute to that something doesn't happen again.
The boy who flew through the ball, in the sense of his mother is dead
It was his first school day (Russians went with seven years to school) and survived the three-day placement in the arms of his mother Tamara.
When he was seven years old, he said, "Mama told me that I should give me a explosion and keep her hands."
After an explosion, he thought she would die.
She said to him, "Look."
Full fear, they could be dead, he fled and saw on the way a smile kid, took it in the hand and flew through a ball.
His father Wladimir, who closed his son out in the army, said, "Danir told me that his mother was dead.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was shocked outside and with injuries in the hospital house, and, on the other hand, accepted her son.
After her reunion she said, "I sweared for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He shocked in and turned me up.
Damir was later fled to London (from the instant news of the World) to receive the title of a Barnardo's children's Champion from the former Prime Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop with the remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say it's gonna be slower in my memory.
I'm still sure I'm going to get away all my games.
But now I can play computer games with shoots and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to get back to the sport chain, but I don't think about myself.
I remember those children with whom I played in the court and who didn't have done it outside.
We never say they were killed or died.
We're saying they've stayed in the sport chair.
I remember very well at my journey to London, especially at the game loads, where I could see everything I wanted, and the driving in a open car above.
But now he feared the place like Ukraine, where wars cause the type of disaster he and his friends.
This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I'm so sorry about all those suffering under the grills," said Damir, who worked as volunteers in a club.
I want to help you so much.
I want to go to the police a day and hope that she takes me the next year at the training academy.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the horrible style after the deposit, there was no children who could call and walk, and this style continued many months.
She lives in her journey to London with Damir.
The people in London sweared when I told us our story.
I understand how people can understand our feelings on the other side of the world and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the prices and the possibility of traveling to London in early 2004.
I wish I could call Chery and just tell you yourself that 10 years ago, but I still remember her and her husband in London, and how the Damy and I helped me.
I remember how Damir would like to eat and call her all local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with Kelners in a restaurant. The damn shocked with his water shoes on them and they turned away and played with him.
And this was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and to support us.
She said, "I always think this world hasn't become better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war continues, and every day people die, and I believe that many children were killed and killed.
That's exactly like our children.
I think that for many of the war it is a part of the news they hear when they are slowly or with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the whole horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that's so triste.
Damir has become large and is a very sweet and quiet boy, he's not really aggressive or angry.
For instance, he does not search for rush, he is not overcome from the past greuels.
I know that he doesn't like to remember it, but he has six close friends from the class and they're going to the sport chain and end up there.
When he was smaller, he was understood - I remember how he sometimes stood on the sofa, the face turned from us for a long time.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he continued his weapons and other military instruments. Damir is now 17, more than me, a good look, intelligent and healthy.
I can't believe I've been so sure for a few hours that he's dead and I'm never going to see him again.
When I repeated me after the explosion and came to the leg, I saw me, and I saw the hell around me, with the parts of the body.
I was absolutely sure my little boy couldn't survive in this hell.
"I remembered him, "Damir, run, go," but I was also so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard it, and he's gone.
And that's how life goes, other than the many others, for us.
George Ilyin, 17
The boy, whose horrible image after the placement, became the symbol of Beslan's greuel
Trost: The Beslan surviving Georgi Lyin with his mother Fatima after the 2004 assembly, right a picture of Georgi today
His blue overwhelming face was marked by fear when he crossed his life, while the Tschechian terrorists shocked his class cameras.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbari of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had left him for his first school day before she was going to take her older son Wladimir to university.
"I left the Court for about two minutes before the terrorists slaughtered him, and my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone," she remembered.
Not all of us, there was a whole family of friends of us, but they were all killed.
Only my georgy made it possible to survive.
Before this date, the harder is thinking and talking about it.
There is no only day we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time, I mean, last night, some scenes of these days follow me always.
No one will forget that, I promise you.
Understanding: The image of Georgi (left) was one of the most shockingest of the attack and was shocked as a Statue (right).
I remember that Georgi wanted to go to school on this day, and he said he wanted to put his teachers.
I just knew he was alive when I saw him at the TV.
And now there are even these statues of the wedding Georgia in San Marino.
Georgi does not like the image, and it's hidden with us home in the booking area.
I understand this, but I also think that people around the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
Georgi says today, "It's important that something can never happen again.
"I doubt that we ever learn the truth.
People always investigate such tragedies and never learn the truth.
And now they investigate the absorption of this boeing in Ukraine.
Should we ever know what has caused him?
This world will be a little horrible.
"I can't understand how it is possible, because if you ask the people, no one wants a war, so how does that happen?
Decades of pain are nothing.
We need twenty years to forget it a little little.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years, I had a few dinner rooms because of the placement, but then it was better.
I went back to school in 2004, and I was afraid every day.
I thought my friends and class room friends were killed.
That's why I'm always going to the sport chair when the 1st September goes closer.
I want to steal my old boyfriend tribut.
It's hard for me to go to the sport chair, but I have to do it.
I don't feel as a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I'm not gonna forget it, but I'm not cutting up.
My life goes on.
I closed the school this year and visited a medical school in Wladikawcaz.
I'll be a heart surgery.
My first choice was a training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health did not stop it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
George Fanijew, 20
The boy who survived, although he was captured to foot a murderer terrorist.
A miracle: George Fanijew was captured to feet a murderer terrorist, but he tried to survive.
During the posting, he was captured in the sport hall and sit down next to the bomb that was confirmed on the foot of a murderer terrorist.
It's really a wonder that he wasn't killed.
"We feel like it was yesterday," said Georgi, who wanted to go to FSB as secret officer, but this was because of his healthy damage.
It's still with me, it's nothing I left behind me.
I'm now older and people say that children can easier with bad experiences - I have to say that it's not true.
"2006 I worked with psychologists and felt me really something better, but I can't forget it.
And I would like to forget.
2005 - in the year later - was the first and only time I went back to the sport chain.
I lost the consciousness.
I will never go back there and ask me not to show you where I seed in this famous image.
Residents: Georgi Fanijew today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the deposit on the laptop
My pain is unfair, and I bring him every day with me.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never asked me after school.
I'm fine.
I should be careful with my last kid, but I can go well now.
But because of my health, I couldn't study the FSB's Secret Service Academy in Sankt Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, even the medical, and they answered that it couldn't be possible.
My second suffering was the animals, so I went to the animal institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "of cats to cook".
He said, "I knew I would never tell my children about my experience.
Of course, children should not know anything, and they should not experience it.
His mother, Marina, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse when the Year Day is nearer.
I'll go to the festivals.
I know that Georgia's not going to go.
It must be more powerful for him because he was there and I don't.
I was waiting at home and I couldn't help him.
I am so grateful that he was given to me.
It's staying in us.
Georgi is an adult now, but this horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept that when something gets so unfaithful.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't take part because of his kid.
He's been operated several times, he can run, but no sports.
I would say he was over 50 percent over the horror, but you can never be able to overcome and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed at the assembly and it strengthens my pain only.
I lost a lot of people I learned well and were moneyed.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart crys for the killers.
I know about families where new children were born, but also of Witwen who never married again.
It is difficult to accept that life continues, even if you don't want it.
I'll never forget how my heart is in me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what happens in the world - wars in other regions.
Why are these people fighting?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country, and I can't almost believe it.
We were a friendly country before, how can we fight now?
People and children suffer, I'm sure that many children were already killed in Ukraine and many are still killed.
If we could take all these rebels and turn away - so far as possible.
Ajonna Tskajewa, 10
The baby, which has been safely carried out by a special income command
Device: Aljona Tskajewa is safely placed by a Russian special income command (left).
She is now ten (right) and never remembers the grains.
The world took the breath in 2004 when the baby Aljona was put into the arms of a Russian police in Beslan.
Terrorists left them to go, but in their gravity, their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Machar returned to school sport chain.
Makhar, three years old, took away, but Aljonas's mother and sister died in the murderer meal.
Her father Ruslan has married again and had a girl with his new wife Swetlana that he called after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, a ten years old today, does not remember the placement and is grown to a intelligent and happy girl, says neighbor.
"They are now a great happy family, and Aljona and Machar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastical father and wants to spare all the memorys that bring to the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.

4 Tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you want to make photos or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.
The most precious option is an aquatic point and shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or a Action Cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver edition, both for $300.
I have recorded these photos at a family party with several cameras that are all available to a price of under $350.
Independence on the equipment, there are some rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a water-deed camera, make sure that the battery and other cases are closed closely.
Place your camera also on the photos or videos you want to take.
Some cameras and Camcorders are available on scenes and reception modes with which the lighting time for the deep subwater conditions is optimized.
And before split into, check at which depth your equipment is able to work.
Some cameras are allowed only for 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search in our buyer leader and reviews for digital cameras for common and water-deed models.
Make multiple receptions - because many do not be punished.
Point-and-shoot cameras have a LCD that you can compose pictures, normally not action cameras.
Even if you have a LCD, it's hard to see this under water, and the right image setting is a lucky case.
So make a lot of records.
If your camera has a series mode with which a series of accommodations are made with easyly changed light settings, use it.
Keep near the surface.
The light will be dramatically worse, if you continue to remove from the surface.
So if you can stay close to the surface if you make ups in a pool, a sea or the sea.
This also allows you to put more colours into your photos; more deeply you go, which is less colours you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good counsel in the country, but it is under water more important because of the bad light relationships.
It is particularly important if you work with a action camera: these devices are often available through a fixed wheel line, which means you need to be closer to your objects if they are to fill the entire image frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man from the species who changed things, even in such a giant organization as the NHS.
As an adviser anasthesiart, he widened his career of the task to improve both the agony of disease and the treatment of nurses.
Among his patients, so remembering his wife, he was a MI6 employee who had to live with the overwhelming impact of torture.
Lawson knew that the doctors were important to diagnose and diseases, while treatments are overly employed with something else: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one who started his suffering.
"I didn't feel," he wrote in May of this year.
I had difficulties to smell me.
While he struggled with the gripped symptoms, he noted that he made his wife Juliet unpatience.
"I would like everything soon than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business journey for a week, Lawson felt uncomfortable and without reasons.
There was something in the air.
He asked a colleague to investigate his breast.
First two weeks ago, he was going to ski in the French Alpen.
The result of the rail investigation was proposed.
He led to Mesothelium, a unheilable cancer, which was the breast-fell, so that the skin that crossed the lungs.
As in most cancer diseases, the precise eliminator is mostly difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokes have been sick, all the langer cancer diseases have not been previously smokeed.
But metothelium is different.
In almost all cases, the deployer is a asbest loading - contact with the fabric that once became "Wonderstoff" has been recognized deadly.
For most of us, metothelium is a disease that can be ignored as easy.
Asbest is finally a product of the past.
The most dangerous asbest type has not been used in Britain since 1960 than the industry has voluntaryly forced to use this.
There, where he was still used, only people worked in certain sectors directly with the substance - clampers, construction workers, rooms and advertising workers, for example.
As an industrial risk from another time, he seems not to be worried today.
But this self-friendy has been uncomfortable.
The British, like it, today experiences the height of a metallthelium epidemic.
There are more deaths through Mesothelium here than in any other country of the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, there are twice as many in this disease as in transport accidents.
Annual numbers of metothelium total accidents since 1980 and foreseeable death cases in Britain
The reason why we are now experienced the mortal impact, although Asbest has been illegal for years (1999 forbidden to all the asbestotypes), is that a methothelium is only developed after decades.
And the gloves of the metothelium is not limited to former workers of the construction industry.
Asbest was, and it is still often in the houses where we live, the offices we work, the schools we learn and the business where we buy.
And therefore, metothelium does not know class illness, financial borders, professionals or age.
The privileges, from the elegant purchase houses in London to private schools, are no protection room.
The parliamental buildings are asylum.
In the hospitals in which we should be healthy, this mortal carcinogen has already been considered as the starting heritage.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a klinger.
In fact, it was hard to imagine where he might have been contacted with Asbest.
Then he found it out.
"It seems like if in the tunnels at the Guy's Hospital, where I completed my training for six years, there was a lot of asbest."
All - students, nurses, doctors and physicians - use the tunnel.
Do you ask how many of my older friends will suffer from the same disease?
This question was unfortunately able to answer at least partly.
"For the four doctors who were trained at the Guy's Hospital, and those in the past five years in Mesotheliom," he wrote in 2010 in a letter, "I am the last who still lives."
How many of us will still be sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed in the age of 48 years of age.
When he died on February 17, this year, he was 55.
This was an unexpected long-term survival time.
Fifty per cent of all metothelians died within 8 months after diagnosis.
The disease is always dead.
So we can only repeat Lawson's question, "Why many of us will still be sick?"
The leading expert of Britain to Mesothelium, Professor Julian Peto, argued that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbeste diseases in Britain are expected to be experienced, overall 90,000 of the diseases are affected to victims.
Most of these are not aware that they will die so.

A short look at the cases of the courts, at which the interested persons often apply because of harm-related requirements, shows how much the throat of the metothelium has already been distributed.
In June this year, for example, Marks & Spencer had been able to have spent the asbest in a flight for Janice Allen.
She worked for nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations, one of the Flagshipers in the Oxford Street.
Mrs Allen was only 18 years old when she started their activities at M&S.
Now she has two children in the 20th.
"For this thing," she says, "I have never heard of the Mesothelium, I hadn't even known something about Asbest.
I never thought it would be about me.
There are only few people who know a lot about Asbeest.
The fact is that the term Asbest is not a substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name leads to the word "Asprostitution form", a description of the faser structure that makes the substance resistable and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the building shop.
Chrysotil, even known as a white asbest, is today the most common asbest found in the buildings.
It was used for toilet plates, footbooth plates, raw resollations, boilers, even for swimming plates in cars.
It is less dead than other asbest forms, however, the EU and the WHO are considered as a "great health risk" with a possible death.
But more dangerous is the blue asbest (Amosit) and the blue asbest (Krokydolith).
The United Kingdom was one of the world's largest importers of a braune asbest, and experts noted that "the clear, but indirect indication is that this was a main basis for the unique high-rates of methothelium."
An employee of Marks & Spencer was executed in the Flagship Center in the Oxford Street, London, Asbest
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical metotheliom sacrifice, but the work of Julian Peto states that their history is no matter.
He presented a study of the interested persons in which "a significant part of the methothelioms has been caused by work or in the home by asbest contacts in the environment."
A majority of these contacts is based on his statement on the "normal use and agement" of our buildings.
It seems like no one can get out of it to be safe.
A report of Goddard Consulting, which has investigated the palace of Westminster, shows how people could have been expelled in the heart of the government.
2009 Goddard reported that service defects and guidances were seized behind the committees of the Parliament with Asbest, whose mortal fascinations could have been developed by something that was so harmless as "stress air movements".
Parliament members are often accusated to care for their own interests, but this seems to be the contrary.
While the Parliamentary Working Service's Directorate of West Mines has received a "supported health product", it was insufficient that 1 billion £ of work has to be taken over a number of years to renew the parliament, to modernize the electronic installations and to remove the asbest, and that, after general elections 2015, the deputy will be held closely in the QE2 Conference Centre as well as on the green banks in West Minster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the prediction of Asbeth was not undertaken in accordance with the provisions of each other."
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost life.
All you can do is wait.
A person who never could exactly determine the contact with Asbest is Graham Abbott, a general medicine.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old abbott summarized that he had been expelled to Asbeest during his work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where the asbestos were positively decided," he said, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all places where you worked, and to the data.
What he still remembered is the day in December 2009, in which he received such a kind of fever.
He was 45, and he was just late after a operation.
Soon I had a shooting fleet.
It's been soon.
I felt horrible.
I thought that the journey wasn't going home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pains of the breastfell, the skin surrounded its lungs.
But as Janice Allen, he didn't have a reason to smile a metothelium.
He didn't go to work a month.
The surprised doctors made rings in his breast and placed Pleurakatzien in order to take flexibility from the lungs and test in the lab.
However, his complaints remained without diagnosis.
His health was slowly improved, and he returned to his workplace.
However, from time to time, the symptoms returned, often after sporting and heavy breath.
2011 a patient has similar symptoms in his practice and later was diagnosed with metothelium.
But also now it does not abort this to his own case.
Finally, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with Asbest.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011 Abbott was defeated, and his home doctor brought his CT scans and rail captures to a group of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt sick for the first time, one of the cameras was put into the hill between the Ripper and the Brust Fill.
I'm an optimist.
I'm going to do it mostly," he says.
Really, I hadn't had so many concerns.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the Biopsie was in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told me that it was metothelium."
Graham Abbott: Metothelium diagnosis
Finally, Abbott had ends with Macmillan hospitals, with which one recommended to take a lawyer.
First of all, he means the dimension of epidemic.
"It realized that Asbest was very wide, especially in large public buildings, where rather were often isolated with Asbest," he said.
Those who were exiled to the Asbest in these buildings are now sick.
And so, the Mesothelium is now more young people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous wheels with asbestoolations in hospitals were under the earth, so patients were probably not more exposed to the substance.
But many employees who changed in footnote tunnels from a building to another (e.g. Andrew Lawson) or eat in subterranean cantine (such as Graham Abbott often done) were in contact with the most likely substantial substances.
It shows that over a few decades after the war, hospitals for patients may be survived, but lively threatened to the treating doctors.
He'll still be away today.
The students put their bunners on asbestmates.
And it's not only about hospitals.
Asbest was often used in offices, businesses, libraries and cities because of his fabulous isolating and flaming properties.
The schools too.
In fact, many people probably have the first asbest contact in the classroom.
In the whole country, in thousands of chemistry hours, students have put their bunners on asbestmates.
On the website, the Asbest theme is now often discussed in schools.
And in the world, such innocent objects have contained in our houses such as footboat plates or shooters normally asbest.
"It is an industrial guiding that is included in large parts of our real estate", observes Andrew Morgan, lawyer, who was in his process against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that took place was the absorption of a garden shooting in the 1970s.
So look at how you shoot your garden shoes.
The effects of diagnosis, and the knowledge that illness is inherent.
"There is a time to process", says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and trying to continue, but I realized that I couldn't concentrate on what I did.
I was two weeks in the practice.
Then I knew I was going and had to take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to experience another Christmas party.
With the greatest difficulty, the prospective change from a doctor’s position to a patient was.
As many patients before him, he remembered how he was overlooked by all the information he had to come right.
"It was very difficult to get everything," he said.
"I asked my doctor how long have I been?"
And there were more than 12 months for me.
I remember that I thought, "Yes, I won't experience another Christmas feast.
"It was then."
Metothelium is especially home-toxic because it is our life-conservation mechanism - the breath itself - that the mortal cancer causes.
Most cases of metothelium are caused by asbest contact.
Asbest consists of smaller fascinations.
If the asbest is disrupted and the fabrics are inhibited, they can set up in the breast skin skin around the lungs.
Asbest phasers irritate the breast fleet and can eliminate cell mutations.
"The problem is with the inhaled nadel cord asbespheres", says Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax-arzt that changed to the Guy's Hospital 2001.
Just as the hospital, by the Andrew Lawson, that it has put him to the asbest, is now ironily, a leading centre in the treatment of metothelium.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some of the other who probably were also employed during their training in the hospital house of Asbeest.
When the asbest nadels reach the lungs skin, Treasure says, "When they press from the breathing on the border where the skin is.
From nature it is from the beginning to invasive.
The common options in other cancer diseases do not work so well in metothelium.
For example, the effectiveness of an operation is heat.
Some think it's a trial.
The treasure cleans that.
"You can't get out of the breast fat," he says.
They're not coming with the skin.
This is because the cancer says "not very good about chemotherapy", the "breaking" is not healed.
"Atimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But at the end they're all dead.
Happily, some patients live indeed long, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott still fights.
After he had contacted Mesothelium, Abbott came in contact with Andrew Lawson, who four years after his diagnosis became a one-man support and consultation office for participants.
"Hello, cancer central," he expressed joyfully at calling.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis for 4 years and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott six chemotherapy cycles were offered to take four months and would expect to extend its life only for a month.
"I was doubtless," he said.
I wanted to stop.
However, Lawson created it "to allow things to appear in a little more positive light".
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart-thorax specialist at Guy.
"We had a advantage that I should not be forgetted, I just called and made an end," says Graham.
A normal patient should be given a transmission and should be expected at the approval of treatment.
The money is decisive for metothelium diseases to be able to take the best available therapies.
But if these treatments finally failed, many of them are concerned by another financial concern - about the future of the families who have left them.
And so they will be subject to the judges in hope to punishment.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It's known since 1898 that Asbest is extremely dangerous for health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s is that a very low load was a risk of health.
And here the ability of companies started playing a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally helped her case, but it was not what Morgan called a "complete punishment" because Lawson could not prove with absolute security that his metotheliom was to return to an asbest contact on Guy's.
However, after the investigation of his death, a speaker of Guy confirmed that "the asbestos fascinates have been removed in the 1990s. "
This was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove Asbest
In fact, it is for metothelium diseases that are trying to defeat a huge problem to generate the mortal asbest contact of a company or a workplace - normally decades after the accidents.
Many of their previous employees are sold or closed.
Insurance records can be lost.
Those who rise against the punishment know that the time is for them, but surely not with the clauses.
As a reaction, there were significant new legislation that makes it easier for the methothelium concerned to defeat, even if their previous employees are not recovered.
The law has established a fund of 350 million £ supported by the insurance industry for all diagnosed after July 2012, but no one can bear in charge.
In these cases, the applicants receive 80% of what a court could have been able to speak to them in a normal punishment process - about 120,000 £.
A total of 300 successful applications for the programme are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks as many metothelium stakeholders that 350 million £ were a "very good work" of the insurance sector.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he said, and said that it is a fourth thing about what the insurers should pay, if the time wouldn't go out of it, and metothelium diseases find the companies and they could be normally punished.
Mike Penning, the former Minister of Labour and Pension, also admitted that the law "not perfect".
But both Penning and Morgan gave that, as regards seven death sacrifices, it was necessary for a rapid shipment daily.
"The people suffer so much and need help today," said Penning during the second hearing of the Metothelium Session in December of the last year.
At this time, Graham Abbott was in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
Following its first discussions, Lang-Lazdunski recommended a operation that he expected a positive effect on Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by rarely therapy and chemotherapy - a tri-axis therapy that can represent a survival rate of over 5 years from up to 40 percent.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"This is of course with the most important," says Abbott.
You're always seeing that in patients.
There's something that allows you to continue.
If you get up, it's very bad.
Graham Abbott was undertaken in March 2012.
Finally, in August he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind himself.
No signs of illness were shown in the following carecasecans.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer flanks on my breast.
I've just been 50.
It's not a life threatening.
It's alive.
Abbott again understood six chemotherapy sycles.
Now it is no longer visible for the tumor.
But the process is physical and psychologically stressing.
You have to think about practical things - about the money if I'm not anymore, for example, or my wife shows how the bomb time works.
If you receive bad messages, you'll be negative.
You have to look forward.
As Ellie's father, 16, and Tamsin, 14, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for your parents," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I received my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I had a disease with which I would not be old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sick and unclean.
She told her friends about it, and soon we got a lot of calls.
Ellie was retreated.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients need.
But for metothelians, such conversations have not been deceived by hope, not by a scene of hope to survive.
The disease brings (as finally as to Stephen Jay Gould) a grimming security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelium is not a threat to life.

It was developed that it was not burnable.
I've seen the servers in the Kamaj Festivals.
The use of the modern commercial asbest begins in Italy, where it is used to produce papers (e.g. money appearances) and substance.
Important asbestation is opened in Canada and South Africa and soon later in America, Italy and Russia.
It is the ideal isolation substance for the machines and turbines of the industrial revolution.

Dr. William Cooke says that asbest particules in the light are "if any intelligent doubts are the main causes."
That's the first case of this type.

The import and use of blue and blue asbest are legally prohibited in Britain.
Every use of asbest is prohibited in Britain.
The Metothelium seat is adopted in Britain.
A deterioration programme of 350 million £ is announced.
Asbest is prohibited in more than 50 countries, however, white asbest is still used in many land countries as a precious building material.
World production is about 2 million tonnes annually.
China refuses Hong Kong Law on Government Selection, Demonstrates Yellow Payment
On Sunday the Chinese Parliament decided, despite the increased call for democratic reforms against the namement of candidates for elections in 2017 by the Hong Kong election.
This action is likely the long-declared Protests in Hong Kong's business centre, while the aktivists led the planning and mobilization within less than hours after the relief into the road.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows the Communist leaders to submit all non-committees.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us anger," said the legal experts Emily Lau, Chairman of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Peking promised.
You've lied to the inhabitants of Hong Kong.
And it's clear that we have to do it with an authorisation regime.
In its defence of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Vice-Secretary-General of the Permanent Committee of the National Congress, said that the authorisation of public nominations to the elections for the Hungary Government would be "chaotic".
Since 1997, as the United Kingdom controls over Hong Kong returned the Chineses, Peking promised to leave the people to the government presidency since 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision on Sunday as a democratic interruption, since it has a right to electoral right to the citizens of Hong Kong, but the decision also clearly makes that the Chinese leadership holds the end by a closely controlled appointment committee.
After a new clause, only candidates should be permitted "with love for land and love to Hong Kong".
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and public most effective protests in Hong Kong have been held for some years.
Between the Democratic campaign in Hong Kong, the movement of Occupy Central with Love and Peace, whose organizations threatened to shoot the financial sector if Peking does not allow a real general election law.
On Thursday, hundreds of Occupy-central attendants were gathered in the rain before the government headquarter in Hong Kong within less than hours.
In the demonstration, the organizations said that their movement had reached a new stage of civil injury and planted Protestwells in the coming weeks.
However, they did not make further information to avoid problems with the authorities.
In a online communication, the organizations reported that the movement "the determination of the Central District has taken into consideration only as the last means, a action that should only take place when all dialog opportunities are made and no other choice exists.
We're sorry to say that today all the dialogue changes have been exhausted and that the introduction of the central sector will be definitely happening.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been prepared for the announcement of Pekings for days, and it was held on Sunday before the government building, including police forces and barricads.
The disappointed ones are strengthened by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control over their city.
The access of people from the fixed country increases competition to products and services.
Furthermore, the fear increases that the values of Hong Kong, such as democracy and freedom of speech, start to be broken under the growing pressure of Pekings.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy Centre movement, as they threatened the business industry - the head of the Hongkongs.
"The Protests they speak could cause great economic damage, after how many have been involved in it and how long they have been delayed," said the expert of the Justice Regine Ip, who criticizes the movement for a long time.
We don't want to make fears that Hong Kong's devices besides control.
This impression is bad for investments.
The stately controlled media of China also reported on democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by western forces.
In this summer, activeists organized an informal referendum on election rights in which 780,000 people participate - more than one fifth of the electioners in Hong Kong.
In July, ten thousands took part in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.
The tradition of school closures in the United States will now be transferred to universities where Freshmen is offered with the private flight.
We are glad to respond to this question and offer the first luxurious travel service of the United Kingdom for students today.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive event at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private flights, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also admitted that the service has a security party.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who, instead, have to rent their cars in a dangerous car loaded by the country.
With our new VIF options, we are pleased to ensure that students reach the university with a minimum movement and a maximum Luxus.
A company speaker said that there are no new bookings that the service was just introduced, but he added that "too students would book the service in the next weeks".
The company also reported that, despite the expenditure of the study costs of 9.000 £ per year, a market was expected for this offer.
Students today differ in their expectations and claims very much from students from 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can precisely do this.
However, the National Students Union criticized the service as decreased.
Megan Dunn, NUS High School Vice-President, said: "This offer seems to be completely separated from the life of the majority of students.
Many students that start this month with the study are a crisis of life conservation costs, since the available financial aid in the form of creditors and Stipendiums does not keep the stronger accounts for the simpleest life basis before they can think about thousands of pounds for such simplicity as the arrival in the student home.
Feminists criticize racism and police behavior by Ferguson
The unarmed young man was killed in the beginning of this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants highlighted their hands in the air and sing, "Hands up, don't shoot," while they waited before the beating.
After two weeks of protest in Ferguson, Mo, because of the fire of the unarmed youth Michael Brown, the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noted a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
After their experience, white feminist comments about the gender before the race, when it comes to address reproduction rights and income inequalities.
However, while the shocks in the Middle West increased and received consideration throughout the country, Perez saw that the answers of white women turned to 100% to the race.
In comparison with the answers of black women short after the shoot of 9 August, the personal tests came with titles such as "Ferguson's thanks to a white woman" and "Feminism is not only late for the interpretation of women".
But for Perez, this means a significant change.
"I don't believe that you find many people in feminism who are white and privileges so high-classified," she said.
People feel that something could be expressed to the events.
It is characteristic for the crisis we have and because the situation in Ferguson is so etennied that they must express it.
For English Profesor Coritha Mitchell from the Ohio State University, Ferguson faced problems on light which black Americans are deleted every day, but not considered "Frauen themes" in the cultural space.
"I can publish something nice on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from everywhere," said Mitchell.
If I post something about how colorful in their own country, the skin is sweet.
"Why can women be safe to speak publicly about a relationship but not about security in the public room?" she asked.
For black women such as Mitchell, race, sex and sexuality have studied in the history of the United States, there is no dicotomy between racial and sexual problems.
For them, black women did not have the luxus to split the subjects cleaner; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women are now connected to the subjects of race and gender in the feministical mainstream crystal, Angela Hattery, Professor for Women and Sexual Research at George Mason University, said that their operations were the opposite.
"In 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were shocked, and the foundation was almost always shocking a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the Lynchmorder.
For Hattery, the disappearing between white and black women came to the point where white fighters for women's choice rights such as Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the fight for election rights could only be a group successful for each other: women or black.
"Their decision was to put on women's choices, and the right to elect for blacks should come later," said Hattery.
If you remember such things, one with power will be aware of why white women do not believe.
We didn't do good our job.
We never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
In 1920, after women received the election rights, there was still a decade of years until white women were organized against the Lynchen Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was almost 40 years after the original request for helping black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flow of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - is a spiegel of time when white feminists played with the problems with black women from generations.
"Isn't it nice if the aktivists who have such traditional feministical platforms have the right to reach a child's education as serious as they do with the right to control the receipt?" Mr Mitchell asked.
Feminists of the second generation, who have built their careers in the fight for reproduction rights and access to recommended means, now try to understand what this means.
The famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went two weeks after the shoot of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, the Guardian colonist, where she requests more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have another but parallel reason for understanding a risk of the body - and views about the race that are clearly different in public surveys - the changes will be introduced", wrote Steinem.
Although the stones for a higher intersectional feminism are discussed in the race as sex themes, some of their comments on the race topic in America are noted.
Christina Sommers, researchers at the American Enterprise Institutes and authors of "Who Stole Feminism?" said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young pharmaceutical men, "we are farther than their sisters," but stones comments on Ferguson are in contrast to their previous criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for children.
But when the white house recently set up a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help younger black and Spanish men, there have been norm reactions of many feminists, including Gloria Stein.
The police relationship with the black Community is not the only problem of the mainstream feminism.
After the United States Great Police has reached nearly 63.000 uncomplied minority in the southern western of the country in this year, the subject of immigration reform is also back to the surface - this time as a subject of women.
Andrea Mercado, Co-Chairperson of We Belong Together, a organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a re-view of the topic, they should only publish the historys of immigrant women.
"This speaks for himself," said Mercado.
If the large majority of labour visa is to men immigrants, women that they join are in a position where they are attracted to sexual violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a posthall in the women's organizations," she said.

Leonidas asked in the Gladiatoriana
Not only the gladiators were sweetly located in the match at the first Rheinbacher day in the free-time park.
However, the association power of the event was sufficiently strong to shut over 1000 visitors yesterdays, who shocked the rain observers and the skin, and quite slowly left by the historical spectacle.
There was a good journey of shows, shows, games, exhibitions and information about the time of Romans and their importance for the Rheinland.
The main attraction of the day, unfortunately, was the martial struggle of the Gladiator School "Amor Mortis", which used every rainpause to demonstrate their robust fighting art in which Arena prepared with sweet sand.
Gladiators "Leonidas" owned themselves as a humor and special representative and sent his men to the Ring for a twice chain in different gladiators.
First, the "provocators" were at the row with right shields and shortnesses, as well as shifts on the left skin and arms on the right arm.
It followed the "essedari" with bread, short-sheat, and wheat-floor, as well as the supern gladiatorhelm, skin and army protection.
In particular, the involvement of the "retiary" was shocked with the "secutor" network, Dreizack and Dolch against the "secutor" and, after a short battle, the Burgens were to land.
Thus, the black metallic forced each other, the shields shrubs, and the wheat lamps slowly passed through the Arena, that anxiety and band could be made for the health of the gladiators.
But on that, the imposing "Summa Rudis", the Musical Schiedsman, was always a remarkable eye.
"We wanted to live again on the Roman daily and make the culture of the Roman times experienced", explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the event "Freundskreis Roman Channel", the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, a "Oppidum Romanum" from the freetime park was established a Roman city, such as Vice-Claus Wehage in his green word.
Finally, Romans have not only brought war and opening into our region, but also the Roman culture and many buildings that we still admire today.
The rest of this was also to be surprised at the Roman Day, about "Aquadukt-Marmor" from the 11 meters high and 1400 meters long Roman Canal bridges, which were first at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus Society put the water and energy supply towards now, and Headman Petra Fricke knew: "We still benefit from the knowledge of that time."
This also confirms the Diplom Engineer Ralph Heiliger of "Ingenieur TeamZwei" from Rheinbach, the instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman Villa in Blankenheim presented skins and models from the expansions in 1894, as well as stones of the original hypocost, warmthysis, which once warmed the Romanville.
It also impressioned the footprints left by Wolf and Fuchs two thousand years ago in the footsteps of the tone before you burned it.
2011 the Agency of Landden-Caleries at Rheinland's Rheinland had buried the rest of a Roman villa in the North Coast Park in Rheinbach.
It has been found to be reconstituted in a economic building with a dark for graining cereals and meal.
The building probably heard of a Villa Rustica, a agricultural good, explained the architecture Dr. Jennifer Morcheiser.
A series of foundations from these expansions presented them in a glass vessel, including a large terrace, several fingers of glass, and parts of a cereal hairket.
The villa, likely, has existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, until the Germans in the then Roman Rheinland, are smoothing.
You also worked with the Roman windmouth game, similar to the today's swimming game, or the Roman students wrote their name with metal balls on guard tables.
At the stand of the Roman Darms Zülpich, the children of Mosaics were able to put the swimming museum on the stand of the glass museum Rheinbach glassmoaks and to serve a serious snake from stone to make the meal for a flat brown or a museum.
With the original Roman travel cars covered by two calm fleurs, visitors passed through the free-time park and also arrived in the impressive position of the city Gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Rome Wednes" in this area.
With a Roman Wednesday from 13 to 21 September, the Watchberg Community will also be reminded of the death of Kaiser Augustus before 2000.
In combination with the home and store agreements, as well as the Watchberger Wander Agreement, the Partnership Agreement and the Layer Game Crystal Oberbachem are offered, among other thematic changes, a talk, cochabends and school class leaders and reminds the Roman past Watchbergs.
For example, a Roman legionian of his work on the swimming Watchberg is told, present plants as living thinking models from the Roman time and offered a wide lesson in matters between a group of Watchberger "Germans" and the Romans.
The Adendorfer's basic school works in the context of a project evening to the theme.
With the Roman Wednesday, the many, but often not more on the first sight of the Romans in Watchberg should be re-experienced.
In the Watchberger Council, a small presentation is reminded of the fund of the Berkumer Matronen sanctuary in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic struck West African economy
Ebola epidemics in West Africa is also a serious fault for the economy.
The markets are understood - and international enterprises are going to distance.
Ebola epidemias the West African economy makes a serious struggle.
The reward is broken on the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are excited - the virus has made it difficult for the region.
Some international enterprises have already been at distance.
"The ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis but also a economic crisis", the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberkah.
Liberia is the worst of the
"It's a total disaster, we lose a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells the second largest market in Liberia, capital clothing Monrovia.
On the market only comes who wants to buy food or something to desinfect against Ebola.
Liberia is the most worst of the virus, only here the fiber cast over 600 people for sacrifice.
The health authorities recently explained that disease was predicted in any angles of the country.
Also in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria have spread the virus.
Overall, more than 1500 people died, thousands of other settled.
Foreign enterprises depend employees
In the whole of the resource countries, enterprises employ their exploitation.
Foreign enterprises such as the steel concerns Arcelor Middle depart from their employees, several international aircraft companies have no longer reached the regions concerned.
They also respond to the domestic handlers and farmers: only few purchase feeds leave their homemates to purchase.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under the Quarantines, the important coffee and coffee bombs are broken on the fields for export.
The farmers do not want to leave their reward.
Food to be cut
"The people will always be less traveling," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Pariser experts for West Africa economy.
For example, the man who normally goes on the market and sell his fruits remains better at home.
The population therefore has the consequences of the epidemics to feel directly and slowly: food will be cut.
On the markets, the proposal is slowing to basic foods such as Riis.
Similarly, the strong region that is dependent on international firms threatens a image damage - with a larger impact.
The greatest risk is that international enterprises are based on the area for a long time, Philippe Hugon says from the French Think Tank Iris.
Decided how far and how long the virus will be extended.
In investors, it could be the impression that "what is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus to invest", warns Hugon.
The illness also sustains the slaughtered state budgets of the States
The illness also sustains the non-strainted state budgets of the States concerned.
The Rating Agency Moody is afraid that its budgets are strongly affected by the high expenditure for the health system and, in addition, by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank already agreed to help the health systems of the countries concerned with $60 million ($45 million).
Evidently the effects are already in Nigeria, where only few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
Although the oil region in the southern Nigerdelta has not yet been affected.
However, there are already many people who are fearing at home.
Reservations in hotels also go clearly back.

The NS regime had established the resolution of the Agreement in 1937.
At first in 1964, 19 young men again found the "new" protection agreement "Tannwald" Berngau from the baptism on April 30.
Karl March and Adolf Ried conducted the Agreement as a Protection Meeting at a difficult starting time, in which it was predominantly involved, to find a United Nations and to install the shoot operation.
The shooting agreement in the guest house "Leinger" was prepared in autumn 1965 with two men in the ruinwet battle.
In the following years, the sport protections organized in a medium-sized seven mansions were enabled in all classes until 1. Gauliga.
The agreement was cleaned every year and the magical border of 380 rums was reached first in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
As the performance of active protection has increased, Member numbers have also developed positively.
After the United Nations "Leinger" did not meet the demands of a modern shooting agreement, the current leadership of Johann Rinn has decided to create a future domain in the fields of the new "Landgasthof Ferteis".
On May 8, 1988, Pfarer Strasser for the new shooting rooms gave the church blessings after a work of 2700 hours.
One of the great highlights in the event was certainly the 44th gauge shooting, associated with the celebration of the new shooting fash in July 1991.

Signel speaks Macht Password: Mood will "come clear"
Now, the officers will be clearly recognized.
A free letter for all complex details is not.
Hardly concerns from the CDU against the Pkw smooth have seen the CSU.
The Federal Officer Angela Merkel, after continuing resistances from its CDU, spoke a powerful word to introduce a Pkw mood.
"To say it very clearly: she is in the Coalition Treaty, and she will come," the Party Fine said on Monday after meetings of the CDU specimens in Berlin.
At a detailed model, Merkel did not first stand.
In the black-red government programme, "determined parameters" were called.
Federal Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made a proposal, which is now being worked.
However, the NRW-CDD holds its none to a mood equal to all roads.
Merkel stressed, too, that the Minister of Finance Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) was constructive in the discussions for a draft legislation.
In addition, he talked to Dobrindt about further opportunities to activate more private capital for investment in infrastructure, such as the breadband development.

Genetic disorder frequently diagnosed
One Britishin says she thought that she would die as a result of a loss diagnosis for many years.
Karin Rodgers, almost all of her youth, lived in the faith that she was only a few years after she was diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she was at the Charcot-Marie Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and the backmark.
Charity CMT UK reported that loss diagnoses are a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
About 23.000 people in Britain have probably suffered from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscles, an insecure gang and cracked dent.
Patients also suffer feelings or pain. The disease is unheilable and progressive, which means that symptoms are worse with time.
As Rodgers was 13 years old, she believed that she suffered from Friedreich attack (FA) - a disease with very bad survival opportunities.
Rodgers thought she would sit at the Roll Studio before she was 18 and died before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children who have 51 years today said, "If I knew that I couldn't do the same thing as the other.
I kept out, and everything was longer with me.
I never could walk with the other kids of rollschuld or skateboard and was often in the school because of my type and walking.
Rodgers said she was 13-year-old after several operations to release her skin and strike his feet, when her doctor left the room and read that she was at FA.
"I felt guilty because I was innocent, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, searched for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA community," she said.
When I received the answer, I was shocked and worried in panic.
I thought I'd be with 18 in the Roll Steel and die 25, and soon all my ability would lose.
I did all this alone with me and planted my own dedication.
She said, when she was 17, she was clear that her ability had not taken so strong as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just stood up and angry me and said, "My love, I don't believe that you have that, otherwise you'd be in the Roll Stone."
I think you've got something less than life threatening.
After some genetic tests, CMT was identified.
"If he explained what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has started a CMTwareness module to take attention to this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether works since the closement of the former trumpets as fire workers
Since only ten years, the former trumpets are not shooted on the monks.
Nevertheless, any month, the murdering munitions in the heart of the biosphere area are surrounded by Sweden Alb.
The granates are sometimes so dangerous that they must be cut off.
A horrible snake covers the springs over the heart of the biosphere area.
In December 2004, the latest shooting shooting on the troop of Munsingen was closed by the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.

Taxes of business leisure in the Washington area increased with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax decisions for enterprises in the country were easy in the past year while the economic recovery was accelerated, so a new study published in the past week, and the companys in Washington did not have an exception.
Employees in the area, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid $27.6 billion to public and local posts in the 2013 financial year, increased by 3.8 per cent against the revenue of 2012 by 26.6 billion.
In the past year, the State and local tax rate of enterprises increased by $4.3 per cent to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 per cent in the year, and it was the third growth year following the several years of decrease 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased by 4.3 per cent of local taxes, so the study carried out by the Service Agency Ernst & Young with the Headquarter for State Taxes, a tax policy group.
More than half of the tax revenues in the district, 56%, from undertaking taxes, while 36% of the income from Maryland.
Virginia has reached 28% of the lower tax revenues from companies.
A major increase in tax revenues is based on a recovery of the real estate values of enterprises, and researchers say that it has resulted in an increase in real estate tax increase in 3,7% in this year after the following three years with growth rates less than 1%.
While a large part of these gains from large countries such as California, New York and Texas, the end seems to be met to the Washington room.
Enterprises in the district, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid more than $10 billion for state and local real estate taxes in the past year, compared to $9.6 billion 2012 - an increase in a year's history of 4.2%.
But the likely recovery of real estate values in Maryland is not so effective in increased State and local tax revenues, as the real estate taxes are about only a fifth of the tax decisions of enterprises.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. are almost half of their State and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland, there is a large part of the real estate, especially in the area of D.C., or in the possession of government or non-profit organizations that are not paying real estate taxes", said Douglas Lindholm, director of the Headquarter of State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore able to leave, for example, more on revenue taxes to provide the same services to the other countries.
Recent recovery of tax revenues by companies cannot be calculated alone in the recovery of the real estate market.
Enterprise income seems to be recovered, so the data.
The company in the region reported income taxes in State organizations of $2.3 billion compared to $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion in enterprises taxes, the highest amount of the region.
While the trend goes in the same direction, the local tax charge for companies does not increase equally at all three places.
The rate of increase in the district was 4.3 per cent of the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 per cent.
Only Virginia reported a average tax rate of 4.1 per cent.
Virginia has 6 per cent in all three offices the most lowest income taxes (in all three there are fixed taxes).
The company tax rate in Maryland is at 8,25% and in the district relatively higher 9,975%.
A comparable study of the United States Hungary Chamber at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia, less state and local undertakings are required and in total a better tax climate than in Maryland.
The district has not been investigated in the study.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure by its southern neighbors.
North Carolina has adopted laws to reduce its undertakings in this year by 6,9% to 6%, the same sentence as Virginia, and the rate will be 5% in the coming year.
If the State continues to achieve its income goals in the coming year, this law could reduce the company tax rate of the State until 2017 to 3%.
It seems to be better for the small businesses in Washington's room, and therefore they pay more state and local taxes, so the recent study.
Enterprise taxes paid as private income taxes by small businesses - a transitional structure, which is organized by most small companies - in the district, Maryland and Virginia, in the past year at $20 per cent of $2,4 billion, a significant growth rate of total enterprises.
The researchers say that the trend and increase in enterprises in the whole country will probably be delayed in this year, with a increase in the general multi-based tax revenues for the State and local governments in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period.
Nevertheless, the Washington area could be dealt with if the expenditure of the federal government affects the labour market in the region.

"Beer doesn't need much: good water, grain and life satisfaction," he added at the lunch with the party in Guangzhou.
The joy of life is already out of Mr. Li, and he smiling the guest.
The officer of Guangzhou was accompanied with slaughter shoes - however, with red wine, which was served for the food.
The Chinese Marke Tsingtao returns to German brain art.
Tsingtao beer is used after the German cleaning order.
More Business Trade
A second desire of the Chinese guest would be a airline connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vize-Parteichef Li.
The airhansa offered the flight previously, but in 2012 he was shocked for economic reasons.
"It would be rewarded," the Communal Politics confirmed.
"The business movement between our two cities continues to grow."
The travelers should now take the journey through Changsha in the province of Hungan, complained Li.
The management of the province of Guangdong, whose capital is Guangzhou, also hopes to connect the airport.
The Vice-Governeur of the province, Chen Yunxian, put this desire in his conversation with the social democracy.
"This is a very good idea," she answered, "the Chinese Vice-Minister Li Jinjun, a temporary Kenner Germany, agreed with.
Employed partnership
The charming Vice-Chairman of Guangzhou hopes that he can visit Frankfurt in the next year to a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already on the main, but not yet in this function.
He just came to the office in this year after his department was transported from the office for corruptions.
The local party Wan Qinglian had to go.
The action against the officials of Guangzhou is part of a country-wide campaign against corruption in parts and administratives carried out by head of State Xi Jinping with guards.
Li Yiwei had worked before his participatory workers for a American company, which is most inhabited in the Communist Party of China.
Before his officer in Guangzhou, he worked as a spectacular functioner in Fujian, where the autobuilding VW has created a great work.
Frankfurt has officially entered more than a twenty city partnership.
The connection to the 9000 kilometers away from Guangzhou belongs to those collected from both sides, about with a school exchange.
Last year the 25-year-old existence of the German-Chine connection was celebrated.
The south-Chine Metropole in the Perlfluss is almost strong as its economic power.
In the next year, they would like to reach a brutal domestic product of 250 billion euros, reported Li.
The family of Joan Rivers "prints the daums"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since she was in a hospital house in New York City three days ago, but her daughter has been hopeless today that the 81-year-old comics had come from her disease.
"Thank for your long-term love and support," Melissa Rivers said today in a communication.
We all press the daums.
Her mother was presented sources on Thursday after an emergency because of a cardiac in a clinic at the Upper East Side, New Yorkville Endoscopy Mountain Sinai Hospital.
The doctors keep them sit down and precisely observed until they are more satisfied with their status, which is still described as "prinst".
The reactions came from many pages, even in the form of an overwhelming online support of Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmental friendly steels and increased losses
For cars and steel shops that come from today's trade are futurely more strict environmental standards.
Like refrigerators and washing machines, new steel players receive from 1 September to a label where the buyer can recognize central data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, "Euro 6" strictic oxide values apply to the damage class.
Moreover, there are more money for the buildings: they receive a single minimum loan of 10.25 euros.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1,04 billion
AMAZON confirmed what information was reported on Monday morning: The online single producer and video producer, and a variety of other things - buys the videostreaming service Twitch for $1,04 billion (970 million).
The announcement is surprising, not because no one had expected a transfer of Twitch, but because it was so much shocked that YouTube would buy the company.
Three months ago it looked like the sale of Twitch to the Google video service was decided for a cool milliarder, and the cooperation seemed also natural.
Twitch, founded as Justin.tv three years ago, was started as a general strike service - a Live Version of YouTube.
Instead, it was fast towards a platform for players who wanted to publish their bravo games in games, a "YouTube for life games", so an insider.
The Twitch Switch.
And "let's play", a video generator in which the waters (the most older) play a strike of secret science theaters are already very popular at YouTube.
It is also that YouTube is often called when you want to describe Twitch, so the message that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was slowly included, a book game of an etablished technician company that buys a potential competitor.
It's a race why the YouTube deal was not agreed, as the company was ready to pay as much as Amazon.
Everything we know at the moment is this comment of Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We have decided for Amazon, because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions, and they want to help us reach it quickly."
Another secret is, honestly said, the incredible success of Twitch.
For Snobs like me to explain that they love to be sported as it is difficult to understand the attraction that looks like to look at others at games instead of taking the control console into the hand.
It's one thing to look at a friend at 3 a.m. on the slaughter, while she's smelling by the resident Evil, and something else to see how he's shocked in Call of Duty 20 times in the head.
All these games could look right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are Ego games, so the view can be a good reception for head pain.
I promise that the fast drives in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age are completed all the games in record time are maintained.
But as long as a game or humor virus is there, his Twitch channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do you know skepticers like I already know about it?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet transport spots.
And what exactly does Amazon want to make this money?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch will be integrated as elegant in Amazon Instant Video, how YouTube Twitch could easily be shocked.
But Twitch has something that would like every company: thousands of young men who are converted as advertising.
As the Chairman of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "we both believe in the future of the Gaming," and the media does not show signs of a shock, not even - shock - as a watch sport.
A few of them left on the Sunday at the Heapburg Bay at Burggarten Festival.
The concept of the event was true.
Despite the powerful regens at the Samstag, 1200 music fans came to the open air festival in Burggarten.
Sometimes the entry had to be stopped.
"This was worse," said Ron Sem, one of the organizations.
Salzwede l light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Saachraj and Ron Sem have formed the name Amula.
Because the open air in the Salzweading Burggarten is to extract light on the day and night by several shows.
Well, and the fun comes from alone.
This was already shown on Sunday early when the first visitors were watching open Air.
A festival for all generations had promised the organizations.
And that's their success.
On the basis of the Burggartenvise supply, there were also guests from the nearest and further environments.
They followed the first Live adventures, stripped with the foot in the touch, smooth cooked drinks - short: dispatch clean and Genuss were advised.
And that's what's going on through generations.
While the one on the white sand on the extra cut down on the beach, others lay down at a fourth wine in the Vinothek, the survey on the Heapburg, which was a larger point of association for the smaller guests.
But also when the child lack, the voluntary helpers had to do all the hands in the true sense of the word to become the Andrang Lord and to smell fantastic creations into the small faces.
The sizes used the Kickertic or participated in a skateboard shop that directed the Good Foot Crew from Salzweed.
Before the big rain arrived.
Shortly before 17.30 p.m., he prayed on the visitors, especially the family searched for sweet and swimming.
But the attractiveness of the Festival did not disappear.
"There were more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who said by a "settled on the whole line."
That is why there was nothing to do with a renewing of the great party in the coming year.
Although the content and size of the event must still be worked, the seed was clearly made in a first balance on Sunday towards the population.
He declared that interim the entry had to be stopped.
Of course, the security company was registered with too few forces.
The results: Some who had already paid had no longer come to the extent.
The resonance has been very good.
In a first careful estimation, the Salzweeder coorganizeder spoke of some 1200 visitors who were in Burggart.
There were problems in the technology.
The Salzweeder Hip-Hop-Band Blocks'n'Rox was so depressed.
The technicians were not able to create a half-way intelligent sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the cells could not be brought to Salzweed.
"The next year they will be there", says the event.
The primary of the Amula-Open Air was more than possible from the visitors.
And that's the bad weather.
However, the events have started some mistakes that will be removed during the first time, but they must be removed in the second place.
In the Facebook social network, events must also be criticized.
"Sorry, but for 12 euros you've just been expected more", Melanie Meier expresses on the event page.
"I'm sorry, you've got a little bit," He's a roomman in the same place.
Others are not very close to the initial problems.
I'm very good that some don't just sweat what, but also really try to put something on the legs.
Hut down!", Stephanie Jenisse writes to Amula.
Now the events remain a year to cut these critical points.
New Radom in Berkum: Watchbergs Search marks schrumpft
That's not expected.
Moreover, the ready part of the building is expected to be used in the marking building.
The action is in the context of a greater measure: almost 50 years after the establishment of the world space observer TIRA is completely renewed by the so-called Radom.
The new radom will be lower than the older with a diameter of 47.5 meters.
But the size still remains world reorder.
The last step to complete the new shell is the headtauch
The upper quarter of the old shell is disappeared and taken with a crown.
Then the last quarter of the new shell will be set.
If the weather plays, the action is to go through the bridges at the beginning of this week.
Participants at the Ice Bucket Challenge decreased Kiefer
Isabelle Roberts from Britain shouted so much as her heat water was shocked over her head that she hurted the skin structure of her face.
This Ice Bucket challenge was painful further.
A woman was sent to the hospital after she had so much crying at the Ice Bucket challenge that she was cut off the kitchen.
Isabelle Roberts from Britain grew so much as her heat water was shocked over her head that she hurted her face structure.
"The water was so cold that I cryed, and while I did, my cup remained simple," she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is protected by the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts some seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that didn't go, the kiefer was cast, and then I understood that something wasn't true.
My mother and my sister also saw that, and they were almost laughing in the hose, but I had to be in the ambulance.
The 20-year-old boys from Britain were sent to the hospital in order to return to the kitchen after the participation in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The Clip was linked to a Internet sensation and a thousand times on Facebook and Twitter.
Are Burgvereine back to a spring?
Lastly, there was a strike between the two Wolf Ratshauser Burgvereins.
Now, the situations of a possible cooperation are considering.
As an example for the reconstruction of the Wolf Ratshauser Burg, the murdered Richard Dimbath, former President of the Wolf Ratshauser Burgfriend, introduced the project in the French Guédelon.
Another year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgborn and the Burgfriend Wolf Houses.
It seems different to the point of view of the history of the Wolf Ratshauser Burg and a possible reconstruction.
Now the two camps are moved to each other: there must be a very short discussion on a common action.
This confirms the arrangements of Torsten Sjöberg (Bugverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfriend) on request of our newspaper.
"I called Mr. Piffl and proposed that we can join once," reports Sjöberg.
His view is that all the members of the two Verine could be back to a strand in the future.
This is how rapidly visible successes are to be shown.
While the Burg friends had a rebuilding of the Burg on the mountain wood in the last time, the "Resolution and Exploration" of the floor was the first place for the Burgborne over Sjöberg.
Herbert Piffl, second Chairman of Burg's friends, has been very pleased in its own information on the call.
Since Dimbath's death, he's predicting the Burg's friends.
A new Chairman will be found in a membership in the middle of September.
At the moment, the Agreement is referred to in the 74-year-old of about 40 members.
"After my friend Richard Dimbath died, we have first let the unity activities from respect." This "Denkphase" was needed to "reason the way it could continue."
According to Piffl, the new President will then go to the discussion with the Burgbone.
To this end, the Burg friends could also make a current stimulation image within their grouping.
A candidate for the Presidency is still not, says Piffl.
"Are I'm certain that someone will be found." He doesn't want to claim himself because he has his stay in Bad Tölz.
The new Chairman should be a Wolf Council House.
The Tölder wants to continue to work on the project.
The different positions in matters of reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffls in the next time.
He loved Dimbath as "Missionary", who always believed in the reconstruction of the Burg.
Two similar, long-term projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an air lock.
With a high participation of the population and by voluntary helpers from all the world, they were a tourist champagne.
Piffl: "I was skeptic at the beginning.
But in the course of time, I have been more convinced that it is sensitive to advance the project." It can be created a "all-set-mark" for the city of relief.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be financing by EU supports, visitors and potential sponsors, believed Piffl.
"The idea of the reconstruction is why I don't just want to turn on the board." He hopes that the Burgborne may move something in this point.
Their purpose to document the story first is "that's important and good."
Then you could look forward.
Clevere ways to spend at Uni-Learning Books
Since the costs for UNI-Learning Books for many students are more than 1.000 dollars per year, the fast-interface student Matt Schroeder was a clear sparidee.
He obtained a free system for books of students higher seeds and boxed a named deprivation to delay the revenge.
"My mathematician book costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a seventh and a chick-fil-A Keks," said Schroeder, 19, which visits the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required for the last seed would cost $430, he said.
He's got $ 120 out.
The colleague reported that the students in the average estimated more than $1,200 annually for teacher books and research materials that it had different cost-reducing options for students.
Online and creative approaches such as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution to the choice for students.
The rent of teacher books will be popular, and so students can use a book long, often to a clearly favourable price than to buy.
Nebo Inc, who works with more than 250 university books, shared that the mix of textbooks had doubled since 2011.
Inquiries in the industry show that about a fourth of the books were mixed in the college books in the past spring session, Nebos Vice-President Tevor Meyer said.
Instead of half of all teacher books are purchased in Campus books after the report of the National Association of College Stors.
Here's the one for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books are online only a third of the price for which they are in the campus book load.
The nineth version of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but it can be paid for $239.99 for the specialized book member Chegg.com for $239.99.
Used purchase
If one of the notes of other or normal use samples does not represent anything, use books are a good option.
"Calculus" is used to have $93.49 for Chegg.com.
Matt Casaday, 25, a final student at the Brigham Young University, says that he issued on Amazon.com 42 cents for the use of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End of the Advertising Business".
The book was renewed for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, director of the University of Massachusetts at the Amherst College Without Walls recommended students to ask for their teachers whether previous expenditures are allowed.
Sometimes the updates for seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases, older expenditure may often be obtained for a burden of costs for the latest expenditure.
Besides Chegg and Amazon is also halff.com from eBay Inc a popular alternative for useful books.
Measures
The rent of teacher books is a translation if you treat them somewhat well, thinking to give them back and you don't want to keep the books after the course.
You can escape more than 80% of the costs of a newly bought book.
For example, a student could provide "Calculus" for the duration of a semister for about $20.
Information about the provisions of the business in which you are offering, including the penalties that are affected by ggf. for the writing of notes, subsistence or use samples.
Meeter adjusted: If you don't return the book, the penalties may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-books
E-books also instead of common teaching books are an option.
Sometimes these books are actually measured by providing an electronic license for a certain period of large leaders such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
With Chegg, "Calculus" for about $ 61 for 6 months.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers, since many classics today can be downloaded freely, while scientific and engineering teachers can be much more cost.
Look at any case.
Joe Gault, 29 who will first visit the Pepperdin Law School, recommends the ISBN number for the price determination in books, as you can be safe to find the right teacher book.
And before a online order, you should check whether the book is really predicted.
This lesson he learned on the hard tour.
He purchased a book that had four weeks of delivery time and finally paid the full price in the college book load.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" didn't become a caster
"The Expendables 3" of Sylvester Stallone played less than 30 million dollars his $90 million budgets in the United States while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" just $12 million of its budgets of 70 million.
The "Seex Tape" movie on Cameron Diaz played at the opening weekly only 14.6 million dollars, while children's films like "Drachens" also make 2" in recessions.
A article of the telegraphic film critic Robbie Collin states that in the films of the lack of quality in the films itself could be the reason.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" for children's films and described "Drachens 2" as pure "functional" fantasy continued.
However, in films for some older target group, it seems to be if the quality of the films is not unlikely the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and metacritic evaluation for each summer film that was shown between the American Memorial Day and 20 July 2013 and at least 2000 Leinwands in the past year.
The results are based on the view of cinematizers and film critics and pointed out that this year's films are equal to those of the last year.
Some comments believe that the development to changed visions and the growing popularity of web-streaming services, such as Netflix.
Governor Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's shortly appearing Dschungelbook film, said to the website Hollywood Reporter: "I think that the times are changed."
We need to accept this and do not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the current weak results of Hollywood productions, Netflix has recently achieved transactions with the cost of $1,2 billion, almost doubled as in the past year, in which the amount of $837 million.
In the past summer, the director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studys that they focused too much on comics shocks and prophecies a Hollywood smell.
In the light of the current abstention, some comments argued that his deep prophecy could contain a true nuclear.
Based on the potential avengers expected in summer 2015, including Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline of the cash results as simple "cyclic" and said to Hollywood reporter: "The next summer will be the biggest summer at the kinokase, and no one will be worried about the business."
When a few years ago, the second district class has been cut to punishment of the ligament, this has been a step in the right direction.
Now the German Tisschtennis Association has taken an additional 3th federal link into the programme.
The result: Whoever has not been resurrected is cut off.
Thus, the top-class team Torpedo has avoided the decree in the Oberliga Republic, but only five-classful plays in the coming season.
Quarter classic remains Torpedos ladies, despite their great demarche in the regional link.
The boys and girls of Torpedo started in the Niedersachsensenga, as well as the boys of the SC walk.
The SG Lenglers and Torpedo Reserves are in the new association link, in the country's liga there are no divine clubs anymore.
The TTV Geismar plays in the Liga, the Torpedo range in the country's Liga.
What the composition looks like a better district class, now the new district sovereign liga is South.
Here TSV Seuges, VfB loddingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Inbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Large hair, the FC Weser and the TTC.
In the district of Liga, the regional representative of Dransfeld and the SC channels are playing as a representative of the TTV Geismar II and the SC, in the district class of the TTC II, Red Weiss, the Bovender SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III. At least the side liga of the ladies begins in the Solar Struck.
Counterers, TTC and TTV Geismar II are here with the party.
In the district liga, Torpedo III and Satellite Houses/Wolf Mars houses start.
With your nine mansions
The SC switch sends his girls to the small district liga.
Also, the SCW Jungs's central liga stage is not completely starting there Torpedo II.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Pass and the Bovender SV go to the season.
In the first season of the newly established regional association, the two divines start with the nine manages.
In the western stage the Red Weiss II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Millennium Houses and SG Lenglern II.
In the Eastern Staff, play satan houses/well seahouses, Nikolausberg and landscape houses.
The Krien-Liga consists of satan houses/wolmarshauses II, Balshauses, Heavens, Seulingen II, Tuspo Pass and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the circle of Osterode, where there are no lady teams anymore on the circle.
In the event that no one of the six second crust classs reaches soil power, the innovative and wide circle must have been thinking once.

Hotel village after second season seed on place three of the table.
With the 2:0 over Grodig, a worst week on Sunday has ended.
"The victory is very free", said Trainer Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached a interim depth in Europe League on Thursday.
"The success was insecurely important," captains and torches confirmed Hofmann, who predicted with green-wess on place three.
Schrammel-Tradutor makes speed on the victory road speed has shown the right reaction to the distortion against Helsinki and goes with a successful experience in the country-spause.
"We wanted to show a positive response," said the Foreign Defended Thomas Schrammel, who tried to win with his magnificent leadership volley in the 14th minute.
"I thought I had the whole place of Thursday and smelled him under the latte," said the 26-year-old girls laughed.
On 13 November 2010, the slaughter had taken the last time in a federal liga party, it was still for Ried.
The first mastership strike in the speed chair will therefore remain in a special memory.
"For me it's something very special, I'm already out of the fast nearby," Schrammel said.
On the basis of the short-term skin blue of Mario Pavelic, the left smell turned from the left to the right defense side and made it very good there.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise this position.
He won the gate, he has already paid some assists", loving Barisic.
Manage shows the Character Schrammel also delivered the flank at 2:0 by Hofmann to a good hour that finally took the decision.
Because before, they could also write the guests.
"Thank you today, thank you, we have made something luck", also observed the smell, which played on the interconciliation of performance and results in the past weeks: "The results have not voted, but the player was always good in comparison with the last year."
Barisic even found that you were "in many games better than today" - against "the strongest manage played in this season".
The first three points since 26 July have therefore proved that the Manager's composite was instantly encountered: " Today my manage has shown that she has characterized."
It's not less joyful for him: "It's what we finally played to be zero."
A lot of work during the country's playpause also showed that with Brian Berendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger were several deficiencies, and Mrs. Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their initial departments, making the victory even more valuable.
"Don't forget this," powerful Barisic, who lost in the past three days with humility and Pavelic players, "the last time were very stable."
Consequently, the country's pause should be used to "speak and put a bit in the physical area" stated Barisic, which has five U21 wavelengths in its lines.
One who is probably located in the pause is Captain Hofmann.
He's struggling for the manity, and it's about pain.
Even in this serious phase, he has shown that he is a very important player for us", observed Barisic.
Hofmann gave the game speed before his movement in 68. minutes not only the structure but also reached the second door.
For the 33-year-old boys who completed his 350th federal Liga game, it was the first part of the game since 2 November 2013 (4:2 over the Admira).
Hofmann: "Don't believe that it's all right now" "We have certainly got a little luck, but at once the luck must also come back to us.
Now it was the highest time," said Hofmann.
He could not always see it black and white.
We haven't played as bad in the last few weeks.
But we shouldn't even believe that everything's okay now.
The importance of his role for the team was not possible.
It's a very young man, which I can help very much at the moment.
They're in some phases to meet me," said Hofmann.
Growd-coach Michael Baur had little predicted himself and his manity.
He regretted the rapid opposite "of the Category Zavertor", as well as the regular gate of use in the 40th minute, which was renowned by Schiedsdirector Collector.
The only project I can make the mansion is that we have not been sufficiently concrete in some phases.
There's too little decisions.
Inside defender Maximilian Karner saw it similar: "It has just started badly, but then we found clean and even a gate.
In great and whole, it would have been more than it.
Under this wheel, Ruth ruled
We showed a powerful stage at our summer series "My part of the routine happiness" last Friday.
Many of these trees are still in the country crystal, the illustrated example is the "spiel" overward of education burns.
A holprener walk leads to the age of about 600 years of eggs.
It's over to coppers, basalstone shops and basestone seas.
A piece below the stone brush from the Bauersberg, a kilometer north of the street to Weisbach, where it is.
Vital looks like the natural dental, it slows over the other trees of the area and remembers a width of over eight meters to a American mammud tree.
A small Buddha on a tree stomach points that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
However, despite intensive research, there was only a reference to the names.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has also consulted the Bishopsheim Archive and asked older people from education burns to find out what kind of use it has with the beast.
The result of his surveys remained the right to more useful declaration for the name.
Thus, by about 80 years ago, the skin rings should have made their animals of education burns out of the possibly slaughtered and freed from stones.
At the foot of the tree, the animals who were covered by the shooting should have been cut off.
In the meantime, the area has rewarded its importance, since the Virgins are actually swinging back.
The area has also been declared to the nuclear zone of the Biospheren Reserve, and the neighbor has further found.

Putin requires the registration of "State discussions" with the Eastern Obligator
The Russian President Wladimir Putin requested Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian government sets the fight against the separators in the west of the country directly with negotiations on "statute" of the abstract region.
His speaker Dimitri Peskow later cleared that Putin did not have to do so that the Eastern Obligator's control would be a part of Russia, but that his status towards Ukraine should be re-defined in order to give the Russian language region the power to develop its rights and interests.
Putin's appeal to the Kiewer Government on negotiations with the pro-Russian surgeon, however, takes the strategies that appeared to be followed for the separators in the introduction of regions and pressure to the Ukrainian government in order to enable the new proclaimed region Novorossia facial independence for a alian with Russia instead of engaged in the West.
In an interview with the state television channel One of the Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to restore the regions held by separaters in the eastern Donezk and Luhansk, which were adopted in March and April after the ukraine halfbine Krim was adopted on March 18, March.
The cream and the separatists have recently described the area as "Novorossija" or "Neurussland", which reminds the prerevolutionary green period of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who are on the route of the Ukrainian politicians for elections on 26 October and while the governments' civil communities in the areas held by separatists were "obtained in their illusions", Itar Tass reported.
"We need to take immediate discussions, not only on technical issues, but also to the political organization of society and the state of the South to make the interests of the living people there", he said.
Peskow said that Putin's reference to the State in the context should be seen with the greater autonomie that has been discussed for months by the Kiewer leadership to destroy fears in Russian language areas that their cultural and speaking rights are threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can provide the necessary autonomy in Eastern regions, said Peskow.
It is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskow, "for it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but for an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the creml speaker on the correction of the "fill interpretation" of Putin's comments stressed the Russian leadership's request during the interview with the separatistic rebellion in the East, on the contrary to the direct analysis of the Crime, where most of the two million Ethnian people are.
Moscow had been larger difficulties to adapt the regions of Donezk and Luhansk in the eastern bond, since most of 6.5 million people are not Russians and investigations from the time before the conflict produce a wide majority of the remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy, called by Russian diplomates on international forums, would give the regional governments in Ukraine fully to negotiate their own trade agreements and foreign relations, and thus gives the Kreml a control over a territory binding the Russian State territory with the Crime.
The halfbinsels accepted five months ago in the black sea are the home ports for most of the Russian marine, as well as a major trade chain and the historical coast region.
The regions between the Rostow region in Russia and the Crime are also rich to mines, manufactures and geese, which are the important components of the Russian military.
The Ukrainian President, Peter Poroshenko, proposed that, on 7 June, Ukrainian legislation should take into consideration the Constitutional Supplements, with which the regions are undertaken more control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his imagination of autonomy seems to be deeply contrary to those of the cream and the separatistic rebels whose weapons and resurrection Moscow are predicted.
Putin's last invitation to negotiate with the separater leaders on the eye, following another front of the rebels in the past week after the Russian troops and panzers over the previous peaceful region along the African sea were entered into the eastern bond.
The separatists supported by Russia, which, according to the fears of Ukrainian security officers, is the first step of a campaign to overcome the strategic coast region to Crime, the control of Nunoasowsk.
For this reason, massive civil and military preparations have been made to confirm Mariupol, a steel industry port with 500,000 people, which is between Nuoasowsk and the weak access to half-binsel Crime.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and asked urgently to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We are just before a point where there is no more back," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign panzers are now located on the Ukrainian territory.
The EU Meeting decided no concrete action that the leadership requested further sanctions against Russia to enter into force in an unspecified scala of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to turn back from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian panzer colonies and 1.000 soldiers last week in the Donetsk region to support the disappointed separators, Oberst Andrich Lysenko, speaker of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council reports on Saturday in Kiew.
The first 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were closed by the Russian accident in Ilowajsk were disappointed on Sunday 10 Russian shields who were arrested in the Ukrainian area on Sunday, shared Lysenko on Sunday.

Radler, Jogger and Wanderers last night, at the 8th Radeln on the Great Fieldberg, supported the Convention "Help for Krebs Hospital Childs".
The tour, for which one was a tour, was a easy training for others.
However, in one of them, they were all alone: it made fun.
Thomas Studanski should have sleeped good night.
Because his first time in his life, the chief of the Supreme Brauhause, last night, went with the Rad on the camp.
For the good purpose.
The small muscle card can easily get away, so that he has also made a valuable knowledge of the participation of the 8th Radeln to the Great Fieldberg Agreement for the “Help for Cranks Hospital Childs”.
That's a good thing.
"I know now that I can - well!"
Small powders walking in the Applaus course?
No, if I had stopped, it would have been out of...
As Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Capital City parliament, four of the 718 participants last morning arrived in mountains and arrived near the creation, but rejoiced on the plateau.
However, it was easier to overcome the 11 miles long road between the Highmark and Fieldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The whole red green policyers from the Circuit Day - Red Dress, Red Bike - made something on the start of understood ("Every quantity of professionals, there is the goal!"), but then it appeared on the mountain as a half proi and went to 45 minutes without breathing through the target.
He is also walking in a rush, as well as Nina Kuhn, President of the city of Oberursel, who had been on the way together with Frank Greeneisen.
For the two triathletters, the "Feldberg Radeln" wasn't uncertainly a sportive challenge: "This is about Charity, where we'd like to be with it - an exit we had done without the rest of the evening," says Kuhn.
They had taken Paul Wenzel from the top rifenberg.
The boy (12) was moved to the top in the morning to strike back to the height.
Frankfurter Florian Zierz was shooting at 9 a.m. home home, "moving" the field twice to get home with fun.
It's fun with "Fritten Toni".
For the chief of the overseas Kurtkiosks Radtors are simply over the fieldberg.
He was assembled with his 6.5-kilo-renrad 40 minutes.
A crazy event.
For this purpose, I like it," Andreas Balzke said.
The trained maintainer says that he is a "ambitioned radar."
It must be, because he was on the "fixe-radio" walking, that's also rather racing, but without shoot...
What it went up without rad locker, not only the 20 wallers that sloped over the white wall and the flight station to the hill, but also a jogger who sloped a car swimming behind on a corde.
Bergwacht-Arzt Professor Volker Lischke, who with his team, equipped with Allrad-Bully and Quad, for safety, said, "I know" from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sliding trail, just that he keeps the slipper itself." Hence, he is certainly his own dog.
The 718 participants - and so many as ever - were sent to groups in the morning.
The wallers first at 9.30 p.m.
The first rail drivers and drivers followed at 10:00 p.m.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers left.
Bent Hansen, Chairman of the Convention "Radeln on the Great Fieldberg", gave the starting commands and wished the participants to fly.
For the next year, he hopes that it is possible to switch the roads to the fieldberg to the security of the participants.
