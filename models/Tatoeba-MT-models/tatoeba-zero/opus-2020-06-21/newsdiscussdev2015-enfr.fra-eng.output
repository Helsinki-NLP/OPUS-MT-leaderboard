It looks like it's a typical rumby club.
In an English university, maybe...
Don't see anything with the rushby clubs I know in NZ.
But that doesn't justify anything, right?
Of course not, but the premise that says it's known in the ruby is all of all...
Yes, finally we are not interromping the prayers of the musulmans and we are not cut the nail of someone during the drinking games (except if it is part of the game), but we are effectively cut in black for some nights cast.
I have never played a drink game based on Nazi theme.
Yeeha and Ride the Bus suffice.
I left a similar comment on the previous article because the language and the feelings expressed in the first year-year-old students were very typical.
That says, this new information leaves me no doubt that they're far far away from myogyan mixtures and the smuggles under the imprisonment of alcohol that are often associated with university rumby teams.
The incident with the Muslim students shows that they're trying to produce the maximum.
You really don't know anything to the Ruby clubs.
But let's go, why let your damages and your stereotypes hinder the facts?
I think that the LSE Rúbi team is cut from old students from these schools for which the competitive ruby is a tradition.
Otherwise, old kids of the private.
It is very different from those playing in rumby in NZ, very different attitudes.
So "misogyne pleasing" are acceptable?
It seems to be the rouby club of my university, I never saw racial behavior, but the nucleus courses through the campus, the flight, the smuggling of goods and the mixture were all part of the game.
Absolutely not.
I'm sorry I didn't have explained it in my last comment.
You can see it otherwise: you say your own body is partly composed of this ancient water.
I'll win in seenity.
ancestral therefore also this interstellary cloud (eight, not traditional:)
@lux You haven't read the article: a small half of your stool water has more than 4,6 billion years...
Yes, we can shoot when even consider that the fleet of the skin has a medium more than 2,3 billion years, that's not so bad that
A sacred feet of nails to disasters and refrigerators of any pool that predicts the end of the oceans and water resources, while this water has always existed.
An unreasonable evidence that heat has been stopped 20 years ago (see the outstanding work of Serge Ferry financed by Total and Areva).
@manon too: What is a evidence that heat has been stopped?
I don't see the link.
I think Manon Troppo's comment is irone.
Hey, and for the second degree and irony you have what as a signaling?
So you do not understand much about ecological problems.
It is not question for the "katastrophists" as you are saying to worry about the destruction of the ocean, but instead of the reduction of human water reserves (you know the milk water that represents less than 1% of the total water reserves on our planet).
And then more generally, it is not the most threatening climate refrigeration for our species, but especially the reduction of small or not renewable resources (gas, oil, rare metals) which support our lives modes of more golden.
With regard to the study you quote and whom you are doing the generous efforts to quote the source, it is naturally little doubt of the validity of the conclusion.
With regard to the soft water problems, I raise you the French are far from being concerned xD Next you have to stop considering ecology as a fat dogma, the ozone swimming smell is being slowly referring to you (siming to 100% to 2050 at the current rythm).
ecology yes, religiously dogmatic and irrelevant ecology, not thanks.
"And it must stop considering ecology as a fat dogma, the ozone swimming snake is being shocked," Yes, finally it's not like it was a spontaneous movement that wouldn't come from nothing.
@martin: I just want to specify that climate warming is a need for because if we eject CO2 too much our land is going to be like Venus.
A steel that through the oxygen action will capture the heat without freeting it and which in a swimming circle will accelerate the switch process in an exponential way.
Have someone seen direct action until now?
Or the less sign indicated that 10 000 good men would come to the ground to plant trees and to do what a green army should be done, what could it be?
It's not me!
In the small brain of Abbott, maybe send the RAAF to the Middle East is its version of a direct action.
We're going to get back, that's sure.
When are they going to get out of the village's idiot?
The latest revelations that vegetation would consume 16 % of CO2 more than any climate model allows to give priority to replant.
It is not logical, because CO2 is the food of plants that are most abundant in nature, and it is necessary to preserve the flower throughout the world.
It seems that this scientific fact has never been put on the plate.
Have you seen the green army somewhere?
Don't do anything, good government.
CO2 levels increased from 280 ppm to 400 ppm and the rate is growing, your argument of plant food is only a fatal distraction.
And before you launch your drink against the Dooms wall, the most abundant grain is not CO2 but nitrogen and sulfur.
The most abundant of biogenerated materials may be carbon, but it does not mean that it is the most abundant grace, so Silverhead's argument is failing and worth being ridiculized.
Direct Action is a thick, because nothing can happen again.
The LandCare budget has been severely reduced and this money is now expendied by the Verte Army.
The problem is that instead of investing the money where it was the most profitable, it is now invested where he will receive the most advertising to make the liberals return to marginal electors.
Your contribution, on the contrary, gives the price of ignorance, good champion.
SilverHead, when there are too many CO2 in the air, plants perform less than photosynthesis and contain less nutrients.
This means that animals and people must eat them in a much greater amount to benefit from their nutritional benefits.
The fact that this deputy is pueral is a clearness.
To date, it has not presented academic strict certificate that prevents the discharge of rules of XVIIe.
For this reason, to sanctify him and not Tevenoud, it is incomprehensible for not worldwide, even though the AN Regulation is not a fiscal treaty.
That this lady in the whole case is not to his honor, it appears especially as hisstery.
If Mitterrand had sent all those who pronounced Mitran...
I remember that during the debate on the feminization of the names, the "Academia" was obsessed: "I'll tell Mrs. the guard or guard of the Sceau" (which has never been busy by a woman).
Awesome machism!
"Political Alliance."
The swimming bag, the back corner of the Republic, the margot of the operating tangents, the illusion table, etc...
But the sum of gladiators, people who take real risks, good grace, badly grateful.
Qd the Phallocratic Unit was on the label and parliamentary regulation, in turning to the + elementary civility under the false paraplel of good ways, sanctions apply to him "the quality" for its partial heading and the measuring of the political allies.
The behaviour of this Member is not normal or worthy of his position.
It is a provocation to speak about him.
As long as he was unknown now, he can now be honoured to be known as it is known for all cancer of a primary class.
The academy of goods and the deputy are sensitive to the pocket...
UP should be able to resolve its internal problems and stop producing skins and skins.
The Academy has good two, especially when it is done to tell him what she doesn't say.
This deputy is a college in full adolescence crisis, which makes a provocation and whose fellow believers, in delegation, will see the Principal to cancel colleague hours.
and by defending it on the basis of a text they have not even read!
Women have not even 15 per cent of the signatories of the UMP tribe.
Mr. Judge, I call two experts to a few thousands of years separate.
That's why I like to pass time with animals.
The joy they feel when they play is so clear and attractive.
Dogs, dauphins, bathrooms, horses, they do all stupid things for the simple joy that they buy.
On the contrary, it seems that we had the majority of our 80 years to work, move us and make the shops.
What strange phase we have reached - we are able to multiplie our life period, but we are going to pass the majority in the sweet.
How did we get there?
Thanks to the illusion that is anthropomorphism.
The game is a metal communication.
Come on.
It's always a illusion.
Moreover, the "communication" requires a shared symbol system.
A hard concept for you, maybe?
I think the concept of inter-specific communication is not compatible with your faith.
That's true.
I can see when a dog wants to play and I can communicate to the dog I would like to play – basic body language.
After that, there is a variation that indicates whether the game is a course, a object to go to search, etc.
It is not difficult and there's no anthropopomorphics – although I agree to the idea that we are seeing a lot of conneries on animals that are in “speaking” while they're just on communicating.
Perhaps the game is not just "utilized" (that may be, or not), it is just something that exists.
For instance, David Graeber is the opinion that " there is a principle of game on the basis of any physical reality".
"If he had learned to school that a woman isn't an object, he may not have been violented." Maybe yes, hope makes life...
Thank you for giving you the opportunity to live, to be healthy, and today to answer a article when you should drink the information without reacting it just 15 years ago.
Generally, I am not against ideas, and I would even tend to be sufficiently enthusiasmed by those who seem to be fooled first.
But when you see what many have stood about their school education, especially among the most likely public to make women attacks, my enthusiasm does not find the lower start of an abortion point.
"the public the most likely to make women attacks" would like to be a little more.
Or instead, no, it's good, we're understood.
And yes, the reality doesn't always feel the rock, even though it does not correspond to your thought schemes.
It is true that the dore juvenile of Neuilly and other beautiful neighbors do not listen much in class.
She prefers playing on her iphone6.
Evry's ungod juvenile too!
If the reactions weren't reacted, Twitter would no longer propose to follow Le Pen and Sarko in the first choice.
I have learned nothing from all this at school and I never violated anyone (and it's not in my intentions).
Do you think I'm lucky?
Unless I had parents to teach me some values....
The micro-society of the family is the learning of social life.
How to take the reading of life when we can't read?
Are young socialists going to baile schools to teach women's equality?
It would be more effective than make moral mounts on Twitter, but it should be out of beautiful neighbors...
Grow this campaign.
They're null everywhere, but to give moral lessons, it's still the best.
Everything looks like photographic, but I want to see the bread in a head.
There's a bleeding here on the fact to use his bread.
The article of this week isn't going to be mole.
It's not the time to make smells around the bread, man!
A little sensitivity!
You have done a double word game with the word "naan" to refer to a grandma.
60 books for this?
It would not even be filled with a 90-year-old age in a retirement house.
How do we pay more, less in the seat?
Because the quality of experience is not necessarily measured to the weight or number of heats, as the quality of a film or part is not determined by its length.
Yeah, I agree with you.
But why should good food be served in parts that would not even satisfy a mine?
It has no sense, and it's just a delegated policy to buy you more plates.
Of course it must not be like that.
The Sportsman in Seasalter at least is a very good restaurant where parts and prices are both reasonably high.
You pay more because you've still hungry after several mini plates.
More you pay, more you have chances to receive a child's part ready with art in your seat.
At least they made the effort to put nappes.
So when I want to go to a decent restaurant in New York, you're telling me I'd have to go to a restaurant in London...
Maybe you should try one of the many other (excellent) restaurants in York before decided that London is the only place on Earth where you can develop good plates?
Is Manif for everyone only a Catholic and Muslim movement.
Yes, that's good: a kind of assembly of homophobes.
But it's not just that.
There are also athles and humanists who do not want modern systems of "children manufacturing".
A child should not be high in a battery or manufactured by a technological device.
Battery?
From where you get this out of here.
And if you respond any technical intervention in the "fabric" must claim the prohibition of the PMA for historical pairs, it would be the worth of coherence.
I also surprised that the manif claimed "for all" has not yet this logical revendication to its attractive catalogue.
It is exact that these are not the only catholics that express: the other religions also, Jews, Muslims, Protestants.
This was put, it is even useful to remember that these different churches were opposed to all the developments of the society: in 1865 (and I am joining G.
Kauffmann) a bishop, Mr. Dupanloup forced himself against the will of the gvt to grant girls to the school just as "the family defence".
We're always in the same scheme.
And more recently, the same channels have led to civilization and family destruction when school became mixed.
This is the credit that you can grant to the positions of these people.
Don't need to be catho to shut up the marketing of winds and kids...
All this is in the right line of the decade of Western civilization, more and more contested by others!
For me, freedom is stopped by others: yes, at the recognition of homosexual couples who have the right to love both others.
But not tolerate that the child is a mixable object.
And this is also valid for GPA hesters.
I can't just love this guy, nor recognize his results.
If he had a better control of the ballon and knew to avoid smoking stupidity moments, he could be a more popular player.
Furthermore, I am sure that any other attacker, in addition to Heskey, who plays so many matches for England, will cumulate a number of objectives.
Imagine how many targets Peter Crouch would have marked if you had given him more than 42 selection in national team...
I can't be in dealing, at least not Categoricly:) Since this article speaks of the purposes he has marked, I will not talk to other things he brings, especially to ManUtd (which RvP, Mata, Kagawa would not bring or bring anything), but maybe that it would be another reason for his gain was much more widely selected than, we say, Peter Crouch.
Botham77 hoddle1 October 2014 12h48 Recommendation 119 It's in the way to criticize Rooney at this time so you can forgive you too.
This says it is good to take into account that since he signed with Manchester City in August 2011, Aguaero marked 56 goals and makes 23 decisional passes in 93 matches.
At the same time, Wayne Rooney marked 59 targets and makes 32 decisionary passes in 96 matches.
So many people will have to find another apology to take it to our Wazza because its field statistics are excellent.
Moreover, "Wazza" is a good reason to ridiculize it.
I am obliged to ask if you really look at the foot or if you think that Peter Crouch A) would be worth so much selections that Rooney and B) would mark as much goals if he had so much selections.
I really don't understand where the criticism of Rooney's capacity as a footballer comes.
The most difficult, it is to be regularly selected in the country's team for 13 years, and to continue...
Are you seriously comparing the football qualitys of Wayne Rooney to Peter Crouch?
Do you do this without blagueing?
There are really people completely on the mass.
Please also note for your government that Rooney has not always been the pre-center machine for English purposes during his carrière in the English team.
Instead of that, he played the previous retirement, the role of Beardsley/Sheringham.
He played behind players such as Michael Owen, Mr. Crouch that we mentioned above, Jermain Defoe, and more recently Daniel Sturridge.
You've forced to write this in blaguing.
In a country where the weapons port is tolerated and in a state where 71 per cent of people have a weapon, I find it totally shyzophrine and paradoxal.
And then those of this school are not just all agreed with the arms port license in the United States!
the use of crayon is always self-suicided.
Stop the kitchen: the girl's 5 years old.
How many kids play with facial guns at this age at our home?
Is that actually powerful murderers for such a thing?
Although the weapon port is in the United States Constitution and it is strongly influenced by the country's culture, I do not believe that the rich children are sensitively different from ours.
A little good sense and reason to be guarded.
It's a disarming process!
Come back!
The information about this different fact is insufficient to assess whether this little girl really has, or does not, premits to the gust of the morbide.
Can we go out of the principle that a series killer can't have a weird behaviour at the age of 5 years?
If people need psychiatrists, they're more smooths of this school than students!
That parents get their kids out there: it's in danger!
Completely agreed.
Those who manage this school are clearly ill.
Your reaction is the most relevant.
Alabama is not the most representative state of the United States but is actually part of it.
What an incomprehensible country!
His relative youth?
These blue clouds that men have nothing to do with a entrepreneur!
What did Alan Sugar or Richard Branson bring to their career at the beginning?
In their first photos, Lord Sugar had a long sweet bathroom, and Sir Richard Branson had a rolled ball.
I can't come too much because I never looked at that, but it seemed like so sweet and without soul.
I don't think it's what he wanted to say.
Maybe it's wrong, maybe?
But what's it looks depressing!
You got me down.
I would have thought that a major knowledge of the English would be an outstanding for business.
I ask what Mr. Bjayou do these days.
Perhaps he said, "Ostracifying," he wanted to mean "alinear".
That would be logical.
No, I thought it was what he wanted to say, but ostracting hasn't always a sense.
In the worst, if all candidates lived as Carmen Miranda and that Sugar had a green cost, it could be advanced that their intention was to obsolete it.
But here, no.
It seems to have been corrected – strange. Maybe the whole phrase has been invented!
That's not strange.
Haha, who knows what he could say?
Really nothing, but someone wanted to quote something...
So yes, the word used in the article was well “ostracting” which would not absolutely mean anything.
The rate of shock in the United States has still slowed, about 6 per cent.
I never saw it since 2001.
The prices of the essence are low in all States.
The American economy, with Obama, continues to strengthen.
Who's better?
You have a very short view...
Their economy becomes "soutenable"?
To live there at this time, I will say that the United States will approach little exploitation as inequalities become poor.
The political system is literally intended by the financing of election campaigns.
Racial tensions, police violence, mass incarceration are wide that it is not imagined in Europe but Americans keep an incredible optimism in the future of their country and their country!
To when?
This is the main question.
A few days ago, English financial environments said that France was lost.
Now, it's the Americ that's on his roof.
Happy, there will always be the UK to save the world.
Another of these articles that simply forget the essential.
The level of consumption of the American economy is no longer sustainable...
Debts and shops couldn't even give the change...
On the ground of the earth-based resources and the growing needs of the rest of the planet.
And strongly the weakest and poorest, a very large majority of citizens, will "beat" or instead die.
I can't blame this Farrage.
Will the Labour finally understand that his cynical and delegated policy importing competitive voters from the foreigner makes him still more tolerated in his home?
Maybe I don't think.
Multiculturalism and diversity must continue forward to any price.
LOL was to enjoy our American masters and continued their cold war with Russia.
Honest performance of the Labour, Ed Milliband is in the mouse, it plays 617 votes.
How much Clacton 11% for Labour – shocking, really shocking.
Everyone is known more or less than the massive immigration policy of the Government of Blair was designed “to throw the nail of the right in diversity”.
The Labour gives the partial election, the Tories lost the partial election in safe seat against lkip = Labour in crisis Have you talked about your fight against reality with a therapy?
I think that it's the same multiculturalism that leads to this return of handle, the ring has been very far since the end of the war, and I think it's going to divide now in the other sense.
Did you talk about your fight against reality with a therapy?
Lol - Security Labour Seat, a difference of 617 votes.
It's depressive Jack, you know, I know, everyone who's not in the deni.
Of course, the Torries saw well worse, but for the Labour, it's a winner in the Pyrrhus.
Find the word "Victoire" in any context, and you will see that when it is used in a argumentary way against the word "defeated", it wins the battle!
I agree, Jack, it's a winner, but she's mature.
The Labour had to win at least a few thousands of votes.
If they store a performance like that in a safe seat, can you honestly imagine the majority to return?
Personally, I'm uncertain that wins in 2015 as long as Lib Dems are not here.
You do not clearly understand how our parliamentary democracy works, right?
Yes, I know the glass of Canada, Groenland and the north of Russia slowly.
On the contrary I ask if Venus's alignement and March etc should not be considered too?
Generally, there is a need to see the Earth more "pateous" or malleable that you imagine.
Is that what?
Some little perplexities.
Wylie, on the other hand, talks about a 'excellent simple mechanism: with the disappearing of the glass on the earthquake, the pressure on the roof is relaxed, what gives/donning (a) a shock to the production of magma (b) by facilitating its access to the surface??
In any case, it is the "booth cut" or the facilitation of the access to the soil surface (more or less) localized.
It is difficult to distinguish the cause of the effects and inverse Quant to climate heating, I seem to be prudent instead of focusing on its effects on our environment, which is already quite complex.
Does this volcanism very friendly affect our environment?
Is there no effect on our climate, future, or past warming?
Is Prudence not it anymore?
When complexity is not aware of simplification, let us apply this simplified and observe.
Yeah, but also, when he is doing night, we're seeing less good.
Hello, the end of the last glass period was also accompanied by a stronger systematic activity in particular in the "active" mountain chains where on the very English continental parties Canada, Scandinavia.
Cordialement CB
It is too often ignored that the earthquake flows on the magma and that the only moon passage is to mount or drop from some 30 to 60 cm, which is different, according to its passage to Zenith, as it does for the ocean waters.
What gives it that the slowing of the textile plates, as well as the marges, is more or less facilitated by this swimming forest, so much more than the polling calotures are aligned by the source of the glass, which therefore causes a change in land balances to the equator, as the volume of the earth remains constant.
I am glad about this "human" speaking of the Supreme of Nature and his self-declared commander, ridicule by his stupid action on the environment which has created it and which has so separated it, and itself and in this environment.
And all this to remain the top commander of this nature that exceeds it in the organization of its own fishermen, through an invent that is to find all the ways possible to dominate his next, one of the other, because of the cooperation, the money.
The earthquake is not on the magma, but on the earthquake, which is constituted of solid rock.
I personally find him impossible to look at it.
Pretensive and arrogant.
That remembers me Ascent of Man de Bronowski.
Live the next part.
Beautiful history Wild1
This remembers me a totally generous series of 2002 called "Ape-man".
One of the best documentary series I've never seen.
Unfortunately, almost nobody remembers it now.
Don't worry you've never been over the first impression.
Your loss...
"Gleeves, our far away" You should look at this passage again.
Or read about evolution.
Super program Thanks Brian
I'm almost sure that the "Humanity History" documentary has already been performed several times, they are always going to Ethiopia (evidently)
Oh there I don't support this boy, Brian, "air thousands" Cox, which goes to Ethiopia to try to make bike eyes before a brain in a mouth.
And his narration...
It must be hard for you, obliged to look at Coxy.
There may be a group of support for you, so it is.
I am agreed, everything is presented in a way I can understand.
I loved the program, wonderfully filmed.
Does Marcel Gauchet represent a marxist bossol?
Effectively, it is the individuality that prevails today.
It is therefore necessary to be himself, in itself, therefore not in line.
Of course, but Descartes is also located at the time of individuality event, and his intellectual question expresses this event.
But at that time it is just the prizes that appear, today individualism structures the whole society, educated or not, cultivated or not, rich or poor...
We're good in the individualism of "mass"!!
Without doing an inexperienced horizon, there is no parent with the carthesian movement to examine what we are receiving to believe, what it is believed itself.
More than rebellion, the doubt is fecond.
Fair of Foucault a Revolutionary is an absurdity.
Many xxx library are referring to it and claim it.
His work on psychiatrist has produced a contra-reform!
In presenting the problem at the level of his paranoid name, he blocked all progress and reflection on the reality of the fool.
And I led the most reductive and reactionary vision: the behaviorism.
The left is absolutely right to this point and to be anti-conformist, it is fighting against this deceptiveness.
We're calling to Marcel left to be a defender of the order.
Great idea!
Be beautiful and rebellious, ask ones...
Black and smells, others.
Besides and robots, you understand the most followers of those who see rebelle in their sight.
In any case, thanks to his complainant polemics to put this patient and continued humanist under the fire of Marcel Gauchet’s currentity, and, if pedagogicly, lighting.
David Cameron supports the increase in the landscape of the inheritance tax
How many other budgets will be needed to pay the social benefits of this rich person?
Dave the robot will well increase its net value once it's not going to be powerful.
Business Councils, allocations, consultation costs, a series of best-sellers written by a nigre on the 'serial policy' – it will be 100 £ once it will be passed the weapons left.
Obviously, he doesn't want to have an income tax on heritage.
Isn't it the same lie as the last election?
And the most rich are those who are certainly very less inheritance taxes thanks to super-payed accounts and tax evasion programs.
This has all the signs of a Empire in declining where heritage kills innovation.
He'll be 100 £ once he's going to pass the weapon left.
Whatever.
It will probably propose to increase the floor to 1 million £, which is well depending on what you say it's.
What was your position when the Labour doubled the floor to 6500,000 for the couples?
Do you think that Brown was thinking only of his own heritage, or are you just a tribalist without brain?
We haven't chosen it last time, we had a coalition at the place.
You couldn't allow him to blame it only if we had elected it to power.
As the rest of us, "Dave" will not die "normally".
The climate change and the imminent exhibition will end it, him and the others of his acabitat.
His “ riches ” will be so unnecessary as that of the other and will not save him nor his children.
Unimpossible income is a social advantage, especially in a country where government debt exceeded 10,000 000 000 000 000 £.
We must all be imposed to pay the essential services and pay the debt.
I agree with you.
I don't say that the doctics of discipline is unnecessary, of course, I only say that it is insufficient to compensate some natural "insufficients".
Unreasonable declaration for the math professor that she was!
How...
Better recruitment and better forming teachers this is a quality approach.
However, the French political class does not know any other approach than quantitative.
There are 2 possible answers, the first would be to select teachers according to their ability to deliver knowledge => reform of recruitment modalities.
In +, she hates children because she doesn't understand them.
Don't understand them, she does not know how to act or react to work well => She is reduced to establish a challenge relationship that makes all suffering in pure loss => should be 1 training with skills to teach.
A work that's learning, surely.
But pedagogy is first an art, natural arrangement and vocation before being a technology.
Working on and with human beings is not making car parts.
Pedagogy does not go in equation even when we are a math professed!
"education sciences" cannot compensate a lack of natural attitudes.
What lacks now, just now, is a real vocation in the bcp of those who embrace the professionals
If there are donations, pedagogy (I prefer doactic discipline) allows those who have less intention to do not fault.
There are ways to address a more effective issue.
The real unknown today are the students whose 2/3 say to us: Learning does not serve anything I already know what I think.
A Slate article describes well the chaotic situation of this income.
Regretton the Old Standard Schools of Institutors..
She finished at 3 hours of the morning from this week, but she starts at midnight.
If this is found, it is in any way appropriate to its time job.
Oh, I didn't know that, thank you.
It doesn't matter with me!
It's a few years that his emission starts at midnight.
We have this thing called iplair and that allows us to listen to the request emissions when we want it!
The Internet is so amazing, isn't it?
I don't have iPlayer on my phone and with a maximum download speed of 4 MB in me, I can't really listen to radio emissions no longer.
I have a type usb adaptor from my SKY box and which is connected to the Internet but listening to the radio on my telephone has seemed too complicated.
Yeah, I think I'm wrong at the time, I had to hear Richard Lester about 3 hours.
Although they were men on Radio 2, they could at least put a woman in their antena time when one of the men is in vacation or sick, at least it would be pleased to people.
They should start off from Jeremy Vine.
His emissions are all sensitively declared in the debate, and it would be better on a chain like LBC.
The lack of DJ women in the day, where no regular animators, from Chris Evans on the morning at Simon May's emission at the return of the job, isn't a woman
It's five emissions.
So what (of these five) is the most likely to be changed.
Shenan knows it very well, but he doesn't say anything - for this moment.
Steve Wright is the semi-detailed one of these times.
Jeremy Vine may be returned to the offices as a real journalist, but dinner keeps all the glass air of a Daily Mail radio.
I think he's quiet, waiting for the current team to be shocked, or it's going to shoot.
I was born in Soisse in 1950!
It's too late?
It's normal that these people vote FN.
For 40 years, we have both the same partys that alternate to the power and make the keys of the country to the other as less good as they have not taken it.
The campaigns are very poor, quite poor than the banlieues with the isolation.
We need to make kms to find a cinema, a bar, a gymnase, a theatre.
But as they don't burn, they're not attacking, not handling, they're not interested in political men...
But thank you not talk about a department where you haven't lived.
Yes, Doclocal, they're under men, sociology is good to think about them.
They have the rate of absentism and early alcoholism too high...
The NF prospers on human beasts, inculture and ignorance as it says that there is still a huge potential of growth, they really need to be bad to not have done better...
Today, the NFF is particularly prospered on poverty, fear of daily, the other, and the feeling of no perspective.
But yes, you're right!
That smellful humanity.
Happy there are people like you, intelligent, cult, and erupted to save the honor.

This is the comment I left on twitter (@priya963) Listen, you can't just add and mix), women must be integrated in the development process.
What I want to say is that in many developing countries, existing standards are put into question, such as child guard and social-producing roles.
This allows to recognize that women can work in the economic area and that's super - it's necessary.
But it is not possible without recognizing the fact that women will then have a double floor, i.e. they will be waiting for their work while continuing to play their social-reproductive role.
I'm not convinced to my sister.
Economy and benefits do not recognize gender roles.
The money talks, and if a sex isn't at the height, next!
The benefits are shocking from your life.
What are you doing, what's the advantage and what are you going to offer?
The benefits of heroism and education of children.
If it was a crime, the companies would listen.
Employers will never employ women from 20 to 45 years of age.
Good say my sister.
It is very difficult that nobody speaks of the unpauted social work in this article.
In some countries, the value of non-employed social work (of the largest part of women) must be equal to 50% of GDP.
The unpaid social work does not receive sufficient support and is sub-valued (not speaking about the fact that men do not do it enough), but it allows to operate our corporations and to maintain our work.
Unpayed social work is also an important reason for many women are not able to find a real "economic emancipation" outside the home...
Thank you for all your comments - for returning to Mskayadee's point, how can we take into account the responsibilities taken by women in a disproportional way when women are taking gender integration projects?
A very practical article.
I'm sure he will help many people who have to “coop a case. ”
Tigre is not Russian but Western propaganda.
Chinese are only responsible for the current situation and would be better to sit at the negotiations table.
The right to self-determination and the Russian soldiers are simply employed near the border, expected long-term exercises before the current situation.
In addition, the tigre has no anti-air missile in its possession.
Free the Tigristan!
You made my day!
Oh, yeah, teeth.
He's just coming back to me the same kind of idea.
This is a pretext all found to weaken a few separaters in order to attach China.
If Siberia is in China, China is in Siberia.
It's just time to repair this anomalie.
Why is an article on a tiger, wonderful and real risk of extinction finally transformed into a betely leading article against Poland?
What's he going to do with the fingers?
This isn't therefore a shelter on the tiger of Siberia, but a shelter on the suites of a Poutine's com operation.
When both media are exposed, it is also exposed to the ironium even to the critical.
The permanent victim retours of the Soviet-Poutinian sympathisant.
Holland was also fully taken the weight with his chameau without crying to the French anti-France complex.
There, our learner Alain Bougrain-Dubourg, the Holy Protector of the Great Russia, was personally and physically involved in the reintroduction of this tiger.
In any case he understanded everything, he's barried...
That's what Hollande's doing, that's something.
First, it seemed to be a horrible idea.
But, on the basis of the article, it seems that it is both an answer to a real problem - the dark emergency subsidies - and effective.
So it's hard to find something to re-redire.
And if only 53% of this sample were broken before, and 73% afterwards, it is a little empty sense of complaining of paternalism.
After all, there is no inconvenience to broke the dents!
In fact, complaints seem to be in relation to the fact that they are targeted to the unemployers and that this confirms a negative stereotype.
But if that would be exact, then it is not a justified critical.
Belinda Smith, from the Canterbury Regional Health Committee, said that the Ministry was concerned about the number of emergency dent subsidies offered by the Working Department and Revenue of the Ministry of Social Development to youth unemployment.
On a mediatic plan, there would be better adapted means to implement it, I think.
But he seemed reasonably well thinking.
There is an inconvenience in the fact that the dents are broken.
If you broke them after having wine, it can hurt the emnamel skin.
If your teeth brown is old and strict, she can cut the skin and cause inflammation.
And I remember a emission on the book Guiness of Records where someone tried to cut the dents the most long, and the judges Guiness at the time had been very unconsequent to do it because of the weak effects of a frequent and long-term dent brochure.
' At first, very pleasant.
It seems to be an experimental design.
The simple fact that voluntary for this study will change the habits of participants who knew that the brochure of dents would be studied.
This is why most of the behavioral studies include things such as double swimming, witness groups, etc.
There is no way to reject these results on the programme itself.
Assuming that these texts are sent to each youth in the social advantages, there are two things different from the test: 1) This is not volunteers, and 2) do not give information back when they broke or broke dents (the results that are easyly wrong by people who give their results in the expectations).
Is there any effects at the epigenetic level?
Studies (Pr Lyonnet) showed that maternal environment (including uterus) could have effects on genetic heritage, not in the genome, but in the expression of genes, and that these heritage trails could be transmitted to the next generation.
Does the grief of uterus affect this phenomenon?
The nidation itself seems like a kind of grain.
There may be consequences, but as long as we do not want to be kidnapped by a perfect clone of itself, is it a problem priority?
I think it's going outside the reasonable limit.
The desire of maternity and parentity must not be able to go far, without addressing the question of ethical, risk, mother and child.
Not the doctor is not all powerful, it is not unlimited, and it is evil and painful to accept that all women will not have it, or children they want to have.
It has nothing, absolutely nothing, to see with the tran
But let the people, the women, the others, have their body, their idea of love that can go to risk take and keep your little tests alone, all in your small panel alone to you.
from their "confidence" this magical sack to have this wonderful moment of pregnancy.
Why would I keep it steadily in my coffee-fort if he can still give love.
The current ethriced circumstances make the FRYDMAN carefully on its communication, but if "acceptable" was accepted to reflect, "on" would be acknowledged that it is only the sac and not the genetic material that is involved.
What will you consider as a argument against: cf here these reactions all men curiosamente....
Marjane, every organ don't know anything.
I've been a plasma donor for years, that's not totally known.
I was registered as a slippered snake donor (I have never been selected because the selection is very strict and it understands both for the recipient and for the donor), that is a real operation.
Now as a man, I would not allow judgeing in a sense or another to take part in this gift, but I will listen to the women to speak.
@Margane: Indeed, this has nothing to deny, and it strengthens the act of love.
Give a king to a member of his family who needs nothing to be renowned, and that's done!
Please don't have any Messsi v Ronaldo combinations.
It's low.
I agree, we don't need it.
Overall, there's no more competition...
Ronaldo is the best athlette.
Messi is the best footballer.
The sport has become a yoyo club.
They're too good for the Second, but they don't have Liga's standard.
Rivaldo was not part of the winner team.
Thank you for correcting me.
But Rivaldo well played for the Sportvo before going to Barcelona.
Ronaldo, who continues to do everything to fight all the purpose records of the Real Madrid season to then return to Old Trafford this year with quiet conscience...
I'm worried to believe it.
I think Ronaldo will put a term to his career at Santiago Bernebeu.
I think you want to talk about the stage of the international oil investment company?

Hello and thank you for your tickets.
He was like to read me a few years ago that a black boy's mom had been found in the current Libye and that this discovery had opened new horizons, including geographical and temporary (I think I remember that my mother was 1000 years old to the first known African masters).
Do you have information about this?
Thank you for the progress.
She earns the reading a little.
It may not be modern contaminations.

We knew the song.
And there is enough that a scientist of Europe confirms it without any evidence, so that it is a scientific truth: the Egyptians and the Africans to eve and today have never invented nothing in their home.
But the song does not tell us who are the inventors of African inventors in Africa.
If it isn't and always "of his wicked debts".
You should read the article.
This is a article elaborated by neo-liberal market cookies and preaching against the mobility of persons and for the mobility of goods.
I think there are other people reached from the Ebola and on which the Spanish government lies us to not give up bad images and protection of the tourism.
Today, I would like to believe that tourism is the last of their concerns.
But they could remain silent to avoid a general panic.
I would like to believe the same thing about the tourism, but the governments of law in particular (e.g. the Spanish and the United Kingdom) tend to protect the interests of business instead of people.
Please stop calling your local MP and claiming the lack of transparency.
Although I think that the government here is only a band of connards, good and corrupt, as Madrid is not a very tourist place, I doubt it's their greatest concern.
What are you waiting for?
(Whoever respect and compassion I have for nurse and colleague), because tourism is one of the only things that allow millions of people to keep the head outside the water, I would say, yes, it's important.
If they were absolutely repatriated by missionaries, I don't see why they couldn't send them into a military base and cure them there in a field hospital, rather than in the capital, for example.
Rajoy had the mission to defeat Spanish health services by privated nationalized hospitals, especially in Madrid, which is his power base, until the courts were interviewed.
It's nothing just a right-to-legal public relationships supporting Cameron, and I think it's wrong with the next elections.
To be just against Cameron (I know that this is not easy here) socially he's far away to his right and would find his place towards the religious crowds of right in America.
Now he must sing the hospital lounges that he had before down to try to achieve his goal that is to protect Spanish tourists.
I'm sorry, but you can't really compare the Tories or any other European party on the Spanish right.
That's cases on the other hand, believe me.
The Spanish government is a lie about almost everything about it.
It's not like a person could accuse you to repay the informed rumor.
So you have tankful evidence to support this idea?
This Watch Tower is called The comments are free.
Thank you, Mr. Suiot.
Without the work at the centre of production and economy with its rights and guarantees, there will be no way out.
Excellent, but especially fascinating reactions on the forum.
Many TPE patrons seem to read The World to take the time to condemn Pr's proposals.
Let's go on the anti-intelligence of the environmental era.
A Legal Professor at the University of France seems to not be able to know the labour market except if it is Nobel economic price and proposes to completely liberalize it
It was so better before, it was true when Dr. Villermen observed the work of the children of eight ages 10 hours per day when the Canuts had been shocked because of a collective convention signed.
Oh, the good old time...
Your reaction is so fascinating by your misconsciousness of the TPE patron house!
Its work is not to know the right in all his men, but to manage and produce.
Four manual amounts inscribed on my juvenile salary ballot, more than 100 more than today!
This is an example, for example, that can be quoted much more, which illustrates the permanent flow of contractuals, taxed without measure of consequences, and that extracts the small business.
Your paper would be very useful if you had written it as a experts and not as a Sorbon client.
In order to order the arch-result argument of the French Labour Code in relation to herbete, a serious university would be extended into Swiss texts and would compare the number of official texts, then the comments (the absence of these lasts that means that Swiss laws are more comprehensive than ours).
By comments in a Code, which is working or not, the legality is seen, in particular...
And yes, in France, there is still a judge who is responsible for applying the laws when a employee is licensed, for example....
Who's that complicated?
Do you find that the rules of law (legal law, law, conventions, contracts) are in the field of unsuccessable barriers and trade?

Let's see otherwise, the choice is not missing in the world of art.
If China can produce new artists who are not parts of the Communist Party, the world will be interested.
Yes, GhenisCan is probably a Chinese government troll.
I think China has produced a lot of contemporary artists.
Those who are Communist Government's doors are not appreciated in Western, and those who are not talking doors are not well connected as Ii Weiwei.
For those among you who think that the art of Ai Weiwei is a kind of fraud, this is what you rate.
Thank you for this, you're coming to ruin my breakfast.
I'm sorry, but it had to be worth exhibiting it (not to make a bad word game).

KARSENTY DEMISSION This master is unfavourable to take an electional mandate the extremists of any border (including sionists) must be put to the distance
Philippe Karsenty and his ridiculous theories of the complot, who valued him a number of judicial convictions, are horrible to Israel and to the matrix of Neuilly.
He does not represent either one or another.
Philippe Karsenty took his battle against the truth alone, in marginal.
WHAT RESSEMBLE ASSEMBLE
What do you have to do with the Mayor of Neuilly against Philipe Karsenty, who tried to blame a journalist and his family, and who publicly calls for attacking this urbanist?
Forgiveness of crime?
I don't find Neuilly on my card?
Is this a new administration that holds these new privileges??
This type requires care, as well as Ulcan Chelli, to do both in the theory of the anti-jude/anti-Israel complex and whose resorts are perfectly identical to those of their most furious detractors.
As many people believe in any political decision, the hand of the “Senists” (then the sense has tendencies to disappear, because of their abuse), these two, as the LDJ or still the CRIF, believe in any critical, even banal, an appeal anti-simism that is not to remember the darkest hours of our history because it is still fecond with the ventrile of my good beast, we believed to return to Russians in the 19th century!).
Noteing that the unbelievablely stupid theories of Karsenty on Charles Enderlin's reporting are still more stupid than those on September 11th.
And God knows that the theories of the Complex on September 11 are a well-beat beast.
And this type has political responsibilities, which is extremely concerned.
To specify my analogy with the theory of the complex of 11 September, it is discussed about a cognitive depreciation on the way to discuss the subject.
All overwhelmed by a completely thorough truth, with too much time, expensed too much money to spend it, it is insupportable to the adaptation of this theory to defeat it (e.g. in the case of extreme religions).
A logical and inelectable flee before, the end justifys all the means, even the lie, which is a complex, but likely it does not seem to ruin the mission.
You suggest to make attention and not put everyone in the same cart, but that's what you do for September 11th.
There is still a floor of questions without answers for this event, and Bush/Cheney/Saudians/consorts seem to have no pressure to answer it.
There are effectively very fair theories, but the official theory is at least a few points.
Oh, nothing's funny now...
Health NGOs and public health talks are found that the results of the study are widely favoured by their sensibilisation efforts.
And of course they will need more subsidies to follow!!
As the fact of smoking was socially accepted 50 years ago and now it is recognised for what it really is, alcohol will also know its time of judgment where the real damage that it causes in our society will be exposed.
More than waiting that everyone attacks me now...
Well, it's easy to be pleased to say things like "exclusive alcohol consumption is grown", but what (a little more) more effort is to give real facts.
I'm sorry if you're considering this as a attack - will you drink a drink and develop?
Better is to risk this instead of putting my mental health in danger by abstending me.
The Government ends the joy when it costs the money.
Here are other alarmist advice based on few reliable statistics.
Two mediums per day is at least a low level of alcohol consumption, and the first quote seems to indicate that it increases the risk of many cancers, but the second means that it is a lower or less dangerous amount.
Maybe the Cancer Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council should be concerted (on one or two drinks, but especially not three) and give us a figure on which they agree - that it is justified or not.
Now, we're going to tax them down, like the smokers!
They do it already - soon this will be the herb!
My dad didn't drink and smoke, and cancer brought him to 64 years of age.
So I'll continue to drink my two red bottleles on Friday and the same night (and the other nights when my wife is not here).
Why is the Cancer Council encouraged children to go in places where alcohol is serving is a old modernity that the Cancer Council has delibly ignored.
What's not related to a risk of cancer today?
Requins do not touch cancer - they eat anything but are not good company.
Requins can take cancer to skin cancer.
Charlie Whiting's incompatibility is a recurrent subject for many years.

Completely agreed.

Two of them, they destroyed the F1 with security pretext.
We hope it's better than Schumi or at least the worst Wendlinger applies his accident in 1994.
Absolutely agreed with you, but attention to point 1: is not the F1, but the circle authorities who refused to advance the start to do not swear TV dispatch creatures.
Very exact, +1
I just want to want a quick and fast rebuilt in Jules Bianchi!
Brazil 2003, Europe, 2007, the accidents that failed to occur between depanage grains and f1 were unprecedented warnings.
We knew that one day would happen, and Jacques Lafite, in particular, said it for years.
How could the course organization and the FIA have allowed these hands without safeguarding?
I can't accept that the risks of the household or the fault are invoked by chance when the predictable has not been prevented.
Or this accident was it.
It should even be said, that there was a yellow dragon, which does not just mean "interdiction to overcome in the area" but has first purpose to signal a danger.
It's not horrible, it's happy for the family that should be before the TV.
Even under yellow dragon, pilots will just lift up the feet.
In changed conditions, virginy can be much more slower the next tour and the pilot, believed to arrive with sufficient margin, may even have “slow” speed in comparison with normal rythm.
But well, we're caused in the empty there, as long as the images aren't seen, we'll not be able to give a positioned view.
I don't see too much what this changes.
Does there any blessed?
According to the CBC, no damage has been reported.
The CBC showed the information this morning before this happens, which makes me ask what caused the slaughter.
It is difficult to believe that there are still jobs where 24 hours to hold.
I don't think there are people blessed because Canada is almost empty.
There may be blessed animals such as skins, rats, etc.
I hope it's irone.
Some Vancouver parties have the strongest population density in North America and Toronto's aglomeration has at least six million people.
In Saskatchewan's campaign, trains do not disappear as slightly and these types of train often cross small urban areas.
Almost every Canadian city is passed through a iron road line, and trains are very often deplorable in a day.
Furthermore, as water courses often follow in areas where there are lakes, rivers or oceans, they also walk in deeply poor places, because people always want to live near the water.
So, all the rail traffic crosses the center of a city because it was a central element of the original construction of the road lines here.
You may have tried to be funny, but there is a great potential for rail disasters in Canada.
Mansbridge made a report on this last night, really shocking.
Of course you didn't read the article on the dilution and explosion of a train in a town of Quebec that made 47 dead?
In fact, you have some reason.
The city of Vancouver was a well-known portal city before the fertile road.
This said, when the fertile roads were built, they passed through the centre of the established communities because it was the most direct and central road.
Maybe employees of the National Railway Society should be held at the next Conference on dangerous products in Calgary in Canada on 2 and 3 December 2014.

This article, as many comments, makes the contrary to the primary religious question: a religion is a revelated truth and for his believers he will not be able to exist other truths.
All the problem is here, and the exeges of the theologists do not only strengthen this fact, no matter what is good to talk about the sex of angels?
"God said: That's good - it's bad" > It's not compatible with democracy, it's called the dictature (variant: theocracy).
It's a leader, but not an importance: "But without religion, how do you want to keep the people?".
In other words: obey to the curse rabbin imam pastor and do your prayers, that will be better!

Yes, that's what Voltaire and others thought, that Robespier is in a certain way trying to build a worship of the Supreme.
But our oligarchy also has its cultures: the euro's strong ( instead of the currency at this time ) or the free market (passively supported by the State when it is to be reflated ) , etc .
Great ideas of religious surgery.
Yes, but especially where there was no distinction between religious and profane.
Where the rational emerges, the religious is at the rider and is expressed in scourge.
The religion is born as the ideological support of the State, and the gods put to the service of ambitions even if it has also brought forms of contesting.
The theology decreased between faithfulness in the form of revelation and adaptation to the air of time did not doubt.
Fanatism is often described as a bad interpretation of the "sacred texts".
This does not resist to the consideration of these texts that are made explicitly appeal to the hatred of the wrongman.
This is instead the moderate religious (and happily they are the most) which "discriminate" texts, and not only consider what is about humanism and common values in all humanity, acts and believers.
For me, fanatism is the beast and bad application of passages of the sacred texts out of their context.
Thus, some verses of the Coran calling to kill “infidelity”,“infidelity”,“judea” or “Christians” are incomprehensible and therefore unacceptable if there are no few higher or lower verses that indicate that these executions are just in cases where the musulmans are attacked, killed and in the situation of legitimate defence.

There are idiots all over there.
The only positive point to take from this is that it has caused a general condemnation.

A insult to our intellectuality, that's what he gave us!
If you decoll your eyes of the television for a moment, you would see that Australia has a rich cultural heritage, starting by paintings in breasts and stones performed by its Indian people and that are still a source of inspiration for modern artists today.
And then there's the Opera of Sydney and a national opera company that produced wonderful songers such as Joan Sutherland and Nellie Melba.
The australian cinema produced films like The History of the Kelly Gang, Mad Max and Gallipoli.
The notable Australians includes Errorl Flynn, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Heath Ledger, Geoffrey Rush and Cate Blanchett.
The only thing that causes your intelligence is you and your ignorance.

WHAT THE ROMANIA!
Alleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee the Hungary!
And I say this as a Roman citizen.
Transylvania, with a woman of Hungary origin, on the other hand.
That says, I can't support the Piturca team, they don't represent me.
Piturca is a member of the placed powers that has not stopped deniing the Roman football until the patental level he has reached.
They formed a network that produced the "Coperative", which decided before the beginning of the season what team would bring the championnat, which teams would go to Europe, which would be readily readily, and who bled the money to its grace, mainly by sales of players that were well underestimated.
Gica Popescu, the former captain of Barcelona, did business with the above-mentioned agents, and tried to avoid paying taxes (e.g. a million euros), then paid them, but, apparently, he was not advised by his lawyers, refused to grant his mistakes to the court (which would be awarded without punishment), and therefore took three years and half of prison.
The prosecution also valued the prison to Becali's brothers, four owners of club, Mihai Stoica steaua manager, and Popescu, for infringements in connection with football.
George Becali also purses a punishment to have tried to shoot (and after the facts) a team to fight us (CFR Cluj) in the last match of the championnat, to win the title and return the jackpot of the Championship Liga.
The team he tried to shoot was our neighbors in Cluj, University.
We won 1-0 in their stage, a result that allowed us to be the first Cluj champions while they were released.
I'm always saving this moment.
In the dismissing of this corruption attempt, Piturca, among others, was signed as a witness to a false document that taught that the money that the police had confidened to Cluj was in relation to a field sale.
So this poor man is not educated, stupid, tricky and mentor isn't representing me, and he will never do it.
Hungarians are only a band of nationalist cretins today.

It's really true when we have the class: we treat the population of legs and dogs
For each new period of unemployment, it is decades and decades of candidates that I address to employees who most often do not even have an accused of receipt, it was automatized.
This is also the total absence of monitoring or support from the Polish Employee.
To conclude that the "socialist" patronym of this government appears to me as an insulting in the memory of Jaurès or Mendeus France.
Have we read here a article of the rolled canard?
A unemployment may remain a few months without the news of its agency, but it must continue to search for jobs through its own means.
It is learned that controls have been allowed to raise people who had no longer affected unemployment.
We are therefore asked how to be done the control of people that we never see.
The sanction is asked to be a radiation for someone who has no access to employment or unemployment.
And if it can be admitted that this reform will allow more radius, what will it help recruitments.
"A unemployment can remain several months without news of its agency, but it must continue to search for jobs by its own means." Effectively, it's horrible.
The question should be addressed, why are these countries in the EU while the authorities are clearly unable to defend the equal ideas of Europe?
Isn't it like if Spanish or Italian authorities had made great-chose about racism in the foot?
Should we cut them from the EU?
The EU was only economic and should remain.
The purpose is not to be a 'Pension Police'.
EU is a peaceful project.
She has no sense on an economic plan.
This is probably the reason why Great Britain will soon leave the EU: this is the most inequalizer society in Europe.
What equality?
Eastern Europe teams are constantly having the corrupted mafia arbitraries that is EUFA.
The best solution would be that the whole East leaves this lucrative organization fore and created the snake.
At least we'll look at the football.
This anti-racism cross is just a screen to cover injustice and corruption!
No, it's not true.
Monetary and commercial exchanges, instead.
European equality ideas?
So what is wrong with Europe to let the United Kingdom entering?
Uefa should appeal them to have joined Blatter's committee and his men.
This happens all over a few years, and I don't exaggerate.
Shoot from the Guardian two or three days ago:
Should he hope to get rid of small symmetric phrases, just the story of the poletic?
Whatever it is, it is a fact that every small event toward peace there has been, there will be people who have worked to shoot oil on the fire.
The decoration would be to say that the Western States are against a "Palestian State", which they are pro-Israel, and that it only explains that these States have never done anything against the Israeli State.
The decoration was to say that to solve the Israeli-Palestian issue, it would be necessary to act against the super-weapon-weapon-weapon-occupied Israeli-identified state as a destructor of colonial pressure.
In 1945, instead of creating a Jewish state in Palestine in the detriment of an Arab population that wasn't for nothing in the Shoah, it was more reasonable to guide the Baviera of his German people (which they were guilty of the Shoah) to replace them by the surviving Jews.
It would have been justice, Germans had nothing to claim and Europe would have maintained millions of educated, entrepreneurs and dynamic inhabitants.
Mr., take the example of Western Sahara colonization...
That Marocco is the colonialist, it's a proof!
But, as for Israel, it must also ask the History, its allies and supports to share truths.
The colonialism, whatever it is, has never been altruist, we agree.
Then stop your pirates to support Israel as a colonist.
The Gale has been colonized by the Romans, but now there is no discrimination between the descendants of the Romans, Gaulos or others.
In Palestinian, there is a discrimination on the basis of origins.
Furthermore, the Israeli State is defined as the one of a "judean multitude" whose non-Jewish non-Jewish could not be part of.
The Israeli State discriminates the non-Jewish, from which the content.
Conclusion: To solve the conflict, it is necessary to break with the Jewish and non-Jewish sionism.
In Maghreb, even some people were baptized by the name of their first status by this savior civilization!
Two realities that must stop ignoreing.
First, the European sionist project (counciling Palestinian) involved in deposing the Palestinians, so it was an intrinsically anti-Palestian project, so the solution is necessary to break with sionism.
Secondly, sionism is a political ideology.
Uruguay missed from the start.
They will give them what the dogs are ordered.
It should begin its re-administeration with small legs.
I hope he didn't lost the appetite of the game.
There are so many softs, including racial damages and physically hard tacs in the football, but Suarez was sanctified too hard.
I would like to see him returning to England. It's not important to what the purists say.
Yeah, I hate all these molarists.
The football is a contact sport where the balls exist, and therefore, the players will hurt.
The fact of returning his dents in the flesh of an adversary to have the advantage did not certainly have its place in the game.
A rubyman was suspended for 80 matches to have made a similar gesture.
It's now the third time Suarez did it.
If you killed someone at work.
What would be the consequences of you?
I knew someone's going to go.
If you're dislexic, I'll forgive you.
I'm actually slightly dislexic.
I forgive this sarcasm with two balls.
I think he was hot to go back to play full teeth.
All these words games on Suarez are losing their mourning.
I didn't order the hair.
An essential condition for a good school course is the respect for students of their teachers and school institutions.
This works if parents culminate this respect for their children.
Parents make it easier if they feel respected by teachers and schools of their children.
In the good institutions, those who make progress to their students, parents are considered partners, not as emms..
Who can believe that it is the professor that should do all the jobs (learn, education, respect, limits, living together) It is to parents to make at least 50% of the taff.
But it's definitely simpler to take it to school.
Mystery on parents is not operational.
Nobody really took on them.
Since the action will remain limited.
Instead, the school institution could have a lot of things.
Operational solutions resident.
The actors (proofs, heerarchists and ministers) should play their role and do not remain touched.
There can be a troop cut off to restart it, not the families.
How do you not talk about education?
It is true that communication courses allow the change.
It seems to be teachers but it is forgotten the first role of the school.
Transmission of knowledge.
And if parents require there, it is that the school ensures their children's education.
What is the Minister who will make up what was called the Public Instruction.
Articles falling: few information, partial and destructive reflections.
Are you really waiting for a intelligent comment from this outside Eastern Banlieu?
It's a beast, it's clear, but I think he's instead of Willoughby, and so North coast...
Sloppy Joe does not understand the numbers.
He refuses to accept the facts.
It's not surprising that we have a budgetary emergency.
Let it fall and the economy will soon wake up.
Hunters Hill, actually.
carefully true
That's it.
A little Aloysius.
His election is the North Sydney's seat.
Effectively a bit of the North coast!!!!
Well, if British BBC televisioners want to compare the neo-conserving governments of our two countries, they would obviously arrive to the conclusion that the two of the Monster Raving Tory Wang-Bangers are conducted by the part of the Monster Raving Tory Wang-Bangers.
He passes for a grinning, today. :(
Yeah, but his leader regularly leaves him on his hunger.
You would be shiny as if you wake up a morning and realize that you will never have the role of the Prime Minister and that all these ill and illicit advantages of life will remain forever outside your port.
Shut Joe.
Very patent.
He tried to present a budget and then abandoned.
At least he's not threatening someone.
Brittany Ferries needs a new boat.
She will well know the commander, without gas turbines - in a remote country and call for State aid.
And as she could do lobbying, no fear of the result.
And as a pool for employment in France which she has nothing to do, she is always ready to shoot when their corporation has losses on markets, especially foreigners...
It's just because their lobbying did not function that the command was cancelled.
If the company had obtained the time or planning for marpol, no doubt that the project would have been achieved.
Open, to know if it's good or not and how BF will comply with the law, although all, it would be nice that "the world" is thinking above!
The Britishtany Ferries company is detained by bretons.
Those who burn the tax centres and securities.
They want State aid.
That they didn't seem to me at least normal.
And even when armies a ship under French metropolitan pavillon is 30% more cher than any other civilized pavillon, yes, it is normal to wait for a shock of the State.
Or then we are condemned to tolerate that British people monopolize the market.
That's the choice.
Eternal issue of French which considers its maritime façades as tourist destinations, not as activities areas, where people sometimes live different from the average parish.
This difference is paid every day, lacking investments, quoting all short.
One of the reasons for which Britain must find its sovereignty.
That's it and after they will create the bretton pavillon with exclusively composed of pure sweet brettons.
With that, they're sure they're going to make the costs decreasing significantly...
Sure.
Unfortunately, this is what we are expecting from the BBC now.
They have always hated everything about the prog, so it's not surprising that they chose to pass further to Hackett's only career, which has always been closer to the genesis of the 70s than those of the other members of the group.
Hackett was for Genesis what Malcolm Young was for AC/DC.
If you don't understand how important he was for the sound, you really don't understand their music.
To say the truth, they do not say almost the only work of Gabriel no longer.
I don't think that BBC could be accused of "hate all the things relating to the project" because they have come to disseminate a documentary of a hour and half a year on one of the largest prog groups that have never existed.
I have not yet seen the documentary, but it's a film on the Genesis Group, not about the only projects of its members.
With regard to the only Hackett career that would be "be closer to the genesis of the 1970s," I am not agreed.
Hackett has no right to take the road, play a lot of Genesis songs on which he had several degrees of participation and intended to have an affinity with Genesis that David Gilmour has no right to assemble a lot of demons to half ends and call it a album of Pink Floyd.
Oh, wait...
I think that Steve Hackett asks nothing more than a just representation, but he didn't receive it.
A curiose feeling, the first album of Bank, is absolutely generous, and in fact in the spirit of Genesis of the 1970s.
They're passing the only Hackett cart because we're honest, she's afraid.
Yes, it's one of the best prog groups, but would the documentary have been done if they didn't have their business success in the 80s?
I have not always seen the BBC spread a long documentary on groups such as King Crimson and Gentle Giant who have a very interesting story but lack of the popular attraction that Genesis has.
Good comments.
I would even say that the BBC has "all" hated the fact that it ADRAIT progressive music in time.
A person with personal interest cries "prejuds": of course.
A little more interview with Jonathan King on the DVD version?
An absolutely wonderful chance.
If death penalty is an attempt to duplicate a horrible act by another horrible act (including sometimes against innocents), then it is a clear success.
There will always be a difference in size between a criminal sentenced to death and those who kill him.
The criminal has made his act since his unreasoned understanding of society and rules.
Those who kill him do it since the vision and the best and wise reflection of a society.
That's what they don't say.
They're indefensible.
Yes, we understanded your point of view, the first time we were.
That is precisely the difference, Mr LeClos.
We need to have a well different spirit of the common of the dead to play violence.
That's what the criminal is doing since his understanding of things.
But it also produces pain, hate, victory in the nearby of the innocent victim: a false understanding which will never be able to prevail those who are wisely determined to death of others since their healthy and just reasoning.
But to try to balance the analysis, it could also be said that the death condemned has often experienced a wild violence, which he could play, against slightly loved people, who made it free.
The neighbors of the victims will eventually see their pain with the disappearing of the one who was the barrier, sometimes the torturer, being loved and hateing their nights.
Don't miss their support.
Thanks, Emilio for this reflection I find very just.
It is strong and exciting.
With regard to Marc Asnin, he proves to be a great intellectuality.
The heart.
That's, of course, what I've read for many years.
However, it would be believed to read historys of another time, of ancient things, that the barrier of the past would apologize, and then it's the date they clic, 2009, 2011, 2012...
I really don't believe Philip Roth is so generous.
Search for the other "Romisher Romanians" referred here.
Roth, Pynchon and De Lillo are all over.
I thought you'd stopped the white, man.
What's it going to be?
Roth is great, better than De Lillo or Pynchon.
And Roth is uncommonly better than this punishable Below, who received the price to him.
Maybe the judges of the Nobel of this year have decided that if we have to have an American lauréat, we could have a [leger] racist.
Munro's very good, too.
They're all produced of "gloms of genius" as if it was a literary type.
His homony Joseph against...
Who were you reading?
How many DiLillo books have they read?
I never ended under World but a few years later I started reading his other books.
Have you read The Body Artist?
News like "Human moments in World War III" ?
White Noise?
The first slightest, crazy, smaller, and their dialogues are also super.
I don't know if I'll end a day under world.
I just know that if I meet someone who wants to live in the same world as I and have read enough books from DeLillo to reject his writer talent, I can only be afraid that his favorite romanzer is Tony Parsons.
Why would there be a conflict?
It's a simple interest.
It was a trace of humor, "the law," not a request for definition.
Among the text and the mind, it seems so EVIDENT here that the woman acted in SON only, and not absolutely in the institution that she represented, that the term 'conflict' is asked to do it.
For her, there was no conflict.
I hope she'll take very money!
Yeah, state services are very practical: or they prevent a dynamic entrepreneur to create the value, or have not prevented it from the danger.
After we hear that French employees are not dynamic and are only searching for tranquility.
The unreasonable areas that are built from the day next day when a large construction program will start there, it is classic, and not only on a lower coast.
Look at the alluviales near the rivers.
It was said to us that “of today there is no more injuries thanks to regulatory bars”.
Now, the retention lakes must be expanded in mounting and crushing the dogs.
But this will be because of the State's services, of course...
The benefits in the field, all of the promotion?
To the ground.
So six million euros.
Is it clearer, there, the interest?
Sort the calculator and you're going to dream to the life you could have been at the place of Mrs Babin, the first adjoint UMP of the Faute on the sea and the former President of the Urbanism Commission, which grants the permissions to build!
The 2 Sarkozysm triumphant mothers are old and immobiliary.
I'm on the left and not all sympathetic with Sarko, but svp, not from low political or low cuts of all azimut, we're not there in a shooting battle.
I wonder if the police who were involved in these recent fusils were also involved in these incidents.
The U.S. police are enduring criminals.
The U.S.'s a mercy.
So, what the hell did you see, you?
The U.S. isn't a mercy.
Yes, the American police are driving because of the rakes they had done on the daily.
Of course, no one do not do anything but the police “come to worry them because they are racists.”
That's a good apology.
The racism is indefinite in the United States, it is unfortunate that there is a incident like that to force people to see the problem closer.
Your generalization reveals a deep ignorance of the US...
You don't know it here.
Good cops must denich corrupted racists.
Get them!
Calculate it.
This kind of open racism does not exist here.
Is that the first time you participate in a conversation?
This is not a conversation, you're accusing someone to be ignoring, while it's clear that you're not going to know anything - of many sources (US sources) have noticed the perpetual problem that racism is in the United States (that's not the oise speculation).
It is very likely that you undermined the extent of the problem and don't appreciate how much the tension to this matter is at this time.
As a result, the border between public service and private security for power and privileges, which has never been very robust, becomes even more sensitive.
Wall Street finances the NYPD in different ways, where the treatment of Occupy is on the ground.
What's horror to me is the naiveness of some and shocks me the VA and others.
And where do you think that journalists find their information?
On the Internet?
They're going to interrogate the responsibilities, speaking, sustaining confidence.
That the man goes to Elisée has nothing really wonderful.
Then, what you know is recovery, verification, analysis.
And there's a understanding that the sarcolators are worried about to do.
@Munstead, our current president has elected on a vague of antiarcozym on the basis of mounted businesses from any parts (unplace and no condemnation), which seemed to have been conquered by magistrates(2 returned to correctional), two friend journalists from Holland.
If this collusion that is revealed between justice, political, executive, and press that is not supposed to be a body of power does not shock you, it is that your party's spirit smells you!
RV with Holland ...
And of course all this is just coincidence and not scattered!!!!!
If you think that only Sarkozy supports are irritated!
From the extraordinary I could read, the VA article does just cut the shooter.
I've even been so ridicule.
For the rest, the world's complaint has little chances to advocate because journalists are not "astraints" in the secret of the sources, isn't it?
In the closest difference that it does not seem to have a consciousness between VA and the power when it seems to have known between the power and the journalists of the World for a operation against a opponent.
I must not be the only one to wait for an explanation of the World on the ground and on its dangerous relationships.
We are well before a state scandale that would cause the fall of the government involved in any other democracy.
From where this edition to the Aboriginals, who said long on the compliance with the current government.
This is not a matter of left or right, it is worse.
I thought the shoes would be well with the smoke hair!
It's just for the numbers and to reduce the wages and to create housing problems, I am sure that if I was an immigrant of the second generation whose life was pleasant because my parents had come here, I would doubt about the issue of immigration but that's not a reason to oppose controls.
One of the most sensitive people in a BBC employees on immigration was a second generation Sikh that said that she was in the eye with the number of people who entered and the changes they brought with them, she was associated with a Muslim man who was not all co-operating, even rejected to give soups simply because of the religion of the lady, he also refused to enter into her place of worship, although she stated that he was not obliged to pray.
** "this said she wasn't PAS at the eye"
As we all know, if we let it do, the United Kingdom will continue to go to the right - whoever puts the limits and contests must be admired even if it is a pub director :) so better for you!
More to the right?
Where are you living?
If this country was more left, he would be communist.
According to you, what did the New Labour who's specially left?
The liberalization of a country, NHS, is the NHS to repeat, massive immigration of immigrants (in their own terms to raise the narrow of the right of Dan), the culture of social benefits, the age of all permissions, the right policy that kills the freedom of expression.
I understand that the Labour is left and not communist, I said that to blague, which I mean, they have socially handled a very high percentage of the population to make them dependant on the State.
It's typical of the left, if you want my opinion.
Leave your prepared arguments as much as you want, but what I have requested you, are specific examples of Gauchist Policy, or a left programme defended by the Government of New Labour.
Can you do that?
With all my respect, this is not what you asked, you asked Daniel Johnson what had done with him the New Labour that is particularly right.
He gave you his opinion, and then you refused to accept it and change what you ask.
Yeah, it's more the territory of Tim Bell.
So Martin Sorrell, the strongest publisher of the United Kingdom, associates the situation of his parents to the economic migrants who are now in Britain?
What an insulting in their memory!
He had completely reason to do that.
France to France!
We've been fighting in 40 45 to fall into another disctation, that's the money.
We're going to make beautiful economies through these technocrats...
The treaties should be renegored to me.
If the word "democracy" is still a sense in Europe, what should it not be?
The Commission is not thinking of the unfair fiscal competition between countries in respect of companies.
This must be negative quantity.
The Europe is not the solution, it's the problem...
The EU has only a goal, it is to make the rail transport sector fully marketed.
In terms, this means that all panes of the French territory will not be reserved by the rail.
The abandonion that are already victims of many territories will only be strengthened.
Any sacred, including the advancement of a country, on behalf of the Liberal Doxa, did not seem to me a good idea.
The EU is a real problem that will have to be treated well a day.
Not all.
Europe is the first institution to have both the will and the means of clarifying the SNCF accounts.
The French State has been dismissed for a long time.
The regions have the impression of paying for nothing, but not the way to compromise the snf to respect their commitments.
Or use public money without gaspillages, it is essential for today in which public resources are binding.
And the great needs.
I don't know very well what could be the TER competition!
Is he still a problem with alcohol?
If that's the case, shouldn't he be the loving leader?
It seems that you have not really succeeded to distinguish the problems that existed during the marriage and that, of course, you are still in the way of being cut off pain and cold now that over five years have been past.
Of course, having an ex alcoholical ex-life close to you and having what seems to be a daily impact on your life is energetic and very difficult.
This says, it would seem to me to love the separation process between your life and the complications you have heritage.
It looks like that is what they do, but that's my enemy.
Because you all live so close to each other and that complications seem likely to persist while new makes the surface, have you reflected on a "flood" plan so that you can make a break between your life and your future?
Financial problems have a negative effect, but with a competenced real estate credit company, a good lawyer and a bit of pressure from the court, they can be resolved.
He's a vindicative and continuing appearance.
Why not go to a family advisory group to tell the things openly and to provide support to help him re-work and pay food pensions.
I think that's the key.
Your life is doing much more than the time you've passed with your ex.
Very good advice.
My counsel, ask the children what they would like to do, even if this means to meet the new woman.
Tell them that you will support their choice whatever it is.
Warn them that he will not hold forth his promises on the contact and ask them to consider how this would be to feel and how they will handle the deception if he does not make you.
Try for them to keep a contact with their father.
If they see you do this for their good, despite your own feeling because of the way he treated you, they will respect you.
They will never stop loveing you and if you do everything you can to facilitate a continued relationship with your father/children, they will be able to thank you when they are greater.
I'm thinking that the children are finished by understanding who's fault, if they're letting them see things by themselves.
Go again a little effort you are close to Godwin point.
It has been further, in 30 to 40 years civilization will disappear, the short-term economic interests are too powerful, that is the land pool against the ice pool.
Moreover, with globalization, the country that is at least social, tax, and also environmentally has a competitive advantage, and others are obliged to follow.
All the policies searching is growth, the Crossance.
There would be an international coordination, but from here...
It is not the climatesceptics that produce C02.
It's all those who fly, those who use the climate, those taking the aircraft or car, those who have been living in accommodations that must have been built, who purchase industrial products that must have been produced and transported.
It is not the climatesceptics that have demonstrated against the epatox, but the truckers.
No climatesceptic policy is climate and Arnold S consums much more than me.
But no one says that climatesceptics escape more than CO2 than others.
Environmental Defenders also move to conferences.
It is that individual actions, even if they account, will not be sufficient.
It is also necessary for political action (other energy sources, reducing dependence to the car, etc.).
And politicians act in part in the sensitivity of their election.
"I'll be back" is actually a famous prophecy of McArtur made on March 11, 1942 at his start is Philippian.
Terminator has only done the expression again.
But it may be the humor to say that the expression is of Terminator.
"the steel gases are a pollutant" There are 30 definitions of the steel effect, all different.
So we don't know what it is, but all the good apostle of the RCA dog seems to know what it is.
Does nobody know what is the effect of shutting?
Bingo du Guardian : How many times before someone puts the mistake on immigration?
I'm putting the fault on the crapules that took all the money.
Do we have Liberia in Texas?
You're Rick Perry and I call my $5.
I put my fault on democratic mentors.
Or democrat scrooks.
Or the mentors of the Labour.
We're wrong, they're responsible.
The movement of populations could be a real aspect of this epidemic.
The asymptomatic or subklinic cases that drive in a car or aircraft for epidemia must move the infection quickly than they can imagine.
Sex with songs, is it better?
You think it's a virus?
I don't advise you to ask for an order for antibiotics.
He contracted Ebola in Liberia.
This nurse contracted the Ebola in Spain.
Mince, actually!
Don't use the word immigration, you'll be afraid of horses!
The United Kingdom depends on immigration to pay all our retreats, to take care of our old people, to hire their hygienic bassins, to enter the 30 000 people who die each year of hypothermia or hungry (not forget your laine and goodness, which allow you to retain, to eat the heat ET to eat this sandwich in the wound).
Don't be so consumed.
The uncontrolled and untested immigration will bring the Ebola into Europe and the rest of the world.
Is that a blague, or isn't it exactly done?
It's more comfortable...
This is how the public money is speeded to allow a slight minority of individuals to pass good time in space to make gallets and turn back by playing clouds in front of TV cameras.
So the real television has not invented nothing, and the authorities certainly expect that a baby is designed here to flame the world and raise the mediatic cover to the western reigns of the tablets.
Maybe they're back on the ground to find out that we're bowling here!
On the contrary to what you seem to believe, we are not sent men or women in the space to make galipettes or crowns, but to work.
And these works are very useful for humanity in general.
And that's, in all areas.
Many of the things that improve our daily life are made from space research.
So yes, it's the money paid usefully.
You can quote one thing that improves our daily and outcome space search.
It's just a fresh gouffer.
the bill style that functions the point in the air (to write to the platform, for example)
To pay his traders?
To participate in the manufacture of an unnecessary product?
Or how to make more money to investors?
Small, workers for workers don't want to mean anything and represent vacuity even.
Ah, if the last high-tech game.
Furthermore, there are several hundreds of thousands of people who work for that possible.
You know, people who boss what, who are more private businesses, in particular to shop the office at the station.
If you think you're going to buy a plastic gun...
But, and those who do not think to buy a platform weapons now but who have the potential to buy it to the future?
Maybe it's the most dangerous of all.
Not because the sword in plastic was a decoration in a private residence.
A plastic gun in a bank is used to try to mere people to believe that it is a real gun used to commit a crime.
Plastic swords may be kitchen decorations, but nothing else.
A very malhonned article would have made it bad to the author/editor to put a photo of the "sword" in question instead of generic photos of "plastic swords"?
Or may you even be quite curious to ask what you wanted to mean the inscription (when the case) above?
Small typical reporting, it is attracted to the fact that "that's just a sword in plastic" and not on the inspiring jihadi text that is written above.
The sword, a Zulfiqar or Dhu al-Fiqar, is one of the major symbols of Islam shiite.
Dirani's family, on the contrary, is a shiite musulman born in Afghanistan, the terrorist groups that are trying to break the governments in Syria and Iraq are almost exclusively from Sunnites.
If only people stopped rigouring the fact that plastic cottons are unforeseen.
They can be dead in the skilled hands.
Even the small covered that we are given in fast rests can perceive the flesh.
Thank you for this information, so if it's a common decorative object, it justifys the ridicule that the author gives him.
It's not the pain to try to make it a 'ha, ha, a sword in plastic' the facts that you say to them actually support his argument.
I saw at the occasion these decorative objects in muslim houses, or paintings on the walls, they never had the threatening appearance, just a other version of a "Cruz".
Two Jesus, you're right.
And that's all his sense now...
I saw that guy who looked like being from the Middle East to Kebab Stop and distributed plastic cups every night!
I love the conclusion.
All wonderful new, often technological, are thinking of many people that it is a right and need to benefit it, but they have an immediate and worse cost, a stated cost (subscription, electrical consumption) in budgets.
And it is impossible to benefit new technologies from frustration.
For example, call to the Energy Solidarity Pact, which allows to isolate the house compounds for 1€ symbolic, when it is located in a modest household (work costs are undertaken by power providers in fact!).
Simply effective but unknown even if more than 3000 houses have been isolated this year!
Interesting this PES.
But I never heard it.
Who can call it and how does that work?
for 60 million consumers, water-economic dust tests and predicts the use of water economy materials on rabbits and WC.
The study shows that a family of 4 persons can reduce from 30% of its water factory (from 150 m3 to 100 m3) is 50 m3 of water economy each year, while watching the same comfort.
This is not a crisis of the request, it is a system crisis that is not possible to produce enough exceeding (which would then be redistributed as an increase in income in real terms) in order to pay the increase in the expenditure you are classified in the “contracted expenditure” category.
Otherwise, the energy precaution, is “just” the reverse of the medaille, because the economy can no longer grow as fast as she wants.
Note that the theory (neo-classical) of the economy is totally unable to respond to such a question, because there is no intrinsic limit to economic growth, and there is no possibility to achieve, more than a decade after decades, the rythm of economic growth.
By its definition even (in physical), energy is what allows to achieve any physical transformation.
Because production is fundamentally transforming, energy is that allows to achieve less economic production (being or service).
And more we want to produce, more energy we need.
This means that any contrary to the increase in energy obtaining (notably called "producing" energy), even in the form of an increase in its price, involves production to increase (except to improve energy efficiency, but to improve energy efficiency is always demanding large investments, which are not rewardable if energy is not sufficiently careful).
In short, there is a very strong link between energy precaution and the fact that it is arrived, or not, to increase the "production" of energy not cherished.
And the very officially published data, for example by the International Energy Agency, shows that the situation is only possible in the years and decades that come (IAEA, in these last reports, clearly indicates that the conventional oil production film has been reached in 2008, including oil not cheap.
But oil is the most universal energy form, because of its very strong density of energy, its transport and manipulation and storage facility, its variety of possible uses, etc.)
Three points, good job anymore the performance.
It was a good performance in Germany and there was nothing back to the things.
Take that France!
Don't vote on 18.
You're a Watch Tower Webmaster?
As it was noticed before: It's good to win.
It's good to win.
In fact, it's good to work the guys.
Although many Englishs love to move Scocias when they are just losing, there's nothing to say, they bring a little color to the tournaments when they come to qualify at least until they can remove the first tour.
It's still more rigorous if we play against them ;)
The English starts to worry about me.
Because, now that the "dore shidge generation" is removed, they may have a decent team with all these young people.
Ferdinand, D.
Batty, Joe Cole and David Seamen come back to the starting XI, why to change a team that wins?
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, had been really "international class", is David Beckham, a little afflicted, maybe, but I think that if he had a superpower patch like me, he would scratch me completely.
People forget their atmospheric constitution, otherwise, speaking of an athlical constitution in the sport, Wayne Rooney...?
I never shock Scozias.
I've tended to surprise in observing their warm colors with nostalgia at the end of the evening...
The only English footballer that, in my humble opinion, was really "international class", is David Beckham
Yes, people seem to often forget that he was, at his best hours, a very good player.
It is about that Juppe would have been bad to request $100000 for a conference in South Korea.
And not that he would get them if he asked them...
You mean, the people come to get a good shock?
For the rest, I would be surprised to learn that B Debre, for example, only sees on his deputy compensations...
I especially ask the question of knowing what it can be told in its conferences.
How to reduce his deficit?
How to return to full job?
I would say no serious conference of a scientific discipline, or any of its scientific level, even if it is a Nobel price, I would not think to ask a less sum.
Content conferences are most of the free or almost free time.
And I can assure you that these young people work really and that the results presented in their -graduate conferences - are real.
At the time of the research budget restrictions, the implementation of these two figures is constructive.
The researchers' conferences are even payable by the lab!!!
It's to say...
Everything's lighting for me.
They look at the sun.
N Sarkozy is a deputy representative of the UNP ethics.
I like the impression that we reprove him to win the money?
I am far from being one of his fans but, that we recall him to have bad (or fraudulently) to manage his campaign OK.
But making conferences seem to be a very legal activity.
To add to Nina's comment, we recall that his movements are supported by the contributors.
Rule No 1 of Epidemiology: isolate.
All American and British flights towards or from Africa would have been suspended last weeks.
Human life is more important than the right policy.
It is present in Spain, GB, Texas and other potential places.
What density of population infection is that politicians will decide to take the right decision?
So if I want to go from Africa to the United Kingdom, I take the aircraft for Spain, and then turn a Spanish plane to the United Kingdom.
If the Ebola comes in the Western Africa, I see all the flights and ships in the direction of the United Kingdom.
We would always need to send goods that say...
What damage is that the panic of international media on Ebola is not more used to talk to less spectacular but more mortal crisis that affect the people of West Africa.
We are all threatened.
In every part of the world, men, women, it's a very tragic newspaper, a very low title.
I could read each paragraph and replace the word Humans in other contexts (together relevant): Women are the first gifts of care - read - men travel from a community to another, etc.
More intelligent comments would have been made on the ways, reasons and places we all can help understand and interpretate cultural and social approaches, and the differences in the gender role that could help combat Ebola in West Africa.
Come on, let's think about it and write, don't be pleased to make a sound.
There's a moment for everything.
If you are not able to offer a good analysis and a intelligent view, maybe you should just think before writing?
Although I will put the women's genetic mutation on the same rang as the decapitation - a form of terrorism so barbar, his survival rate only makes a different form of torture - saying that its temporary suspension is a "light of hope" exceeds the understanding.
In fact, I see that the contributor is Sierra Leone, which can give a certain degree of “validity” to his opinion, but in that case, obviously, it does not give a better perspective than that of a medium activist on the street.
And I believed that the Guardian was being “moving” as a worldwide resource of journalism - which advanced in the 21th century, delaying its fundamental precedings.
Who, in the editoral team, let me look like that?
For a territorial election or other money does not contain.
I read without delay that the territorial public function increases its effectiveness, and I have never seen the article that gives them the word or try to explain why.
That would be legal, effective.
There will be uncertainly lies and truths, to separate the good grain of evil.
The Court of Accounts is cherish to tell such economic aniversarys.
It's true that they never had anything to manage the people in the Cambon Street.
CTs are not in deficit, they have funding needs that can only relate to and only to investments they do.
It is forced to use too frozen concepts the press as the World makes the game of all darknessisms.
Debt is beneficial because it finances investment, collective patrimonia
Unfortunately, debt financing is especially the operational costs...
And as the insurance of officials (for example, to make good rounds-points) is in a growing and incomprehensible load (obligative load until their death, because life work + retrait), these collectivitys are large in investments.
It is therefore necessary to remove the status of officer, predominantly at the decline of the funds.
In addition, to be responsible for financially-building barriers.
It is fabulous, the communities should be accompanied by a decline of common effects and it is the inverse that has been produced, evidence that accompanying a scale is not effective without suppression of the other.
How do you want to correctly manage large territories like cacahuet at the time of the TGV and the car?
The time of the horse where these territories were created is revolutionary, it may be time to react.
They wouldn't prefer to stay in prison, worse inclined, in the administrative duty, to paralyse him!
Even striking trials, it is not too strong to explain the situation of blocking in which the Vème status conducted with its provincial men.
This really started with Petain.
Then he continued to go to the series "to the souffle cut" arrived strongly in this regard.
Why are they not going to live in a apartment of 250 million dollars in Monaco above a cinema to leave all this suffering behind them?
Europe is also built on a semestre, which will be a long and difficult process.
When will these people learn to take care of themselves?
Don't even try the answers of the kind “It's the fault of the whites.”
"responses" not "reply"
I hope it's a sarcasme.
It was in my previous post, where it was not sufficiently clear.
That's what happens when we're disappointed to be the first.
If it is a sarcasm or not, there is a argument to pass.
It is now agreed that modern Sapian Homo has been evolving northeast Africa about 200 thousand years ago, and for a specially humid period about 150 thousand years ago they have been able to travel north to the Middle East, and the rest (or at least eight thousand years ago) is part of the history.
The current Minister of Defense had said a few months ago that no military hospital would close.
So he lied.
It was uncertainly the only government that seemed to keep the road.
Now, we know that we can't trust him anymore.
Six o'clock!
in 2017: Transformation in a comfortable private hotel for future retreats of the Republic ?
Movement of the floor in Bercy?
Very good decision: Val-de-Grace was a symbol of the past, a doctor for nanites and their families, the care of " Grend V " from a 3-speed doctor.
We're going to get money, and the military will care for the influenza of the last little other...
Do you know that 70% of patients are civilians, all of us?
Londra Watps?
I loved their fans based on Wycombe/Londres.
Like the London and the Wellsh?
They left the London past season.
It's just the Wasps now.
A franchise of any other name...
At least they're going to Los Angeles, right?
It changes that a football team uses the field of a ruby club instead of the inverse.
Moreover, the movement outside for Tigers and Holys will be much easier.
No, it doesn't change anything.
At Stockport County, we had the fault to be purchased by the Sale Sharks, and we finished loving our own stage with them once we found our independence.
I would say the same thing.
The way they emphasized to lead to the field, although they have access to other places, did not benefit us.
I love supporter Coventry City.
Good news isn't stopped.
There is always the possibility of a United Coventry now.
It must be frustrant for a team that has not bad supporters and which was up to the top for more than 30 years, seeing his stage repeated by a ruby club.
I know the recent problems of the CCFC, but this must be a good glass.
For my part, I'm not the club ruby, and to be honest, I don't know anyone who does it by some fans of the Watps on work.
Yours and some thousands of other people in the South-East will certainly follow them away or do they now have to support another team?
Good pro home and good vulgarization.
But who's worried about it?
But why do TOUS IT systems are not based on these concepts?
+ because a large masses of pre-existent programs (cobol, java), + because all systems do not need them, + because there is no magic bag ++....
And because most of the computer systems, bugs have no real importance, what is taking into account is being the first on the segment.

But those don't sell it.
Real time has become a key sector in many areas, and few of them who know the immediate details of these processes.
It's 15 years old that I didn't go to an Olive Garden.
The quality-price report slowed.
I'm sorry for those who are going to lose their job, but it's better to close the box.
I would recommend a simpler menu with choices that popularity is known.
Reduce costs and prices.
There are already too many sales in our food regimes.
Don't ask Olive Garden not to put a salt in the future.
It seems to be reasonable with Faisons more benefits, and not Faisons of healthy plates and the best quality-preciour report.
They take us for pigeons.
Oh, yeah, look at what people did not have too much gressin.
And then let's do our suppe by someone else, it's better when it's industrial.
Assure that there are full salts, this replaces the real ingredients.
We should also add a bit of sodium glutamatics.
The amount of salt you need to add to the smell water is delicate, but this significantly enhance the gust of the end product.
It is not only the gust of the salt, it also affects the way the skins.
The finished product is so better.
Without salt, there's no food.
Everyone should try alternatives to the company kitchen.
Do you have family restaurants and offer wild plates for reasonable prices?
What happens in the United States is very triste.
A banal accident of the work that turned badly.
A young promiser who learned the volunteer, followed his father's career in prison for murder.
A man slaughtered everything and brutally interrupted this born vote.
That it is sentenced for 10 years of prison seems to be the minimum.
Where are you going?
It's totally agreed!
That humor!
The shipping of it is obvious and difficultly apologizing and bluffable as well as...
Effectively, it is difficult to apologize.
That's what I've got a certain sympathy for a 15-year-old boy.
During the prosecution, the father of the child complained of never seeing her son but without requesting for forgiveness to the neighbors of the guy he himself killed.
Who's really victim in this story?
What are you coming to mix all!!!?
The child's father was sentenced for what he did.
Regarding the lost ball connery, the accused and accused, he knew just well that the balls are dangerous.
The boy did nothing to the accused!
So he pays for the crime he is responsible!
10 years old, it's a little bit in my opinion.
To have the intelligence to shoot this young man to smile?
Effectively, it was a sound!
If the opportunity is present, go in vacation in the Mouse Valley and sleep in the B & B one of the small viticulers.
It does two times that I do, wine, landscape and food are excellent.
Furthermore, if you are there for one of the many wine festivals that hold in each community, it's still better.
I'm sorry, the Moselle Valley, I've kicked too fast.
It's glad to see the German wine is recognised.
Instead of importance, German vigners traditionally use only a single variety of roots, which means that they really need to boil hard to keep a certain quality.
Of course, some young generations are experienced with different roots, such as France, Italy, etc.
There is not only the Moselle region that must be recommended - France, the Palatinat rheenan (Pfalz), Baden pledge to be visited.
A French region of interest is Alessace, which is like a melange between Germany and France.
The wines are of the German style (or maybe it's the inverse, bref).
The Germans prefer birds.
Traditionally, they drink the wine after feeding.
Knowing the popularity of seed whites during the feed, they now propose a lot, and with a very higher alcohol content than their nine degrees prefered.
But their traditional vineyards in bottle in the property are so complex, the breathing is overall balanced.
Try the Schloss Vollrad spatlese with a homard thermal next time you go to the rest.
Find Hallgarten online to have a good selection.
I used them when I had my restaurant.
The World Atlas of Wine de Hugh Johnston is a good guide, overwhelmed.
I understand that there will be new Guardian readers who discover wine, but this is a record of each newspaper on the German wine since the nights.
On the other hand, there is a article on the German vineyards that are in arrival, the new Baden sects who are going to accompany the plates, the red that are very sweet, but especially not these degrading Liebfraumilch that people drink when they were young (hey, I really don't think that it is still true or evocator, except if I address me to the more than 40 years of age - which, as I say, will already see all this).
Close the Val de Grace would be a huge error and a illustration of the lamentable state in which the Administration of France is.
A crime against Louis XIV and an epine in the foot of my grandfather and my grand-dog who studied it.
In democracy, public health management should be submitted to the vote of the Chamber of Members: these ministerial calls, which are holding by the barbichet, and these decisions taken to a close home, have become insufficient.
Sorbogroin is right.
It should be done as in the Green Soleil: Eutanasie at 70 years.
Moreover, we could return the flesh that will eat our poor (sic) poor active actives because they can't go to the market.
Indeed, find the job to our unemployers, the real job, and you have no deficit problems!
For older people, it is time to pay a little more because national solidarity is not able to provide...
Assets, in the way of disappearance, will not be able to keep this demographic transition alone...
So from the geriatrie, of course, but to think otherwise than a hospitality model of the 30 glory.
Now, the maximum growth of 1,5% (that is the case for 30 years) for the next 50 years will take us back to the whole model defined after war!
Val de Grace is the symbol of the exception in medical matters in France: a certain rigorous and disciplinary that was more known in the public hospital.
If this symbol falls, we're really wrong.
First, we're wrong because the rest of the hospitals is not at the height.
The scandale is that the presidents and other elites are able to cure more than in the public hospital.
The solution is to increase public service offer in other hospitals than to keep a doctor at two speeds.
The Val is a French physician pool, and of course it is a symbol.
The closing would be a mistake, a sign of walking more to France's medium-critical.
Without the military status, which must be preserved absolutely.
"The Hospitalization Day Price", a hospital management unit, is decided by the Ministry with local supervision of the Regional Agencys of Hospitalization.
The abomination of our nation continues.
Finally, I mean, obviously, the baby is only one of these economic refugees, he came to Australia to have better paid work than he had in his home.
In almost all the world countries, a child born in this country of two non-citizen parents is almost always non-citizen.
Australia is far more than most of the countries by making children born from Australian citizens.
But it is Australia who is criticized because it does not respond to some so high standards, with evident difficult consequences.
Why?
This seems to me to do two weights.
Send Abbott to the Middle East, Pakistan, Sri Lanka to finish all persecutions and violence and wars that flee to the people of their country, and forced them to find help in Australia.
If he doesn't want people to come through the ship, then the problem that generates this traffic must be resolved.
I don't have to complain anything about life at Sri Lanka today.
Civil war has been 26 years old, tens of thousands of people died from both sides.
That's what happens during civil wars.
However, war ended six years ago and the country returns to normal.
Everything takes her sense now, nimrod...!
Strange that the British Prime Minister David Cameron did not believe this small superchildren when he was in Sri Lanka with Mr. Abbott...
Cameron condemned war crimes and the maltraction that had yet occurred.
Several European countries have already been suspended by the Thamu's deportation of LTTEs, thinking that they would run a risk of torture to their return.
UNHCR reviewed its assistance application assessment guidelines in December 2012, and recommended that those with LTTE links be considered at risk of their return.
The year [2013] saw a number of attacks by the buddhist warrior groups against Hindu and Muslim.
The elections for three provincial advice were held in September.
It's too late, boys!
Mr. Nowak, the coco is gone with so many periodics.
In fact, this guy couldn't even get a chance to make it.
He didn't have a health insurance in the States?
So he wouldn't have been given any treatment.
I would like to know who's going to pay for medical costs during his stay in the hospital.
The city of Dallas may be paid to some lab for the purchase of the body?
In the United States, the rule is paying first, help comes later.
Specially in Texas
Ohhhhh!!!
There's little time ago, we were explained that the ebola killed so fast that a large epidemia was impossible (we have all a scientific literature on the question with models and all).
Then it was said that the risk of contagion of returned persons was null.
We're smelling more, I'm afraid.
You must read newspapers to believe that a risk can be null.
It can be three weak but not zero.
Finally, it is a scientific realistic, more a virus is rapidly dead (generally) less chance of repaying because the death of the host signs his own death.
The combination of 2 (two transmission and fast death) is sometimes coming from the Spanish influenza.
Open c is the general quarter to save humanity. . .
There is nothing to obscene to put up a certain brave and true western media, but at the detriment of thousands of other African sicks who do not know the work, nor the brave or the verse?
Of course, this makes the action of NGOs light and encourages them to help, but the repeating of advertising is a terribly partiality.
The freedom of expression, so loved by the conservators.
The suspension was to keep the doctors under control.
I ask how many doctors have voted for Newman and Abbott, weapons brothers attacking the freedom of expression and the right to the private life of Australia.
I think they had never imagined that their conservators would have taken them out of their rights to the freedom of expression.
I wonder how many doctors have voted for Newman and Abbott,
I think there's one who doesn't do it next time.
Yes, this is exactly what we need now, less health professionals available during potential health crisis.
A heat tour for when the problem really becomes out of control.
There are no longer enough doctors who work around Australia in this way.
The refusal of Tony Abbott to take part in the “guere” against Ebola illustrates his philosophy about medical challenges.
The plan of Joe Hockey for a new Mediterranean Market Fund for Medical Research, which should reach $20 billion from 2020, would probably be only a black shock for the budget.
Using the pretext of the novel medical research, it will raise $20 billion and transfer these funds as a general income.
I hope that Australian voters come to see this excellent Russian for what it is.
Tony Abbott is much more intelligent than we don't want to believe.
It explains that the sale of Medibank Private is compensated by the Medical Research Market Fund.
However, it is a loss for sick people, a loss for older people and a loss for low income.
Maybe it's very intelligent, but it's not just.
Finally, the "menger ringer" and its Telstra's market fund were excellent teachers.
If it's not just, then let's show Abbott that's intelligent.
Send it in hell to the next election.
The worst for Nadine is even the “ancient personality, sacred....
I also noted it, sufficiently corrosive as a comment.
If it was only possible to dissuade her to appear a buzz on it constantly..
The worst destiny for a (e) political final career: it is not recognised in the street.
Welcome She has not been recognized in its city of Toul as enough to administer it.
How is the good "provincial" sense of good!
We live a hatred time, Madam Morano.
I'm certainly against the port of the Burqa, but there's no question.
What this anecdote tells is the purity sarkozism to the state: small medium-sized ministers, a confusion between the government function and the execution function (if Sarkozy could come with his tonfa on each road in order to demonstrate that it is well guarded by the public order), the pregnancy and extraordinaryness of their maximum degree.
I propose that the right to Morano, Sarkozy and all these “ancient personalities” becomes unlawful to bring fire and instructions, they would thus be able to exercise their self-declared functions of judges.
But who's Nadine Romano?
This is in fact the main teaching of the case: even the police have turned the page of Sarkozy, maybe they don't regret it.
It's really necessary to stop before it becomes a generous for him.
I send this agent who ignored Nadine Morano's existence, if I could only do the same...
like bob, for the shooting
Not agree, thanks to her we're strictly ...!
Nadine, if she didn't exist, it should be invented!
It is however easy, she looks like Christine Boutin with a blonde pearl.
On that occasion, N.
Morano was obviously done in the fault of the police officer that she had faced with her, and who would certainly have had to multiplie the corbeths and "Yes, of course, Madam, then Madam, tell me in what direction I have to run to get in to me without waiting for this hot woman."
"In one of the cases, the Australian Super Hornets left an air attack on a target of Iss when the risk of killing civilians became too important."
Americans aren't bad about this, but I think even when Isis's going to overcome or have already done it, at least someone counted the body now.
For civilians on the industrial scale, nothing revalues the western war machine.
I am not agreed, the sanctions imposed by the United Nations (including non-western) between the two Iraqi wars would cost life to millions of Iraqi people, especially children, older people and vulnerable adults.
Most of the anti-governors I knew prefer the sanctions in the defence of the “guerry machine”.
Did you also be the man who prefer the sanctions to order and men on the ground?
Very good comment - the United Nations has acted incredibly hard and inconsidered in the past few years.
The sanctions are generally inefficient and are not able to touch the election - uncertainly a reason for which they have the occasional approval of the Security Council.
You may remember that the insured people have not lost time to mark their main enemy when they saw it in the recent war in Iraq.
It was the United Nations Mission QG attack that they had established at least five days early in Bagdad in 2003.
They shocked this place with strength and two times and I imagine with satisfaction and cold blood.
So brutal and hard this bomb is, I was surprised by the shock of people to know that a United Nations mission has been targeted in this way.
Good notice, I really forgot that.
So add a half million people to the total number of deaths of Western nations (also with recent problems in Ukraine the economic activity was directed to people who intended to hurt).
This does not help your argument only to explode not-reliable statistics.
The only counts even vaguely reliable on the deaths related to sanctions are the children of less than five years of age, and they are even very suspected because Saddam Hussain refused to leave target inspectors to find the facts.
It was obviously in his interest that the negative effects of sanctions were exacerbated.
The most reliable believes that the number of additional deaths for this age group is between 2000,000 and 400 000, but no one really knows it.
With regard to additional deaths in other age groups, estimates are not better than hypotheses.
Since the number of pre-sanction dead for less than five years was about 10 times worse than in the United Kingdom, for example, it is possible that the number of post-sanction dead is widely partial to this age group.
Of course it must be afraid, but also the gift of games in general.
It must be stopped doing as if people were clean minds, that love was all that the children needed, and that they could be done with unknown people that neither the parents nor the child may never know, without their consequences.
One of our mythes founding is Oedipe, 60% of the French people are the genealogy.
It's an essential and unprecedented thing to know his origin.
Instead of doing as obvious and useful fanatists arguments, we should explain what serious problems may occur for a child adopted or designed with a gamed donation.
If you realize that the parents you haven't provided the legs you've done, you could give it, my opinion, because they wouldn't have done any crime.
The latest advanced PMA (e.g. rings) are at least debatable as a reasonable GPA.
The true question seems to me: the frustration of the desire of children justifys these acrobatics, and that has nothing to see with marriage for all.
It's just as a point.
It is obviously that GPA should be afraid, which is what this stupid matter is.
Of course, it's regret that we can't have a child when we want it.
It's a problem I've known with my wife.
However, it is less serious than birthing very disabilized or becomes, contracting a serious disease, losing all its children in an accident, etc.
It's not the worst among all the concerns of life.
It's a frustration among many others.
This doesn't prevent lives.
And we can always care for other children!
In a society that does not support any form of frustration, where children become well consumption, the GPA is unacceptable for me.
Child's desire is not a caprice where we can use the other according to his good desire.
Staliness requires reflection and acceptance.
