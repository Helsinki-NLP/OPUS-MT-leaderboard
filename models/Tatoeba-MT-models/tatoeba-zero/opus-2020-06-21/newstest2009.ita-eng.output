The Prague Border at the market closure has had a negative crown.
After the morning's crowd, the Borsa of Prague has restored the losses.
CEZ actions have reached almost half of the current daily trade.
From the beginning of Tuesday, the Borsa of Prague has returned from the crown of the day before it was almost 6%.
There's the slope of action on Wall Street behind this shooting.
Thus, too, the market reaction is shown on the result of the vote of the Chamber of representatives in America, which has refused to support the local financial sector stabilising plan.
Action crown in Asia
Thursday, the actions of the Asian Bordes have lived a dramatic crowd, although the indexes, however, have then cancelled a part of the losses.
The Hang Seng Index of the Borsa of Hong Kong during the day was almost 4%, but later one of the losses is 2,5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which follows the movement of Chinese actions to the Hong Kong Borse, decreased from 3.8% while the markets were closed in Shangai.
The shares at Sydney's Borsa lost more than 5%, but at the end the losses were 4,3%.
The Thay-Wan's Borsa, according to the local index, has decreased from 3,6%.
"The planning of salvation is uncertain, and this will influence the financial markets around the world," observed the head of the Hong Kong Valute Office Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, despite the part of China, is the financial policy alone, so without depending on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level in the United States.
The American legislators, according to the first Australian Kevin Rudd, should return rapidly to the dialogue and adopt the proposal for financial support.
Otherwise, there is the risk that other countries also consider the consequences.
American Action Strategy
The American Parliament rejected the financial system's support plan, for which 700 billion dollars (in about 12 billion Czech Koreans).
The legislators thus ignored the call of President Bush to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help to stabilise the whole economy.
American Actions Lunedì have experienced a tragedy and the main indexs of the actions have registered the largest crown over a 20th.
The Dow Jones index was almost 7% and a crown of similar size has been observed last time in 1987.
The index was low before the vote, but it was only seen that the law design was not approved, and it was gone free.
The Congress has ceased: the US government can pay $700 billion to banks.
The highest representatives of the American Congress and the Government of President George W. Bush agreed on a more broader form of economic support for the American financial system.
The vote on this matter will be at the beginning of the next week.
American legislators cut the iron in the dialogue on the approval of the savings plan in the form of economic aid for the US financial system for a total of 700 million dollars (in about 12 billion coronary).
But it's not still nice.
The representatives of the Congress should therefore define some details of the intention before publishing the final form of law and vote.
The financial support plan will be discussed on Monday on the territory of the Chamber of Representatives.
Sunday said so to the Reuters Agency, the President of the Committee on Bank and Financial Services in the camera Barney Frank.
The Senate, according to some sources, could be voted about the plan probably not before Lunedì.
The economics believe that the approval of the financial plan should be the first and fundamental psychological factor to monitor the financial markets.
However, there will be a return to reality because of the complexity of the mechanisms with which market aid is achieved in practice.
Paulson: the piano must be effective
"We have made a great step forward."
"We have cleared our different opinions on the form of the presentation of the market stabilisation package," stated the Democratic Nancy Perlosi to the Bloomberg Agency.
According to the same, the final vote could still happen in Sunday.
Delegates of the legislators gathered the night between Saturday and Sunday with the American Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give us the government's financial funds finally.
These funds should be used to purchase non-profit hypothetical goods from financial companies, which bring financial companies to serious losses and risk the stability of the entire system.
"We are complementing the final plan agreement that will work and that must also be effective on the market."
"It's necessary to put forward the reservoir plan, but I think we're there", said Paulson.
The Asian Trade Signal
The overall financial crisis is strongly on the markets of actions that are breathing.
According to the Democratic Senator of Nevada Harry Reid, legislators are trying to reach a final agreement to the Congress before Sunday.
They want to calm the investors before the Asian financial markets, which are, in time, the first to influence the Lunedì market due to the decision of the Congress.
But for now it is not definitely clear when the two rooms of the United States Congress will vote the law and even if the negotiations will be arrested at last on some problems.
The legislators hope to be approved in the next days.
But the law will still be many changes.
The total sum for the support of the system shall be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion must be available soon as possible as President George Bush asked.
But the Congress may block the allocation of the rest of the sum when it will have the impression that the program does not perform its function, blocking the following $100 billion and after the ends of 350.
Bush appreciated the progress in the negotiations.
However, even though the President can put the glass on this decision, the Congress may exceed its right to view.
Despite these changes, the basic thinking of the program has been maintained, it is, in order to obtain the financing to buy passive hypothetical values, which the price is covered because of hundreds of thousands of Americans who are not able to pay their hypotheks.
"We have done everything.
The representatives' room should be able to vote on Sunday Law and Senate Lunedi," said the Republic of Senator.
Progress in the negotiations is also satisfied by the President of the United States Bush.
His chairman Tony Fratto declared that Bush is satisfied with the positive edge of Saturday and appreciation "the efforts of both parties to establish our financial markets and to protect our economy".
Gold parachutes restriction
The President of the banking committee of Senator Christopher Dodd, the main vote, stated that legislators have agreed on the responsibilities of the financial programme, the protection of contributions from losses, the closure of the reduction budget, the fraction of the financial plan.
The new law must also limit the so-called gold paradoxes for business leaders who participate in the programme and are creating a committee to control the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard and we have made a great step forward to the agreement that will work and will be useful for the market and even for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan provides assistance to the household owners with payment problems.
The government should negotiate the new hypothetical rates that will understand with the objective of decreasing monthly expenditure on debt costs and enable them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychology support
The proposed plan is, according to the main economy name of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea but its achievement will be very difficult.
"And that because we don't know how and how prices will be purchased for the problems
This will be decisive for how losses will be divided between them the financial sector and the government," said this week Marek for the iHNed.cz website.
If the plan will be adopted now or at the beginning of the next week is not so essential, according to Marek.
"That's more important, it's that the representatives of the Congress have already found an agreement on support of this plan and that they baptize it soon as possible.
The psychological meaning of this agreement that will be approved is at the most important moment, "he stressed Marek.
Double to the last blood: MP3 readers against cellulars
We will suggest how to choose
While almost every cell phone you can read MP3 files, no MP3 reader can call.
This results clear that it's better to purchase only the phone.
Despite this, there are many reasons for seeking an autonomous reader.
The selection depends on the way of use and the needs of the future owner.
Maybe you'd be able to understand a precious high quality ray to listen to us the last album of Maxim Turbulenc.
At first, these musical products do not appear like LP and from the quality view for this, there is no goal.
However, if on your scaffles are cutting hard-rock, jazz or blues, such a shift as the minimum and dream it.
It also works with the portable music, namely music composed or simply in MP3 format.
There are also categories of prices and quality.
For some, it may be unacceptable to expend to a 8mill coron reader, as well as a fan of the Pink Floyd may be hardly digs the twenty-third coffees of the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
Deciding is the duration of batteries.
Some high quality music readers can do much more than simply read music, but they do not even phones for wrong.
There is no other current device as universal as the phone.
In addition to primary functions, call and send sms, you can read music and video, register both and you have a photo machine, sometimes better sometimes worse and maybe you can also navigate.
And if we take into account smartphones and palmers you will also have a miniature computer.
It's a small miracle as no fridge can make the grid and no television can photograph anything.
The university of the cellular also has disvantages.
More functions you are using on the cell and first the screen indicator will require loading.
And read music consums much energy.
Some cellulars can read music for more than 12 hours, only, and very less.
In this sense, music readers (especially the simplest) are much more efficient.
As regards economic cellulars, they are not counting that they can duration for more than a few hours.
If you still add us, from when some called, you're looking for work for security, that's also the most costful devices.
But you don't have this problem with a MP3 reader, even the worst duration of at least 9 hours of continuous functionality with a download.
A further problem occurs when music is downloaded in the phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the device is available from the universal USB port and not all can be connected to the computer without a special software.
Of course, music can be registered directly on memory card, but only few memory readers are able to make it without adaptor for minicards that do not use in cellulars.
Readers, except some exceptions (Ipod) do not need any special software.
Please fill the device with the music via USB via the computer.
The majority of the cellulars and readers only creates a multimedia library ordered according to the names of the interpreters, the name of the album, generation, or according to the user classification.
Some devices play only the tree structure, such as the Windows Tool Explorer, and some can do both things (irver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operational system).
Readers are more easy to handle, phones can do more.
When you choose a special device, you are especially interested in resistance to battery, memory capacity, quality and type of audio output and clearly the use facility.
If the music needs you especially from the background and if you listen to it every day only shortly on the tram you need a phone anymore you read MP3.
It can now, clearly at any cellular.
You don't have to be too careful of the forms of the phone or reader.
MP3 readers are all supporting, the global majority of music that comes to you will be just in this format.
In addition to this format that belongs to the most distributed, the total majority of devices support music in WMA format.
The AAC is less available (form used by the Apple company and its Ipod).
The best phones allow, for example, to buy online music.
You can visit the corresponding pages of the operator (or another provider) via the mobile web and buy the song or album.
This same service may already be a valid argument to buy a phone reader.
Unfortunately, the offering of the operators is worthy and it is normally limited only to the radio moment.
The prices are not very low.
But generally it is presumed that this music sale mode (such as through GSM, Internet or without Fields) will dominate the musical industry in the future.
Most people always carry the cell behind.
Whoever you want to listen to something fruits in the bag while the MP3 reader remains forgotten at home.
However, it depends also on this, if you always take the coffee back or at least the auricular without branches.
If not, you can use the integrated player that almost every cell, but only a small part of MP3 readers, you have.
Maybe the largest benefit of the phone readers will be the price for many.
The more economic costs are normally less than 3000 corones.
For 3 and 40,000 corones you already understand a very dignified walkman.
However, you will normally be limited from the absence of an input for the common coffee.
The best cells and from the most equipped technical view and even with the load of 3.5 mm for common coffee, cost up to 15 million corones.
Instead of the benefit of readers, in addition to others, it is easy to handle.
The simplest not necessarily more economic (see our choice) makes it really anyone to handle them.
The minimum of the functions, the sympathy of the handle a time with the common stereo or maybe the hydraulic, is obviously.
There is no danger to shoot for the starting of the mobile network and resulting from a gigantic ball for transmission of data.
What device to take
The most economic cellulars (e.g. Vodaphone 527) are normally a slot for interchangeable card memory (of type M2, microSD etc.).
Even with regard to the purchase of the respective card, it is included in 2.000 corones.
But be careful.
Base models only support cards with the maximum 2GB capacity.
Only those more costs do it with 8 GB memory.
If you already have a phone and you want to buy a MP3 reader, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
According to the capacity (max. 2 GB) you should not spent more than 1 100 coron.
If you are part of the most required listeners, you preferably take the specialized phones - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual keys for MP3 and the comfort of the service is close to the same MP3 reader.
In this area he made more road Sony Ericsson, the cellulars of the walkman line have the same use scale as MP3 readers sold separately.
The MP3 readers above shown you the same service and the same price category up to 4 000 corones, but with a greater memory capacity (before 16 GB) and battery resistance (which 15 hours, in maximum line up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic since this year.
Maybe
Maybe the market of mobile phone in Czech Republic is pretty mature, and our operators are almost offering all services such as their partners in Western Europe.
However, it lacks something – a virtual operator that requires the traditional to lower the price.
Maybe he's not missing for a long time.
The fact that the Czech operators belong to the most cherished in Europe have already written many times on Mobil.cz.
In the end of the accounts, he also confirmed the MTU, which has noted that the price of SMS is higher than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulating the roaming tariffs, it may be a paradoxal situation - for some Czech mobile operators, the SMS will cost less from the outside than at home.
How can the Czech Republic prices remain so high towards Europe?
The answer is simple, lacking the competition that would really want to start the breakdown .
Maybe it sounds absurde, even that we have three mobile networks and high covering over 100%.
Instead of mobile telofone operators, the fact that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense, also emphasizes the head of the Czech Telecommunication Council, Pavel Dvośák, who has expressed a few times that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It may be true that the traditional operator with its own network has no more likely possibilities. (The rest may be difficult to find other frequencies now).
But there is another possibility - the virtual operator.
In addition to the market entry of virtual operators, it has brought a significant decrease of prices to which traditional operators would then have to react.
Similarly before the entry of squads such as Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile in the market, they resolved in Britain similar voices as we.
However, it has proved that the place for such operators is and that they can really have success.
In the end of the accounts for examples, we must not go far away.
In February this year we informed you about the arrival of the virtual Mobilking operator in Poland.
In the only half year, this operator has been able to conquistate more than 1000,000 customers and to become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time, Mobilking is the Penta Financial Group in Czech Republic between the other U:fon.
The benefit of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on a very more concrete group.
In order to effectively function enough, there are many less customers than a traditional operator.
They do not take back, to say, relatively high expenditure for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
So in the world virtual operators are usually low costs, offers calls and SMS a little price, which is often in balance with the offer of the most limited services
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers SMS that cost the minimum half of its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be a quite good move, even the smuggling on a little group.
This operator points to this specifically on men.
"The real men choose the Mobilking operator that you like and whom you can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company that produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say if we can also say a similar concept as in Poland.
It doubts the printing portal for Vodaphone Miroslav śepickī: "The Czech market is relatively small for a framented approach, which is based on most virtual operators.
In addition to the view of services, it is relatively saturated."
In Czech Republic there is no possibility, they say mobile network operators
But it seems almost sure that if there's an operator in the Czech Republic, it's not gonna be the Mobilking.
"It is talking about the expansion of this project of success, but the negotiations in the Czech Republic have not many expectations.
Mobilking's accension will be in the other countries of our area," said in a phone dialogue for Mobile.cz Jana Studničkov, the printing of the Penta Financial Group.
Thus it is indirectly confirmed that the current operators in the Czech Republic are not decisively favourable to this thought.
Nevertheless, they try to do everything because you do not believe any competitive potential.
From a short time it does not hide its interest in starting a virtual operator, the GTS Novera group that would like to do another step to become a real competitor of Telephone O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed services but also mobile telecommunications.
And first it's better.
We have repeatedly negotiated about this possibility with all the Czech operators of the mobile network.
We have already been able to progress in negotiations with some of them," says the calling of the Pavel Kadl Group.
So maybe they'll get better time.
From non-official information the first virtual operator may have it within the end of the year.
For now, however, around its creation is an unreasonable wall of silence.
"In this time we do not believe that in the Czech market there is the space for the creation of an fully valid virtual operator.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
Until now no subject with a comprehensive and serious project has been addressed to us," mentioned in its statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sscheō of the Press Section of Telefanika O2.
In the specificity of the Czech market, the other operators also remember.
The chat of the print of T-Mobil Martina Kemrova adds in a rare agreement with the Declaration O2: "For now we noted no vital and benefitable commercial project for both, which is possible to continue to build."
And add: "In the T-Mobile network it will easily appear a virtual operator within the end of the year.
At this time, we'd already have to have a concrete agreement on the table, so that it would be possible to consider it at the horizon."
Vodafone concentrates his attention instead of reaching the requests for 3G license.
Add Miroslav śepickī: "We are open to the negotiations of potential virtual operators, especially in the framework of the share of expenditure and infrastructure.
Let us consider this, from the point of view of customers, the most productive.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for fast mobile internet."
The competent authorities - with complex operators
The attitude of mobile telephone operators can easily be understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to the decrease of prices and thus to the reduction of profit.
Why then facilitate a such competitor?
Fastide around creation U:fon shows that when operators have something to do, they can stay on the same side.
Perhaps the great pressure is pressed against the sweater in the creation period of U:fon towards the T-Mobile company.
This witnesses the public access information from the websites of  yang are available.
But now it serves as a argument for which you do not accept the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrova noted: "The environment of the mobile telephone market has been poorly powerful overall with the entry of the four-motive operator on the market.
As regards the typology of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another competitor would bring on him and especially on its higher services."
However, the attitude of mobile phone operators is very surprisingly the full disinterested part of the Czech regulatory bodies.
It is not just the attitude of the TurkishTU that, unfortunately, in the Czech Republic - the difference between Great Britain and other developed countries - has no competence to interfere in economic competition.
It belongs only to the Economic Competition Protection Office (UOHS).
However, this towards the whole problem has taken its typical position.
"Introduction of the virtual operator on the mobile telephone market would be possible after the conclusion of the contract of the necessary infrastructure renounce between mobile and virtual operator.
No such contract has been concluded until because the offer of potential purchasers probably was not enough interesting for traditional operators," said Christián Chalupa, the section for UOHS external relations, in response to our questionnaire.
A such statement by the representatives of the operators may not be surprised.
Instead of the office that must defend the interest of consumers and, above all, take care of the fact that no one uses its market position, is more than a delicate matter.
In particular, when Christián Chalupa adds: "In the outside where virtual operators are commonly working, we can observe that their entry in the market has contributed to the download of prices for mobile telephone services."
But obviously the pressure on the correct operation of the market environment and price reduction does not belong to the interests of UOHS.
Really shocking in all the situation is the almost emotive harmonity of these three operators resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether it really is only a coherence, it is just alone.
Like the same price of the benzine for all benzine is otherwise the fruit of the coherence and the fight against competitiveness.
"The section has not found signs of anti-competitive behavior in this regard and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position, so he has no corresponding responsibility for his market behavior.
The necessary instruments for the opening of the mobile network for virtual operators may also miss the telecommunication regulator," said Chalupa in its declaration.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many conflict points .
Of course, there is an analysis of the significant markets developed by  zu, according to which telecommunications are from the point of view of economic competition the single market.
On a such market, obviously, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer another approach - for the creation of a virtual operator is always unacceptable to the network's experience agreement.
And the mobile operator has-in the end of the accounts logically – the monopolie of his network.
So for a certain part, it must be dominant for strength.
But even if we do not admit this argument, for UOHS, it should be a minimum allergy that three mobile operators do so strangely.
At the same time, the lamentations by the interested people (including the GTS Novera company) show that during the negotiations with all operators are meeting very similar obstacles.
Download the responsibility of  zuTU in telecommunications is a sufficiently frequent truck with which UOHS is out of the whole fact.
This has already been realized in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to promote the expansion of rights in the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the actualisation of the recently approved telecommunications law, despite the fact that many experts expected the improvement of the situation.
This is the fact that the representatives of UOHS must know more than good, but maybe their interests are otherwise.
You can do when no one looks
While we do not understand it remains the operation of these pseudo-virtual operators, there are some in the Czech mobile networks.
This is a company which publishes its price lists of mobile telephone services, but which are only partly public.
This is usually a multi-level marketing company.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a series of others offer their mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies are generally reached only providers.
The magic is the fact that the company against the operator is classic company customer, which orders a large number of SIM cards.
As an important customer then receives special price offers (and otherwise).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech telephone operators prohibit such prevention.
"If the cases that you have spoken, from which we would be interested, it could be a violation of the contract conditions, and could focus on the conclusion of cooperation with that company," said Martina Kemrova to the questionnaire.
But it is so unproof that such activity would not be reached at the ears of the responsibilities of mobile phone operators.
In particular, in the cases of the 3 enterprises mentioned, thousands of customers can be discussed.
No operators are defending at the same time from such a attitude.
From the activity of these enterprises, it is an unfair profit and at the same time - in difference with the real virtual operators - are not damaged in any way with its official marketing.
Miroslav śepickī warns about the possible problems: "The law allows similar speculations, but only a quick percentage of customers uses the services of these companies.
These should also accept that SIM cards in their phone are not registered in their name, so they cannot be fully discharged as normal clients of mobile phone operators."
But this should be a minimum strange of the sweetheart.
Moreover, there is another question for UOHS.
If mobile operators close the eyes in front of such a attitude, why do they block the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that UOHS has sufficiently strong rights to discharge such activities and if it does not want to be acknowledged by the explanation of operators who have no idea of all this and that their commercial conditions are prohibited.
When we're not more costs
As stated in the text again, the income of virtual operators on the mobile telephone market has brought a significant decrease of the prices for services.
At the same time in almost all countries where the operators were born, traditional operators tried more or less to prevent their creation.
The arguments that were used were almost identical - too small markets, at too simple limits, problems with the quality of services etc.
But in the developing countries, in these cases, regulators have been intervened not by mobile phone operators but from their customers.
Yes with formal measures as well as with non-formal pressure, then it came to the creation of the first virtual operator and to him others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are launched from each other to the other as a balled pavilion.
For our experience, we can't get out of the sense that not clearness of the skills in these cases makes him more comfortable than me.
But we don't cut the ring.
If the information of the backscene is right, and the virtual operator will really appear from us, the cheap telephone market will be back in motor.
If one of the operators had agreed to the creation of a virtual mobile operator only difficultly UOHS could remain unpassable to the rejection (discrimination) of the other interested persons.
And we may stop calling higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new twenty-five has four new versions.
Choose that best
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech National Inno.
Sunday, the first Mirek Topolánek at the occasion of the Czech State recognition was introduced in solely the new registrations of the national "Kde domo mśj".
The new registration of the inno was made by the National Theater's Order under the direction of Jiśí Bślohlavek.
There are four versions available – only with the men or women's voice, core step and instrumental edition.
The song is under the direction of Kateihin Knśinkov and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the revisions of the nation are Otakar Jeremiách and Jaroslav Krček.
On iHNeed.cz website you can listen to all and four versions.
Bślohlavek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful neighbors.
Yes, he first said to the radio "Rozhlas" which was pleasantly chosen to sing the variants alone, the songers with the youngest representative voices, which are expressive and popular.
"After the beginning I tried to care that both the king and the corn, they have the clear word, that the text is well comprehensible, which are in harmony," reported.
Then the national nation will celebrate the next year of the 175^ anniversary.
The song "Kde domo mśj" was played for the first time in 1834 on the ball of Stavovskéh divadlo in the original Fidlovačka of Josef Kajetán Tyl, joined by the music of František Škrupa.
He purchased the population and people have made it spontaneously.
The first strophe of the song after the foundation of the Czecholavacchia in 1918, then became the natural part of the nation.
It remains one of the seven national symbols, even after the birth of the self-domain Republic of Czech.
Sounds the "new" inno
The Mercoledì MHD of Praga will join you for the first time with an electronic tissue
On Wednesday, 1 October 2008, it will be written in the history of Prague's transport company, such as the date in which the first passengers in the metro, tramvia and bus will be deleted in the place of the newspaper ticket to have an electronic tissue.
At this time if you can search for about hundred thousands of people who have their Opencard teacher .
The passengers can buy from 30 and 90 days and year (which will vary from the first January 2009) and at the same time you can download their letter in Infopoint and in the transport company offices and at the stop of the metros Muzeum, Mśstek, Nádraí Holešovice, Andśl, Roztyly, Letśany, Kobylisy, Rajská zharada, Kačerov and Luka.
The tags can already be purchased from yesterday on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
From the service, more than four hundred customers have been used before the afternoon.
Those who will start using the Internet service can completely forget sports in the metro stops where they had to make long files for paper tickets.
The cutting is buyed via the internet and on the Opencard they download it on one of the 12 municipal Library branches.
"In these places passengers have a sport with personal format that will help interests in buying the internet and register the credit purchased on their paper." said Martin Opatrný's portal.
In addition to the library, you will be able to download the electronic tags on Opencard in bankmat and self-service that are installed in the metro income.
How are these banks?
They are red, similar to the bike obliterators and passengers have already noticed them at the shoot of the Roztyly metro, Budåjovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are five in the whole city, but within the end of the year it should be obtained", concluded Opatrný.
The thickness shall be checked instead of the author of the bankmat.
The bankmat service that will work tomorrow is very simple.
Please enter the Opencard tissue and after payment of the thread, you'll be loaded above.
Electronic tights value not only in the capital, but also in its neighbors.
It is, in the urban trains and bus lines from 300 to 499, which the inhabitants of the central Bohemia are taking to reach the capital.
"In the trains added in the integrated transport of Prague there are card controllers with which they check the temporary and zone validity", explained the control mode of the Philip tickets from the Ropid organization, which puts on the times of Prague's collective transport.
Urban buses have the readers of the cards integrated in the castle of the auteur.
It is therefore necessary to show the magnetic card to the auteur, but in more need to support Opencard at a specific point next to the box.
Thus the assistant checks the validity of the loaded tags.
"If the passenger needs to check the validity of the loaded tablets, there is nothing more easy to ask the assistant of this type of information," added Drapal.
Travellers who take the urban bus and will not remember, when the validity of the switch is expired, they can again be able to load self-service bankmats, where the charts are loaded on the paper.
The information on the validity of their documents on the screen of the device will be displayed.
Germans of the Sudan wanted a referendum from the United States
The Germans of the Sudans in 1945 asked to include Zhumava in the United States.
This results from the letter recorded in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronate of the United States.
With this desire, according to what we say, some of the Sweden German groups returned to the President of the United States in 1945.
This results, moreover, from the letter conserved in a private archive and today deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of Krumlov requested the American President not again to allow the refund of the "department of Šumava" – employed by Hitler on the basis of the Monaco Agreement – the Czechoslovacchia.
"We have understood the situation and we want to be sure of the promises that American units come to the German territory, not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," writes in the letter signed with the words "The people who have the destination of Šumava with all the hearts."
Because they say, the anxiety to Czechoslovakia – by knowing the Czech National Character – gives the Germans only hope to cruelness, lack of views, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter take the American President to take the prosecutor now and forever.
"We can't believe that without regard to the opinion of a fourth million inhabitants, you recognize this territory as a foreign state to us, which oppresss and slaughteres ethnic minorities and has not contributed to nothing, just for nothing, to the victory of the Alliances," says in the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign it is the presumed fear of the seven sales by the "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States had to doubt the conviction of the Germans in Zhuwa, it would be based on a referendum on the will of its inhabitants to become part of the United States or to live under the domination of the United States.
Although the text of the letter can seem clever with our knowledge of the history of the after-government war, some witnesses describe in a proper way the expectations of the Germans of the Sudans.
Although the Czech Germans had to say at least that they would be treated from their movement from the Republic, only few of them accepted such a possibility.
Some were expected that the United States and Great Britain negotiated a kind of autonomy for the people of the Sudan.
Others believed that they would only be stayed in Czechoslovakia.
This also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born at Budjovice.
He was mobilized during the war as a German of Budhjovice in the sea power of the Baltic Sea.
When the end of the war was captured by the British and put in the prison field in Holštøn, the decades of other Czech Germans were going to find him in order to teach him the cecho.
"They believed that once you returned home the ceke would make him fun," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia, according to the fact that the Decrees of Beneš would have been moved from the Republic.
Don't think you're paying!
The emotional campaign will attack the users
The most costful action in the Czech history addressed to road security.
This could also be defined by the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport is intended to make Mercoledì away.
The office of Minister Alleš śebíček is expected that the drivers are shocking from a dangerous behaviour to the flight.
The campaign from 150 million will appear in television, radio, film, internet, but also on volunteers.
The uses should be distracted from the fast and under the effect of the alcohol to the flight.
And recall him to put the skin before you leave.
He wants to touch the consciousness, especially young, motorists, bids, and not for the last professional leaders.
What's going on in the spot?
Especially the stories of people who will affect emotions.
And this also shows the slogan "sanguinoso" of the whole campaign:
Don't think you're paying!
The word "not think" is written maiuscle on the ball.
And in a pool of blood there's the word "to pay."
This must symbolize that a person may in a moment of distraction pay for his own life.
The spots will be waiting for the spectators until 2010.
The Minister has inspired the similar campaigns in the Anglossane countries, which are commonly able to see images with drastic scenes of the victims of incidents.
You promise so to reduce the number of incidents and die on the Czech streets.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Carta and bastone to drivers
"What the users work with the cart and bastone system.
The cart for them, for example, is when they pass with red, so they save time.
Bastone is the danger of the curse or incident.
You should remember the risk to drivers, "it says the psychologist of the Ministry of Transport, Martin Kośán of the Hospital Na Homolce.
And therefore they want us to make information campaigns in the print and especially negative advertising, believe the psychological.
He believes that the risk users are less effective.
"If you have been installed the fixed panel that warns the danger, you will probably soon be confounded with the environment and the drivers will not give him more attention," warns Kośán.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories towards peace
The first of the Israeli providing government, Ehud Olmert, expressed himself for the refund of almost all the territories employed in 1967, namely the borders of Jordan, the East Jerusalem and the heights of Golan, in turn to the peace between Palestinian and Syrians.
Thus he said in the dialogue that published Monday, the daily Jediot Ahronot.
"We have to reach an agreement with Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all areas (occupied), if not all, " said Olmert to the daily.
"We will have a certain percentage of these territories, but the Palestinians should leave the same percentage (of the Israeli regions), because without this, there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that the possible refund will also include the East Jerusalem .
"Whoever wants the security to Jerusalem, and especially not wants to make the ruspe or spianatrists the passing, as one of my best friends has been successful, he must turn away to a part of Jerusalem," noted Olmert in the shock of the two attacks of Luglio in the city, during which some people were killed and twenty people blessed.
According to the first, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Mountain of the temple, the sacred and historical places", which are inside the Old City. .
"The one who wants to maintain the sovereignty of Israel on the whole city shall be integrated 27,000 Arabs.
This will not work", he further stressed.
The retirement of Golan’s heights
Olmert also expressed for the retirement of Israel from Golan’s heights, namely, the uncertainty condition to conclude this peaceful agreement with Syria.
But this would also require a certain effort by Damasco.
"I do not propose the conclusion of peace with Syria only on the basis of the retreat from Golan," warned.
"The Syrians know well what they're going to stop to get Golan's heights.
They will have to reject the current report with Iran; they will have to reject their relationship with the Hezbollah (Scitites movement); they will have to reject the permanent support of Hamas' terrorism, Al-Qaida's movement (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the sacred war) in Iraq," stated the first.
Thursday after the accident: Is it illegal stewards in bus?
The law does not recognise them, it cannot be walking on the bus that takes a long distance
In the context of the tragic incident near the Italian city of Pava del pullman of the Society Student Agency, the question is whether stewards and passengers could move to the bus during the course.
"If we want to respect the laws strictly and formally, the activity of steward is in conflict with the law of road traffic," says the portal of the Minister of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The last week's incident with which life has lost a hostess of 22 years has been caused by a truck that cut the road to the pullman.
The girl was sit at that moment close to the auteur at the least safe place of the pullman, although there were still two other places assigned.
But the bus can make an accident or slowly shoot in the time of distribution of coffee or newspapers.
Depends on whether the bus is equipped or less than places on foot according to the carriage book.
If the passengers are not authorized, they must sit down.
Student Agency's bus have not been placed on foot, you confirmed it to the website Update.cz the director of this Radim Jančura.
"We have evaluated this with the Minister and at the beginning did not allow passengers to move on the bus.
After it was revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the course if they have the place assigned," he expressed his view.
The law does not recognise the steward.
"No clear legal interpretation of the role of steward – no law is concerned with regulating this role."
However, no regulation prohibited by the carrier to carry out services.
The road traffic law only recognises the term of the vehicle, its rights and duties are not defined," adds less clearly the portal Hanzelka.
The Director of the Road Transport Department of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný believes, however, that the currency law is sufficient to this problem.
Depends on whether the bus has approval places.
All this," says.
Categorize the buses in urbans where there are places on foot and the maximum limited speed, interurbans with higher and longer speed, treated without the footsteps with the maximum allowed speed and the seats of safety cables.
Like in airline, the expert says.
The BESIP expert on road safety Jaroslav Hośín does not find the substantial problem in the bus movement of stewards.
"When a quiet course is not so many dangers, the situation can be compared to air service.
Even there is no safe when a turbolence arrives and the flight assistant can shoot the head."
"If the bus makes a fresh brush, obviously, valuable physical laws.
Like the city pullman or the tram.
This carrier must solve the safety of stewards with an internal regulation," said and intends also that the problem is not resolved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is willing to suspend services.
Student Agency is the only transport that offers steward services..
This uses about two hundred.
The director even after the incident considers their dangerous instructions.
"When I have the feeling of being to consider the profession of steward as a dangerous job, I will abolish it.
Passerers can receive coffee and newspapers while they get out.
They would also decrease the expenditure," says.
The director of Asiana Alexej Litvin, who is a line fraction in respect of the University Agency, has motivated the lack of stéwards on its means as an interest in security.
"We don't have hostess, we're opposed to the beginning.
Before or then he will end with a dead incident," he said less than one year fa Tøden.cz.
It’s happening a tragedy.
In the incident of the line for Napoli, a young hostess in the Plześ region was deceived, which had been working for the company two years.
A Slovenian truck is probably out of the emergency corse without using the arrow and blocked the road to the pullman.
The driver of the pullman tried to avoid it with a brush manner, but he burned it with the top right side.
Jančura rejects the fact that the two places were employed in the rest of the stewart.
"It is not possible to reserve these places in long-trade pullmans, they are uncertain."
This is in mind of complaining the automobilist of the truck.
The Agency will not wait for the Court's sentence to pay the damages to the girl's family, but is expected to be financially rewarded by the accused.
Revision of the law?
Not viewed
The revisation of the law, on which a group of 30 experts worked by the Ministry of Transport for more than one year, could lead to the movement of stewarts at bus board.
"But no concrete results have been achieved.
They do not consider both pullmans, they take more than the pointing system, maximum speed on the auto and use of the cell during the driving," says the experts Hośin.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of stewarts as a great threat to the security of passengers", concludes the Havelka port, that bus security control is the competence of the police and security offices.
The hopes of Düsseldorf point on Francoforte
They do not miss the talks in the letter of the WestLB Director addressed to the home collaborators.
In the monthly letter that could be "the capital market center of the Financial Case Case Group" through the meeting of the banking institute of Düsseldorf with the Deka-Bank of Francoforte.
West LB would launch a "competent block" with sustainable benefits in such a company.
Furthermore, it could be a decisive shock for further links in the field of countries' banks.
Thus it is read when a administrative advisory in difficult times wants to demonstrate the capacity of action.
Because WestLB is still under strong pressure.
Not only by the European Commission but also through the National Financial Monitoring Service, noting time ago to the regional government of Northern Rwanda that the time leads to the search for a future solution.
The links between the Deka-Bank, which the same customers of the Case di Resparmio are already known because of their investment funds, and WestLB certainly speaks about a little nice, even by Francoforte.
He reported at the end of August the Head of the Deka-Bank Franz Waas at the presentation of the first half of the year that a house fusion on the way Magonza with a national bank like Helaba or West LB has no sense.
However, the Governing Council of Deka, which is carried out by the regional banks and the consorts of resort cases for half, delegated the Administration Board to conduct meetings with West LB on common contracts.
It could be a matter of market negotiations or parts of them.
However, the discussions have, as they say in the parliament of the affairs, just started.
Dela Deka-Bank, with its 3000 collaborators, is one of the more covered businesses in Francoforte, it is not the first time that it is to consolidate the sector of resparation casses.
In 2003, the Deka-Bank seemed to have founded a short period with the Regional Bank of Renania-Palatinato and Helaba.
From this association with three it hasn't done anything.
As projects were published, the Asian regional bank was contrary to the participation of Helaba.
The remaining two institutions have proved to be incapable of reaching an agreement.
The regional bank of Renania-Palatinato went instead to the regional Baden-Württemberg bank in Stoccarda.
However, they have always thought about a Deka-Bank fusion with regional banks.
But at the end, the President of the Helaba's Governing Council, Sunther Merl, expressed himself against design games to meet with his house.
This seems to be aware of the knowledge, which is necessary to draw close to the various cases of the public sector.
Since the Bavarias Parliament has been elected, first, a Baden-Württemberg Country's meeting could be held with the Baden-Württemberg.
For Helaba isn't all a good news.
If you increase the pressure for other fusions, your hands will miss partners.
In the south now, the Juner partner would be, although, until now, the financial crisis has exceeded much better houses in Monaco and Stoccarda.
The association of Asia-Turingia resparmy casses participating with the 85% of Helaba has put the chain to the meeting with WestLB.
It's only NorthLB.
These geo-strategic reasons are just a account.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how the various pharmacist models of the single houses are compared.
In June, Merl noted that the decision-making question, with which the future of the regional banks would be assured, would not yet be given a response by the association of German resparation casses.
At the end, the West LB division could also be out, which is not naturally desired.
Thus the letter of the Board of Administration expresses the will of aspiring in every case to a "general resolution".
You will see how the reunification of single parties with the Deka-Bank will work.
The second weekend of the bird party is dedicated to Italians
For Elena is the first time when Luca is the third or fourth.
This time Elena is present to the party as a friend, and so he says it's different.
Besides 5l. of the Kaiser Mark is on foot a barbecue mass and shows to about 200 travelers who are the deep tons that can produce from the gorge.
Elena's before Luca's cup and after a shooting.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here at the parking of bus near the Porta Newa station, this night starts at 23.45 4 flights with destination Monaco, Festa de Birra, arrived at 6,30 p.m...
Three flights are mainly reserved to Italians, only in Brazilians.
In an angle of the parking, the South Americans are sing with the band in their hands, having already celebrated during the night.
It's so ridicule, says Marco, that it's not for Italians.
Marco that brings a long capt with false filth and a couple of eyes with silvered widths belong to the bus.
For five years they go to the Octoberfeest, this year 3 tours.
The night date, day to the party, returning at 22:30.
Tonoon he would only believe unnecessary expenditure, says Marco.
The cost of 45 euros includes the journey, the welcome of the brindisi with the Kaiser bird, made in accordance with the Bavarian reality standards, the disease and the German guide – Marco has visited a German course in Francoforte.
And so night the bus go around the Brenner.
There's no bird yet.
The silence falls in the bus, the travellers sleep.
In the better way, they will still need their strength.
They stop in Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian targa on the A9 road before Monaco make a short break.
When, as was expected, the Marco group reaches at 6,30 to the parking near the Theresienwiese, there are already some 50 bus from all Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are grouping, Marco explains the attack programme last time.
First: Put the yellow caplin.
On the left is written "Oktoberfest" next to the website of the Marco Travel Agency: "Conoscersiviazinging.it".
Second: "When they open the doors of the bird's cemetery means run!", said Marco first morning.
"Core!" Run and occupate the places in the tent.
"It's not before, we're locked, and not all the yellow legs sit on the same bread, divided into the acute space!"
The coast is 8.25 EUR, Marco url.
And don't forget to give the bathroom.
"To demonstrate the security service, that we do well!
If you leave the places, they're gone!"
Third: "State at 22.30 points we'll meet again here! Comprehended?"
It's part of the party.
For the road, a attack comes out of the yellow woods to the trees, the road cards and even a advertising card of a large bavarous party.
You want to be ready to shoot the retreat.
It's the second weekend of the party, known as "the final week of the Italians".
There is no need to be a 50-mile, which goes to cross the Alpins and enter the tendings, that 10% of the visitors are deeply derived from Italy.
The police of Monaco is strengthened with seven officials of the High Adige, Italian volunteers support the Bavari Red Cross, which makes a statistics on nationalities, where Italians come to the first place with 200 medical treatments in front of English (circa 60 medicines) and Australians (circle 80).
Predominantly loved by Italians is the tendon of the Hofbruuhaus.
1. Unsomn nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system is relatively stabil, confirmed the Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück last week..
It is good that the policy has used the word "relative" and also emphasized that the German banking sector is not resolved by critical developments.
Because the crisis has started the weekend.
The real estate financer Hypo Real Estate, noted in DAX, obtained from a German bank consortium a milliardary credit, so that you can protect from market turbolences.
A special person of the situation said to Reuters Monday, support credits would be reached up to EUR 35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate must only pay interests for the requesting party.
The money comes both from private and public banks.
The loss of the Depfa affiliated.
The State financing under a newspaper article has been refinanciated in a short term – which is not more possible because of the market challenge.
In the first half of 2008, bank reserves were reduced from 95% to EUR 2,37 million, and the capital share also decreased from 1.6 to 1.45.
Income and net income by financial affairs was decreased by 0 compared to the last year, increased benefits and certain actions as well as the liquidation of appropriations in funds have reduced over 70% of EUR 5 ml.
Only higher income from the refund of subordinated compensation costs that are due to the restructuring of the former Depfa group as well as the reimbursement of interests in accordance with the single text of tax laws and the management of businesses for enterprises, the negative benefit has been sufficiently moderate with approximately 16%.
The former public financer after being privatized in 1990 was lost in the speculation with commercial real estate credits, which were deported in the Aareal Bank.
Since the income in the classic financing was too low, Depfa has joined more in infrastructure projects and in the financing of common projects of private and state investors (PPP) and has been internationally diversified.
The Hypo Real Estate now must amortize the value of the affiliate, which will have a basic material effect on the profit and loss of the group.
The fact is that the divisions have been cancelled.
Yes, in 2007 2/3 were reduced.
The Hypo Real Estate after Depfa's absorption is an important financing of the State and infrastructure.
It is more dependent on market refinancing between banks compared to other institutions, because it does not have customer credit deposits.
As a result of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the grant of credits between banks in the main part has been shocked, because banks accumulate liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate is annually required for a part of the Depfa credit portfolio – about 50 mld. – refinancing means for a short time.
According to the advertisement of Hypo Real Estate, the financial requirement of the group was covered by the credit for a certain period and the company protected by the impact of the monetary markets for most non-operators.
From other sources it feels that refinancing is assured until the end of 2009 by money.
The President of HRE Georg Funke's Directorate Committee, on the other hand, said that HRE group will not need the currency markets shortly.
The Federal Bank and the National Financial Monitoring Agency (BaFin) are based on the fact that the HRE Group’s commerciality is still insured.
This is hopeful for shareholders and bank creditors.
In view of the dynamics and the impassency of the crisis, there will be no guarantee.
It is possible that the financing is not completely used.
But also the opposite is not to exclude.
After Sunday night the bank was learned about it was to fail, the momentary saving has not been able to calm the souls.
The shift rate of 75% over 3,30 euros.
They regulate the courses of each other.
While the previous level debts are almost inadmissible, the rates of the funds are decreased.
In particular, the mutuals of the Employee Würettemberg-Hypo, including the deficiencies with expiry over 2009.
Before the residents of the HRE seemed to be an alternative investment, their valuance should now be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system after strengthening the crisis of the banks and its institutions itself.
Even if the central banks, governments and the less damaged banks are still ready, you can be counted on an ammunition of annualities within the term.
Or in function, what no one is shocking to expect – that the financial crisis will be over in the next 15 months.
But with regard to information recovered because of partial statistics, almost certain probability has become a justified hope.
In particular, it will create long-term investors some nights in the decision if they divide their commitments.
Short-term investors may conclude the report of losses for future compensatory tax payments on maturity.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento-Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop 16 years old, the first school day should be presented to Tachibana Highschool, the girls start to ride: Germany is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word already from Mangas-ne New Trade Log in Japan.
The first school day in Japan
I was embarrassed.
I was also able to go to school.
Besides Tokio's margins to Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes of train to get to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find her alone, and I wasn't lost.
The beginning of the first lesson hour seems not to be fixed as we were in the Late Sassion.
The schools arrive soon from 8 in later, until 8.40 begins a short colloquie with professor, the so-called "home room".
But before the lesson started, he touched me.
I am not the man who speaks desires towards people, above a class of 40 schools.
Because I had not yet the school uniform, I put a old round of the hosting mother, together with a trace, blue calcets and cooking black shoes.
That's how I put me in front of the cattedra and I tried to speak well: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - I'm Sylvana, I come from Germany and celebration between my birthday.
At that time I was very pleased to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls of the class have been striking, riding and signed, and then I heard the word "Kawaii".
I've already known her from my Mangas.
It belongs to the essential lessic of Japanese girls to survive and meaning "sweet, sweet".
Then I run fast to my place.
The girl close to me, she was a honour to sit next to a exchange school.
The rest of the lesson time was continued quietly, but when he played the gong, I was slaughtered in the true sense of the word.
Everything talked disorderly and smiling and smiling me with questions – then it's really difficult to understand the English of Japanese.
In the pause, everyone opened their blessings.
My hosting mother also made me the lunch cart - is different from the German skin panins.
I had residual with species, salsiccin, ceriol and algebra, fruit and a species of involtiins with meat and tofu..
I don't even know what I eat exactly in Japan.
Everything looks strange and have a completely new shooting.
In fact, it's really good.
Maybe except the skin shoes under salt, brrr!
The Bento is not only a breakfast at Japanese schools.
There is a time when a girl regrets a Benefit made from it, prepared enough artistically, with the hope of doing the boy's knowledge during the recreation.
I read it in my Manga smokes.
I'm very curioso if I can find it.
"Why really Japan?" They asked me my friends when I told, I would like to go for a year to school in Japan.
I always said:
"Why I'm sweet."
Finally, I'm reading the Mangas for years.
And to better understand the smokes and cultures contained, first or then I started learning a little Japanese language.
I was completely convinced that we came once.
I also love traditions, uses and costumes.
I have a lot here.
On the one hand, Japan is a place of technologies and last trends - from the opposite part: serious, disciplinary and traditional.
Since everything is well organized, I have never heard me lost, even though Tokyo is the largest city I have never seen in my life."
1. Rats also have feelings
A rat or a rat fly when they feel the danger.
The neurolog Joseph Le Doux is convinced: many animals have feelings.
4. But how can you see if, when they act in our same way, our feelings have the same?
In the Internet newspaper "Edge" for a few years are published articles of scientists.
6. SPIEGLE ONLINE in a series presents answers selected to the question: "What do you think it's true, without trying to try it?"
I think the animals have feelings or other conscious states, without me or someone else has been able to prove it, since we can't even prove that others have conscience.
But in this case we must at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. When we refer to other species and ask questions about the feeling or generally of conscience, we enter into a impratory territory because the reference base is not coherent.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, he does the same things that the other animals do. That's how he died, fled or attacked.
People act in a similar manner, from where some scientists understand that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I don't believe this.
Two aspects of the brain structure make us difficult to transmit our feelings to the animals.
On the one hand, the front frontal cortex is often linked with human conscience, the associated circuits (as for its direct comparison to the short memory and the executive and control functions).
In the man this long area is much more developed than in the other primates and it seems that among the other creatures it is completely missing.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness, which depends on the prefrontal court, including knowledge, whom we are, and the ability to plan and decide, the foundation on the presuppose that man even differs from the other primates.
Another dramatic speciality should be presented in the way to speak about man: since a large part of life is linked to the language, it is often said that it is linked to conscience.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
Although consciousness does not depend on the language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of the animal, as has been done, would certainly differ much from the circumstances of our conscience.
This is why it is difficult to find out how conscience can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, in analyzing it through his experience because of the special hardware, their research will lead to great problems.
Most interpretations refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of conscience to which science would be more easy to access.
We could analyze animal conscience processes without their contents, and this happens in studies on the short memory of the primates, especially in the example of the vision.
So for this principle, Christof Koch and Francis Crick are following, they first go to the nervous linked of conscience as to the cause mechanisms: both may be identical but not necessarily.
Interestingly, this principle also shows the value of the prefrontal currency for the implementation of the display.
So what does it mean for feelings?
I put them into the fact that a emotional system like fear is active in one of its conscious activities of the brain.
So what we indicate as "terror" is the mental state in which we find when the activity of the defence system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as the body's reactions) works on the memory.
Thus, the feelings are closely connected to the regions of the court, which characterize the primates and in particular human being.
With the speaking nature, we are creating subtle disfunctions of the hearing, because we can distinguish and categorize the situations to describe them to others.
For example, Antonio Damasio believes that the feelings result from the most primitive activities of the regions of the body of the feelings of the cortex and the cephal paleo, similar to Jack Pankseep, which, however, has focused more on the paleocefale.
Since this network during human evolution has not been much changed, this would be absolutely part of the extensive feelings of the species.
At the purely theoretical level, I can't contradict it, but I think it is unreasonable.
Pankseep adds arguments about the fact that what for rats and human beings appears like fear, you probably have so warned in both cases: but how can you see, if rats and human beings prove the same thing when they act in a similar manner?
Should a shock in the case of danger flee like even if he felt fear?
In my eyes, the simple behaviour can not show any vital likeness yet.
And i.e. the neural compartment continues to be helpful: rats and human beings have similar paleoencephals, the weaknesses even a brain.
But is the paleoencefale responsible for feelings?
And when can you even show it for humans: how would you want to prove on rats?
I think the rats and other mammals, may adjust insects (who knows it?), feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And as their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (which human conscience is based on specific circles and language), I prefer to study the emotional behavior instead of the emotional feelings of rats.
In any case, there are progress at neural levels here, as it comes to the same procedure on rats and men.
As I do not search for language and conscience in rats, so I don't do it about their emotions, I don't even know whether they exist.
This may be considered mype, but I prefer to step forward, instead of shocking continuously against a wall.
I'm a practical emotive for the appointment.
The President of the EUFA Platini: sent for Poland and Ukraine
The Vice-Premier Iwan Wasjunik said that the preparations will soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The Government sees Uefa's decision to Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and in its ability to organize Europe with Poland," said Wasjunik
"But this is not an amnisty for our country.
The work is just started and there is still much to do in both countries."
Both home master countries are zoppicating in the walk table for construction or reconstruction of stories, streets, hotels and airports.
The number of stages to be advised to Europe will eventually be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't lose more time.
Now we must work with the maximum speed," said the President of the Ukrainian Association Grigori Surkis.
"EUFA will have us constantly"
A more radical step was done in Poland.
After many scanners, the direction of the PZPN Association was suspended by the National Olimpique Committee and was replaced by the Independent Administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee was meeting on request by the Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
"The serious danger that PZPN is not able to operate according to the rules", said Drzewiecki to the Polish Information Agency.
"In a letter we have assured the President of the EUFA Michel Platini that the preparation to the EM 2012 will not suffer."
Many exhibitors of the first division only in the past season have been sentenced for manipulation, and finally the beginning of the Lega was to be sent back to the last time.
Dennis Quaid shocked
She wanted to promote a new movie, in an interview, she talked about the privacy, and now has greatly with the former: the star of Hollywood Meg Ryan has declared adultery her ex Dennis Quaid.
He's smiling and smiling.
The war of the Roses at a delay for the former couple of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid marriages: Seven years after their separation, the two actors of Hollywood now discuss one with one another a bad strict - in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week was expressed on the reasons for the marriage failure: "Dennis has been in my long faith, and this was very painful."
You would have come to know it only after the separation.
The opportunity for the "spogliar of the soul" was the work with Ryan's printing for his new film "The Women" – the history of an adultery.
The reaction of Dennis Quaid to his publicly declared adult husband was clearly distracted: would be "audited", said the fifty-third to "New York Daily News", which "Meg for the first time repeated and re-elabored the story of our report".
It would also be "deplorable" that in Jack, the seventeenth son who had together, again, "remember the pain and sovereignty, that a separation means for every child."
While Ryan from the separation lives alone, Quaid is again married and will soon become a gentle father.
And therefore his judges are closed with the arrow: "My life in every case goes forward.
I'm glad to have a wonderful family to which everything is for the best."
Call prices for airlines and hotels
In the first half of 2008, flights and advertisements in Europe were more economic than the previous year.
In Germany, the flights would be up to 50% more economic.
Flights and nights in the hotel have become more convenient - this is the result of a study of the financial provider and traveller American Express.
The company analyzed its data of the reserves of the first half of 2008 and after an increase in prices in the first quarter, it has observed a clear calamity in the second quarter.
After the hotel market prices are increased for years, the prices in many places are already calmed.
From January to March the prices in 41 of the 48 European cities, which are still in average around 6.9 compared to 2007
However, from April to June the prices were over 3,6% lower than the previous year.
The most apparent trend would be in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37% less than one year ago.
The American Express sees as a reason for this the weak quotation of the dollar, which would lead to a "called desire to travel American tourists"
Even financial centres such as Francoforte and London would be touched by the hotel price recession in a stronger way from industrial centres such as Hannover, Colonia or Stavanger
In the Northern city, the hotel prices with a increase of 26.3% deserve the record in Europe.
In terms of flight prices, the trend in the first quarter is still understood above:
As a result of the cherosening of the Economy Class passengers had to pay average 7,1% in comparison with 2007, long-term fuel flights would be up to 29.2% more carry.
From April to June the prices of the Economy Class air tickets have been calculated in a mean of 12,5 % compared to the previous quarter, in the first class and in the business price changes have been larger.
In Germany Prices are grown more strongly than in other European countries:
From January to March the prices were decreased from 11.9 %, in the second quarter, 23.6 %.
As regards the internal German flights according to the study, prices have been measured.
The reason for the price crop would, on the one hand, be the low economic growth, explaining the company.
The request in many segments of the aircraft market has been decreased.
On the other hand, it would be through the open heaven agreement that liberalizes the air traffic between the uses and Europe, an increased pressure on competition.
The mark of the critical situation would be the suppression of non-received trafficking at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 would have declared fall – only in Europe was treated by 24 airlines.

The dark matter affects the flight of space sons
For years, a mysterious phenomenon creates perplexity among scientists: the dark matter influences the speed of space sounds during the so-called Swing-by hand.
The experts are afraid that the general theory of Albert Einsteins' relationship may not be all exact.
Space Sonda Ulysses fly through space for almost 18 years.
Because of the fuel tubas that frozen rapidly now constitutes death for congelation.
Among the scientists for years a mysterious phenomenon creates disappearance – the annomy of the/o Swing-by
The Swing-by is a flight manner of space sounds, with which they receive extra slancio/spita/oscillation in the gravity field of a heavenly body, for example on Earth.
So the sounds can save much fuel.
The Euro-American Cassini-Huygens research sond used this physical experiment as well as the Ulysses Solar Sond.
What the students have been surprising for years: the races do not do all as they would expect to be in accordance with the gravity law.
On the other hand, there are irregularities in the speed.
Sounds become immediately faster or slower.
Until the physicians could not explain this effect.
Annomy of the Swing-by's year again.
Some experts fear that the general theory of the relationship of Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction force of the material with a curvature of space, may not be all exact.
The American Physician Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study of Princeton strongly believes as before Einstein did not wrong, and try to explain the anonymology of the Swing-by through so dark matter that the astronomies have advertised in the cosm.
"Anomatic answer may be the dark matter that could also be very close to the Earth," writes.
With the existence of the dark material, space studios are only aware of about 10 years.
From you, of course, there is a attraction force, whose effect on other heavenly bodies is seen.
Instead of all invisible, you are not shipping or reflecting any electrical radiation of sorta, especially appended to any visible light.
According to the scientists' calculations, the dark material is at least a good fifth of the whole cosm mass.
Tourists raised in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their sequestrators, tourists raised in Egypt would be newly free, as he confirmed the Italian minister.
The drivers from Sudan requested a number of millions of euros for rescue.
In a shooting prior to release 6 sequestrators, they were killed.
In the south of Egypt, five Germans were raised.
The ransom treaties are already undergoing.
The Germans are always in the midst of the sequestrators.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists raised in Sahara are certainly free.
This reported consequently the Egyptian state television, the Arab Embassy Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs Franco Frattini confirmed the delivery after the Italian television curnacle Sky TG 24: "Their civilians and other obstacles have been released
We're looking at their health status," Frattini said.
The 5 Germans, 5 Italians and a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian councils would be in good health and security, reported the Egyptian state television.
The 19 components of a sending in the wilderness have already been located in the journey for the Cairo.
They still remain a little clear the backscene of a shooting shooting before the release of the obstacles: so the slaughterers after the indications of an Egyptian public security agent would have been prepared for the conclusion of the slaughter, before the Sudan army killed 6 of them.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed for a ransom," he said the officer.
It would be "as only a treaty to take the obstacles to deliver", when soon the "that surprise has arrived."
The Sunday Sudan soldiers in the border zone between the Sudan, the Ciad and Egypt killed by firearms 6 of the raids and captured 2 of them.
The sequestrators had provided from Germany a ransom of EUR 6 million; the money should be granted by the German wife of one of the obstacles.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported about a German intermediary, the release of obstacles would be delayed because the raders feared their security.
According to the report, the sequestrators wanted to put women freely in ostating after the payment of the ransom.
The men would have been guarded so that the drivers wouldn't have had a safe way of escape.
The German Ambassaded to Cairo has rejected a position in respect of the report .
Patrimonia abuses "trained the suicide"
Years of abuse by the patriarch have brought a woman to kill himself, he declared a court.
Michael Trerise, 57 years old, was in prison for six years after accepting eight cases of sexual aggression.
The Court of Truro Crown Court learned that he had regularly angry his daughter Stephanie Randle when she had between five and seven years.
Trerise wrote in a note of condemnation: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Mrs Randle was killed in his house in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at age 34.
When she was a child and lived in Coventry, Trerise blessed her and blessed her before having sexual relations, while the mother was out of work in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the Ottanta years, and he returned to live in Cornoa.
His daughter's head went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Mrs Randle, who had spent a long time as voluntary to the National Trust, was tortured by the abuses that had caused him.
In 2006, the Public Minister Ramsey Quaife said to the court that the friends of Mrs Randle, who was a nice surfing and ciclist, were "emotionally dead", and that he had "moving with life".
In April 2007, his real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
You think he's killed with a plastic store.
Mr. Randle comforted her daughter's patriarch, who wrote a condemnation letter that ended: "I lifted her and blessed her."
"I didn't hurt him sexually.
I feel responsible for your death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "Leis is a extremely strange feticist, and for his victim must have been terrible, especially when he was only seven years old.
"This splendid saga ends with the victim that gets away of life.
More harder is the fact that if it hadn't done it, it would be difficult that the facts were completed before the court."
I realize the effects that the father and mother of Stephanie have had on their daughter in these years.
"Otherwise it was clearly likely that you were a promised and happy young success."
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Office of Cabinet Office, which left top secret documents on a train in June, must be accused of the official Secrets Act, learned by the BBC.
The man was transferred by the Ministry of Defence when he left on the train for Waterloo two highly classified documents.
The documents were passed to BBC before they were sent to the police.
It is the less delicate of the accused under this law and there is nothing that suggests a criminal attempt.
BBC Frank Gardner’s defence corresponding said that the movement would come as a surprise to many of the administration.
"It would have thought that this had been treated internally with the Mode and the Bureau," said .
The employee, which cannot be appointed, is accused of being sentenced under section 8.1 of the act, the clause relating to the safeguarding of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the office should be accused of the metropolitan police because of the very sensitive nature of his work.
Documents lost contained al-Qaeda assessments and the security forces of Iraq.
He was informed of the Monday morning decision and was taken away from his home and brought into a hidden place.
Construction companies face the B&B account
The English construction companies could face an account of more than 800,000 £ after the saving of the Bradford & Bingley bank.
The government gave 14 billion sterlines to protect the deposits of 2.6 million Bradford & Bingley.
The interest on that loan will be paid by all companies taking the money of the savings, including 59 construction companies.
The Director-General of the Building Society Association (BSA) Adrian Coles said that it is "irritant" that companies and their members have to pay.
The loan of 14 billion sterlines will eventually be paid when the mutuals of Bradford & Bingley will be rescued.
But the interest that will be matured in fractures will be made each year to 700 financial companies that take deposits, but the interest that will be mature will be depended every year to 700 financial companies accepting deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It is unfortunately that those institutions that have been conducted in a careful way... are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been very less careful.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that every company had to pay in proportion to the deposits that he had, and that the company among them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Ombudsman estimates that the interest on the loan will be assessed to 450 million sterlines in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find 81 million sterlines to pay the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Construction Society Association, said to the BBC that he believed it is injust.
"It is unreasonable that those institutions that have been conducted in a careful way in the home market are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been very less careful."
According to the SAB, no company has failed since the documentation started in 1945.
"We have to examine all aspects in the next weeks to see what options there are to protect construction companies and their members from what might be a significant account", added Mr Cole.
The interest required in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year at the end of March.
In 2010 the interest of the whole year will be required and this may be almost two times higher.
Since construction companies are mutual organizations without shareholders, their members are finished to pay the account through higher prices or lower interest rates on accounts.
Milk salt 5 penny to litro
People in Jersey are faced with the fact that they need to pay more for their milk.

Denied the warranty to the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A Bangladesh Court rejected a warranty request by President Sheikh Hasina, which means that you might be arrested when he returns to the country.
His lawyers said that the Court refused to grant you a warrant for extermination of $50 million (729.700) to a business man when he was a member of the Parliament.
The case is one of the many corruptions accused us against her.
The political rival of Sheikh Hasina, Khaleda Zia, was released on warning at the beginning of the month.
The return to Sheikh Hasina's Bangladesh is planned for the next weeks, but his party, Awami League, asked the timely government of the country supported by militarys on the day before total freedom.
The correspondants say that while you were going outside for medical care on the word, it is not clear according to the terms of your release, if you can stay free when you return to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say that it will be called to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The High Court has rejected the question of warranty for Sheikh Hasina by pointing out that you can't have the warrant viewed that it's already on the outside of the word for medical care," says its lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will present you a call against the Holy Court's order."
His lawyers explain that he needs the warranty to return from the country to the outside to prepare the elections of December.
Sheikh Hasina is waiting for return to home after October 17, she said a senior leader of the Awami League party.
You've been arrested last year after the military powered government took the power, but was released in June to go to the outside to receive medical care.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all the accused against them.
Fight for the Afghan anti-polish campaigns
About 200,000 children in Afghan lack the recent immunization campaign because of violence connected to the Taliban, says the United Nations.
The United Nations has introduced a vaccination programme in six provinces last week.
But it's said that you can't reach children in the parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
A United Nations porter said that this happens, despite the promises of Taliban who would not attack or hinder thousands of staff who carried vaccinations.
BSkyB lost legal battle with ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal struggle with the Commission's decision to force the company to reduce its participation in the rival ITV TV station.
BSkyB was said by the competitive court to break its actions in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the committee had said that BSkyB's participation hindered competition and allowed a ITV-infringement.
BSkyB purchased the participation in 2006 in an agreement that actually blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media by buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the acquisition of BSkyB to ITV was doubtful about the independence of ITV, so that the Commission would initiate an investigation.
The Head of Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom's regulator opposed to the purchase.
BSkyB argued that preventing it to reduce its ITV stage was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedie - especially as BSkyB had said it would overcome its vote rights.
New investigation on the case of the Procureur of the United States
The American Prosecutor-General appointed a Public Minister to examine the license of nine American lawyers in 2006.
The operation occurs when a report on the case by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticizes the actions of the administrative officials.
The report was critical towards the White House, the legislators and the ex-advocate General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was cut off from the fear that the applicants would have been removed for political reasons.
The Special Minister Nora Damehy will now invest whether the investigated officials during the investigation have lied to the investigators in the attempt to hinder justice.
"Series accused of potentially criminal behaviors have not been completely investigated or approuved", said the Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The allocation of a special public minister with the power to acquire witnesses to witness was one of the main recommendations.
The debate began when nine American lawyers were removed from their positions from the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department said the lawyers were denied for delay.
But later it was shown that the licensed lawyers had not been evaluated more than many other colleagues, bringing many observers to conclude that the license was motivated by the policy.
Some of the applicants were involved in the judiciary action against representatives of the High Profile Congress, while others refused to investigate the accused of fraud to the harm of democratic electors.
The American Prosecutors investigate and bring forward to courts on account of the government.
They may be denied at any time, but they cannot be licensed for political reasons.
The next head of the department of Justice, the Prosecutor General Alberto Gonzales, was found in the storm for licensing, and finally resigned his position.
A number of other officials of the department of Justice have been released.
(The report of the general Inspector has been very critical in terms of the role of Mr Gonzales in the case, saying that it was a primary responsibility in licensing, which had taken its role in the leadership and was extremely highlighted during the process.
Other officials, including Bush Karl Rove's former senior assistant, were criticized because they did not cooperate with the investigations.
The ecics of the Meat Loaf will be celebrated
The rock star Meat Loaf is to be honored to Q Awards for his innocent epic Bat Out Of Hell.
The songer, who will remove his special gold premium at the ceremony next week in London, said to be "good" to win the recognition.
The song, which takes nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the track of the album's hidden of 1977 of Meat Loaf.
Coldplay will conduct the appointments for the premises of this year, which is on the list of nominations in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor of the magazine Q, said, "There are some songs that transcenden things as time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is without doubt one of those."
The song, composed of Jim Steinman, required a strong voice provided by Meat Loaf.
He opened with a instrumental section that was almost two minutes.
The song was performed as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached the fifth place.
But Meat Loaf Bat Out Of Hell's album remained almost nine years in class and came to sell more than 40 million copies in the world.
Meat Loaf - true name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including an intervention for an unregular heart battius in 2003 after he slaughtered on the ball.
In 2007, the rings began to cut the concerts.
It was later that he had a crystal on a vocabulary corde.
Dark streets of town, often forgotten and maybe soon in sale
New York City has thousands of adventures, boulevards, streets and other passages, some famous, other merly uses.
But also many veterinary taxists and residents have long time find it difficult to give the position of Extra Place, for it is because they have never heard it.
The small road is in the East Village and go north from the First Street – without doing the Second Street – between Bowery and the Second Avenue.
About 30 feet width and 120 length, similar to a powdery row than an active traffic.
There are no road signs.
It's virtually impossible to see it on a normal atlante.
Nevertheless, the road must have a mystery.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the real estate company of recent light buildings built on the First Street.
You want to restore Extra Place and create a cleaner passenger for shopping and business that should open in the new buildings.
Other amazings include neighbors for a long time that say they were affected by the switched road simply because it was one of the last remains of the past.
But the city's conservation and development department, which has road control, is not interested in maintaining it.
During a meeting of the Committee on the use of the field of the Common Commission of the Cities and Avalon Bay, some representatives of the Cities and Avalon Bay have made a proposal for the real estate company to buy the ways.
But the Committee prefers that the road remains in the hands of the city, and has requested a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, director of the Community Board 3.
"There's very little space left to the property of the city, and we would like the city to continue to have extra Place," said.
"It might be the proposals to system it and to manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure public access."
Avalon Bay has been announced many months ago that he wanted to restore the small road and install places, including some to use a coffee to which the real estate company hopes to allocate the space.
The idea that Avalon Bay buys the road has been public for the first time in meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a porter in Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the road, it doesn't necessarily mean that she wants to have it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renew this decree and transform it into a public agency," he said, adding that the city suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a Reservation Portal, said that it was really the desire of the city to sell the road and noted that the purpose of the Agency was to develop the property instead of managing it.
Comparing to his most colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a historic light.
Some believed that he took the name in 1802, when a large agricultural company that had Philip Minthorne came to divide between his many children and the stretch of land was not claimed.
The door on the back of CBGB, the rock rock monument that closed in 2006, open on Extra Place, and the road may be better known as the set for the photo of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia".
"The land was wonderful," said Danny Fields, manager of the Ramones, who made the photo in November 1976.
"It was a cold of immondience, clothes and pieces of boxes, poster, sheets, cords."
Some residents, including some bloggers who write "generation" of East Village, opposed to sell extra Place, adding that the piece of public property, modestly, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare rarity – a framment of town almost for nothing changed that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled: "The book of Lamentations: A look at a little natalgic to the city in the way of extinction"), published a part of the city's history that appeared in The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is an extra angry of viucelessness, drinks also day and delimited doors of shopping helmets and windows with bathrooms, with old weekly newspapers that swim through the low-founds."
With a few exceptions, the road seemed almost the same as a recent night.
A rat slowly runs through the back of the road next to a door that drived inside the CBGB, which is now the site of an aristocratic clothing trade.
The walls were graffited and a empty bird bottle from 22 times near a group of abandoned daily freshes.
Some past men said they were rarely thinking of Extra Place but they suggest that they would need to be a little fun.
Mr Fields, on his part, said that some people also think that the attraction of the road in its current state is under evaluation.
"The best years of my life," he said, "we were in black, shocked and disgusting places."
The bilateral debate: conviction in English
In this point of educational look, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discussed the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior member in California's studies and senior director of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-auteur of the book "Don't good as you think: Why the media class needs to choose a school."
To take the Spanish electors really is a complicated business.
The educational projects of Barack Obama are a significant example.
Mr Obama's campaign notes that "the African and Latin students have significantly less likely to diplomate than white students, "what is true.
To combat these shortcomings in achievement of the objectives, Obama's educational plan specifically supports, among other things, "transitory bilingual education" for English students.
However, the question for Obama is whether its commitment to bilingual education, which highlights the teaching in different languages from English, does not take account of his interest in meeting learning differences.
Let's take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a elementary school in the Eastern Lake of Los Angeles.
School students are for most Spanish and low income.
More than a third of the students, many of whom are coming recently, are studying English.
But, among the fourth students, a surprising 100% of students tested higher levels in 2008's mathematical state review.
A very surprising 93% of the fourth students have done the expert level test on the art-di-linguage-ing.
This unbelievable result has been achieved using a different ingredient from the favorite by Mr Obama.
Sixth Street highlights the repass and exercise, continuously evaluating the skills and a position of the type "no one apologize".
In addition, and here, Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, Director of the Sixth Street, the objective approach of the school for English students is "full assignment".
The use of English highlights the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Ms. Mikels, who opposed the bilingual education, said to me, "We had a fantastic success with a student just coming from Mexico and if you had entered the class 12 months after you wouldn't have been able to identify what it was."
"Function", he observed "for us"
Obama would take the model a school like Sexth Street Prep to replicate it in other Spanish schools with English students?
The results reached by the school make the answer to that question very easy, but the educational policy in the same party (National Education Associations is a long-term supporter of bilateral education) and its continuing support to bilateral education prevent Mr Obama's response.
While he agrees that immigrants should study English, Obama recently resolved the question when he said that people should stop her worried about the "single-English legislation".
Instead, he said, "You must be sure your children are able to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close these lacunes of achievement, it should be carefully considered the educational models that work instead of disrespect them or banalize them.
Oil washs brushly and renews economic fear
Oil prices are slowly reduced because of the concerns that even the American Reserve Plan for Financial Markets may not be able to restore the economy.
The future of the greage is dropped from 7% to 99.80 dollars at the bar at the New York market shop in the morning operations.
The prices lost more than 20 dollars at bar from last Monday.
In the last two weeks, the markets of the first materials were defeated by the financial shock of Wall Street, and by a couple of powerful uragans in the Mexican Golf.
After reaching a small amount of $145.26 at the bar in June, prices were covered up to $90 at the bar at the beginning of this month, before coming again, on the background of a tremendous incertitude in the financial markets.
The anxiety has influenced investors again Monday also after the Congressive leaders had said to have reached an agreement at the weekend about the saving plan, the greatest of the history.
The news was desired by the fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far away from the past.
In the last episode of progressive fusion, Citi Group will cover the Wachovia Corporation bank operations, said the Sunday Government.
At the same time, the Belgian, the Netherlands and Luxembourg governments have partly nationalized the Fort European Financial Conglomerate.
Barclays Capital analysts said that the frenetic negotiations on the weekend had brought to a salvation agreement "It seems to have failed to revive the market's feelings.
While the worst economic situation is expected that the demand of primary materials, including oil, will calm.
"The perspective for global equity, interest rates and markets of change rates has become uncertain", wrote the investors' analysts of the German Bank in a note.
"We believe that the first materials will not be able to run to the container.
From a perspective of the first materials, our most closer concern is until what point the American virus will escape globally and in particular in China. "
Bank analysts have reduced their expectations for the next year while house oil consumption is due to the slowing economic growth, reduceing oil prices and gas prices of approximately 20 percent for 2009.
The explosion in the second fourth signals a team record.
After spending more time than anyone with the Jets uniform in the last eight and more seasons, Defense Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he looked out of the second Sunday's fourth, when the Jets transformed a game without points in a remonet.
"I saw something like this," said Ellis.
The second fourth was started after the Jets and the Cardinals had equally the grid of the threatsful clouds that overcome them with a fat game.
Then the quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles for a touchdown of 12 yards, providing the perfect signal for a afternoon in which their growing symptoms made a great step forward.
Favor found Coles for other two touchdowns in the room, including one when a cornerback is fallen and one with 10 seconds left at the end of the first time.
"I'm not out of my way," said Favre of all the passengers arrived in Coles.
He's a fantastic player.
Our communication was great, despite what people can think."
While Favre and Coles were taking up games, the defense struggled deeply the fourth back of the cardinal Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a vague launch and lifted it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
Security Eric Smith planned another passenger and intercepted it.
The linebacker David Bowens forces a warner fumble.
The last turn, the forced smoke by Bowens, might have been the most sensitive.
Cardinals went in advantage on that ownership of ball, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets had recovered the ball with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely heated a metro of 20 yards, for a benefit from 34 to 0.
It was more than the Jets ever marked in a room.
When it was asked to describe the patient, the Coach of the Jets Eric Mangini said, "The second fourth or third room?"
When it was said both - the Jets gave 21 points without reply in the third fourth - Mangini said, "I can tell you that I've enjoyed more than the second fourth than the third."
There's been a lot of points in a small time lace."
Bersenlassi rested over his world's record
Haile Bergselassess of Ethiopia has again shown because many consider it the best marathoned forever, broken their same world record at the Sunday Berlin Maratona and become the first person to run a 26.2 miles below 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory on the course pleasing in 2:03:59, Bursellasi sends in frantumes for 27 seconds his previous point of 2:03:26, rounded the last year in Berlin.
At 35 years, Burselassie puts the 26th world's record of a so disbalanced carriage that has produced a world's sample or a world's record at every distance from the Metro to the Maratone.
Last month, Burserlassie slaughtered Pechino's olympic maratone, fearing - perhaps too alarming - that air pollution would worse its asthma problems.
Instead, he decided to run to Berlin.
In conditions almost perfect - solely and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the arrival - Bursellassi has winned Sunday with a slow average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per million.
Soon as a mid-fundist such as Bursellasio and Paul Tergat del Kenya have gone to long distances, the record of Maratona has fallen over more than two minutes in the past decade, since Ronaldo from Costa del Brasil arrived in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After the Sunday's winner, Burserlassie told the reporters that two weeks ago he had clamps with powders and missed a week of allies.
Clearly, the rest left it fresh, not angry.
"I'm so happy," he said to the reporter.
"It was perfect.
I recalled a week ago, and I had doubts today, but at the end, everything went well."
It was a little criticized - especially in Kenya, the African rival of Ethiopia - to have excessively orchestrated his garages, generally avoiding many of the best marathonite stars in the world, accounting on an apple as if it was a suburbane garage, and putting the world's records above the sense of competition.
But these critics rarely reduce the size of the competences of Bursellassi as maratoneta.
With the four horns of Sunday, Burselassie reached the half-way road point in 1:02:04.
Two elite flights, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, held in competition in Bursellassi after the applicationists were svanished.
A few more than three miles from the arrival, Burserlassi made a final census to separate from Kwambai, which ended in 2:05:36, enhancing its best personal time of almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi has arrived third in 2:07:48.
In the Women's Garden, Irina Mikitenko, native of Kazakhstan, who is now German citizen, has completed a significant year winning in 2:19:19, the seventh more fast time than ever.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world's record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36 years of age, was a surprising winner of the Maratona of London in 2:24:14.
Pechino's games have been lost with what is described as a bad incident, but it is careful to win in Berlin, making its best personal time of almost five minutes in the third martin that has run.
You've been able to make the calculations well, leting a quarter of ethiopians and Kenyan corridors participate with a great distance, retaining them after about 18 miles and half.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia has arrived in 2 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya has finished the third in 2:25:01.
In a cityside, pride and processes of a black life
I hide in the extensive theme park on Orlando's subbows, a few miles away from smiling, laughing, and honourable city, where the pride and complications of African experience enter into life.
Eatonville, the first black city entered in the country and the birth house of Zora Neale Hurston, is not so simple as described in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three crowd camps, 300 brown skins, 300 good skins, abondance of guava, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a place of pellegring.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect for Hurston, the most famous writer of Harlem Renaissance.
Even in many ways, the city that has described - and it stops tourists understanding it in the tourist guide of Florida produced by Federal Writers' Project - remains a place in part.
It's so independent, dignity and private as it was in the Trent years, when Hurston wrote that rural nests in Florida often resisted to share their thoughts with the white man, "who knowing so little of us, don't know what it's losing."
Even now, in a year where a black presidential name, Senator Barack Obama, was called for an opening talk on the race, many who remain different from the outsider view.
"We are very careful about how our history is told," said Hortense Jones, 59 years old, a resident from the whole life and member of the oldest church in the city.
"I must be right."
Eatonville has been long defined as a paradoss of trionfum and difficulty.
It is a historical model of black power that is almost 2.400 community where poverty rate is two times the national average.
It is a letterary centre, but also an example of the shadow of the dark of the rural culture of the Southern blacks - sometimes designed, sometimes pregnant - born by the American slave.
It is not surprising that the inhabitants here are also proud and protective.
And the concern of the imagination of Eatonville really started with Zora, which all here are called Hurston.
You presented the world to your nation city through true books, rich dialects, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of the Florida guide transformed the city, just outside the Root 17, a road that runs through the often forgotten centre of Florida in a scenario of black and human drame
Bad as a snake in life and in literature, Hurston brought readers to the shopping of Eatonville's first synagogue, Joe Clarke, and then was to be more private.
"Fouri from the left to the road," wrote, "it's the modern public school, marron with the white refinations, with its well-served and cortile gardens, where Howard Miller was always shocking, thinking that he could just read and write."
You also mentioned the new husband of the Vedova Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "seats all the types and anything suits to the passenger rooms."
Thus, just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also with analfabetism, second neighbors and sex.
Of course this wasn't Fodor.
In fact, it wasn't a retreat that everyone appreciated.
"He was telling it how it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of the girls of Johnson that Hurston immortally cites men who sing gross songs about their beauty.
Add: "Af some people don't like."
Hurston is still remembered here as a living spectacle that often returned from his family transferred to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77 years old, is remembered that when Hurston was burned in the city, it was usually unforeseen in a triangle Chevrolt, smoking and smoking pantalons in a city that even today benefited from dignified beach.
Many people were shocked, says Mr. Franklin, while others were disappointed.
"The people were always very pleased to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But, adding, donando on his place on the back of the Sabelian lake, where Hurston was probably baptized, "he was never stayed long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books were out of print.
And the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although once it was a letter star, a contemporaine of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at the Barnard College in the 20s, he was settled in a slaughter without bag in Fort Pierce, Fla., where he lived.
In Eatonville, there were no great commemorative ceremony, and no great conference.
"I don't believe them understand their contribution to the world or their leave to all," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a Biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A change occurred in the 80s.
The officers of Orange Council wanted to put a five-course route through the city to restore Kennedy Boulevard, the main road to two corsies.
Orlando's expansion has already broken The Interstate 4 through the western border of the city.
The proposal comes when Eatonville was still back from a difficult period of his history.
Forced integration, in addition to other things, had finished the relative idly isolation of the community
In the Fifth Year, the battle on racial mixing brought hatred on the gate of the community.
"In that period, a group of white boys came and shooted, and things to people who were on the one side," says Mr. Franklin.
"In fact, we had a girl who was killed once.
They got a shop from a car."
In a letter from 1955 to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made an application to the Supreme Court for forced integration, defineing its decision in Brown against the school office "un insulted instead of honor for my race".
The residents now say that the disaggregation of schools, despite being positive in some aspects, disappears the cohesion of Eatonville and suddenly puts the confidence of their young people.
"The black kids were habituated to be broken - I remember this - slaughter your teacher in the morning, slaughter your teacher at night," said Mr. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and the Executive Director of the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This duration, he added, until the teachers and students did not come from the same place.
"You don't break your white teacher because your white teacher... I mean, there's a cultural division there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Citizen rights, in any way, helped and create space for many other Neale Hurstons - black writer, actor and artist who overcome the damages, as he did, with safety of himself and lines like: "How some can reject the enjoyment of my company!
I can't really understand."
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker began a long walk for the hurston's thief without targa and began to fight for the resurrection of his reputation.
Five years later, a biography acclamate on Hurston's Robert E. Hemenway shocked the libraries, retroducing it into the American Canon.
The project of the autostrade came right while her famous daughter had retraced the lights of the rivalt again.
And this time, the old neighbors of Hurston seen her as a savior.
The community began to design a festival dedicated to Hurston in 1988 to show what could be devastated with his autostrade.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return to the commemoration.
Many years later, the state went back from his project for the road.
"The five cores of the resurrected autostrade have brought what would be said high speed, a real pride for the city," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd makes it easier: "He saved Eatonville."
The victory on the project of the autostrade has helped to change the image that the city has.
Those from outside cities like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to come here in the church in 1993, began to appear in a long number, and the residents began to review the past.
Eatonville added to the public history record in 1998.
A new library to one piano (called like Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a Kennedy Boulevard repaved and pleasant.
Today, Eatonville remains a anonymy of Florida: only six miles from the centre of Orlando, it can give the feeling of a secondary road under the east rain, small as when it was found with only 27 black families in the 80s of 1800.
(It's 90% black today.)
The outsides that are going to search for the history of Eatonville, for its meaning, are often being treated with guards.
A previous permit is requested for most interviews, to some things - such as the walls on the oldest church of Eatonville, drawn by a white man, which are seeing black men in the fields - have no permission to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs Jones, a fat teacher, with a weak for the brilliant red, are still afraid that their insulating community will be angry.
However, while the Hurston Festival has expanded, it is also a high level of citizen pride.
The young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston saw their entire race: beautiful, problems and everything, no better, no worse and fiery, creative, big worker, stupid and confused as other ethnic races and groups in America.
It is a citizen affection that can be heard in the voice of Mr Franklin's nipote, Edwin Harvey, 18 years old, which intends to return to Eatonville after the colleague to work in the local government or for the police Department, which he said might need help.
And even those who are younger, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11 years old from Winter Park, seemed to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"My people, if they just come here, will think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all others," said Alondra Kenon after the messe in a recent Sunday.
"But if I really close you and take you a moment to look at the story, it's really a gracious city."
Here in New York, we all talk flexibly about funding.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If the tourists in Manhattan were far away from the newspapers and the great TV schemes of Times Square, they wouldn't be aware of staying in the cycle's eyes.
They wouldn't be sure that the glass offices, in the upper tests, bankers and hedge hedge managers who monopolize New York live every day the worst "brush day in office" from the 1929 crown.
The factors skut metal carts for the way through the marchappers, carrying muffin vacuums for breakfast meetings.
Latin Americans cross the legs between condomes by bringing, like human muds, 50 and shooting tracks stripped to a stone on their shoes.
The employees are still waiting in line for their morning bag at the boards of food on swimming pools, and it is still impossible to take a yellow taxi between 16 and 19 of a working day.
It wasn't like there was a real crisis, until I decided to open a new free of joyday afternoon with all the discours of ruin and tristeness.
Even though I planned the fact in a way that was in line with the breakfast of the afternoon at my JP Morgan Chase branch, a chain of about twenty was already waiting in the line.
Not in front of the cash sport, to remove money or deposits, but on the front of the customer service sport, where old customers order assign as assignments, tourists ask directions for the big Macy store and new customers open accounts.
Many of those I'm in front of me, I would then have learned from Starr, my "reliable banker" were in line for my same reason.
On the contrary to me, however, they have already led the savings from the smallest banks from which they do the pendorses, such as the New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Islands.
They took money from such thrifts (such as a company of construction), credit cooperation and cities bank types whose branches operate only within a state, and say to treat customers as families.
In the past years, 15 of these banks have fallen.
In the past days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in active, was submitted to the controlled administration, and while the New Yorkians traveled to home for the end of the week, a other bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion, was the search for a buyer who saved it.
The employees and acts that were in front of me, shooted for another college, moved their money to a bank understood as a safe port, the bank that is asking more warranties at Wall Street.
The common newspapers in the last weeks have become competent in financing.
A woman to my supermarket of confidence, speaking on the phone, related to Lehman Brothers, the bank went in false failure, and its employed Director-General Dick Fuld in the whole family, as it was shocking from a pig partner.
And Lyn, the uniform portine, almost fifty-first of my condominie, has changed theme with regard to our normal conversation argument on Brad and Angelina or delivering my expense.
You told me, after my visit to the bank, "I have all my market funds now!.
I changed, I'm not running any risk."
Muslim Tombe is prominent while Austria turns to the right.
Heinz-Cristian Strache, on the left of the Austrian Right Lake of the Freedom Party and Philip Dewinter of the Belgian Partie of Vlaams Belang, take part in a manifestation to present the organization "Città against Islamization" in Angust on Thursday, 17 January 2008.
They have types of signs the mosche-based road representatives with a red line that pass in the middle.
Police has accused the extremists of the right to have disfellowshipped a Muslim cemetery in Austria in the same week as the extreme right-related political parties have granted much to national general elections.
More than 90 tonnes have been seriously damaged to Traun's cemetery, near Linz, in some hours after Friday night and this morning, in which the police believed that it was an organised action.
The guilty has traced with the Jewish symbols like the star of David on some tombs, but the detectives believed may have been an attempt to mask the extremist motivations leading to a hatred for Islamic immigrants.
It is not clear if the incident is linked to elections.
A porter of the local Islamic community said that they were "deeply shocked" from the news of propanation, which happened to the end of the Ramadan, month of religious relevance for the musulmans.
Austria, in fractures, has been shipped in a spiritual research trip following its right execution in the parliamentary elections of last night.
The two extreme right partys who took about 30 percent of the votes, the Austrian freedom party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, have done a campaign with slightly anti-immigration tickets and some of their slogans have been defined by the xenofobian critics.
Heinz-Christian Straches, head of the Freedom Party who wins more than 18 percent of the votes, has held a campaign against vessels and burks and also expressed its opposition to foods that are perceived as related to Islam.
At the end of Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent Islam's growth.
Both parties seem to band the construction of mosches and miners, and they say that they are political symbols of a continuing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Reviews and analysis made immediately after the elections, which have established the extreme right as the strongest political block of the country, pointing out that the change was introduced predominantly by young electors who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Go to the outside interrupted to Gary Glitter.
In Gary Glitter, the glove star of the guilty of sexual abuse on minors, has been prohibited to travel to France and Spain from the court.
The judges imposed the prohibition of six months in Glitter after he informed the authorities that controlled him to want to go to Spain through France.
The prohibition of traveling to the outside was granted to the Kent police last juvenile after the judges provided the evidence of the previous arrest of Glitter for sexual abuse against minors.
Glitter, the true name Paul Gadi, was not present to the hearing of Ashford in Kent but was represented by the lawyers of Corker Binning.
The police of Kent submitted a request to prevent Mr Paul Gadd’s travel to the outside of France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd was not a person."
Glitter, 64 years of age, informed the authorities to want to travel to the outside as he was requested by the registration of sentences for sexual crimes.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel to the outside for more than three days.
He is also requested to give the police a warning of seven days on his expected start date.
The lack of notification to the authority may lead to a sentence for five years of prison.
Kent's police said he wouldn't want to discuss the individual cases or the possible movements of Glitter in the country.
A police porter of Kent said, "Kent's police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or outside.
"In our view, it is easier to control someone remaining in the United Kingdom because we have complete systems to manage any potential risk more effectively.
"Protection of Kent's residents is the main concern of Kent's police, and we work carefully to monitor the behavior of convictions for sexual offences registered in the country to minimize any possible risk for the public.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after 27 months in a Vietnami prison for abusing two children of 10 and 11 years of age.
When Glitter came back to Bangkok where he had to ship up on a flight to London.
But he said he was sick and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities would not have done it to pass control, and at the end they took a flight for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities did not let him enter and return to Bangkok where the Thai police and the immigration officers insisted for returning to England.
At the end, he arrived to Heathrow's 3th terminal on 22 August and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge, west of London, since Scotland Yard was successfully asked for an order to enter it in the record of sentences for sexual crimes.
Glitter was previously incarcered in the United Kingdom in 1999 for having images of child abuse.
A source of the Ministry of Internal Ministry said that Jacques Smith, the secretariat of the inner feeled safe and happy that Glitter was stopped by traveling in France and Spain.
"Photograph of the Master far from the scene to extract the character" Sonther Bauer, photograph
No shoes fleeting shoes from the first time.
Only the existence of the great masters of the flamenco, shocked by the concentration that characterizes the interpretation, to look at the appearance of the man or the woman.
One of the artists.
Otherwise, the person.
Two inseparable facts, except in the private, in those moments far away from the public, when the intimity of a loop, the depth of a shocked eyes or the expression of the hands, are natural because they must not go in scene.
The German Sunther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alternates the theatrality of some players, ballets and chitarists on the ball with the most known side of these masters.
With this goal, the photograph offers an original iconography of the flamenco, covered with it from various visual angles.
The exhibition, including in the programmation of the Photography Flamenco, reflects the international importance of this ball, always larger day," explains the artist and explains that in "Flamenco-People" it could also be treated as common people, but seeing the photos, the observer is not the typical images of artists, interpreters or executors on the scene.
These "too the road" people are "artists who can transmit passion, tristeness, joy when they are on the scene ... and capture the public.
In order to cover the personality of these grands, it is not necessary to take them back in the scene,
Because their personality and characters are internal.
What I interested was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to catch with the photographic machine the personality of the large of the flamenco."
With the passion for the "Cant des Les Minas", Bauer started a long way to return to songs, chitarists or ballines by using a photographic machine.
They are retraced that, due to the type of machine and material, they remember the classic photo.
The application of various styleistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, conferring to the modernity, according to an idea that reflects the concept of Bauer's own flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day."
Not the baller, the song or the sound in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, is able to conquer the public with its art.
The search for a meeting with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of hearing and being, are and were the continuing of this work, in exposure in these days at the gallery El Fotomata.
Famosi artists of the flamenco such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente friends, among others, are in this selection of about seventy-treated artists.
The project has become a species of anhology of the flamenco, and will soon be published in a book which will collect the retreats exposed to the display.
The passion for retreats has brought Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "SportART Project Retracts" (SportART Project).
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photograph accepts "I love to take people, know them and can think for a moment in their life, this is a long or short moment.
I think the retraction is the most difficult one in the photo.
You meet or compare people, persons that sometimes don't know or give you just a few minutes to cut the photo.
Besides these circumstances, like a photograph, I always try to make my ideas."
The collection of retreats of the contemporary flamenco, titled "Flamenco-people" is allocated at the gallery El Photomata, on the 20th way of the Mata, parallela to the way Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa reveals that the Roman that she writes is a "azardo"
It is environmental in places that have not yet known and treated unknown arguments: Despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is taking with a new project to which he works, a Roman whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who lived over 20 years in Congo and has crossed the Amazonian.
Since you are always favorable to the Nobel Prize for Letteration, the writer has confessed last night at Hay Festival of Segovia, that the project that you are employing today is "is a slaughter" and that "all indicates that I should not write it."
"If I had a good sense, I would not write it, but I will do it equally and I hope to end it as soon as long," he concluded his intervention to the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days had seen to pass through the city of Akchedotto a hundred writers, historical, journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The city and the dogs" was, like pronotic, the figure of spy to the third edition of the word festival.
Vargas Llosa, who wins the Hay Festival's premium to be the most voted writer of the participants – an ancient edition of the "Our mutual friend" book of Dickens, filled the places of the theatre Juan Bravo.
The writer, presented by Félix Romeo, was found before a public who was shooted the time when the Peruvian, with a great memory of humorism, has revoked as a nak in him the literary vocation, resulting in the "excellent adventure" of the "speaking of reading" and "to live beyond what I lived"; as written in "mode disciplined" to provide the "manging of inspiration", with a intense documentation work, ration and continued reconstruction; such as Faulkner, Victor and Alexandr Dumas have influenced his vocation and "the image of the memory".
The Spanish-American Romanist, recognized that "no way" is to measure and know whether the books can change the life of people, "but I refused to believe that literature is a pure intriguing, an effective experience," emphasized Vargas Llosa, supporting that, on the other hand, "hat the effects" and that "returns the most anti-conformist people." Therefore, he invited the writers to "no stop to competitive" and to "submit the responsibility" of their own vocation.
The time hinders the Festival of Pozoblanco, privacy of the courses
The celebration of the flights that would have to suggest the days of Pozoblanco Festival was suspended last morning, after the selected tours for the routes were checked that the conditions of the plateland were not appropriate.
Therefore, the company, in accordance with Ferdin Bohorquez, Paul Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the course celebration.
The income came against this Festival by preventing two days to celebrate on three.
Saturday, the rain has prevented the follow-up of the second round of tors.
In the cartle were Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, which would have had to face a torch of Castilblanco.
Thus, the Festival had regularly carried out only Tuesday.
In this occasion, Daniel Luke was trionfare, cutting three ears and brought out in trionfo, after having turned out with sweet and aesthetic.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talvannte has finished his two routes by rescuing health and one ears, more than the public about the race itself.
The worst among all was The Juli, passing from the area of Los Llanos without glory and without punishment.
With the second tower, after a tremendous mule, the fishes of the public were winned.
A tank with two miles of hahish pools over the blocking place in Alava
Five less than ten in the morning.
The agents swallow up to the two busy buriers of a truck, instead of stopping, they're going to escape.
The agents shocked the top to the two busy buriers of a truck instead of stopping the escape.
Their load, more than two tons of hahish, is a good reason not to stop.
The agents after they have followed, they can arrest one of the two employees, a 28-year-old man identified as A.A.J., as reported in the report of the Department of Internal Government.
The arrested person is accused of drug traffic and falseization of public documents.
The incident occurred when some of Alava’s road officials were conducting a control of the transport on N-1, in the point where it crossed the common circle of Armaniñon.
They arrived to stop a truck for the inspection when the driver, infringing the commands, accelerated brushly and overlooked the blocking place.
The agents have data on the control until the vehicle, after a couple of kilometers, stopped on the road border and their two employees have been data to escape in a forest area.
The agents of the Emerzaintza have thus succeeded to arrest one of the flights and to defeat the 2.178 kilograms of hashish that carried and took the truck once inspected, an Iveco Daily.
The hashish pants, which were located in the back of the vehicle, were then taken under the police custody for a deep investigation and the detection of the weight.
Furthermore, since the officials acknowledged that the matrix was "duplicated" because it did not correspond to that reported in the documentation of the truck, the arrest was also imprisoned by the crime of falsification of public documents.
Ertzaintza continues to investigate to arrest the second suspected person, which has been able to run as he said, and to determine the origin of deceased drugs.
Detention A. A. J., 28 years old, was conducted to the police station to carry out the appropriate procedures and to be available to the judge within the following hours.
Stop the actor Heather Locklear for guidance under the effect of medicines
The actor Heather Locklear, the Amanda of the popular series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) to lead to the effect of medicines.
A Witness saw it performing risks while trying to get out of the parking in Montecito, as revealed in the magazine People from a californian road door.
The testimon showed that around 16.30 the Locklear was shooting the accelator, making very laugh, and trying to take the car out of the parking with brush hands front and back. When backmarked, he passed again in front of his sun eyes."
Shortly later, the Witness, who first seen, apparently had not recognized the actor, saw that the Locklear was stopped in a close road and was out of the vehicle.
It was the person to strike the emergency services, because "he was worried about the Locklear's life."
When the police patch arrived, he found the actor sit inside his vehicle, which locked the road partly.
"That seemed confused," and because of this, the agents led him to a specialist centre for drug use and alcohol to submit it to a test.
According to a police portion, the actor has been cooperative and the hypothesis of the alcohol outcome has been cut off until the beginning, even if "seeks as observed by the officers at a time, we believe that the Locklear was under the effect of some pharmaceutical."
The Locklear was arrested with the suspicion of guidance under the effect of some substances not better specified and was sent to the local prison around 19.00, to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was re-established by a specialist clinic in Arizona after being recovered after an anxiety and depression episode.
Appeals to the Danish Federation of the UU to take its responsibility in the case of Silva
The General Coordinator of the Izquererda Unida Party, Gaspar Llamazares, confirmed today that he will take a decision on the case of the former juvenile assistant to the Youth and Sport of the Community of Siviglia, Francisco Manuel Silva, which has signed the demissions last week following the accused of customerism.
"In these cases, they are particularly federalist, and it will be the Danish organization to take their own responsibility," Mr. Llamazares said in terms of the resolution that the party will have to adopt with respect to what has been until today in the Siberian Council.
However, the UI leader stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations on irregularities that Silva would have done. "The UI has always wanted that this kind of investigation we have the maximum transparency."
Similarly, it stressed that training is regulated by "extreme ethical codes for all public loads".
"Sangre of May," the epic shock of Garci
Inspirating the National Episodios of Benito Pérez Galdoos, Jose Luis Garci reprotes in Sangre de May the famous revolte of Spanish people against French, in which it is the most ambitious film of his film, with almost 15 million euros of budget.
With this film, the register tried to "exhibit the personality torrent and at the same time the social analysis" which has always admired in the work of the famous Romanize, explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevar would be headed by a wide box of interpretations.
Sangre of May, over two hours and half, debuts this Friday in film sales, to become a television ministries over four hours on TeleMadrid.
A great admirant of the letter of Galdoos, Jose Luis Garci is to have performed with this round "a dream of his childhood", and he believes to be grateful for Esperanza Aguirre, who had been commissioned by the Community of Madrid three years before turning a commotive film for the second century of May. The register accepted a covenant that the history of the National Episodes.
The 15 million budgets allocated to the Community of Madrid have represented for Garci a "single opportunities" to re-establish the scenographs and costs to take up a "a stored Spain that has disappointed the choice of the leadership to fight and the fact that the fight for independence brought the people a huge delay in the development under the Kingdom of Ferdinand VII".
However, the register has not received financing compared to those of Alatrists or The Fans of Goya - more than double than Sangre de May, so it was not possible to turn some scenes provided by the scenario that he himself had signed together in Horacio Valcarcel, co-operator of almost all his carriage.
This, for the registry of Volver to start, has influenced the practice of its habitual work, the scene table with the actors, with which often uses to try to turn together to those who do not part of the cast, because it is considered it "especially", considers that "Part of the work of the registry resides in the theatre and the film to know what is happening in the field in which it works".
Many of the interpreters, part of which they are in the Sangre box of May, try to face their car, such as Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Candidate at Oscar for four times - winning one - Garci believes no of the three candidate films to represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academia - its Sangre de Mayo, you are French bill tables and, the last chosen Cyclos -, does not represent the youngest generation of Spanish film "what should be known instead".
From this movie, Garci does not wait for prize.
"After you think you're working for posters, then you realize that works only for prosperity, and at a certain point you're going to simply turn a film in more than 30 years," explains Garci after more than 30 years of carriage.
Isabel Bayon recognises the sivil existence of the Balleria Tortola Valencia
A sivilian ballet makes an opposition to another Siviglia's same ballet.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, the catalano father (Firenze Tortola Ferer) and the andalusa mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), born in the neighborhood of Triana, and three years old, she was transferred with the family to London.
It was a free dance ballet and a specialist in Eastern Dance.
He conducted a lovely life and was a pioneer of the women’s emancipation, the calibrary of Isaac Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was buddhist and vegetarian, and defended the cause for the abolition of the corse that prevented women to move freely.
The life of this woman, who signed a revolution in the field of dance and ethics in Europe between the two wars, has always been engaged in Isabel Bayon.
"I would like to work with Pepa Gamboa and you propose this personality. I'll be incredible."
Support the ballet: "We do not want to tell his whole life, but collect the spirit.
The titles of his dance suggested me some basic elements of the flamenco.
So, "the dance of the mariposa" suggested me a giant, or "the dance of the serp."
His dance was sensitive, and it was said to me that my way to ball into this stage," explains.
The scene table provides two exceptional contributions: the Miguel Poveda, who will sing again Isabel in one of his shows, as faced in "Open the door"; and the Master Matilde Coral, who was exceptionally wanting to work with the one who was his allieve.
"Matilde interprets Tortola from adults, the personality of maturity.
I am happy because you agreed to work in my work and I feel very honourable."
The audition also includes the musical and citarist composition such as Jesus Torres and Peace Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, Puga and Moi di Morón; the concussions of El Pajaro, as well as the violation of Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of a actor, Juanfran Juárez "what interprets the role of eternal accompanying these artists who have been in all the way, and who have always had many spasmants."
In the work, it is also present in some ways the lives of this woman, which is located in distant places, especially for that era, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then the whole Europe, because it was normally living in London.
"I wanted to remember it, because I think it is one of the women who had a huge influence in a certain history period and now no one remembers it and no one considers her operation as something of value," supports the Bayon.
The spectacle will start today at 20:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega theatre.
With the publication of the "Journal of a newly married poet" the Triennium is also closed
The presentation of the first edition of the "Journal of a Poeta Reciencated" at the Church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Joan Ramon Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, includes the activities of the Assistant to the Judge of Anndalusia to celebrate the "Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" (2006-2008), organized to celebrate the fifty-year anniversary of the assignment of the Nobel Prize for literature and the death of both sides.
Thus, the "Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" concluded with the redistribution of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum, and with the enthusiast "Joan Ramón Jiménez: the light shooter," which was inaugurated last May and which, after touching the various provinces of Andalusia, will be expected to arrive in New York in conjunction with the International Congress.
Furthermore, the Assistant to the Cultural of the Board of Andalusia acquired a total of eighth hundred copies of the "Journal of a Poeta Reciencated", in the care of Peter Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the ealles of higher value.
America likes a little less without Paul Newman
Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of these."
The phrase is of the actor Sally Field, which I will lay with him in "Ausance of Maliciousness" and gives the idea of the imposition of the American movie, and from the whole America, in front of the uncomfortable idea that Newman has gone.
But he was very costing to give him a Oscar.
And since 2007 it was in pension.
And he knew that she was very sick.
Despite this, it was a very hard shock for everyone.
"Atime that a test goes beyond any expression, and I have now lost a great friend," said Robert Redford, "my life and my country have been better thanks to their existence."
Nobody was afraid of being ridicule or exagered.
He died a father of cinema and patriarch in a specially dark moment, for the fear of terrorists and markets, with the self-stimate of the American people to land, the desperate research of new motivations to feel dignity.
When the times are so difficult, the men so without virtue and remain a lot of people to admire, you don't need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he incarnated the ideal platform of beauty and truth.
He was an official opposer of Richard Nixon and defenseer of lost and twenty-five causes, the foundation for combating drugs created in honor of the dead first gender of overdose to the creation of the march of marriage and biological food.
Everyone gives a country that is costly going beyond a suicide food culture.
The shift was over Hollywood, without cure, nationality or passport.
The last James Bond, the English English Daniel Craig, observed that he wasn't killed a man, has been finished at a time.
Another English, Sam Mendes, registered with Oscar, said that working with Newman was nothing less than the appointment of his career.
The bad boy arrived from Australia, Russell Crowe, was shocked to define Paul Newman's greatest inspiration.
"He left a high-level example for all of us," observed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who are trying to live today as Paul Newman did: keeping high consideration the need of correction and having a serious and far away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in the mediatic junk of today.
However, some tried us, and Paul Newman is a good example for them.
He divorced once but remained married for fifty years with Joanne Woodward, where he remained faithful, even though he was not surely missing the opportunity to not be it.
"Why I'm going to eat out of the hamburger today, if I have a whiskey at home?" Sold to smile.
In the heavens it is the pride that his daughters are also his amateures, which is not so common in America.
"In all the great roles that he interpreted, no one was so proud of the man who was devoted, lovely father, grandfathers sweet and filantropy,," they say.
The imperfect course of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that before or later the Olympics will stay in Madrid and, after the trial failed for 2012, this may happen in 2016.
But I ask you, are we ready?
If we follow the example of the course of yesterday, say no!
They called it the "perfect course," but I think it's been the worst thing you have assisted.
A lot of stupidity, which if afterwards had been taken into consideration for the evaluation and I had to examine it, the answer would be absolutely negative.
But let's go to order and start from the beginning.
The shocks started with the dorsale retreat, which suggested that they were going first.
It wasn't a wrong idea, but if you're forced to go, that's to remove everything (i.e. the chip to avoid the codes during the guest).
Instead not.
You had to go only to take the dorsale (only crazy, go only for this) and (more the relative chat), surprise! they had only shocks of 'S' (second stupidity, because I need a XL table).
In what world we live?
Is it a crisis if they have decided to purchase only small tissue, made with smaller tissue and therefore less costly?
However, things of this kind are inevitations in comparison with the same day of the course.
Besides going very quickly to take the chip, the waiting chain was 15 minutes and for more, you had to deposit the sweet.
The waiting is over 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a course to which more than 11.000 people are expected.
So, as was predictable, the course began that we had not yet deposited the sand, although, once the company was successful, the recovery also was worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the expectation of over 40 minutes, to which trials were added to popular rebellion and assaulted at the stand.
At least 500 people tomorrow, we will certainly have the pulmonary, and some, like me, will not even result in the correct order, because of the chip that I think I will not register the arrival correctly.
In the future, if they will ask me about the perfect course, this will not be sure in my thoughts.
So I think we will continue to dream a well- prepared olimpica city.
Microsoft Search Recipientist (virtual)
At the MIT conference on emergency technologies, Microsoft first presented a new system of human image recognition and interaction, a kind of artificial intellectual, but without a lot of intellectuality, in order to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a tax (or, in the case illustrated by Microsoft, a shipping service to move inside the company camp) by assisting the phone user.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of forms and volts, this "receptionist" is able to know how many people are in a room, who are - even remembering their position in the company - and listening to and understanding the key words in a conversation with them.
It can also group the present groups in conversation groups.
In the video for example, the receiptist presents a third person, but it understands that it does not belong to the group with whom he is talking and that it is not a company employer.
She asks if it's there to make someone visit and tells her that it's going to be in short.
All without blue screen.
That's unexpected.
However, this is, of course, the future.
Now the company has better focus on which it is, for example, on the next version of its Windows operational system.
This week has been very talking about a Microsoft strategic change.
Windows 7 will be reader and you will not have many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that, if the computers were equipped with the essential and less loaded business spacing functions, they would be five times faster – yes! Steve, it will be "the less".
All a discovery, if you consider that Microsoft, after version has continued to add to Windows functionality and "extra".
The direction change is appreciable.
Microsoft has the right: the operational system is always more important, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome on the network, I was one of those who supported the theory that was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Many correctly stress that a browser is not an operational system.
The operational system will always be necessary because it is an essential element to ensure the communications software.
Complete the same function of your wife or husband when you have something to say to your husband.
That's true.
He will never miss, but it may be necessary to think about the "more" of the operational system, not as a absolute, but relative truth.
What Balmer said this week confirms this idea.
People always give less attention to the operational system, and more to the web browser.
You're taking the computer only to launch Explorer or Firefox - or Chrome – and daily we pass more time by navigating online than in a remote window environment.
What is the half of the applications of the operational system?
It's less than more.
And Windows 7 must be less, very less than Vista.
Mining, less overwhelming, less complex.
Microsoft is interested in integrating its online services so that they form a valid alternative in Google.
They have a desperate need, indeed, and report here a small example.
I cut the photo in this post into one of the recreation places for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of this month.
On the bibting machine, a card calls them to use your search tool - "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study came to the conclusion that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to carry out a network research.
Last week, from the rest, the delay was confirmed in the development of the new Windows Mobile version 7.
It will not be put on the market in the first months of 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if not in 2010.
Microsoft will surely try to join Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The cell phone, after all, is increasingly become a computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the market, is criminal.
The Fabuleux Marcel
Paul Picasso took her to the Coast Azzurra, Leonardo de Caprio slows in 'Diainer of blood' of Edward Zwick, as well as Al Pacino in the 'Padrino' of Francis Ford Coppola, and in addition to the typical uniform of the muscular gay paroque.
And if we try to list the star appearances, we can recall the image of the forzote with the shocked baths that took the weights in the ambulant circo.
This is, in substance, the typical slept by man, with the inside of cotton, cut down and without hands.
It's the 'tank', as they call it the anglophones, even though, the Belgian Fabuleux Marcel split over all.
The "Marcel" is excellently compared to the other for the high quality of the coton, for its unix cut, for its distinctive voice and for the small Belgian band (as recognisable), which the most emblematic models of the ball lead as details on the ball.
The "Marcel" is excellently compared to the other for the high quality of the coton, for its unix cut, for its distinctive voice and for the small Belgian band (as recognisable), which the most emblematic band models lead as details on the ball.
And warning, because the production of this Belgium does not refer only to the famous "tank".
They also purchase balls for college, boxer back, boxer cards, cotton pants, marine snakes, baby-dolls, mini short...
Intimately thought of being comfortable.
And it's a sin to use them as an intimate whiteer.
I'm too nice.
"I want to be a young mother, the candidate don't worry."
The great similarity with her sister did not prevent you from developing your personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
Today, the sisters of Cruz have taken very seriously their new activity in the field of mode.
For Monica, I'm much more than beautiful girls and festivals that give their own name.
It was in Paris for the promotion that the sign Mango made from his new place, in addition to the presentation of the most important prices than the Spanish mode house sponsorized.
Calm and tired, you get fast.
Tell us you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that we thought of my sister Penelope and I for the Sunday Winter season of Mango, and also to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner to the Opera in the Honour of Valentino.
We say, a very intense day, but at the same time, emotive.
From what elements part of your new collection for Mango in this fourth work season for Spanish house?
Yeah, my sister, and I like the movie of the 50's 60s, we've got several inspirations from here.
Then, I like to lose me in the city and see how women clothes, how they combine and mix their clothes. I often do it.
Ballerina, actor and styleist, you're a very gentleman, right?
I believe, even if at the end, everything is confused and there are many elements in common.
To me, at the end of my little, they liked the clothes; I wanted to go to my grandfather's house to feed in the armies of my tea and to see his habits.
It was a bomb, even to go to the game park.
Then, once ballerina, I always took much attention to the clothes.
You know that the ballets like to have your own style to go to lessons and wisdom, to look at the eye and feel good.
And in the role of the actor, when you give the lookoba to you, it's the time you really meet the personality.
So, everything goes together, yes, with very respect for the styles and professionals.
Not long ago, you've been 30 years ago, you're in a crisis?
But no.
I never heard better, I like the 30-year-old idea.
I find that women are mature and they have a good experience to get the life that makes less wrong.
Biological clock does not scare me.
I did the things I wanted to be small and this gave me a lot of internal happiness.
So, you think you're getting a mother, right?
Of course, I know I'll be Mom because I ask my own body and I want to be a young mother, that's not me to lose it.
As regards the candidate, I'm not worried too much.
What I will do will give great happiness to my son and educe it with a lot of love.
With regard to the film, you are waiting for sketching in the various sales some films rounded last year.
I'm so, and I've got a lot of wants they're scattering.
As a woman coming from the theatre, I'm very inquired and worried, I'd like soon and clearly, but it can't always be so.
I want to spend "The last hour" and "Search for Christ's Tube."
Let's see if you'll like
A few days ago, you've been cut on a passenger with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say so.
It's not that I'm going to pass like a model.
Similarly, Naomi Campbell, who I know for a long time, called me to invite me to go to London to participate in a shilling of benefit for his organization "Dones for a better world" and the habitats that we have provided – I brought two parts of our collection for Mango - have been put to the stage to collect funds for this Naomi NGO.
People don't know this sweet side of Naomi.
They say so much about her, that I know her for a long time, I can confirm you that I'm not so true.
In addition, I find this good part in which you're involved.
She asked me to smile for a noble case, but if he asked me to do the snake, I would have done it equally.
If it's to help women in the third world, you can't get back.
Recipient alcohol drivers must install the "alcolock"
The Ministry of Internals requires that drivers with three administrative sanctions for excessive alcohol rates in blood install in their car the system that prevents the drive of the vehicle in a blending state or if it is not suffered in the device.
The measures have been announced last June and are already included in the annual report of the State General Prosecutor, which will be a pilot project for a year's period.
The purpose of this project is the reintegration of the driver, since this will be to attend a re-agency course on the road.
This initiative, along with the Strategy Security Research, will participate in the Directorate-General of Traffico (DGT) and the Institute of Technology for Automobile Safety (FITSA).
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of the automobilists reported more than one time for ebbrity driving back to driving the car.
The alcohol lock would prevent it, because it is a vehicle connected that measures the alcohol rate in the inspired air and prevents the car if the driver does not suffice, or when a higher alcohol concentration is detected than that permitted.
The cost is more than EUR 1000 and would be charged by the sanctionate.
In this regard, a study carried out in the United States in 2007 showed that the furniture vehicles of such devices allow to reduce up to 65% of the offences committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it can save 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: bringing them fresh to these behaviors before they become criminal offences.
And to facilitate the development, since the legal reform can be done in a ordinary way, and, without doubt, the necessary reform for the criminal procedure would require organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, although it has already been introduced in a experimental way in some industrial and public vehicles.
Tomorrow, the Congress of Members will vote to a PSOE initiative in which this system is proposed to be installed in school bus, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without "peep-toes"
At 17.40 p.m., the Spanish aircraft in which the Asturia’s principles traveled at the presidential hagar at the Bento Juárez City Airport in Mexico.
The sun was walking, but the rays still forced to use the hand as a visor to see the real couple out of the air.
At the footsteps of the shop, the Spanish Ambassador and the other authorities.
Sometimes I had asked a taxiist for the road if he knew that the Spanish principles were to visit the city to formalize a official journey.
Oh, very good, so you can't go to the airport to load people at that time... you're out of here or...
No, no, sir, you're Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, very good...
However, the Mexican print knows who are the principles of the Asturies and the importance of the travel.
Many who are waiting for the shooting of the airport shooted on the red shooting and the military coron of 27 marine soldiers offering honour.
The principle appears to be riding, clothed in sea blue, and she, the princess, shine to the wind, very sweet, does not use its usual "peep-toes," may have told him that the city of Mexico threatened bad time.
Regret the photos a smile and a short shock before you pass into the room where the official committee is waiting for them.
Pressing the door of the hotel where they live, one of the four largest in the city, waiting for a spiritual reporter of the Mexican television.
The best prize offered by mode
Probably there is no place in the world the most suitable to present a modest prize, which is not Paris and probably no more disquisite and good living styleist in Valentino.
Mango just presented the second edition of El Boton-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote the international promotion of new talents in the mode.
Provision of a price of EUR 300,000.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, watched his designs in Mango's vetrine at the 54th of Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cryed from the emotion.
In addition, it is the second largest negotiation in Europe and was just opened with 1.335 square square meters of extension.
The first is in London.
The many events, joined with the desire to enjoy the Valentino styleist who presided the concours' jury, had started with a lunch dinner at the Operator Garnier of Paris.
With the nearest squisite tele from Chagal, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango, it was even more spectacular.
Nati, with the underlying heart and doing the right needs, because of the last death of the brother, he put a custom of the House and some supplements of ELAH to remove the fiat and the arm of the son Luis - a boy of almost two meters of height - has accompanied Valentino to the presidency of the home dinner.
Andik, the owner and Mr. Mango, did the house honor and the horseman who has been finished, together with the Barone Rotchil, without jacket, because they both had left them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who has managed the shop in pantalons and shops – drawn out of your hand – has transformed for the dinner, inducing a very sensible black habit and excited during the night journey with Goya Toledo inside the work, when they showed us the room for bathrooms and she, remembering other times, took up a bar and stood a "great more".
Ines Sastre has not stopped passing in the palace places, but he had shown us the photos of his son on the cell.
The next day we welcomed the presence of Olivier Martinez – another boyfriend who moved in a motor - and John Travolta, who had arrived to the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his lenzule, his swimmingmans and was assured in advance, that we had not been sweet in his room.
The place under the sterned sky of Paris.
Oh there, it's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There is no 1,000 but 1,000 and a way to forget the caotic and frenetic life daily.
And as if it wasn't enough, they're all gathered in a book that will bring relax in books on September 30.
The wave is almost a punishment when he swims every morning at 7:00, but it is even worse to imagine in the frenetic rythm of modern life.
The office is called tension and the computer's bad snack.
Strength is the evil of the twenty-first century.
However, there is no one and even two methods to fight daily exacerbating and the difficulty to disfellowship from the world of work.
No, this number has nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Besides Yoga positions, classic massage or "spa" treatments, Susannah Marriott collects on the pages of his book, all the "menu" of options on measure for pleasant and time.
The anti-stress work is titled "1001 ways to relaxe" and its calm will reach books thanks to the editor Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to conquer peace in ambitions such as the worker or in personal relationships, this "manual" means such a conviction.
Furthermore, it suggests alternative solutions, such as being contacted with nature, or 100% natural receipts that contribute to relax.
If adrenaline does not already fall in your ventricles to find the body balance and stress has become a problem, it is the time to sit on the divine, spend the mind and focus on reading.
Speak in Sound
Some children speak during the night.
I'm not talking to those who wake up very shocked to tell us something happened to them on the previous day, but to those children who speak to remain sleeping.
The first time it happens, the maximum is a fear, but in fact it is not very important.
This is a good change of the dream defined somniloquie.
It appears with a certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Of course, most of you have told you that you had spoken in the sleep.
This phenomenon can be very sparified (one time in life, for example associated with a high febre episode) or with a greater regularity (day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child does not remember anything.
There is no single reason that can explain this phenomenon.
Sometimes there are episodes associated with other sound disorders such as incubines, night fears, night-to-bed skins, or soundambulism, but not necessarily so.
As previously indicated, it can be associated with high feb stages, with stress situations or overwhelming situations.
In any case, it's a little bit studied phenomenon.
Also the intensity with which it appears is extremely variable.
It may happen that the person speaks with a very quiet voice tonna, with sweet words, almost in a suspicious or that happens the contrary (urla, cry, long talking ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, the child would be able to observe and, where appropriate, consult a specialist to check whether there is any issue that generates an anonymous state of anxiety as a shock to the situation.
We have said that this is a good alternation, therefore, does not exist treatments except if it is not associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (e.g., if it is accompanied with insomnious or stress situation).
However, what can be done is taking into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to extraordinaryly excited the child before you go to bed.
Propose peaceful games and avoid television programs or series that cause fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children to whom it is fatigue to relax, you can use relaxing techniques to help them get a certain internal calm.
This will allow the child to sleep more quietly.
Once the dreams appear to try to keep calm.
Remember that I'm innocent for the child and that the day afterward you will not remember anything about what happened.
Used advisory advice
Don't wake up.
It's not useless because it is not aware of what's going on, and you'll stop the sleep.
Although she's talking, she's sleeping and then she's relaxing.
Remember that if you look very angry and episodes have a certain frequency, you should be better consulting a doctor or checking out where such a great concern in your child.
If you understand what you say (that is not the most common situation), do not fall in the attempt to make a questionnaire to get information.
You won't get anything, because it's sleeping, and so it's not conscious to organize his thinking.
In addition, you are able to hear what you're saying but not to see what you're dreaming to say, so you need to take much attention to the interpretation of the information and the conclusions that they could bring.
You never tell the child you could ask him for questions during the night to know his secrets.
I don't know.
A thing like that causes a huge anxiety.
Soon, don't worry, it's nothing serious, it's an episode that takes just a few minutes.

Illhaeusern finally found the road of the winner in house after a long-term infruction period.
Without a formable game, the Giallo-neri have created the largest number of network opportunities by transforming them one in the winning of the game.
The ritm was not very supported during this meeting in which the attackers were expressed to factic.
After a first attempt from the hosting team Kauffmann who tried the seven with a loose shot, the Illhaeusern began to have the best and one after the other caused the defense of the maritime, Funterflick from the remote, then high Hirn, Romein of point and Debold.
The shamemary answered with a lock in the center, left only the Riahi shocked in a shock point.
The beginning of the second time was decisive with two initial occasions signed Riahi and Temporale for the Wednesday, and immediately after the first network of Marais for the Illhaeusern, well positioned, reprened a ball resisted to a first trial of Debold (53').
But the Illhaeusern can't take his happiness long and will be expulsed a twenty-minute after that leaveing his team team companies in numerical lowerness.
But the shamemary will not be able to use it and will not bring great problems to the Illhaeusern's Empires, just identified to "reforze" the defense, except in the last minutes of play when, after a rocky action, the ball was shocking through.
Sarkozy meets fishermen in collera
Before you leave to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will kill in Britain.
In front of the demonstration of fishermen who have cruelly prevented access to various bretton and standard ports, the President of the Republic decided to take place on Tuesday morning at the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère Department, to encounter the representatives.
These lasts have promised to accept it "with constructive spirit" and hope that they are present with concrete proposals.
A presidency visit that will take place in the same time with the General Assembly of the "Crise Committee", created by the Bretton Fishermen to take steps towards the explanation of the oil price, which has reached its record with a average of EUR 1.14 per litro.
According to Eliseo David Martinon's call, the President will discuss with them about the possible solutions to help enterprises to reacquire competitiveness and to make sure the working conditions and the repayment of the marine."
Fishermen wait Nicolas Sarkozy to shut up.
Tuesday morning, they conducted "lumaca operations" in Morbian and Calvados, causing nearly 10 km of angry.
Also, Quiberon's port was blocked, but the links with the Belle Island have not been interrupted.
On the Quiberon Penis, a road block has been implemented.
On Monday, the marine have already proved their determination burning from the alba, pneumatics and palettes in front of fuel deposits at the ports of Brest and Lorient, while taking feet of manifestations in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement was extended to the ports of the Atlantic coast and the Manica, such as Sables d'Olonne, in Vendée, where fishers remained on the moon, or in Havre, where a twenty-five boats prevented the movement of trade ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and the Crossic, at the Atlantic Loira, have interrupted the block of the total rail note of Donges at night.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer, they have decided to wait for the meeting that will be held to the Ministry to decide any action.
In Guilvinec, the "Crise Committee" will, indeed, decide on the future action of the movement and evental participation in the meeting planned to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Brazilian fishermen do not want to be represented by the members of the National Fisheries Committee who did not support the movement.
"It will continue out," because "the fishermen will not cease" and "do not intend to move to Paris," announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, Chairman of the Fisheries Committee of Lorient.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay for gas oil, currently pay about 50 cents per litro, but estimate that the income limit of a packaging will be reached only with a gas oil less than EUR 0.30 per litro.

Demoralized at the beginning, Wall Street is depressed after the unexpected refusal of the bank salvation plan, thought to restore stability to the market.
With 228 votes against the plan and 205 votes, representatives rejected the financing requested by the Minister of Teacher Henry Paulson.
About two Republicns on three have rejected the plan.
"It's a negative signal sent to the market, which sees the Congress incapable to adopt a plan", said Lindsey Piegza, FTN Financial.
"All this reports how the project market was counted," he added, fearing that in some days it could be "for a few days" to take one.
"If the project was effectively living (...) then the witness would soon be passed to the Fed – Federal Reserve- (the American Central Bank, ndr) and other central banks to solve the crisis, which would be further limited to credit conditions", warned Brian Bethune, responsible for the financial and economic sector at the Global Insight.
And considering the state of emergency,” every day that leads to the crown of a financial institution” in the United States stressed the Piegza.
After the fall of Washington Mutual on Thursday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia's banking activity by the Rival City Group.

Obama in advantage of the first double TV
After the first debate on Thursday between the two candidates at the White House, it was a second to know who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Without any surprise, the general districts of the Republic and Democratic campaign have declared the respective victory of the television duel, followed by a third of the American families.
Politologist David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although meriting, was not enough brilliant to enable him to swallow the cast in five weeks by the presidency.
The Gallup Institute, which has a sabbath public opinion surveyed five points in Obama (49% against 44% for McCain), shows that the democratics had the best.
An instant survey conducted by CbsNews on a sample of indecisive electors, found that 39% of them believed Obama the winner, while 25% point on McCain.
A great performance by his companion of the Joe Biden list, expected during the first and unique debate with the Barrier Sarah Palin, should confirm the benefit of Obama.
"It would be a mistake.
But Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The scenery McCain has never stopped promoteing its insufficient experience in the field of external policy, underlineing the "intelligence" of the adverse regarding the arguments faced during the first face.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that." He often declared many recurrences.
"I don't believe that Senator Obama has the experience and skills necessary to be chaired," said.
This is a continuous chain for the Republican television campaign since yesterday.
Obama, from his song, emphasized how his choice would represent a new future.
Without extending, it has proved concise and precise.
It has promoted its pre-determination for the right decisions and the intention of restore the image of the United States on the world scene.
"McCain has never understood, on the other hand of Obama," he reiterated this weekend, a democratic spot, reproving the Republic of having not taken the necessary measures to face the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the new minutes of debate, John McCain had much to say about me, but nothing about you, he declared obama yesterday, before 20 000 people gathered in North Carolina, under a battle rain, for an electional meeting.
He has not even expressed the words "mediate" or "workers". The financial crisis is in favour of Obama, considered by the Americans as the most suitable person to save the economy on the top of the precipitation.
"The next week could represent a decisive execution," he considered, yesterday, the influenced democratic senator Charles Schumer.
The Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton Administration, compared the Obama's economic institution to that demonstrated by Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidate, the current crowd "is the final green after eight years of slow economic policy adopted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reaffirming the intention of reduced taxes for 95% of the Americans, despite the suspects of Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois also mentioned among its priorities the achievement of an eventual energy independence from the country through the promotion of renewable energy and the use of a health insurance system.
McCain would build a park of 45 nuclear centres by 2030.
The two candidates slaughtered the questions focused on the financial saving plan of $770 billion (470 billion), adopted last night the Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "Have you noticed that there were elections?"
Youth and opposites showed Sunday night in the main place of the Belarus capital in order to react in advance the results of the legislatives.
Some hundreds of Belarus gathered Sunday night after the closure of the election seats in the Central Beach of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent character of legislation.
While the results were still waiting, many young people came to demonstrate the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictor, divisions".
Some condemn that they have not even voted: "Where are they going to do what they will, from my vote?", says a boy.
They do not believe that this scheme that has made a great figure of foreign observers in order to re-elect in dialogue with the European Union is ready to undertake a democratic democracy.
The sanctions, including the prohibition of visa for 40 Bielorusian leaders and the congelation of goods, could be removed if these elections were considered legitimate by the observers.
It wasn't, according to the opposition.
"We have been displaced by the election committees and our observers have not been able to participate in the votes." he regretted Youri Potemkine, portal of the Union of Democratic Forces, a eterogeneous alliance of twelve parties.
"It is a change in face, stressed by Alexandre Milinkievitch, former candidate of the opposition to the presidents of 2006 and the head of the pro-European movement, because the important one is who accounts for the cards and in this case is the executive.
If Members of the opposition come to Parliament, it is because they have been appointed and not elected.
But their income in Parliament can include a television space, regional meetings and law proposals."
The opposition therefore has the duty to enter into the political game because "I must start the dialogue with the European Union.
Because if our economy, which is debtly debt to Russia, comes into crisis, and we do not provide any reform, we can become a Russian protector.
Now we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that ‘the security and cooperation organization in Europe, which has followed the election process, recognizes the validity of the scrutin.
It underlines that the participation rates seem too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26% of the voters in Minsk) gave the way to every type of manipulation.
"Have you noticed that there were elections? Do you ask the social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released this year in August?
There was no one at the election seats.
And there will be a maximum of five Members of the opposition to the Parliament, the most convenient to the power."
The night silence falls on October's place.
In television, President Loukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Committee are welcomed by their success.
The meeting - Blood is safe again
Hema-Québec celebrated yesterday the tenth anniversary of his foundation, and his President, Dr. FrancineDekary, had all the reasons for rejoicing, because Hema-Québec has become one of the most safe and effective blood providers in the world.
And especially, it has recovered public trust, seriously affected by the scandale of the infected blood in the 1980s to 1990s.
As we know, national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Cross Transfusion Service have been infected by the virus of the acquired immunodeficiency (HIV) and the C hepatitis.
In front of such a drama and the protests of the population, the Government of Canada conducted a public investigation in February 1994, directed by the Judge Horace Crever, which aimed at lighting about the circumstances they brought to such a tragedy and to disseminate recommendations to prevent the reproportion of a similar disaster.
While the judge Krever late to style a report, some provinces have set up a committee with the aim of designing a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was carried out by the Gelineau Committee.
Following the Gelineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Hema-Québec to provide the Quebec and the Canadian Society of Blood (Canada Society of Blood) for all other provinces and two territories.
In 1998, when Hema-Québec started to its activities, only 38% of the people declared that they still had confidence in the donations system in Quebec, remembers Dr. Decary.
The situation was deadly.
Thanks to the continuing efforts to improve the safety of blood prejudicies and the research on the field during the following years, we recovered the public's trust, explains pride that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the Québec population had now confidence in the Hema-Québec.
However, Dr. Decary is convinced that "the trust is something extremely fragile".
By the end of its creation, on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec applied the precaution principle.
At the time, he was attended in Europe in many cases of the human diversity of the mucca pazza, a new manifestation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob's morbe, reports colleagues that it was the presidency since 1998, the year of the foundation.
"And we didn't know absolutely if that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
It is therefore based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gelinau reports that when there are doubts and may be a serious disease, in this case the morbe of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, which is demonstrated with a degeneration of the brain that is inevitable to die, they take measures of exclusion.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had passed over a month in the United Kingdom was rejected since 1980.
Now, a few years ago, it has been demonstrated that this disease is being transmitted through infected blood.
This episode has so shown us that he had a sense to apply the principle of precaution."
In 1999 a more efficient technique for HIV identification was appeared on the market: the tests of the nuclear acid (TAN) which allow to recognize the presence of the virus in the donors directly in the blood of the virus and not the antibodies against the same, which were based on tests that had been used until then.
TANs have allowed to reduce the window period, namely from the time when the person has contracted the disease to which the first viruss can be identified in blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
The period could be reduced to a less than one week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and could not be identified so that it is significantly reduced.
These improvements have perceived significantly the risk of combating AIDS with blood transfusion.
Today, a person on 12 million runs the risk of receiving infected blood from HIV virus.
"In other words, this means that it will be necessary to distribute 12 million blood samples before someone is infected by HIV virus.
As Hema-Québec distributes each year between 4000,000 and 500 000 blood samples, we will want more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmitted with transfusion.
I think today you can feel quiet in receiving or prescribe blood transfusion to recover health, says the Hema-Québec head.
" Our challenge for the next decade is to keep our products security.
You never know how pathogen will emerge in the system.
After a year ago on the Island of the Reunion, the Chikungunya virus, which, as the Western Nilo virus, is transmitted to the blood of an insect.
It must be constantly monitored," continues Dr. Decary before emphasising that in addition to safe resources, Hema-Québec must also provide sufficient supply.
"The needs are increased because the old population is.
In the case of the more aggressive cancer treatment, patients often need a use of red globules or plasma.
The ageing of the population also has the consequences of the number of donors which in average are only 3% of the people of Québec acceptable as donors."
All healthy people who have been under 18 years and responding to the admissibility criteria, however, may give the blood every 56 days, or six times per year.
In the meantime, 14% of those offered as donor are not accepted, because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and they have traveled to a country where this last is public, they will be rejected for a period equal to a year.
"With this 3% we can keep an inventary ability to respond to the hospital needs.
The pension cases are very rare.
But it must be renewed by the members of this group of donors, which they are old and can't do donations anymore.
Now it is difficult to convince people to give the blood, but especially to keep them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Life is so frenetic today that it is difficult to give the blood a hour,” says Francine Decary.
With a annual budget of 297 million dollars, Hema-Québec does not only distribute blood samples, but also human tissue, including osses, ocular heart valves and skins that are used almost exclusively for serious uses.
These tissue are analyzed, transformed and frozen before being deposited at the Hema-Québec, which is the only public bank of Ombelical coron blood in Quebec.
In the ombelical coron, which once was considered a biomedical cut, a rich blood of staminal cells that may serve to cure serious diseases, such as leucemia.
"We've been celebrated, a few weeks ago, the bank input of our millennium blood sample, and we predict that you're releasing more than thousand each year.
The Dr. Decary, who describes this practice of coronary blood prelive, must be used for the beginning of the next year.
"Thank of Mothers are sorry that you can't have access," because Hema-Québec has no means to offer this complex and cost-building program in all Québec hospitals.
Calcio - The Impact in Semifinal
The Montreal Impact has been qualified for the semi-final of the eliminators of the A series, winning 3-1 against the Sounders of Seattle, yesterday, during a second decisive game of the final quarters, at the Sapulto Stadium.
The Central Campingist Antonio Ribeiro has signed the decisive goal to 90'.
After a first time without goal both sides, David Testo and Rocco Placentino have signed the following networks for the Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to mark Matt Jordan.
Remember that at the first game of the back-to-return, the Impact had soon a 2-1 challenge at Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in Seattle's periferia.
The Impact will face Vancouver's whitecaps in semi-final.
Saturday night in Minnesota, Thundler took a first 3-1 back game, wining 4-3, but the Whitecaps will even participate in the semi-final.
The Impact will have to face the Whitecaps on Thursday and Sunday, but more details will be confirmed in day.
In short - Decisive network of Kovalev
Canadian and its ass are ready to recover the season.
The three-format of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn have animated the offensive game phase by winning 3-2 against the Panthers, Florida, last night at the Central Bell.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first meeting, marked a goal, made two passengers, and he collected a victory passenger, in the room of the Hab's preparing games.
The only network signed by Kovalev for the victory was decided.
"I'm not still ready, she warned Russia.
I need another game to hear me in my action."
"He tried to blame in the first period, noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the outcome of the game.
There was a beautiful ovation."
Search point to the North
The first Minister does not exclude the start of elections before the end of the year.
I concluded the Advisory General of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest in Jean-Talon, in Quebec where the new Minister of Health, Yves Boldu, (left), tried to be elected at the time of today's partial elections.
"Applicate the borders of our last large northern border": this is the long-term ambition of Jean Charest, presented yesterday in Levis, by means of a strong visitive impact, at the meeting of the General Council of the Quebec Liberal Party.
After him, during his speech, the projection of a kind of "Milling to Images".
On three mass schemes, there were negative spectaculars of hydroelectric diges, mineral cultures, Quebec images saw with "Google Maps", cartines, etc.
Great means as in full election campaign.
During the printing conference, the first minister refused to exclude the start of Sunday elections, even though he noted that it was very compromised.
The "North Plan" is the fourth point of a "project" which the first minister says to have for the Quebec, the of a 'new economic space', which includes a first agreement with France on the handwork, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with the Ontario.
In the recent discussions of the First Minister, the opening of the northern territories to the 49th parallelo has never been subject to a presentation.
However, the first minister was limited to explain why the North would be "a joy of the great potential", but has not been expressed in terms of time or investment rate, as it has not explained how to be the precise priorities in the implementation of future projects.
It has been the most limited to notify what is priority: hydroelectricity, forests, but especially the mining sector, which, due to the growth of the emergent countries and the restructuring of the public infrastructure, has experienced different improvements.
In accordance with the styled list of Charest, the North contains "nichel, zinc, rame, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titan, and even diamonds".
The 'great territory of France' is here, it is Quebec.
It is not just here, but it's in us," he insisted, as he wants to encourage a national founder.
The foundations of Quebec are raised in their relationship with the North and highlighted: the gold feb in Abitibi, the national engineering, the Baia of James.
"On us, it's our future," he added, after a theatre break to see the card's card on his shoes.
The North, 70% of the Québec territory, including a part of the Labrador who has always revended, has specified the first minister during the print conference.
"It's a traditionally maintained by all governments.
There is a border line on which no agreement has been held for a long time, and when the opportunity is presented, I will restore the position in the name of the government,” said.
In other words, I think the climate changes must be evaluated in the North," he said about the Northwest Pass, which will be open for the whole year because of the dilution of yellows.
In this new geopolitical context, the first minister estimates that the territory is a duty.’
And the people of the place, the First Nations and the Inuits?
The first Minister stated that the Quebec government would show its attention to this matter and that the project would meet their interests, especially those of the young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Peter Corbeil and Michel Leturneau (ex-Deputy of the PQ of Ungava), have already given the way to consult a thirty community.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Trasports and Natural Rises) has taken an important load, has started work.
The first minister does not exclude a great meeting", not necessarily a summit, but a moment in which "common visions" will be provided."
Northern development would have the rest to sustainable development principles.
The North Plan will be concerted, ordered and respect the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuum with that of the first liberal ministers that have before it.
"Come the liberalians who have before us, we know we distinguish to transform the challenges into new times of growth and development."
This was one of the recurring topics of the weekend, which started Thursday with a great cocktail in honour of the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions proposed to restore the Central Beauharnois in Diga Adelard-Godbout.
"De Godbout, Creator of Hydro-Québec, in Reading that nationalized hydroelectricity, in Bourssa, the Creator of Baia James, our party has always learned to strengthen the future", stated Jean Charest.
During the print conference, it is recovered to another reference, conservator this time, the "Strip to the North" program of John Diefenbaker, first minister from 1957 to 1963.
In response to the project on the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric degree, Charest precisely stated that its task would be planned for 2012.
"All this remains among us, but I feel that we do it," admitted his warriors, raising applause.
In fact, the first minister, which said in April, would not have been electoral in 2008 and probably even in 2009, has not missed the possibility of starting a vote in autumn, which could happen in accordance with the law.
It underlines to be very compromised, particularly in a mission of the Federal Council in China and in the Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council on the end of the week has provided to the Liberal Chief a platform of nationalist resolutions, in particular the "constitutional aspirations" which have been read as oil: the PLQ calls for the recognition of the "quebec specificity" in the Constitution.
It is also hoped that the Québec names the members of the Council on radiodiffusion and Canadian telecommunications and that they have a right to visa on decisions taken in Quebec.
With regard to the opposition, the abuse of the North Piano has been accepted in a scettic way.
The leader of the PQ, Pauline Marois, has grown the North Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry Government in 2001.
You believe the Liberal Government, reached in 2003, would not respect the application.
If it was done," we would be progressed today" commented Marois next to the candidate of the Jean-Talon (excluding today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ stated to support the adoption of the North Plan by the Government.
"What we hope is that all this is not simply understood as a spectacle," commented the leader Sebasten Proulx, replaced by Mario Dumont, in the way of the holidays today.
Letter - A Unnowed Land
It was Vic Toews, former Minister of "Giusty" of Harper's office, to allow himself to declare the past summer that Louise Arbor was a "truck" for Canada.
In this way, a woman who struggled inconsistently for justice and who merge all our admiration tells it very much about the endurance of the Prime Minister, as well as on the same Stephen Harper.
This is in front of a government that is the only, among all Western countries involved, to have not repatriated his citizen in the concentration field of Guantanamo.
A government that does not take account of the fact that Omar Khadr was a simple adolescent at the time of the facts of his infringement.
The only government that, despite the signing of the Geneva Convention, rejects his own word and leaves a slow child in human conditions.
The only one that trusts in a parod of justice to establish the guilty of the accused.
We recall, on information, that UNICEF, International Amnesty and the Order of Canadian lawyers, in particular, can be sent to Omar Khadrafnich's repatriation to a regular process in Canada.
It is just the same government that closes the eyes of torture: it is very little that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, maybe forever, after many years of suspicion.
It is not yet understood, but we are assisting an incredibly erosion of our rights, freedom and "democracy", saying that Harper does not stop assaulting and sounding so unsensed on his lab.
Here we arrived at the moment when there is no more morality: it can be distracted, tortured, arbitrarily imprisoned by a Canadian citizen according to the discretion of a government leader until today of minority (to see what it will be after October 14...).
Many electors believe that a party that preaches Virtune, the Respect of the Law and the Order represents the salvation: they do not see that this government has rejected the reputation and dignity of our country.
It's just here, Mr. Toews, in the decline of all this, and there's no other way.
Free opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian talk
In the edition of 17 September, Le Dever published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President of the Canadian Mineral Company Barrick Gold.
Following a orwellian logical, this last says that the world's largest aurifer company has sported a chair for dismissing six million people against three authors and a small quadrined editor house with the intention of starting a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that the judges are independent and imparcial, it is not the truth that they judge, above all in the case of a chair for dismissing, but the law.
Without any surprise, this substantial difference is completely hidden by Garver.
Because for the Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would lead to the ruin whoeverever is to support its opposite position.
Unlike the outcome of the process, writers and editors of the Black Canada book, there will be a cospicous amount of money to organize their defence and fight, with a weapons decisively learned against a lawyer arm financed by the taxes, without the fund of the mining company.
On the other hand, in these fights to learn weapons, the tactic is often to destroy the agreement in order to establish a consensual regulation which implies the opposition instead of fearing anybody who is talking again about the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was in front of the public view that would have to present its vision of facts.
On the contrary to what happens in many countries where Barrick Gold works, the debates are in Canada in accordance with the exchange of opinions and not on food.
The company would therefore be sufficient to open its books, its documents, and to establish a real and self-debat, through newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent researchers, which would be able to make light on the matter.
But Barrick Gold doesn't seem to have too much confidence in the public view and rejects the requests and letters for support of the Canadian authors.
Maybe Garver could explain how to ask a public "debat" when his disrespect for the same public is clear?
In the world of the Vice-President, this word appears only to be the lawyers who are fully paid and not the whole of the Canadians; this is a vision which is very limited of the concept.
In a democratic system, even denigrators have the right to speak.
What Barrack Gold does not understand – or does not want to understand – is that the public who supports the authors and editors of Canada Nero does it first because he rejects the brutal means adopted by the mining company.
This public is ready to listen to the Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civil exchanges of opinion, and not in the optic of what many see as a kind of invasion (researching the "public debate", the Barrick Gold just gave to the authors of Canada Nero a lasttum intimidating them to sustain the use of that word...)
Besides the surreal discours of Garver, the chair of the Barrack Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the persecution of the truth, which is essential in every democratic society.
It rejects the right to quote of authentic sources and the debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the same basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is not possible to study and discuss the disadvantaged arguments to the richest companies in the world, many of them are able to do so, who can?
If Barrick Gold really wants a public and transparent debate, it could follow the scientific standards as the authors of the Black Canada.
He has the right to replicate.
For a long time, the university environment, which we make, is able to manage debates and disputes and to solve conflicts.
The overwhelming measures of the Barrick Gold clearly show that, in contrast with its claims, it does not find a transparent debate.
This goes away from the university world, as it deems the same public debate in Canada, and it is now that governments take measures to be able to restrict abuse desires.
Operation - Saving for Wall Street – Dialogo between Republicans and Democratics
Bush Administration and the leaders of the Congress, representatives of the Republic and Democratic slaughter, have finally come to an agreement on the largest rescue-financing plan after the Great Depression of the 30s.
The new version of the plan from 700 billion American dollars, which aims to bring a fren to the financial crisis which has been recorded for months on Wall Street, must still be ratified by the two rooms of the Congress.
It provides in particular: checking on its effective action by the election leaders, new mechanisms that guarantee the reimbursement of public money, new provisions to contain the number of cases covered for lack of payments, as well as an inspection right to pay payment to the leaders of protected enterprises.
The American Secretariat to Tesoro, Henry Paulson, President of the Chamber of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi and the Republic of Representatives at the table of the treaty, Senator Judd Gregg, have announced the good news a few minutes after the half night, last night, at the end of a deal of two days of a treaty martyr.
"We have made great progress towards an effective market agreement," said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
"All decisions have been taken in a way to protect the economy and the American people from the current crisis in Wall Street," explained the democratic.
"It's the crucial point: if we didn't act in this way, inevitably we would be flown on the daily life of the Americans," stated the Republic of Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the treaties was marked by concerns about the impact of a new failure on investors.
The limited time was corresponding to the opening of the market, this morning.
After the Treaties, the two candidates to the American Presidency were very favorable to the agreement, but not to avoid expressing their fault in front of the adoption of extreme solutions.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama will have added some provisions to the Agreement, in particular those which will enable owners to maintain their homes and the inherent payments for business leaders covered by the State.
"When the participants are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the inresponsiveness of others, there is nothing to rejoice.
But these measures are necessary," commented on the American TV screen.
Interviewed on another channel to know whether he will vote for the plan, his republical adversary, John McCain, answered: "I want to analyze the details, but I hope so."
"When I read, it's something that we all have to divide and that will allow us to go forward."
The option of a non-intervention is simply unacceptable," said.
The plan of 700 billions aims at re-acquire the money of the contributors of suspicious credits, the risk-based and inconvenible assets of the American financial institutions.
The plan arrives after 14 months of crisis due to the outcome of a real estate bottle which first led to the slope of hypothetical risk credits (mutu) and then extends to other more broader forms of credit titles (PCA) and to slow down liquidity and banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of delegates in charge to send the first project of an agreement last week to the air.
It seems to be out of that blind row since the democrats have accepted that the "toxic" active of certain difficulty companies will only be protected by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to meet everyone, at the Congress, there was a provision that, if the government had to face losses during the five years of coming towards this programme, it could imply new taxes to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides the payment of a first sum of 250 billion to which more than 100 billion if the President is required.
The payment of 350 billion should be ratified by a further vote of the Congress.
Instead of their aid, Washington will receive shares of participation in protected enterprises that will acquire the dividents in case of profit and which will be able to retain when waters are calmed.
In accordance with the plan, the federal government will have the opportunity to delay the reimbursement procedures relating to real estate loans and to establish limits to reimbursement and indentity paid to the leaders of the undertakings involved.
From today's plan architects would like to submit it to the vote of the Chamber of Representatives, and to the vote of the Senate Mercedes.
Despite all the efforts, it is still not sure that you will be given free to their plan.
In fact, there have been several votes against the project, both at the republic and democratic shift.
"Of course, Washington does not feel you", said the Republican Scott Garrett, members of the Camera Financial Committee, turned to his electors.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yeah, there are solutions.
But not sure to use contributions..
Leader of a small group to the Congress above-mentioned "the Skeets of Scientists", the Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presents the situation in different ways, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Catty hundred important teachers of economics, including three Nobel Premi, have written us to say: We ask the Congress not to take any adverse conclusions and to examine the way to take care of it," said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, there was again a test of the world's crisis nature.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11,2 billion euros (16,3 billion dollars).
The intervention of the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas informed that it would have dismissed the purchase of its competitor in full failure after the loss of EUR 2 billion (2.9 billion) for the crisis of real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis has 85 000 employees and is part of the twenty larger banks in Europe and ten larger insurers.
"It's not the money lost, he declared the Dutch Minister of Finance, Wouter Boss yesterday.
Instead, the influence and vote rights are recovered in bank matters.
It's certainly something that the spareers and the families appreciate now that the time is announced incertain."
During this period, on the other side of the Manic, the British Government seems to be able to nationalize another bank for the financial crisis.
According to the English print, the government would be loaded from the whole of the current loans at the Bradford bank and Bringley bank, which is more than 41 billion (75.5 billion dollars) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander has noticed yesterday you will buy the succursale and customer accounts of the British bank.
From the beginning of the economic crisis, Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to undertake a nationalization process by the English government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Dead of an Engaged Icon
The beauty of the blue eyes was his axis in the manic, for others his weak point.
Was he freed from the Narcistic show, the American actor from the smile?
Yeah, and no.
His discretion, sensitivity and evident talent would be cut off from that circle of powerful ones dedicated to true and sacred monsters.
But what a costume!
Paul Newman, the disappeared Thursday, at 83 years of age, in his ranch of the Connecticut, after a pulmonary cancer, remains one of the last icons of the American cinema for the years.
Minor monumental Brando, which was similar and which was long a variety of rivals on the screen, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also he also ported the freedom and development of dramatic convictions.
From mixed couples often born magic children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, from the German Jewish father and the mother of Hungary origin.
From these European roots, one of the glorious visions of the American dream will be born.
A humble ego, last quality mark.
Because in him the whole country was recognized by the safe man, the fighter of the Pacific war, was fierce in the battle, which at the beginning of the 50s, studied dramatic art in Yale, and then frequently the New York Studio Actor, before he triumphed at the theater, in television and early in the film.
The same warrior man for civil rights was also the car pilot that classified according to the 24 hours of Mans in 1979, as well as sex symbol, although part of a model couple since 1958 with the artist Joanne Woodward.
If it goes with him the shadow zones of a reserved, discreet, compromised, allergic stars to the show-business scandals, which will never be able to shoot the mystery.
A honest man, in the most noble sense of term.
This weekend, Paul Newman's disappearance was a shock in the heart for the films, while his big characters populate the black memory screen.
Another half century of American movie in full transformation is reproposed through its interpretations.
The fascinating cow-boy of Butch Cassidy (1969) and that boy is incapable to want the focosa wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in the kitchen on the cheat that was adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More recently, we remember Mr. Bridge's sensitive pieces of Mr. Bridge (1990), torbated by a marriage that didn't keep the promises.
So many other Paul Newman's passing to the story.
The boxer Rocky Graziano, criminally murdered, violent and intimable in Lassù someone loves me, Robert Wise, a role to be used for James Dean, and recovered after his death, which officially launched Newman in 1956.
That wicked sympathy in the excellent Stangata, Oscar as the best film in 1973.
The color of Martin Scorsese's money, which is valuable to him in 1987 is the only Oscar on 9 nominations.
That face over the years was his.
He's still.
The epochs happen through his way.
The young people are especially known for the Slap Shot-Colope film of George Roy Hill (1977), in the role of Reggie Dunlop, a hockey team on slightly ortodoed ice.
His fans found him in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop, the brothers of Coen.
The circle was closed with the last role of the Icelandic mafia mafia in Era my father, 2003.
Unlike the lyricest degrees of the movie that immediately abandoned the master, Newman will remain long in the salt, claiming Hollywood in its entire snare, festivals and conceptions.
Bertrand Tavernier, French cineamer, defined it, with an iron point, "a challenge living at the superplaying," and judged you exage his performance.
The professional wasn't always a game for the beautiful Paul Newman, where the roles seemed to fall as a manner from heaven.
However, he often prefered the role of the young actor: nevrotic personalities, drinked shooting or disappointed, which expressed out and rebellion with his perfect treats.
As a register, Newman revealed unknown sfumaturas of his true, pushed sensitivity.
The first time of Jennifer, in 1968 (based on the Romans of Canadian Margaret Laurence), with wife Joanne Woodward in the role of the protagonist, led a smooth lacquery of melanon.
He, who lost the son Scott for a overdose, dedicated him in 1984 the Harry and Son film, discreet and triste film.
Among the countless shocks last night on Newman, his great friend and old arms friend Robert Redford (he had recited together in the Stangata and Butch Cassidy) said infinitely "Their presence took my life and this best country."
Generosity and life love, two great features of the disappeared actor.
Besides a legend carriage, there is so a great warrior for civil rights, ecology, independent movie, an Hollywoodian derivative.
We will be surprised to smell your face on oil bottles, salts, biscuits and other foods, judgeing it a bad choice, even though born as a game.
However, the income of these sales were intended to the Foundation for the Child in difficulty.
Newman, instead of adjusting himself to his mito, chose to join himself until the end.
He left his five daughters a letter he said" Always and until the end, your father was incredibly recognising his good star.
It was a prize."
And this was the privilege for us to follow the path of a so clean and generous American artist.
Citizens of the model, therefore, and much more.
What has been produced in the manufacture of Zuccio & partners?
On the other hand, on 8 October, it will be discussed the hearing of the criminal proceedings against Yanos Zuppo and others.
Political man and its members are accused of reiterated trade fraud in the framework of a crime association that has caused significant damage, and other crimes, including false documentation.
According to the Search for the money obtained by concourse bands, they have been used for private purposes, and have often certified the effectiveness of the activities through false fatture.
The State and municipal money, in total 65 million flowers, has been finished in part in the cases of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, in part in the taste of some people.
According to the method, which was known by the demanding authorities, they took the money obtained by concursion bands based on non-existent instruments, and associations have never comply with the obligations undertaken.
According to the accused act, most of the factures were false.
To make it, the fat blocks have been purchased at the Yozsefvaros market, and the circular tanks were manufactured instead in Kiskunhalas.
And to decide on the names of which you say to emit the fattures, it was established between the guiza between the collines above the Balaton where Yanos Zuccio had sent Isvan Lados.
According to the condemnation of this last, he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
It has asked for consumers, on the model of these, the facts to be prepared for concursion bands, among others, to those of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Budapest Common.
Most of these are operating in Istvan Lados and András śri which, according to our information, has, in particular, addressed the reports necessary to obtain funding.
One of the choices of Lados' study journey was a bird.
According to two factors issued by Zuschlag and partners in 2003, the restaurant location has been able to have a group of 90 people in the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
But so many people, as the restaurant says, would not all go together.
Similarly, the facturation issued in the summer 2002 to the Jobb Jövśért Foundation, later called Együtt in Harmadik Evezredert, a shuttle of formal and content errors.
A Badacsonytomas pension has only three rooms, but more than 10 people couldn't even even even, but in the fatture there were 130 guests.
But the compilators of small fantasy factors were exagered when they marked the Pigal Kft., and this also is a restaurant, in which accountability - according to the information issued to the judicial authorities - had not even recorded documents on behalf of the companies Jobb Jövśért and Hopaá.
Gyśzś Farkas, company administrator, declared the hvg.hu that when it was called in search and showed the factures, he immediately understood that it was false documents.
"If I fear the name and the Iva game of our company were in a wrong point."
He added: Besides formal reasons he did not even return to the fact that, according to the fact that hundreds of people were accommodated, when there are totally eight rooms and there are no so many bedrooms.
The fatture was restaurant, and their restaurant isn't in function for time.
Fat compilers supported not to inform themselves that the Budapest’s travel agency from their choice, organizing only travels to the outside, so shockly indicated on the facture with payment in travel accounts in Hungary, which did not agree with the company's performance practice.
Furthermore, as has been shown during the investigation, the fact that Iva was also presented, while the travel activities to countries outside the European Union are exempt of Iva.
Among otherwise, the amount of Iva was wrong with the four documents issued by the Hotel Revfullöp Kft. in favour of the Jobb Jövśért Foundation, in fact on services offered by the company, Iva must apply to 15% and not to 25% as indicated on the facts, as well as the hotel employees evacuated only printed facts, while the manufactured factor was written in hand.
In addition, the "employers" have destroyed other facts, in the case of this, as a activities carried out by the goods transport on the road, as it is known by the search procedure, activities that were not implemented by the company originally for investment advice.
Furthermore, for formal defects - causes of non-compliance fatture, false fear - was found that the fattures emitted for Egypt in Harmadik Evezredert Alapítvány, XXI. Századi Culturalis Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false.
The same occurred in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Sport Camp of Kunfeherto, whose representatives refused to have issued the factures in question.
The falsificators did not even give attention to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Nyrigayháza was in liquidation when (2001) prayed you a Fiatal Varosert Egyesület group, so that the curator of the liquidation of this, according to our information, refused to have issued it.
They have employed fattures consecutively
Another group of fatture emittents is composed of those who were aware of having to deduce fixed fattures.
The Eély Budapestért Alapítvány foundation has issued a facture on request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták for the Együtt Foundation to Harmadik Evezredert of almost 4 million flowers.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the employees, according to the accused act, convinced the Director of Collab Kft. to emit fattures.
He cooperated together with Zuppo and also with the Biogate Kft currently in liquidation, which in 2003 provided fattures for a value of approximately 5 million flowers from the Jobb Jövśért Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület association and the Vörêsfenyś Egyesület association, behind which there was no real economic activity.
Even money moved because the prepared factures were then stolen, but the associations forgot to show this appearance in their documents.
The following group of delegating factures belongs to those who are linked to the employees.
For example, Ivan Kubatov, authorized to the backup of the Director-General of Delta Trio Kft, with a location in Budapest but not reperable there, which is in the business of fuel and vehicles.
This has issued various factors in October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer means, for a value of approximately 18 million flowers.
According to the data of the investigation, the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas purchased these factures since 14 September 2005.
The Director-General of this report was a Romania between 2002 and 2005 Ivan Kubatov would enter the documents relating to this.
As we know Kubatov, during the investigation, has recognized that he has released facts in behalf of the company to the Atlasz, Hopaá and Egypt in Harmadik Evezredert Alapítvay, and the contra-value was brought by him.
On his express request from Ivan Kubatov Roman wallers have found the Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
Nevertheless, there was no one of the debts that were operative, because they had received no job according to the employee.
However, the companies returned to him because, on request of the Co-advocate Z Solt Szente, the drafter of the Foundation Documents, on behalf of the debtors, were delivered facts to associations related to Zuuh: at Atlasz and Y-Generation.
On behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov has issued 15 factories for a total of 14.2 million flowers.
The search believes that Kubatov has undertaken 10% of the amounts indicated on factories, as well as Iva.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to emit fixed fattures, manufactured for the concours band of Biztos Pont.
Y-Generation and Sövetség in Modern Magyarországenrt in January 2006 presented a gang for the Socialist Party's public use entity, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They also win 500,000 flowers of head but the sums have not been used for the purposes indicated in the band.
As soon as this wasn't coming to gallery, they presented the TMA five fixed fattures received by Works Team Kft.
These factors were found during the search for the office of Arpád Kemecsei at the Ministry of Public Education.
A part of the employees, as they have already been looking for, will probably refer to the evolution of the production of the factories.
The most interesting thing could be if the employee number one, Yanos Zuschlag, would decide to spend the speed over all.
His condemnation has not been very detailed, and even if you have promised more times to talk about everything in an extensive manner, it has not yet done it.
If it is in their interest, it may also be that socialists have taken agreements with Zusi, which - instead of resurrection of 50 million flowers, most of the damage - would be willing to make the spontaneous cap.
Zuschlag could also be violated by the fact that his requests to defend his conditions of prison, namely the concession of home arrests, were not found until the time.
While the authors of non-reparable trade crimes and causers are much larger damages may be freely passed or at least waiting at their own home to the end of the procedure against them, what is not granted to him.
Psycology of spend in excess: Why are you going to expend more money?
The purchasers are intended to expend more, exceed the goods.
Neurological and economic researchers at the University of New York have been able to discover the neuro-economic bases of this well-known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to their study appeared on the Journal of Science, men do not want to stay back in a guest like eBay store, so they are also available to pay a higher price.
The research tried to trace the nervous scheme of this "partite" at the level of the nervous system through experimental axis.
A group of volunteers played at the lote, the other group of players participated in a stage while with functional magnetic resonance method (fMRI) have examined the active areas of the brain of people participating in the experiment.
In both games the participants could win money, but in the stage game, where the substantial element is to join more than the other, the body stretched under the brain cut in a intense function when they lose the game.
This brain area, in addition to the other functions, plays a role in the "auto-gratification" mechanism of the nervous system.
So, according to researchers, the price rise is explained by scanning the veelement reaction of the stretched body.
To support their theory, economicists of the research group have conducted a financial investigation of financial follow-up.
In this survey, three groups have participated against a partner in various conditions.
The supervisory group reported how much the real value of the product concerned was and they made their point.
Another group more than that has promised that the winning case will receive another $15.
However, the third group would receive $15 prior to the stage, but the members of the group would lose money in case of loss of the steel.
The difference between the two groups consisted of the fact that for one of them the winning was highlighted, while, on the other hand, the loss was lost.
By verifying the neurologic hypothesis, the members of the group who played "to the loss" were ready to make higher points of the control group or "winning".
"This results are not deducable by any of the previously existing economic theories.
Indeed, these phenomena were to explain the riskful phenomena to the asses with joy of winning and avoiding the risk.
Only the creation methods of the neurologic image have helped to solve the contradiction between the two theories, so that we have come to a third explanation" - said Andrew Schotter, professor of the University of Economy.
Hepatitis: When do you go back to your doctor?
About a half billion people worldwide suffer chronic hepatitis B or C, in Hungary, instead, among the first causes of death are mentioned chronic hepatic diseases.
In Hungary, the number of hepatitis affects a hundred miles, of these are only 7000 treatments: the reason is that many patients do not know that they are counted.
Hepatitis definition is the collective name of contagious hepatic diseases caused by several viruses.
There are many similarities between symptoms, typicals are hepatitis and attraction, but their pathogene agents and caused diseases differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses are distributed in two major forms according to the pathogen agent: hepatitis A and E through the food channel (e. g. water and infected foods), hepatitis B, C, D and other organic viruss (sperma, vaginal losses, saliva).
For whoever travels is useful to vaccine against virus A and B, against C does not exist vaccine.
The symptoms of Hepatitis A appear two-third weeks after the consumption of infected food, accompanied by general disease, weakness, addominal pain and nausea.
After shaping skins on the skin and white of the eyes, the fats become clear and the sweet urin, the sweet smell occurs within two-third weeks.
A million people die every year throughout the world for hepatitis B, the most serious variant of disease, which causes fegate tumors and hepatic surgery.
The main reason is, according to the estimates, that only one person of ten receives pharmacological treatment.
Even hepatitis C may have very serious consequences: if not being treated, hepatic chirurgy may cause fegate tumors and tumors.
Most infections do not know that they have contracted the disease because pathogen agents are devastating the hepatic cells, in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
So it is very important to prevent and effect regular medical analysis.
This disease is much more frequent than the average in three groups: those who had blood transfusion before 1991, drugs and tatuates.
In the world today, the number of people infected by chronic hepatitis C is up to 200 million.
Because a routine laboratory also shows the disease is the penalty to return to the family doctor when any symptom of unknown origin is observed.
Recognised in time the disease is curable, the virus can be removed from the body, so stops the infective power and can be prevented from the training of tumors.
30 September is the world day of hepatitis, organized for the first time in 2004 in the world by associations of diseases.
The purpose is to call attention to the viral chronic hepatitis, the causes of its development and early recognition of disease.
Who believes in God feels less painful?
According to the result of a recent survey, the religious faith works as a species of analysis that has become more sustained by the death of the Catholic martyrs.
The scientists of the University of Oxford have performed an interesting experience, considering how the faith in God affects the feeling of pain, reported the British Telegraph.
In the field of a strange investigation, a electronicshock was performed at 12 Catholic believers and to such athletes, while everyone observed a picture that represents the virgin Mary.
Based on the results, Catholic believers were able to reject large part of pain.
Thanks to the investigative technique of human brain, it has been found that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for the control of pain.
The test is the first of a series of researchs in which, beyond the academics, also take part in scientists, philosophys and theology of the university.
The test has been exactly carried out in this way: a tool that emits loads and passs the elektroshock has been linked to the left hand of the subject of the experiment.
The researchers asked the participants to concentrate on two paintings, the virgin Maria painted in the XVII century from Sassoferrato and the Dama with the hermil of Leonardo da Vinci painting in the XV century.
The authors of the review hoped that the image of the virgin Mary originated a kind of religious state among the believers, while Leonardo's framework was chosen because he was not too different from the other and thought of it calming effects.
Experience subjects passed half hours before MRI scanner, and in this time's age 20 electronicshock received in four consecutive series, while observing or drawing about religious or the other.
The Catholics reported that the vision of the virgin Mary made you feel "secure", as if "no one cares" of them and "see are calmed and were pervaded from peace".
As we looked at the image on religious subjects, 12% were less painful than when they were before Leonardo's work.
The psychologue Miguel Farias, who took part in the test, believes that such a result can be achieved with any images from the strong effects also for the athies, but it is necessary to find the appropriate image.
"We need to search for a image towards whose feelings are very positive, such as a mother or father," said the psychologue.
The English Bishop Tom Wright has enjoyed the result of the research.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases you can change our personality." - he added Wright.
After the best results, the question remains only if the believers are presented the painting of a madony of Leonardo or another pitcher of such calibra, which effect could have on the control of pain?
The vision of a virgin Maria of quality would bring better results?
You know what you say about yourself.
On the day of the 10th complex Year Google can say you can find yourself both in the bags of people as well as in heaven above their tests; you know where they passed the holidays, as a ambulance often and what it interests.
However, this, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the directors of this, is not yet enough.
What is instead of the sceptics that make a comparison with the orwellian incube, they do not really see the substance of the web 2.0.
Recently Eric Schmidt declared to the Financial Times that the main purpose of Google is to collect more personal data from their users and this is necessary to meet the original goal of Google founders that was: "We're in a system all the information of the world!".
According to the Google Director interviewed this, after 10 years of revolutionary work, it is still starting to be able to manage all information.
The question what's going on for five years Schmidt answered: would he like if Google could answer questions like "What am I tomorrow?" or "What would be the suitable job for me?", but software do not know to answer questions apparently simple because they don't know enough users.
Not all internates are aware that during their Internet research are registered exactly the searching words, from which IP address are searched and on which page the interested persons are stopped after the search.
By the Personalized Search two years ago, users can memorize their navigation history, they can relate to what they searched and clicked, then these in long walk will generate results on a very better measure; on this logic it is based on recommendations that the system offers us products and services based on our previously declared and registered preferences.
What happens if my data are used against me, if they look at what I'm doing? - Do you ask the worried users of the Google data monopolie.
In most cases, the conflicts of internal persons are caused by the fear tested for the size of the potential power represented by this, and not for the sense of guilt, for the fear of punishment, for the desire of freedom or for the rebellion to power.
However, a fact is confirmed, and it is that all the claims are not only registered but that, in reasonable cases, there can also be third-party, in such legal cases, nothing defends the personal rights of internal persons.
The most clear example of this in recent times is perhaps the action coordinated against Brazil's pedofils, in which Google has introduced the Brazilian government the information that has made possible the identification of pedofils from the Google Community Orctus page.
In addition, the persons concerned on personal rights have suspicious to submit to May when this - in agreement with the Association of EFF electronic legal protection - has successfully demonstrated the truth in court against the FBI: even later, Google cannot be covered with any point of the Constitution to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(All the same time, the federal government has successfully covered nearly 500,000 web addresses and thousand research expressions received in relation to the confirmation of the child protection law approved years ago, but it has not been able to obtain the search lists of individual users and the whole list of web pages and key words referred to in two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore extremely contradicting: those who are afraid to provide their personal data are exercising Google because they believe that their neighbouring area and their private life are involved by using the services, and they were opposed to the rebellion of multinationals that are shocking for the conservatory image.
In the meantime, the geek American culture and the proliferator of appassionates, actives and computer users compared in many countries are seeing in them the future generation of great deeds, the "cool corporation" instead of their rival, the Microsoft liquided as a world conquistator for Windows, as both fight for the same purpose.
This may happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users an identity code, does not demand money for their own services, the source that has always been updated, and the program package is much more accessible, young and cool from the official practice of the software collection.
But it may also happen because geeks see exactly the problem relationship between personal rights and Internet, which involves just one of the key words that are more often repeated in the past few years, the web 2.0.
Web 2.0 does not speak only of cooperation, to leave intentionally traces behind us, and to use communication channels to our disposal and while the size of these changes for each individual is the same: show us yourself.
A young media can create profiles in more community pages, from Facebook to Xanga, can connect you to other services such as Twitter or last.fm that elections your musical guests, all of them can be inserted into systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, and can also write blogs on which its most recent photo galleries are automatically stored on Flickr or Picasa.
So we read many examples of the cases clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos cut on the morning from the common round of friends, comes easy to know with whom his perfect boy has passed the night, or one of them can license his employer because he wrote a sincere view on the company's top: one thing is sure, the concept of private life now has been completely reconsidered.
Those who live online lives are in a way to show themselves and so we can formulate the fundamental tes that are hidden behind the behaviour of young people.
Instead, who wants to hide something or only wants to avoid Google's monopolie can (e.g. starting with Screen using the Google search system but that at the same time does not leave voluntary tracks).
There are no few people who do not register about community pages for not being found, the online Google applications, the preparation of texts for image management and the collection of news, can be replaced with alternative versions not lied to large server parks and that do not compose our best profile until existing.
The public opinion is even so secretly waiting at the moment when Google will get out of the articles.
Currently the company with its $156 billion is more than IBM (140 billion), Intel (124 billion) or Coca Cola (110 billion dollars), the advertising spaces AdWords/AdSense threaten the entry of public agencys, recording services caused not only the Microsoft but also to many software developments.
However, the critical observers close to all of this find an alarm point: the company's headquarters, for example, rejected the protest of employees after doubled the sight of the company asylum, has considered too costly the resurrection to enjoy daily employees, but it slows to the fact that in 2006 Google the chief to the Chinese government and in the sense of their agreement, the results that opens the good profit and interests of the Chinese regime will filter all the results.
A internal rule of this seems to be not to publish a new service in advance but only when it will be useful, one thing is sure, that the predictable problems of the next months and years of the world will be disappointed at a point: while some believe that the project of scanning and archiving books and reviews of Google will take proportions such as that this will soon be faced by the United States Supreme Court, others have fear of the health system, in fact we can create our health profile with our references, medical and problems.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can offer good material to the next generation of fantasy writers, the historical Cory Doctorow's story describes the future with orwellians, where a man with Google data can be approached in an alarming way.
Two minors have helped the double opposite of Ozd to destroy the tracks.
The police questioned two minors about the double murder of Ozd, suspected with reason to help save the traces of the crime - announced March the portion of the Police Chesture of the Borsod region.
Young people have recognised the crime to their charges, and now they are accused of favor.
The two minors, two girls according to the information of the MIT, defend themselves freely.
The favorite is punishable until 5 years of reclusion.
The suspect of the double murder of Ozd, a 23-year-old man of the place, was put in preventive detention.
He's suspected of pre-meased pluriomide for lunch.
The investigation resulted that the youth twenty-five had a great debt with a 53-year-old man.
The suspect didn't want to spend the debt, so the last month she took his creditor with an innocent in an Ozd channel where he and the 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI's information, the young man was ready to do the crime, a signal is the fact that murdered with a hidden weapons on the place.
The police is investigating the weapon and the circumstances of the use with a expert's involvement.
The Borsa of Varsavia offered for the purchase of the Borsa di Praga
The Varsavia's values bar has offered 200 million euros, about 5 billion Czech coron, for the purchase of 100% of the list of values of Prague.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Borsa of Varsavia, confirmed the advanced offer by the Polands, although the cekes had previously excluded the Borsa of Varsavia as possible buyer of the Borsa of Praga.
The reason for exclusion is that the Borsa of Varsavia is ownership of the state.
99% of the actions are in hand to the Poland state that is intended to sell over a few months more than 60% of its titles.
The Czech financial newspaper E15 states that the offering of Polands represents the highest number up to date for the Prague Borse.
According to the Finnish Press, the Vienna Borsa, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Borsa, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Borsa and the German Borsa.
Petr Koblic, Director of the Values of Prague, declared last week that the Borsa of Varsavia would be the worst owner and did not exclude that this could bring to the end of the Prague's Borsa.
Market experts estimate the value of the Borsa di Praga in 5-10 billion coronary.
According to the agreement of shareholders, almost 90% of the holders would be sold.
The largest owner of the Borsa di Praga is the Patricia Finance with a quota of almost 25%, followed by the Bank śeská Spośitelna by 14.7% and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. by 13.5%
Economic crisis from the European Journals
The main European newspapers in their Monday's comments on the international economic crisis already speak of "a second September".
The global financial disaster has happened thanks to the President of the United States - accused of the Republic - that has not been able to comply with his party behind a fast abuse law, which is the purpose of relief to a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbour, as the super-financiar Warren Buffett stated, it would be more exactly talking about a second September.
A part of Madrid's printing is also seeing the spontaneous capro in Washington.
According to El World, the lack of American Political Guide has cut the world economy on the shopping oil.
It grows increasingly the danger of the skin of the American financial system, and it will then suffer all over the world.
Bush's plan was not perfect but due to the vote of the Congress there is the danger that Washington will not offer a political means for crisis management.
World economy is suspended in air, just when it is the most transformation of capitalism history.
It is no longer possible to release the threat - upset the Days-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today can still offer a savingship to shipping financial institutions and with the money of the contributors can save them from the failure.
But if more banks grow as in a Sunday effect then they will not be sufficient, nor the financial means or new immediate solutions.
The Member States of the European Union must overcome their national egoism and concentrate on the control of the sampled financial markets.
On the other hand, the undebolished financial institutions have obtained more than 100 billion euros - remembering the Vienna Der Standard, which seems to be more real than the European contributors, like the Americans, have to put their hands on their portable to relief the crisis.
The EU has not been very concerned about the crisis that has crossed the old continent as a tsunami.
The "salvators" should not immediately defeat the 100 billion euros, however, it would be better if they are able to play the money of the contributors to prevent larger damage.
Intelligent machine imitate the flight of the calabron
What could be the best method to develop anti-collection technologies if you do not imitate the sensors of the obstacles that are in nature?
For example, the fires.
In the surprising project presented to the CHATEC in Japan, the calabrons gave the initial strategic exhibition to the engineers Nissan how to build the next generation of anticolization systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokio, the Nissan has built the biomimetic robot BR23C, a provisioned robotic car for fire properties, with the purpose of creating a system that can scan all collisions.
Fire flights form their own oval space that really seems to our protective school - he explained the Kazuhiro Doi exposure, director of the technological sector PR and research and development.
Important is the role of the view of the ape, capable of a visual of 300 degrees in each direction.
The engineers acted with the telemetric laser idea to copy the function of the view.
The BR23C indicates the barriers to two meters of distance within a ray of 180 degrees, calculates the distance and sends a signal to the microprocessor of board that transforms it immediately into a command to avoid collision.
In a fraction of according to the robot, the barrier understands the obstacle, and then, imitating the movements of the ape, it changes the direction immediately by turning the wheels of the necessary measure to avoid the incident.
This escape manual is performed in a way different from the current system.
"If not so the robot could not react fast to avoid collisions" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Labor and Roboter Project.
It must be instant and immediately reacting because this technology corresponds to the harmful and internal street of the protective school, within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what it makes to avoid other fires.
This process must be performed in an eye battery.
But in contrast with the fires, the dependence can not go to the height or low or in diagonal, it may be only bidimensional and in the direction of stressability of the route.
Instead, instead of the unfinished opportunities to dispose of fires to scan the other fires, the robot, as a disposal possibility, can switch on himself, accelerate and slow down.
BR23C is feeded by batteries to lithium polymers, lighter and higher energy density, which means that their duration is higher than the lithium iones.
According to Andoh, it is important that intelligence of the intelligent reaction, not data development or even less the ability to imagine them.
This robot must develop some inputs in a few seconds and react.
There is no need to remember and react with intuitive logical based on previous manual data, so only uses a few decimal memory of Kb.
There is no need for a gigabyte memory or megabyte memory.
This is the first step towards the development of a technology for immediate evasion of collisions that, predicting the Nissan, within 10 years can be installed on series vehicles.
Additional application opportunities can be represented by the unification with GPS satellite navigation system that avoids the barriers present on the road leading to destination.
They also found the name to the very costly child.
The written version of the Economic Saving Legislation law was addressed by 700 billion dollars for the purchase of disproportionate credits, which should be applied in more parts.
In the first passenger, half of the sum is spent.
In the new protracted agreements until mid-day night according to the East Coast, the leaders of the Congress have decided to save $700 billion after a debate that was long-day - reported the Reuters.
We have made passes - Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the Chamber of the American Representatives, which has remained only to put the letter agreement.
Both the candidates to the Presidency, Barack Obama and John McCain, have supported the plan's compromise.
Teacher Henry Paulson, speaking about the result of the compromise, stated: the programme will work and will be effective, but there is still much to do. According to Pelosi, it is not the saving of Wall Street but the investment of the economic car.
The written version of the plan was public before the Asian market opened at 8 hours after Washington (the 2nd Monday night after the Central Europe) but has not produced a large growth in the burden.
On Monday, the Chamber of Representatives will first vote on the draft defined Economic Stabilisation Act of 2008 on the programme, after he will touch the Senate.
President George W. Bush talked Saturday night with the Pelosi, then welcomed the news of the Agreement with joy in the White House.
We are satisfied with the progress reached tonight and appreciated the efforts of the two parties to establish our financial markets and to defend the economy - said Tony Fratto porvoce of the White House.
The programme, however, differs from the original proposal for Bush administration, which prescribed that the $700 billion would be all expenditured for the purchase of holders with disproportionate credits on the floors.
Now as the first step will be possible to expend the half of the amount of $700 billion, 250 billion immediately after the vote of Monday of the Congress, with these, the Minister of Teacher will purchase accounts with disproportionate credits, the kind of the remaining $100 billion will decide the President.
A special colleague will control the programme to which also participates the President of the Federal Reserve.
The expenditure of the other half of the 700 billion depends on a new decree of the Congress.
In the sense of the Law, the Ministry of Teacher can apply a combinated tactic: it can buy credits, hypothetics and titles with hypothetics and other types of credit "upplied".
The purchase may happen through a steady and directly - have announced the ministerial competent.
The legal standard makes it possible for those concerned to take part in an insurance programme where the Ministry of Technology guarantees the means that are worried, for which companies will pay a suitable price to the probabilities of damage.
Henrz Paulson said that the law gives the necessary means that 700 billion dollars come for the urgent requirements of the American monetary system, which are the purchase of wrong financial means, or their insurance, or to avoid the risk of the crown of a large financial institution.
We will do all the steps necessary to make us ready to introduce the law just signed - has added.
The directors of the banks in crisis and at waiting for State aid think that the government will limit their goodness, defined by the slang of other oceans, just as gold paracades.
The limits of payment will only be in some cases, and the limitations depend on the way the Ministry of Technology will provide assistance.
The limitation means that if the minister will purchase in the framework of a steel, he will set up an overwhelming on the gold parachute, if they do not send the defeated bank director in pension.
At the time of the direct purchase of disproportionate credits, the Government will be agressive to ensure that the money of the directors is not exagered.
It will be added that the already existing contracts of the gold parachute will not change, but the limitation is only valid for new to encourage the participation in the programme.
This is the first case in the American history of the entry into force of legal restriction on the payment of general administrations - commented on the Democratic Barney Frank President of the Committee responsible for the Financial Services of the Representatives.
In addition to this, it has the right to approve a quota of the banks participating in the programme, reduced the risk of the contributing banks, as they can eventually win us if the economy, together with the saved bank, will turn back.
The law proposal includes that in the next five years the President must submit to the Congress a proposal which provides for the refund to the contributors the losses derived from the financial sector.
Of course, both parties have been those who have expressed their doubts about the project.
This is not what the American citizens asked us to not defend the dollar of the contributors - he declared the Republican Member of California Darrell Issa.
His democratic partner of Ohio Mary Kaptur believes that the measures have been taken by the same ones who are responsible for the Wall Street's crown.

The next year in the United States without seeing?
Kinga Göncz sees the possibility that around January 12 may enter into force the American-Ungherean American Exemption Agreement - the Minister of Foreign Affairs has spoken about this in Chicago with the Hungary representatives of the place.
According to its opinion, "hour all depends on the fact but other oceans are built in time the electronic input and control system."
However, he called attention to the fact that in the new system there will no longer be the permission of entry, but before the start, tourists will have to be registered.
The responsibilities of the Hungarian diplomacy will continue the treaties in Washington since now.
He will meet the Minister of Foreign Condoleeza Rice, whose medal of the Cross of the Order of the Republic of Hungary with the Stella and will engage with the foreign policy advisers of the Democratic candidate Barack Obama and the Republic of John McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain have also been skilled in favour of the bank saving plan
Barack Obama and John McCain, the candidates to the Presidency of the two large American Party, have guaranteed their support for the government plan of $700 billion for the saving of banks, but there are politicians who claim the demissions of the Minister of Tesor.
The representatives of the Congress and the Administration after the long-day marine treaties, Sunday night, have announced that a principle agreement on the saving plan of banks has been concluded.
The crisis of Wall Street and the financial package for frozen credit markets have become the central issue of the presidency campaign.
Obama and McCain want to show themselves more suitable than their rival to make the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the recent investigations with the first plan of the economic issues of Obama, the benefit of McCain, obtained after the Republic of Convention with the appointment to Vice-President of Sarah Palin, was dispersed.
Obama in a conversation in Detroit expressed the hope that the Congress quickly approve the law on the plan of 700 billion dollars.
He stressed that the proposal contains the protection passements of consumers that were also supported by him.
"There we have to act responsiblely (...), the danger threatens your work, your savings, all industrial sectors, the full economic stability," said in front of a population of 35,000 people.
It has not been left to define the economic ideas of McCain.
McCain in an interview to the ABC explained that "all the things we'll send down with difficulty this situation (...) but it's not doing anything is not a pathway."
The Republican Senator reported that the proposal contained the creation of a control committee of the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the good outcomes of the top manager, which was to insist.
Obama said to the CBS that McCain had no role in agreements, but he was in a daily contact with the Minister.
President Nancy Pelosi reported that the Chamber of Representatives probably will vote on the law proposal for the Monday.
Printing the world of German language
The right pool is intact, only within the pool the electors have become more conscious car - so The Spiegel analyzes the weak result of the CSU in Baviera.
The Haider party is ready to rule Austria to prevent red coalition.
The spiegel (split.de)
Frank Walter, in the online edition of the German newspaper, in the article Baviera's revolution divorces his parents, analyzes the causes of the unconfied CSU dramatics.
According to the polytolog, the CSU's erosion has been started very long before the triste couple Beckstein-Huber entered.
The social Christians have restored the Baviera for decades and now these modern citizens get away from them.
The change of the era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as well as Angela Merker.
The challenge was not a great surprise for the CSU, but the Sunday ended a process that was precisely ten years ago to be realized: the unbelievable Egyptians of a state party has been finished.
Since 10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU was 47.7%, for the first time under the thickness of 50% for the 50's.
This has been repeated three years ago in the Federal Tag elections in 2005 still in the period of the same referred to Stoiber.
This is why modernization is in the region, which divorces parents.
Sociologists have pronounced it 40 years ago, but have been very wrong in time. However, the secularization, the results of education, the establishment of Eastern and North Germans in the developed Bavarian region could not remain without consequences on the CSU's loyalty.
Modernization will be equal to the increase in the opportunities and it is obvious to the political consequences.
The right pool is intact, only within the pool the electors have become more conscious, critical, ostinates.
It is also surprising that in the past weeks the CSU has taken out of the classic bourgeois groups: the vocational freedoms, the artisans, the diplomas and the wheels.
The support to the CSU is slowly 40%.
Press (depresse.com)
The Vienna conservatory newspaper "Who with who?" in the article "The Presidents of the parties are blocked in coalition issues" is concerned about the confusion of Austrian internal political situation created following elections.
The SPOP intends to treat the EVP.
The EVP prohibits the intervention of the SPOP in its internal business.
The BZUE is open to treaty in all directions, and the green do not still want to discuss coalition.
The elections were made, now rounds all around the coalition; in the debate transmitted by the public television, the leaders of the party just saw the cards.
Warner Faymann President of SPUE confirmed that he wants to treat the EVP.
The SPUE wants to demonstrate that cooperation between the two parties, in some regions and in the social partnership already exists.
Faymann opened the question if you can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current President of the EVP, as a vice-six.
As you stated, the course Schüssel-Molterer has been in any case refusal.
The recurrence of this direction is not considered.
Molterer was carefully reacted to the red offers.
As he said, the cooperation will certainly not have been successful if Faymann tries to enter into the internal business of the EVP.
If your party chooses the opposition or income in the coalition is still an open part in the party, the matters should be discussed in any case within the EBP.
Jörg Haider's leader of BZÖ has repeated that it was open in all directions.
"To prevent red coalition, we are ready to take our responsibility to rule," said Haider.
Yaroka: I need to cut the vicintuous circle of poverty and segregation
Today, in Paris, the European Summit for Party Opportunities was started, organized this year from France to the European Union's presidency.
Livia Yauroka, Mr Fidesz of the European People's Party, in the message addressed to the plenal as the main rapporteur of the Congress, has called on the attention to the school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation of Roman children and the most serious obstacle to their statement.
Xavier Bertrand French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and the European Commissioner Vladimír Špidla responsible for employment, social affairs and equal opportunities have opened the conference at the maximum level.
Among the invitations to the conference were the governments, European social partners and representatives of the larger civilian organizations and the protection of rights within the same opportunities.
The European Parliament's Press Group, according to the office of the Fidesz PE Parliament, has reminded, in addition to discrimination in the affairs, that the Romans are cut off from the labour market in the first place because of their low schooling.
"The majority of the young Romans have a medium-level study title and, as a result of the elementary teaching of bad quality, only a irrelevant number of them can reach a higher study title."
Jaroka also stressed, as fundamental human rights, the key role of education in making human rights valuation.
Investing in the education of Roman children may mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the Member State, there is a need to be aware of these links in the most wide range between the Romans and the non-Roms.
In fact, as early as the school begins, it is more likely to become a productive member of the labour market; through income payed and consumers contribute to the budget of the country.
"The right of European Roman citizenship must ensure their right to quality education and the elimination of the schools of low-level and secret", said Livia Yaroka.
The Deputy believes that the European Union's goal and action unit is necessary to accelerate school deregulation processes, and therefore it is essential that the right respect of existing and designed anti-discriminatory directives is the right respect.
"The victory circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be interrupted, the need to give Roman children the opportunities granted by the democratic space so they can contribute as citizens fully to the future of Europe," asked Japan.
In the sign of the "European Year of Party Opportunities" to ensure for everyone, the objective of the European Summit for Party opportunities organized every year, from Berlin's meeting last year, is to ensure a single forum to promote the objectives of anti-discrimination and equal opportunities set at the state and European level.
CSU: pleasing for a transitional period
At the end of October, it will be decided on the sort of the imprisoned couple Huber-Beckstein.
Despite the bad electoral challenges, the tests have not yet fallen, but the Bavarian CSU's headquarters had been sent to the debate on personal issues at the time.
The Chairman of the Erwin Huber party and the regional governant Surither Beckstein are still on their own place, the question is until the time it ends.
From the kind of tandem that has just lost a disaster of votes from 17% will decide the extraordinary party's congress in the last week of October.
The two extremely critical politicians have known in any case that they are not attacked with all the seat forces.
They thus tried to abort the angry scribes from the parliamentary group and the base that a day after the "tsunami bavarese" have prepared the personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
5 years ago, under the guidance of Edmund Stoiber then at the culmination of his career, the Christian and Social Union receives 60.7%, but now after the assault of state against Stoiber 43.4%.
The CSU for 46 years was "a absolute monarch" in Baviera that gives 18% of the German GDP.
While they always contain conservators in the Southern region of fundamental importance for the Hungary economy, in the future they will be coalised in any way.
Whatever the first sign of the reorganization within the party, the Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, considered possible heritage of Huber, obtains a place in the restricted investigative group that will start treating with the FDP liberals and the Liberian Electors who represent the right values for an eventual government coalition in Monaco di Baviera.
For a strange shock of destination in the list of Liberian Electors, the Gabriele Pauli whose attitude against Stoiber was used as an opportunity to shoot by the couple Huber-Beckstein to then treat the woman without regarding the great ambitions.
The CSU leaders now focus on all their forces to stabilize in some way Beckstein.
The former regional governance and the former CSU President, on September 28, will also be an active role, also Stoiber, who had been in the shadow.
Lunedì Huber gave some statements to the faithful towards the CSU, as they would have been more supported by the Brother Party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the challenge as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
The Merkel cannot be cancelled after the federal tag elections set for September 2009 if the CSU that has played a decisive role in the 2005 national victory will not be resumed with common forces.
According to the Merkel, which does not hide the delusion for the fascination, the loss of the CSU will not be negatively affected by the great coalition of Berlin.
What is surely relative: it will not be easy to manage the fertility of the CSU, but the crisis of the social democratic crisis is still hard.
The SPD reached its lowest result from 1946 in Baviera by 18.6%.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
Not even a representative of the opposition has entered the Bielorrush Parliament after the Sunday elections.
According to Russian observers, it is the sign of the well-being and stability in the country guided by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Security and Cooperation Organization in Europe (OSCE) instead explained with the brochures conducted in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, who sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognized the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 million people of a country of population is free of opposition for over one decade, before the elections of last, the opposition collected under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODS) hoped that Lukashenko was seriously renewed for the fourth time after the constitutional amendment to the elections of 2006, "conceived" some sessions in Parliament to representatives of the opposition.
The ODS has thus rejected a previously evaluated boicottage.
Besides the opposition's expectations, Belarus, more economically depending on Russia, who asked a credit to reduce the import of Russian natural gas, which has agreed to give Russian gases in possession of Belarus through the country, was intended to improve the relationship with the EU where Lukashenko and other high-border politicians could not enter into the Belarus's anti-democratic situation.
It was referring to a detention that the OSCE, evaluating the election campaign, focused on positive and not on lacks, such as the prohibition to be presented for a third of the candidates of opposition.
However, the rapid Monday report of the OSCE also criticized the campaign, during which the candidates of the practical opposition could not appear on the print, and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the counting of the votes.
Despite this opposition, a improvement in the political climate is apparent: the political prisoners have been released, Minsk has also been prepared to a small comparison with Moscow by continuing rejecting the recognition of the South Ocean and Abkhazia from Georgia, even though Russia, with which Bielorrusians forms a federal state, which is considered independent to the two countries for a month.
We have made two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has started - it has declared our journal Aleksandr Milinkevich.
According to the Presidential candidate for the opposition of the 2006 elections, it is hoped that it remains, although "the power of being feared to make one opposer in a no-weight Parliament."
The opposition does not require protests for results but is prompted to bring the elections the message to the need for economic reforms.
Of course, we have a lot of problems, we need to print the newspapers of the opposition in Russia, local authorities have difficulties for distribution, but I also see that more people support the change, even among the elderly - said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that even the more officially helped goal, the pensions, is adjusted to Lukashenko's regime, which considers the main result of the creation of social security.
As a result of the decline in the country and the increase in economic deficit, it is only a question of the disaggregation of social security "he remembers secular silence" - believes Milinkevich.
On the contrary to the opposition policy, Russian observers have judged democratic elections.
Sergei Lebetev President of the Community Independent States has declared to the Russian printing Agency RIA Novosti: "Mans believe not in words but in fact", so the lack of opposition is not only the evidence of maturity of Bielorrusian electors.
Brunetta: "First breakfast before work"
It has never happened in the history of Palazzo Chigi that there were turning doors for the entry and out of the employees.
But from today it takes this new measure against the robberts, against those who fear and then will drink a coffee to the bar in worktime.
The new anti-children has been presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary-General of the Council's Presidency, Mauro Masi.
"The touring doors - says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more presence and more services," the Minister needs.
"There is a new stage of responsibility and transparency.
This is reformism," still stressed Brunetta.
With Palazzo Chigi, the installation is completed in all the palaces of the Council's presidency.
For Masi, "the choice of the rotating doors is also important from the symbolic view".
There were no resistances from employees, assured the secretariat-General: "It was a process shared by the workers and has been the cooperation of all."
Instead, nothing more breakfast in worktime; nothing more coffee and cornet.
The word of Brunetta, which suggests, smiling, "A beautiful cappuccining is a holy hand."
During a meeting at the High School of Public Administration
in Rome, the Minister then notes that "in three months, public employees have reduced 50%, i.e. 600,000 people in more than one year's work."
And add that it is necessary to make the Public Administration more effective
Italian, "the wage dynamics - the Minister explains - in the past 8-10 years have been double than the private sector and well above the inflation rates".
Thousands of public employees have joined to respond to the rules of the Brunetta Decree by adhering to the recovery supported by Codacons.
"In the Minister of Public Function today, there would be numbers of about the smallest occupationality because of disease - it writes the association of consumers - the people of the 'operating children' is continuously growing.
Thousands in Italy are in fact the employees of the correct and productive public administration who have joined themselves to declare war with the illicit standards contained in the decree."
In particular, Tar will be responded to the exclusion of additional economic treatments for malnutrition depending on service; the extension of the time facility facility of the sick worker, where control visits are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions provided by the Minister.
Labour accidents, Napolitano: "Decisive Prevention"
Every day, in Italy, there are 2,500 incidents, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently invalid.
For 2007, Inail data confirmed that white dead were about 1.200.
Numbers that witness the gravity of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost double deceases than the killers.
To call on the attention of institutions, social forces and means of information on this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates all the 58th National Day for the victims of work in the second Sunday of October.
"The worried data distributed by the Anmil and the same chronics in these days confirm as critical as the question of the prevention of work," said the President of the Republic of Napolitan, in the message sent to the President of Anmil, the Mutilated and Invalid National Association of Labour, Peter Mercandelli.
The head of the State expresses its "life appreciation for the continuing associative commitment to prevention in places of work, protection of unfortunate workers, assistance of the families of victims and awareness of public opinion".
"It has, of course, led a 'bast', sincerely divided, in front of tragedies that, for their dimension, sustain the clauses of media and the involvement of the public opinion but the daily reality reprotes dramatic cases, even repeating in their dynamics."
Napolitan does not hide that "is certainly also a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
In particular, it takes the many initiatives made in school for a more direct conscience by young people who are at the work world.
The attention to the phenomenon should be alive, not to alarm its social gravity, to apply and to improve legislative standards.
From his song, the President of the Camera Gianfranco Fini said "as the phenomenon of white dead forms a absolute social emergency, which opens the conscience of each of us and imposes all institutions a decision-making commitment to put you urgently finish."
"The data on the hard work seem to mark a slightly positive course, but this does not make it possible that the number of white dead are still impressioning", noted the President of Amil Peter Mercandelli.
"We wouldn't want to, in fact, that this "tendence to the residue" is translated in less attention, because it is right when the attention goes up that exploses the tragedy.
"We believe that at the general level there is still too little to combat the phenomenon of distress and the contrast can be exercised through many actions.
It is necessary to, at our judgment - he highlighted Mercandelli - more controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the school world."
"Serve a further effort - he added - for the communication and sensitization of the public opinion.
But, above all, there is a greater sense of responsibilities by employees against a phenomenon that represents social emergency."
Mercandelli then declared "the progressive deterioration of the indentary protection levels for the victims of the work" and the "heart assistant to which the system is spoiled in the past years".
"The goal is therefore to return to the worker the insurance guarantee - he added - because the kind of person who is unfortunate should not depend on spontaneisms or illusion once prepared by the legislator."
MP3 readers as accused, risk the hearing
Listen to high volume music for a long period of time using portable musical devices like Mp3 readers can cause permanent hearing lessons.
The European Commission is referring to the opinion of the Scientific Committee on emergency and recently identified health risks (Csserri) of the Ue, published in Brussels in a communication.
"Despite this scientific opinion - it is read in the note - it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices per week for more than one hour per day, holding high volume devices risking a permanent loss of audio capacity."
"I am worried that such a large number of young people that use frequently portable musical devices and high-speaking phones can inconsistently harm their listening," says Meglena Kuneva.
"Days scientific repercussion - continue the responsible Ue - emerges a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
Moreover, we need to acknowledge consumers and make them public domain information.
We must also review existing control systems, in the light of this scientific opinion, to ensure that they are fully effective and have the step with the new technology."
Brussels had requested the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the great use of portable musical equipment and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the laugh of them.
"The scientists - conclude the executive Ue - confirm that there is a reason for concern, and the European Commission will now examine together with the Member States and the stakeholders whose measures might be taken to better protect children and adolescents from the exhibition from portable musical equipment and fair equipment."
Today, there is already a European security standard which limits the ruling level of the portable musical equipment to 100 dB, but they are concerned about the hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to such sources.
These damages can be limited by means of solutions such as the reduction of levels and the duration of bloom exposure.
In its opinion, the Scientific Committee you presents that the portable music equipment users if they listen to high volume (more than 89 decibel) music per week over 5 hours over the current limits for the maximum authorised layer on the workplace.
Those who listen to music in these conditions for more long periods risk a permanent loss of hearing after a five-year period.
This would be 5-10% of the users of these devices and their number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the Ue.
Rome, Germany gives the Commission the future of capital
Today, in March, the sums will be taken in June.
This is the calendar set by the Championship for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capitale", which has been placed this morning in his new seat behind the Charcalla Terms.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 components of the Commission will put the guidelines for Rome.
Once the arrests closed in March, the Board and the Joint Council will evaluate analysis and projects so that the Strategic Plan for Rome will be able to submit in June with the "Official Balline" of the Campoglio and its German Union.
"The Commission is absolutely independent, and all the political, social and cultural ideas have been represented - it has to highlight German - must provide proposals for a Roma development idea that the political decision-makers, which remain the Council and the Joint Council, will then be able.
There is no supervision of roles but only the will to have a place where to develop a great project for Rome.
In March, his work will be finished and then will be discovered, because this experience must have a precise period of time.
In June, we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capitale."
The Commission of Inutility, since its opinions will not be binding, German replies: "All depends on the work that will be able to make the Commission and the quality of its proposals.
If quality will be, as well as in France with the Attali Commission, and as I am also sure in Rome, it will be essential.
Too frequently the policy is on the management of daily and emergency that are still maintained.
We, on the contrary, want to look more long and far away, in a deepest perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future."
Moreover, the church of Rome is to point out that "This Commission is not an unnecessary entity, nor a car. It is absolutely free, it will not cost an euro to the Roman citizens and will serve to raise and engage in the best intellectuals expressing the Capital".
For Germany, in fact, "It is necessary to have a strategic reference design, not closed or immobile, to allow our city to make a real level salt, which has absolutely needed, thinking with an unilateral spirit to its future."
A future that, in the Union of Rome, "not will be limited to the only current common borders but will be guarded well" not only in the optic of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of Capital but "as far as Rome can and must play as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American President.
He wrote an American political note that has to pass for an independent person: "Barck Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, with his decisions, decreed the United States economy and had reports (as he also did today by citizens) with the Islamic enemy."
They increase the attacks against Obama just while the date of the elections is near.
She wrote a lady of Miami on a web: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a great face: believes he will win the highest load of a nation that has had in all two rulers and five black senators!".
They are in fact attacks that do not say so much; they are clearly racial attacks and do not respond to the question of the elections: is it a good president? There are polls; they say all that Obama will win and with a good distance.
Even in this case, there are people who speak with the heart, but not with the brain.
A journal of Mississippi, in the south of the United States, wrote a editorial newspaper: once in the chain to vote, we know who will give his vote the American patriot.
It's out of a side of the American mentality held up until the last.
"That you want, then we'll think we're going to put the cross, if on Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama should win, we'll go away from America.
This has never been done before now, which seems almost certain of the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasons, the winning weapons for democratics is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were the errors made by Bush during his mandate? 89 percent responded: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and sent home to calcifer.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers have lost their lives and Americans have not been forced to make valges.
However, Irak for the majority was the weak point of Bush.
Who will take the place of George W will have a huge task to do.
Using, the economic trail also makes you feel about journalists: in the newspapers it is time to break. And many do the Internet fault, "assault" of the printed paper.
Fifty hundred American journalists were interviewed by PEW Research Center on the status of their professional and mental control for the future.
However, today journalists are almost all pessimists on their future.
However, newsletters have not declared openly that they feel less worried about the credibility.
They don't feel isolated as once.
The problem for American journalists is money, money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a destroyed economic model crisis.
Moreover, the keys made in the newsroom, in the room where editors work to put the newspapers together, is a great problem.
It is a problem that will be resolved, according to the interviewed journalists, if you don't want the traditional journalism as the great public intends to pursue substantially.
A clear but comprehensive pessimism is today the American journalist.
You are on ten newspapers and senior executives are convinced that daily at national level is following a wrong road.
In the local field the executive group is 65%.
Stamped against broadcast.
It's not difficult for journalists to see where the web goes.
The largest houses open a shop towards the internet, for many views like the "assault" of the printed paper.
The "economic pressure" that the journalists warned has increased up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists admitted that they break the technology in hope that "do something good" for their journalism.
The largest disaster today in the American journalism is among those who are heading newsrooms, that is, directors - and reporters who work for them.
56% of the executives at the national level are sure that their reporters share their values, while at local level the percentage increases to 23%.
For some, this has to do with the "security of the work".
Executives that think to lose jobs around 3 years are 47% at national level.
For staff reporters, you go to 30%.
The "safe work" at the staff level (in our editors, ndr) in America is always at the order of the day.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In a nation such as the Use, with 300 million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, television and Internet workers often offer what they want and become so a question of "take it or leave it", take or leave.
The directors receive almost always large payments, while the editor can also gain $10,000 per month, other than the pension and payment of insurance.
For the ferries, then, the rating is complicated: to days after the first year, to the third to reach 15 days after a number of years.
But American journalists, for their appointment, often "ammal" for the year.
It's all about climate.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL ROMA, DANILO COPPOLA RESTATE A GROTTAFERRATATION
The President of the Second Criminal Section of the Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to refuse the essence of the immobilist Danilo Coppola who had asked to move from his city, Grottaferrada, to a residence in the city of Rome.
Coppola is investigated for banking in the context of the contract survey on the Unipol-Bnl scale.
During the process at its load, the last week, he obtained the lack of the householders transformed into the residence obligation to Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentilni and Gaetano Pecorella, asked the immobilist to walk the tragic from the city of province to a residence in the capital.
However, according to the court, these movements (which gave the opinion against the pm) would allow him to influence his company and access the evidence they accused of it.
Elites in danger
The phenomenon was already shown a few days ago with the vote of the Chamber of Representatives against the saving plan of 700 billion dollars stored by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and it is more interested to punish Wall Street than to save the economy.
There is a confirmation of the New York Times last night by telling us that the current crisis is shocking the Republican Party, which is always more divided between its old East Coast, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and community business institutions, and its new soul, instead, conservators, opposites to "these of Washington" and the world of financing, especially in the Centre and Southern States.
The soul, for the appeal, has been prepotently alive with the vote I said at the beginning.
However, this is just a example of changes, major changes, that the current economic earth may be predicting or already leaveing: not only in the United States but also in the whole West and may not be just here.
Even in the uses and in Europe, the crisis seems to be functioning by incubating phenomenons since that in the new climate they are consolidated and finally come to the light.
The first of these phenomena is the renovation, the extraordinary launch, of the double state-sovereignty category in relation to a species of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis is, in fact, a crisis of bank-financing institutions which have, indeed, associated with the external, but first of all are seeing the budgets of people and families who live in a single country, in a single state.
This creates immediately a political problem for those who rule it, and that is how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and the families that, among others, are also a electory.
The crisis appears economically globally, but politically is almost nationally.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of the game or does not have much to say: the lighting test is given by the European Union, which is commonly divided between the various interests and between the various state strategies, is not able to decide any common political lines.
And this is the government of each single state that is waiting for interventions, savings plans and relaxation, new rules, and especially the explanation of funds: since the time they arrive at the closest, are only States that have economic resources, the mass of financial resources that can try to restore things in the sixth.
They also have the necessary means and legislation to be used: two resources of incomparable value, in certain circumstances, which are likely no market and no international organization will never be able to have similarly.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the statistical and national element is of the rest in perfect symptoms with the increasing importance of the recent developments in the economy tend to assign to a very closely linked factor to this element: territoriality.
Indeed, while we were convinced that we were now in the Kingdom of the network, the always more sophisticated technology, the immaterial, while we were convinced that globalized finance was now intended to dominate the world, we have found a treat that our future will instead make accounts in a growing measure with those very few inmaterial things that are the water, the collections, the oil.
All things that, looking at a little, may certainly be carried out from one place to the other of the land, but they are, however, read absolutely to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
Because the one who is here is sovereign, there are certainly many cards than those who are not, who have the difficulty to live in a place without assemblies, without oil and water.
I'm coming to the second news that I'm taking a fractures.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitablely says Political, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the consciousness of the object requires authorised leadership, the request of someone who can take the situation in hand.
On the other hand, a decrease on existing leaderships, economic species, is so inadequate and small of shadow zones.
And together with something more deeply and in a certain worried sense: a discredite, an insufficient, an image of inadequacy, a sense of lontanity, which tends to participate in a growing number of Western countries.
It seems to be more widespread in the largest sectors of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same ideas of social eleites, their way to hear and to be, their culture in the comprehensive adoption of the term, to have done their own time and to be more extraordinary to the views of the majority.
The request of leadership, instead, is substantially a ratified but potential movement of delegation of traditional leaders and political assets, which appears in the electoral "revolted" elections or in the slowly executions of the colleagues of these last and last times, from the conservatory access to Austria-Baviera at the crown of the Laburistian consensuss in Britain, to the rebellion of the American congress against Bush (and perhaps also the victory of the right side in Italy has something to do).
It is the impression that traditional eleites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rides, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their formats would say someone, make it always more difficult to understand, and therefore to represent, what is not currently forming in the deep streets of Western society and that the economic crisis renews, increases, affects potentially dismissing.
Before all of this, it would be frankly exagerated about a 'rebellion of mass' at the order of the day.
But keep your eyes open of course isn't for nothing.
The supercolla to walk on the walls
Sconfig gravity laws thanks to a super ball and in the future walking on the walls like Spiderman.
It is the goal of various American research centres and a team of four institutions has now been very close to us.
With a single additive of 2,5 squarecm, the students have been able to keep a body of 100 kg on a vertical wall.
The American Science magazine published the discovery of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the study team is an evolution of existing people who use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubs.
“The principle of the colla can be imagined as a series of systemed tubes as a pile of spaghetti” explains Zhong Lin Wang from Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have inspired the channels of the gyms, covered by microscopic games that can ensure a perfect leadership to the animal.
The tests conducted on various materials, such as vitro, Teflon and vitrated paper, have shown that the new addesive is ten times more powerful than the channels of these rectangles and at the same time" goes easy from the wall," Liming Day, researcher of the Engineering university of Dayton.
CAMMINARE MURI? -"This material may be useful as transitory addebition," adds Liming Day.
Maybe to walk on the walls just like Spiderman? Maybe, but researchers think of a very less attractive use such as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubs are heat and electric current drivers.
Other applications might be related to airspace engineering.
For the moment, I didn't have anything over.
The ALTRA RICERCA – also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to the search of a new adequacy.
In an article on the American Chemical Society magazine, the Californian students presented a suitable microfibre format such as hair that pull from powders during the movement on a surface to keep a perfect adherence.
Pharmaceuticals: never consumed fruits
Attention to the pompelm succumb, the ring and the skin.
These drinks, especially consumed in states because of the detainees and vitamin rich, if you at the same time take some saved medicines, they change the absorption by simplifying or decrease their effectiveness in the cases as a result of serious health.
The risks of fruit sugar and freshly associated with the abuse of some medicines David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, which from the 236th National Chemical Society in Philadelphia, has been launched a new alarm: a bit of pompelms, rams and pans to reduce the absorption of some saved medicines, cancel their benefits and risk patients' health.
The pompelm succumb was already under accused accusedly because it was considered responsible for increased to toxic levels the effects of some antiarthmic, antibiotic, ansiolotic, antistaminical and neurological medicines.
FARMACI A RISCHIO - The same Italian Pharmacist Agency had been newsed in an information bottle two years ago by going to doctors and patients to not underestimate the risk resulting from this mix and to take care of what you drink in the case they have been taken, such as Diazepam or Metadone.
NO SOLO POMPELMO - According to experts, there are substances that prevent medicines.
The list of active principles that have been prohibited by the pomp and the other sugars.
From here, the call of Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology Department of the State University of Milano: "They generally discovered are signed immediately to the various international and national pharmaceutical agencies that, eventually intend to change the information notes of the medicines.
So read always the illustrative papers of the medicines that are taken and if there is something that is not clear, do not make us impress but ask the doctor or pharmacist's expert at Ansa's Agency.
The Economy Nobel in Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize for the economy was allocated to the American Paul Krugman for his studies on trade models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a neokeynesian who teaches to the University of Princeton and is a well-known editor of New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most critical ones of the choices in economic and external policy of Bush administration.
A few months after the attacks of September 2001, Krugman had planned in a editorial posted on New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A prediction that was not little polymical and that for years has been reflected to the economicist, but that it has now been realized.
"I'm surprised and also a little shocked for the speed with which the memory of scandals such as Enron or Worldcom college is gone from the attention of the public," Krugman stated at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "economist of great value", but also a distributor with a multi-agressive style, particularly critical against excess of freedom of Bush administration.
Open Office, here is the third edition of the package "anti-Microsoft"
It is the day of the OpenOffice.org 3.0 delivery, the open source of personal productivity that aims to get more users from the office home, professionals to the public administration, as a free alternative to the most known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work by voluntary developers, on which spaces monitor SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several news: the welcome screen and the review interface is less expensive, if they add more substantively as the native compatibility for the Mac OS X operating system and the support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the last ISO standard version.
Attention also to the interoperability with the Suite Office 2007, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.doach, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific features of some modules such as that allows to reduce the sizes of PowerPoint presentations, such as e-mail, or the possibility of importing PDF files into the graphical processing module, by maintaining the original appearance of the page.
Always on this front you can create "Hybrid PDF" documents that accompanies the typical graphic of Adobe with the elements of a calculation sheet or a text manufacturer.
Cooperation is a element that has received different improvements within the applications: in the calculation sheet, you can be able to enter into more hands between different users, avoiding change conflicts in the text developer, each collaborator will be allocated a color in comments for a better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some functionality of OpenOffice on the web ( on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the next weeks the final result should be released.
The Italian version is downloaded to http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and has been added to the English that was found on Thursday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is also available for the Linux operative system.
The cd of installation can also be sent home or at workplace.
And if the theme of free will be a train for dissemination in houses, it's just in business that Open Office the suite trys the big school, and you can already account on various projects carried out in the public administration and schools.
And they don't miss the realities offering an ideal training, advice and assistance for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could open business perspectives.
Open Office is composed of five main modules: Writer, for the corresponding Word videoscription; Calc, it is the calculation sheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for Powerpoint emblem presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access program is the program that allows to work on databases; Draw, is finally the graphic module.
Objective for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and it is likely that we are at almost 3 million and 600 miles today, with the exit of the new version, it is likely that we can also exceed the expected number.
Positive COl result is the fourth case of doping
A new case of position at the last Tour de France: it is Austrian Bernhard Kohl, team Gerolsteiner, the third classified and winner of the best scalator magic.
Reporting the news is the daily site of the Team.
The 26th Year Kohl is the fourth positive runner in the Cera, the third generation epoch, after the Italian Riccardo Riccô and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also those of Gerolsteiner.
The analysis on blood samples of Kohl includes those carried out in the last weeks by the Laboratory of Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the controversial analysis will confirm the positiveness in Cera, the Austrian will lose the third place at the Tour and go to the two years of canonic squalification.
To confirm the news of the positiveness of Kohl at the Epo of the third generation is the chief of the French antidoping Agency, Peter Bordry, who has informed the Association of Press that he has notified the positiveness to the Austrian authorities.
The 26th Austrian podium was on the end of the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, accompanied the magia for the best scalator.
IMMIGRATION: NEW YORK TIMES WHAT, ITALIA is RAZISISTY?
Italy, "Immigrant countries" has recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" acknowledged with refusal.
This is turning Belpaese into a country of racists? How much is it asked in a long article the New York Times that has dedicated a long article to the debate on racism in Italy, joining the case of the young Abdul William Guibre originating Burkina Faso killed in Milan last month for stealing a sketch of biscots.
This is the case that now defines the "neighborhood of the north": the northern regions are at the same time the "more integration and more work", but also the "more anti-immigrated feelings of the country and the highest support in the North League".
By confirming the growing tension between Italian and immigrants, now also quoted the episodes of intolerance of Milano, Parma, Rome, Cimpino and Castel Volturno.
Not just.
The new legislation referred to in the Law that strikes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of citizens is referred to as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
Tendence stressed both by the Pope and by the President of the Republic: "Napolitan Georgia meeting Benedicto XVI to the Quirinale asked the State and the Church to work together to defeat racism."
Holidays' victims of coal up to 900 euros for a room
The market of assets for universities does not know crisis.
According to the last Sunia survey, the survey officer, taking a single room, can cost a student up to 900 euros to Milan, 700 to Firenze, 650 to Napoli, 600 to Rome.
"The phenomenon has now taken very serious characters to exclude the entire fascination of young people from the right to the study for the highest comprehensive costs that the families of origin should support - explaining the responsibilities of the Sunia’s study office, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand by students has so much the market to involve a generally increased process also for the residents."
In most cases, the offers of availability contain a number of violations: free, unregistered contracts, without limits of canon, linked sub-affects.
For Sunia, we need extraordinary measures that can calm prices through the review of taxes.
Seeing the details of the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brisa area, there were about 450 euros; for a single room you go from a minimum of 650 (Nark area) to a average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (in the Vittoria area).
On Florence a bedroom costs a average of 350/400 euros, a room around 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate on the nearest areas at the University, 250/280 euros for a double bed, from 370 to 500 for a single.
In Rome, near the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) are requested for about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a bedroom in a double.
Values only slightly lower ($550 for a single camera) in areas near the other universities (Osteanese and Science).
Only if you move in Perifer Area: 300 euros for a bed and 450 a single in the Prenestina area, Centopelle and similar.
There were 300/450 euros in Napoli for bedroom, for a room of EUR 400 to 600, with the highest prices in the Policlinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for a bedroom, there were EUR 250/350, at least 350 for one single.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have more weight in the urban economy.
In the towns where the phenomenon of foreign students, such as Perugia, is finally registered with another anomaly: the increase of about 25/30% of the canon requested for foreign students than those applicable to Italians.
Old cinema Paradise, the towns cancel the historical salt
Historical film sales close to the multiplex.
"A city without cinematographic salt is a blind city, it's like a ball without eyes."
The image offered by the register Giuseppe Tornator is efficacely pictured as it happens in the large cities of Italian, but also in the cities of the province.
The cinema marginalization process, with the born in the periferity of the great multisale and the corresponding death for consumption of monosals in the central areas of the city, is one of those events that exist inevitably and inconvertible but also have all the characteristics of a true and cultural crime.
Dismissing are often historical places and memory cards," it is like if you were less a friend, a acquaintance with whom we shared a piece of road and a lot of emotions," observes the registry of New Film Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago was valuable to Tornator the premium Oscar and the Great Prize of the Jury of Cannes, and who told the poetry of a provincial room and the nostalgia to live in a way that could be lost forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of the exercises, clearly speak: In the past five years the battles have closed 316 traditional cinema, and to pay the largest outcome are mostly the sales in the main cities: 10 in less to Florence, 9 to Milan, Napoli, Bologna and Rome, 6 in less than to Torino, 5 to Palermo.
Among the most affected regions from the first closure the Emilia-Romagna with 82 persical monosala films, followed by Toscana (44) and Lombardia (41).
And demonstrating that the first responsible for their disappearing is the event of multix, these are really the three Italian regions that have made recording the largest number of new multisala films: 195 schemes in Lombardia in the past five years, 81 both in Toscana and Emilia-Romagna.
“Itlanic exercise has developed irrationally” notes Paul Protti, President of the Anec," it is useful to build new structures but would be to ensure the survival of those already existing, because when a town room closes, not all its visitors are ready to transfer to multix.
In order to do not talk about the lack of funds for exercises: the State’s pre-related debt is about 10 million euros.
It is honourable, from the ethical and moral point of view, that the government does not respect existing laws.
In order to support the sector, they would serve between 16 and 18 million euros per year".
Interesting in the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, concerned about the closure, decided to run the repairs with the signing of a protocol between Comune and Anec, the first of this type in Italy, to protect and promote monosala films both in the historical centre and in Periferia.
Among the rules laid down there are tax facilitation measures for the managers and benefits of the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter in the limited traffic area and have special tariffs for the soil and in some parkings.
"It's a initiative that I like," Joseph Tornator observes and I hope that other cities follow the example of Bologna and put on foot other measures.
It is certain that, in contrast to the extrapower of multi-scale, traditional sales must also improve the quality of sound and image, because the public is more required today.
The defense of the traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important for me: the closure of the Superkine of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the scene that convinced me to do "New Paradise Paradise", which I thought for 10 years.
I lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I go before the Rialto or the Cyril of National Way now closed, where I lived so many shared emotions, to not see the powdered cards turning me on the other side."
Legaging between the political and 's synagogue arrest of Gioia Tauro
"The synagogue of Gioia Tauro was available to harmonize the choices of the Comune to the interests of the Piromallli coast."
It is weakened by the accused that the magistrates of the Calabria Antimaphia Directorate turn to the synagogue and vice-six of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the sindac of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested tonight for external concours in mafious association.
In hands also Joacchino Piromalli, the mediator elder between the clan and the public administrations, and his advocate, the Homosexual of the Boss, already condemned for association for mafioso stamping, condemned to restore 10 million euros.
"In any legal and moral standard, as well as in good sense," the applicants write, the two local administrations had expressed the will of paying consultations to the lawyer Piromalli.
"It would be so granted to the cosca - they write the judges - to be officially engaged within the municipalities by facilitating the possibilities, already ingest, control and address of the public administration."
The Chairman of the Regional Countries Agazio Loiero does not hide that "collections between local and unorganized institutions there are many" in its region: "There are areas where mafious intensity is stronger than in others, where collision is almost inevitable.
But there are many local politicians who resist the pressures of the 'andrangea', heroes that keep clean.
The arrests of tonight follow those of July last with which the police announced that Piromalli cooked.
From the end of April last, the Joia Tauro Joia's Common Council was shocked but already in 1991, and always for predicting conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians were taken by the task of administration of the Community.
Jorgio Dal Torrione, the Udc's synagogue at the moment of the dilution, was elected by the head of a central side coalition, after the balling of May 2006.
He shouted the scandale when the Prefecture ordered the dissemination of the Common Council.
He called on in question the next vice-minister of the Internal Marco Minniti, accusing him to have architected the whole for a political issue, but the judges, in the order of signed arrest, explain that the Cosca Piromallli cosque came to request the change of the A3 project.
From the environmental interceptions ordered towards Dal Torrione, they write pm, it is emerged that "the availability to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representing a larger group near the Piromalli, harmonizing the choices of the public administration for cosca interests".
When energy is born from where they now spend on the large
It's a ultimate smooth, which is more than 70% of the surface of the planet and now discover the great global energy companies.
Where, flights, seaes are the new renewable sources on which they have put the eyes, and now they try to put the hands, put down as the Chevron.
The possibility of recover energy from the sea movements has been studied for hundreds of years and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the oil price slowed around 1980, the idea of using marine energy was taken by part, but now the environmental stems and the new increase in oil makes an impact on the sector.
London’s World Energy Council (WEC) estimated in 2007 that 15 per cent of the global electricity requirements could be covered by marine exploitation installations.
This amount would be the double of that currently produced by nuclear centrals.
And more, there would be swimming and merry.
You're shooting at the shooting.
The first company to discover the marine energy was the Enersis, which in 2005 settled an agreement to build an installation in the north of Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it was a revolutionary step.
At two years of distance to switch on marine energy are always more and among these companies that have always been voted to traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying the ocean energy technologies - he declared the portion of a company associated with the United States oil colose to the economic newspaper Wall Street Journal - and it is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us."
The cooperation concerned relates to the obtainment of a permit by the United States Energy Commission, necessary to start a project for the use of marine energy in Alaska.
It is a sign that is not so short, especially if it is considered that in Alaska it is still used to extract oil, and recently President Bush has started a plan for new tribalizations.
In addition to Chevron, there are the Verdant Power Inc. of New York and the New Jersey Ocean Power to walk the road from the sea and the sums invested until now, as not in details, they indicate that observers are interested in the seas.
Technology to put on the point.
The experts are talking about a technology still to the farms, even because marine energy is not all doubts about the environmental impact.
For now, the installations such as the Portuguese or some in Scotia are small and they do not seem to create great ecosystem problems.
In order to produce energy on a wide scale, however, technologies must be used with a greater environmental impact.
And the choices are different: the Ocean Power, for example, uses a bow system associated between them.
The spine of where it moves the bows on and down is converted into hydraulic pressure from pistons and cylinders inside the gallengers.
The pressure makes a turbine turning a generator at its time.
The electricity is sent to riva through submarin caves.
For now there are four installations of this type in the way of design, in waiting for federal approval and part of energy could serve for a military installation.
The Verdant Power, however, already produces energy for a commercial centre and a parking using six submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movement when there are seaes makes turning the torbin pales, creating a rotative movement that produces a generator.
Verdant said he had a long list of customers waiting for the necessary power authorisations.
After the place, it's merry.
A particular interest, they say to the Electric Research Institute, now merge the potential of the sea.
Although it is a intermitting phenomenon, the sea is more predictable than wind, sun or where, and so more reliable as a source of energy.
It is just about the energy of the seas that were like New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others who are on the costs, have already invested 7 million and half dollars in 2008 and planned to invest up to 35 million for 2009.
