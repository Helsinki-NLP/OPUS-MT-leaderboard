How long do you feel these symptoms?
and all the therapy pain must be treated in this way, especially at your age
and especially if you have fever
and your cholesterol and your tension must also be controlled
And do you have fever today?
Do you presently feel theoracical pain?
Do you also have difficulties to breathe?
Can you tell me if you have other symptoms?
And how many of you have been fever?
And I'm going too.
And I have a little sweet and I go.
And I'm really very bad today
Is the current period promoted to your rhythm of fees?
And I have these pains in the sweet.
And I think I have a little fever.
Can you tell me where you feel the thoracic pain?
And they have a little fever too.
and with your diabetes
And you know that I have the impression that my petrine's going to be cut off
And you know that people go on me over the whole time
and you have pain in the skin
and you said feeling a pressure in the skin

Do you observe other symptoms or problems in addition to muscular pain?
Is there any other sick people at your home with the same symptoms?
Do you have other symptoms?
Are you souffled?
Do you still have pain in the skin?
Because it's the influenza season
but we shouldn't be able to defeat the possibility of a thoracic pain related to a cardiac problem
but this pain in petry is a more important problem now
but I have difficult to breathe
But I know that many people are all on me.
but we need to treat all the pain in the skin with the greatest care
But you're normally breathing now, isn't it?
because I completely forgot because of this pain in the skin
Is that you have the impression that we understand the petrine?
you are still souffled(s)
Do they be sick or have similar symptoms?
Do you have another chronic affection like hypertension or something similar?

Are you shoffed in more than this pain in the pettrine?
Do you have hypertension?
Are you shoffed in more than that?
You know what symptoms she had?
See the image?
drink a lot of liquid today
But I do tests for diabetes
However, she has symptoms instead of mys.
How many of you have fever?
What's your tension?
if you always have a strong fever
if you have a hundred or more fibre or more
if you think your symptoms or problems are worth being examined more closerly
I've got the fever yesterday
I had also a sweet fiber.
I've got the fever yesterday
I feel awesome pain here in the petry.
I have some difficulties to breathe too
I'll send you a picture
I'm worried today
I have head smells and a little fever today
I think it's the Grippe.
I think it's a little grip.
Is it like a very slow person sit on your sweet?
It started with head smells in a little nearly in the same time
That's bad in the middle of my sweet.
it's an oppressing pain in the skin
It's in my feet.
It's at the center of my pettrine.
It's at the center of the pettrine
I have a pain in the sweet.
This thoracic pain I'm worried very much
I want you to describe this pain in the sweet.
such as hypertension or diabetes
as a pile in the center of the pettrine
Now against fibre you can take paracetamol
Mary, that's how much now you have symptoms
you say now you have a pain in the sweet
I sometimes have a sweet smell
Okay you have other symptoms in more or only this pain in the skin
Or somebody sit on your sweet?
a little closely similar to the fiber and tough, the head pain and muscular pain
in full environment of the petry
Show me on this image where you're worried
since you have the fibre
So do you think some of these symptoms could be related to pregnancy?
So your children have some of these symptoms?
Tell me about your pain in the sweet.
the fever increases the night
the fever I had the last two days.
Fire began to increase last night
It's the doctor Porter of the three-centur in the emergency room
Well, can you tell me a little more about your pain in the sweet?
Well, I feel a pain before my body, here in my skin.
Well, I have a strong pain in the sweet.
Well, when I have this pain in the sweet.
What kind of pain you have in the skin?
When did this pain start in the skin?
Where'd you get bad in the sweet?
where you feel this thoracic pain in the skin
you feel like an oppression in the skin
You know I've got diabetes and all this.
You said you had this pain in the sweet.
Speed increase of the cumulated impact of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) within the European Union/Economic Space and the United Kingdom between 1 January 2020 and 15 March 2020
The cumulated impact of the cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar development in the countries of the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming as well as in different cities, the pandemic of COVID-19 is rapidly progressing in all countries.
According to Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care services must be prepared to a small number of patients at COVID-19 needing care, and in particular intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a home of unknown ethiology pneumonia was reported in Whan, in the province of Hubei, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Heavy Prevention and Disease Centre designated the responsible agent as a new coronavirus known now under the name of Coronavirus 2 of the severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since the infected disease of SARS-CoV-2 has been baptized with coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Today, about 80 per cent of people at COVID-19 have a pleasant affection, i.e. an infection of respiratory ways with or without pneumonia, most of which are cured.
About 14 per cent of the cases, COVID-19 causes a more severe inclination to hospitalization, while the 6 per cent of the remaining cases are developing a serious form of intensive care.
The mortality of patients hospitalized because of COVID-19 is around 4%.
In the context of this study, we evaluate the development of the accumulated impact of COVID-19 in each of the countries of the European Union/EEA Economic Area (EU/EEE) and the United Kingdom (R.-U.) and compare it with the development known by the province of Hubei in China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 Case in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
After China, COVID-19 continued to promote, and the dynamic of COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world is now following that of the country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) would declare that COVID-19 is pandemic.
In the edition of 5 March 2020, Spiter and al. reported the first cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Europe according to the definition of WHO cases.
In the EU/EEE, the first three cases confirmed were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in persons returning from Whan, in the province of Hubei, China.
On 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 were detected in each of the 30 countries of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom (R.-U.) with 39 768 cases and 1 727 deceases declared, including 17 750 cases and 1 441 deaths for Italy only.
Obtaining the cumulated number and the cumulated impact of the case of COVID-19
In the European Health Prevention and Diseases Control Centre (ECPCM), the number of cases of COVID-19 reported in each world, which only obtained from official sources such as health departments, national and regional authorities in different countries and WHO, is updated daily at 08.00.
These data were used to assess COVID-19 development within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and to establish comparisons with Italy's experience.
In order to evaluate the prevalence of active COVID cases, we calculated the cumulated impact of 14 days of COVID-19 cases, taking into account the natural development of COVID-19, within each EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compared the cumulated number of cases reported in each country by 15 March 2020 to 8.00 a.m. with Italy's data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID19 development in the EU/EEE countries and the United Kingdom
Evolution of the cumulated impact on 14 days of the cases of COVID-19 within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom has generally monitored that of the province of Hubei (Chine) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EE and the United Kingdom, the accumulated COVID-19 impact began to grow around 21 February before a drastic increase in the surrounding of 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This development was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other countries of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom presented a similar increase in the cumulated impact of COVID-19 (additional data).
Figure 2 provides the cumulated number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom compared to Italy's data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It is noted that, on March 15 to 8.00, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only three weeks ago or less.
Our results indicate that the number of cases signaled by COVID-19 are rapidly increased within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The evolution of the cumulated impact of COVID-19 suggests that pandemic progresses to a comparable speed in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are different cities and that there are differences in the responses of national public health services, potential variations in case definitions, and differences in the selection protocols of patients to be tested for confirming COVID-19, including for rattracking tests.
In March 2020, the doctors of Italy's affected regions indicated that about 10 per cent of patients reached by COVID-19 needed intensive care, and media reported that hospitals and intensive care services in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data relating to the admission of cases of COVID-19 in hospitals and/or intensive care services are currently available at the EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of the cases, respectively (not submitted).
However, a systematic collection should be achieved in order to complement the current monitoring data focused on the number of reported and death cases.
A study carried out in 2010-11 showed an important difference in the number of beds available in intermediate and intensive care services in Europe, which were 29.2 beds for 100.000 persons in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 in intensive and intermediate care beds for 1000,000 individuals 2010-11).
Modalization scenarios on the saturation of care capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEE country and the United Kingdom of the prevailing case of COVID-19 hospitalized cases associated with risks > 90% over-intensive care capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the rapid risk evaluation of COVID (19).
Since the cases were to be grouped in certain regions of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and the hospitals and intensive care services generally receive a defined regional population, the data on intensive care and care should preferably be established at the level 2 of the Statistics Territories Units Nomenclature (NUTS 2).
Italy's experience and the current development in other countries show that COVID-19 pandemics rapidly progress within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The countries, hospitals and intensive care services should therefore be prepared to a supported Community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2, as well as to increase the number of patients reached by COVID-19 needing care, and in particular intensive care, such as in the regions affected by Italy.
As highlighted by the recent rapid risk assessment of the CEPCM, a rapid, proactive and exhaustive approach is essential to delay the propagation of SARS-COV-2, through a approach to an acceleration approach, where fast and precise increase of the number of cases could not leave sufficient time to decisions and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their responses, if nothing has been implemented in mount.
The rapid risk assessment also includes public health measures to improve the impact of pandemic.
There is a short window in which each country will strengthen its control efforts to raise the propagation of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce health pressure.
Without that, health systems in other EU/EEA countries must be addressed to a small number of patients needing intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The epidemic of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus 2 of the severe respiratory syndrome (SRAS) (SARS-CoV-2), has been infected by more than 30,000 deaths and infected over 800,000 people in China and otherwise in the world, causing an humanitarian disaster.
As its homologue, SARS-CoV, which is incoming thousands of cases of YAS in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by South-South keys and cause similar symptoms.
However, COVID-19 presents a less strict and mortality than the SAS, but it is much more transmissive, and it affects older people than young people and more than women.
In response to the rapid increase of the number of publications on this emergency disease, this article is endeavoured to provide an appropriate and exhaustive review of this subject of full-speed research.
We will address the fundamental elements of epidemiology, ethiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, pronostic and disease prevention.
Although many questions are still waiting for answers, we hope that this review will enhance and eliminate this serious disease.
The spring Festival, on 25 January 2020, has never marked the Chineses, who have been forced to remain closed for the whole week of gold, as well as for many other weeks because of the propagation of a new viral disease.
Virus is very homological to the coronavirus (CV) which causes a severe respiratory syndrome (SRAS) in 2003; therefore he has been baptized by the World Health Organization (OMS) on 11 February 2020, and associated disease named coronavirus 19 (COVID-19).
Epidemia started in Whan and rapidly propaved around China before extending about 50 other countries around the world.
On 2 March 2020, the virus had incurred more than 80 000 cases confirmed by COVID-19, with more than 40 000 patients hospitalized and more than 3,000 deaths.
For WHO, COVID-19 is "the public enemy 1", potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (http://www.cmbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 works were published on COVID-19, including in the areas of virology, epidemiology, ethiology, diagnosis and treatment since the first report on 7 January 2020, which presented the virus sequence, is isolated from several patients.
This review tries to synthete the progress of the research on this new subject in full.
As far as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with COS and another coronavirus disease, the breathing syndrome of the Middle East (MERS, epidemia occurred in 2012).
We will also make the point of what we have learned until now in terms of prevention and prognosis of disease, and we will consider some questions still suspended but even urgent.
The coronavirus is traditionally considered as non-mortal pathogenes for humans, which primarily caused 15% of common rhomes 4.
However, during this century, we have known two high-patogenic coronavirus for humans, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which have caused a epidemic in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively before promoting rapidly to many other countries with high morbidity and high mortality.
Current COVID-19 is therefore the third epidemia of coronavirus of the recent history.
As presented in Fig.1.1, then unknown pneumonia homes were first reported in Whan on 31 December 2019 at the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the sequence of the coronavirus was declared.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case was reported in Whan.
Among the time, epidemic was rapidly propaved to the cities, provinces and neighbouring countries.
On 20 January, it was reported that health professionals had been infected, suggesting that inter-human transmission could be possible.
On January 23, the city of Whan was placed in quartain with interruption of all its public transport.
On January 24, the first clinical study on disease indicated that, in 41 cases confirmed, only 21 patients had been directly contacted with the Whan's sea fruit market, considering the start point of infection with an unknown animal source.
On January 30, WHO qualified world health emergency epidemics.
At the time of the drafting of this report, disease has already been promoted throughout China as well as about 50 other countries around the world (Fig.2).
When the situation is rapidly evolving, the final port and safety of epidemic remains to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicentric study carried out on 8 866 patients, with 4 021 cases confirmed by COVID-19, presented a updated view of epidemia as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/lBi-HX_rHHP1QA).
SARS-CoV-2 was infected by people of every age, but more than 30-65 years.
About half (47.7%) of infected persons older than 50, very few of them had less than 20 years, and only 14 were less than 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 was more infected by men (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was developed in homes, mainly in the province of Hubei and the peripheral.
The average period between the appearance of symptoms and COVID-19 diagnostic was 5 days (2-9).
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The average period between the appearance of symptoms and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The basic reproduction rate (R0) was 3,77 (95% IC: 3,51-4,05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected persons had been exponentially increased until 23 January 2020, which corresponds to the massive movements that took place before the spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients identified as cases confirmed was 1,44% (95% IC: 1,10-1,86%) and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3,06% (95% IC: 2,02-4,59%).
The three main risk factors of COVID-19 were sex (human), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
The coronavirus is a subfamily of large developed virus containing a simple brin ARN.
They can be classified in four kinds, namely alpha, beast, gamma and delta, the known coronavirus to infect the man belonging to the alpha and beast.
The glucoprotein Spike (S) of the copper is linked to the angiotensine 2 (ACE2) conversion enzyme and the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) of its cellal receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, then a membrane fusion is produced.
Virus ARN is released in cytoplasm; after the replication of the viral genom, the genemic ARN is accompanied by glucoproteines of support and nucleocapside proteins forms of virus containing viruses, which then fusion with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genetic sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 was presented on 10 January 2020.
It was established that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus, with more than 99.98% genetic identity between 10 sequencing samples produced on the source site of epidemia, the Huanan's fruit market in Whan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through the transmission of electronic microscopy, particules of SARS-CoV-2 have been detected in ultrafine sections of human breathingways.
Human ACE2 was identified as a SARS-CoV-2-receptor and SARS-CoV.
However, protein S from SARS-CoV-2 links the human ACE2 less strongly than that of SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less significant infection than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b, as well as a secret protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b could play a role in viral pathogenity and inhibit the expression of the IFN; however, orf8 does not contain known functional areas or grounds.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, and al., the complete human CR2 Cryo-ME structure was presented in a complex resolution of 2.9. with the B0AT1 amino acid transporter.
They found that the complex, which presented open and closed compliance, was assembled in the form of diam and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could link two S proteins, which provides indications for recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for the clashing of medicinal products in order to eliminate the infection to SARS-CoV-2.
Heritage and intermediate host
It was established that SARS-CoV and MERS-COV were keys and they were transmitted to humans through civics and cameras, respectively.
Following a phylogenic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronavirus, the suuri keys have been advanced as the native SARS-CoV-2 host, as the new virus is 96% identical to the two type coronavirus of COVS from the suuries called ba-SL-CoVZX45 and SL-COVX21.
However, the intermediary host that allowed the virus to strike the species' barrier to infect the man remains unknown, and the way of transmission is still to elect.
Ji, and al., issued the hypothesis that the virus could have been transmitted to human keys by the serpents, which would include homological recombination within the protein S.
According to a study conducted by Guangzhou researchers in China, pangolin - a long museum mammaly is breathing, often used in traditional Chinese doctor - could be the intermediary SARS-CoV-2 host if it is judged by genetic homology 99% between a coronavirus found in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a distance of 1% between two genoms is a difference in importance; therefore, it should be expected to conclude results to establish concrete evidence (Fig. 33).
The physics-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very little known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may survive in vitro for 48 hours in sec environment and up to 5 days at a temperature of 20 °C and a humidity of 40 to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 could have similar properties.
It seems that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet radiates as well as at a temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol to 75%, clore-based desinfectants, peractic acid, chloroform and other grass solvents, but not clorhexidine, can effectively disable virus.
Human population in its entirety is generally dispersived in immunity with SARS-CoV-2 and therefore is vulnerable to the new virus.
At present, no detailed study has been reported about immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to studies previously carried out on other coronavirus, including on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4.4).
Generally, when a virus infectes a host, it is first recognised by the immune system inhibited by the bias of molecular motive recognition receptors (PRR), including the type C-lective Receptors, the Toll Type Receptors (TLR), NOD-type Receptors (NLR) and RIG-I-type receptors (RLR).
In different ways, the virus introduced the expression of inflammation factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I (IFN) interferes that limit the dissemination of the virus and accelerate macrophysic phagocytosis of antivirals.
However, SARS-CoV protein N may allow the virus to escape immune responses.
Unfortunately, the adjustive immune response joins the fight against virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ cells, play an important role in defence.
The CD4+ cells stimulate the B cells that produce specific antibodies of the virus, and CD8+ cells directly eliminate infected cells.
Aid T cells produce pro-inflammatic cytokins to support defence cells.
However, the coronavirus may inhibit the T cell functions by inducing their apoptose.
Human immunity, with supplements such as C3a and C5a, as well as antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a retabli patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, excessive reaction of the immune system causes a localized explosion of the number of free roots, which can cause serious lesions to the pulmones and other organs and, in the worst scenario, a multivisual deficiency, or death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by a home appearance, is more likely to affect older persons with comrbidities and pregnant women.
It is acknowledged that persons exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised are more risked to be infected than others.
The average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated from 1 to 14 days, but more than 3 to 7 days after a study carried out on the first 425 cases reported in Whan.
However, a study carried out at 1 099 case showed that the incubation period was 3 days in average, for a float from 0 to 24 days.
A recent study, as described above, concluded in an incubation period of 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) according to a demography of 8 866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adjust the effective period of quarentaine after the most precise incubation period in order to avoid infected persons but asymptomatics not transmit the virus.
Generally, persons exposed to, or infected by, virus is placed in quarentaine for 14 days.
Should the quartenine be extended in 24 days?
The fibre is often the first and main symptom of COVID-19, and can be accompanied or not of other symptoms such as a sec, a shock, muscular pain, shocking, heading bad, gorge pain, a rhinorrhed, theoracical pain, a diarree, nausea, and defects.
Some patients presented disphine and/or hypoximia a week after the appearance of the disease.
With regard to serious cases, patients quickly developed an acute respiratory syndrome, sectic choc, metabolic oxygen and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms, as well as those having a acute fiber, even in the absence of thoracic radiography anomalies, must be tested for the virus to allow precoce diagnostic.
A demographic study, carried out at the end of December 2019, showed that sickness had 98 per cent, 76 per cent, 55 per cent dyspher and 3 per cent; 8 per cent of patients needed ventilatory assistance.
Similar conclusions were reported by two recent studies on a family and on a home appeared after the transmission of the virus from one asymptomatic individual.
Similarly, a demographic study carried out in 2012 showed that the main symptoms of patients reached by MERS-CoV were fever (98 per cent), seed towels (47 per cent) and dyspne (55 per cent).
However, 80 per cent needed ventilatory assistance, or more than the patients reached by COVID-19, which is coherent with higher letality of MRS than COVID-19.
A diarhy (26%) and a gorge (21%) were also observed in patients reached by MERS.
In terms of SCHS, the main symptoms were fever (99-100%), seed tube (29-75%), dysphine (40-42%), diarrhoe (20-25%) and gorge disease (13-25%), and ventilatory assistance was required for approximately 14-20% of patients.
On February 14, COVID-19 mortality was 2 per cent, for 66 576 cases confirmed at the world level.
Comparedly, the mortality of the SAS in November 2002 was 10% for 8 096 cases confirmed.
For the MERS, according to a demographical study carried out in June 2012, mortality was 37 per cent for 2 494 cases confirmed.
A previous study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 6.47 with a trust interval (IC) to 95% of 5,71-7,23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
A comparison of symptoms, mortality and R0 of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV is presented in Table 1.
The data above suggested that SARS-CoV-2 has a more important capacity to promote MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but that it is less literal.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control SARS-CoV-2 epidemia that it has not been for the MERS-CoV epidemies and SARS-CoV.
The appearance of a household is often involved in a family or in a assembly or vehicle, such as in the case of a cruise.
Patients often traveled or stayed in Whan or other affected regions, or were contacted with infections or patients in the two weeks before the appearance of symptoms.
However, it has been demonstrated that individuals may be virus portators without having a symptom for more than two weeks and that retailable patients may be re-relators of the virus, which highlights the need to increase the period of clothing in quarantine.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white globes (e.g. lymphocytes) in the first towns.
For example, a lymphopenia with a number of white < 4 × 109/L and a number of lymphocytes < 1 × 109/L, and a high rate of aminotransferase asparate and viremia were identified in 1 099 patients at COVI-19.
Some patients had hepatic enzymes, muscular enzymes and high myoglobine in blood, and most of them presented an elvation of the C-reactive protein rate and the erythrocytic sedimentation.
In the most serious cases, the rate of D-dimère was high, and the number of lymphocytes progressively reduced.
Thoracic radiographic anomalisms are observed in most patients reached by COVID-19, characterized by bilateral shadows or an opacity in glass level.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute pulmonary lesion and a acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
In the case of SDRA, uncontrolled inflammation, liquid accumulation and progressive fibrosis are seriously compromising gas exchanges.
The disfunction of type I and type II pneumonites leads to a decrease of surface pressure rate and increased surface tension, thus reduced the gonfler capacity and increased the risk of pulmonary collapsus.
Therefore, the most worried therapeutic reviews often coincidence with the most serious form of disease.
In February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed a dequalization of pneumonites, the training of hyalin membranes, interstitutional lymphocytal infiltration and the presence of multi-nucleated synctic cells in patients with a deceived disease, which corresponds to viral infection and SDRA pathology and apparent to the patients reached by MOS and MERS.
The SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection through a polymerara reaction after inverse transmission (RT-PCR) was used as a primary criteria for COVID diagnostic 19.
However, because of the high rate of negative false, which can accelerate epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which wasn't only on the RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation had been observed for the diagnosis of AVS.
Thus, the combination of medical anticents, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological reviews is essential and imperative to establish an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a SERLOCK technology protocol based on CRISPR technologies for SARS-CoV-2 detection purposes, which allows to identify synthetic ARN fragments of SARS-CoV-2 between 20 × 10-18 mol/L and 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies by micro-sharing litre) with a reactive band less than one hour, without needing sophisticated equipment.
It is hoped that this new technique will significantly improve sensitivity and practice, if its use on clinical specimens would have been concluded.
Because of the lack of experience in the new coronavirus, doctors may only provide support care for patients at COVID-19, while trying to try a variety of therapy already used or proposed for the treatment of other coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-COV, as well as other viral diseases (Tableau (Table 2).2).
These therapy include existing and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressors, steroids, retail patients plasma, Chinese doctor, and psychological support.
Even the plasma of retable patients has been proposed for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are all used to develop anti-corps and vaccines against virus.
The SARS-CoV-2 attacks the pulmones in the first time and probably also, in a less measure, to other organs expressing the ECE2, such as the gastro-instinal system and the rings.
However, disfunction and respiratory insuffisance are the main threat for patients, and the main cause of death.
Thus, respiratory assistance is essential to highlight symptoms and save life; this includes general oxygenotherapy, high debit oxygenherapy, non-vasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, according to the illness.
Patients suffering serious respiratory symptoms should receive extracorporal membrane oxygenation (OMEC), a changed cardiopulmonary derivation technique used for the treatment of critical cardiac or respiratory insufficients.
Furthermore, the maintenance of electric equivalence, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and sectic shocks, as well as the protection of the functions of vital organs are also essential for patients reached by SARS-CoV-2.
It has been established that excessive reaction of the immunity system leads to cytokinic shock in patients reached by COS and MERS.
A cytokinic shock is a form of systematic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokins, including TNFAL, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IFNAL, IFNś, IFN.* and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of free roots, which are the main cause of SDRA and multivisual deficiency.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokinic shocks, especially for serious cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibodies, were used to treat cytokinic shocks.
Other immunosuppressing treatments for cytokinic shocks include immune response modulation by T cells, IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF blocking, JAK inhibition, blinatumomab, cytokins 4 signal suppressor and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressors, have been widely used in the treatment of the SAS to reduce the gravity of inflammation lesions.
However, high dosing steroids did not have benefital effects on serious pulmonary lessions in patients reached by COVID and COVID-19.
Instead of this, they would lead to serious secondary effects, including a vascular osteonecrosis, which have significantly affected the pronostic.
However, the careful use of short corticosteroid cycles of low-mode dose was recommended for patients with a serious form of COVID-19.
At the time of the preparation of this report, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, the intravenous administration of redésivir, a nucleosic analogy, was effective in an American patient reaching COVID-19.
Redesivir is a new antiviral medicine developed from Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg virus.
In addition, redésivir also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other simple ARN virus, among which MERS and ARN.
In view of these findings, Gilead has transmitted the composition to China to allow a number of tests on individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2, and the results are very expected.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-alpha, lopinavir/ritonavir association and ribavirin were advanced as potential treatment for patients suffering acute respiratory symptoms.
A diarree, nausea, disorders, hepatic lesions, and other indeseable effects may occur after treatment combined with the lopinavir/ritonavir association.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicines used in patients should be carefully controlled.
Retailable patients plasma and anticorps production
Collection of blood to patients who have been healed in a contagious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy individuals of this disease is an anti-state practice.
Indeed, retail patients are often relatively high anticorps against pathogen.
Anticorps are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogenes and other foreign bodies; they recognize unique molecules in pathogenes and neutralize them directly.
Thus plasma was extracted from blood from a group of patients healed from COVID-19 and was injected with 10 serious diseases.
Their symptoms improved in 24 hours, in association with a reduction in inflamation phenomenon, a reduction in viral load and increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, a verification and clarification are needed to provide this method for large-scale use as long as no specific treatment has been developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, certain plasma-related inconveniences should be carefully examined.
For example, antibodies can cause excessive stimulation of immunity response and cause syndrome of cytokine release, potentially fatal.
The concentration of anticorps in the blood is generally low, and the plasma demand for seriously ill with patients is important.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies enoughly to combat global epidemics.
Consequently, it is more important and more efficient to isolate retailable B cells and to identify genetic codes encoding relevant antibodies or to investigate effective antibodies against the main protein of the virus.
This would allow to increase rapidly the production of anticorps.
MTC is used since thousands in China to treat a wide variety of diseases.
However, its effects are widely based on the combination of multiple components in a form that varies according to the diagnosis of the MTC.
Most effective components remain little or not known as it is difficult to extract them and check them or to know their optimal associations.
At present, because of the lack of an effective treatment of COVID-19, MTC is one of the main alternative treatments for patients with low-modified symptoms or in a serious form of disease.
For example, the shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen have been effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The best rate of COVID-19 was observed in Chinese provinces with MTC recurred to 87 per cent of their patients, including the Gansu province (63.7 per cent), the Ningxia region (50%) and Hungary (50 per cent), while Hubei province, which had not been recovered by 30 per cent of the patients reached by COVID-19, presents the lower guarison rate (13 per cent).
However, it is a relative comparison because many other factors of impact, such as the number of patients and the gravity of disease, must be taken into account for the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and its collaborators publish a study that compared a treatment with western physicians (MO) only and a combinated treatment associated with MO and MTC.
The time of return to normal body temperature, symptoms disappearance and hospitalization period was clearly shorter for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only.
More impressively, the aggravation rate of symptoms (decreased lenses) was clearly lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group (7.4 per cent against 46.2%); also mortality was less for the MO+MTC group than only (8.8 per cent against 39%).
However, the efficiency and innocentness of MTC remains to be specificated by the larger controlled tests carried out in larger scale and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the action mechanism and to clarify the effective components of MTC treatment or associations, if possible.
The individuals identified as likely or confirmed cases of COVID-19 are generally feeling anxiety to this highly contagious and mortal disease, and those placed in quarantine also experience anxiety, solitude and angry feeling.
Furthermore, the symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxie and tumor, as well as the indeseable effects of treatment, such as corticosteroid induced in corticosteroids, may cause an increased anxiety and psychological deterioration.
During the early times of snack epidemia, several psychiatric morbidities were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic crisis, psychomotive excitation, psychotic symptoms, acute confusional status and even self-suicide trends.
The binding investigation of contacts and the involvement in quarentaine, within the response of public health services to COVID-19, can increase anxiety and cause certain responsibilities in the effects of contagion, quartainine, and the stigmatization of their family and friends.
As a result, mental health care should be provided to patients reached by COVID-19, individuals identified as likely cases, persons in contact with these populations, as well as to any other suffering person.
This psychological support should include training of multidisciplinary teams, clear communication with regular and specific updates on SARS-CoV-2 epidemics, and treatment plans, as well as the use of professional applications and electronic equipment to avoid any approached contact.
Effective vaccines are essential for interrupting the transmission chain of animal reservoirs and humans infected to vulnerable hosts, and are often supplementary of antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emergency viruses.
Deployed efforts to develop protein S vaccines in order to produce long-term neutralized antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Life vaccines have been evaluated on animal models for ARS.
However, the in vivon effectiveness of these potential vaccines in older persons and on models subject to legitimate provocation and their protection against infection by a zoonotic virus remains, as no clinical study has yet been initiated.
This is probably due to the fact that the SAS has been completed 17 years ago and that no new case has been reported since.
Nevertheless, sporadic MERS cases and homes continue to declare themselves in the Middle East and in other regions because of the continuity of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Various vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS through the inactive virus, DNA plasmas, virus vectors, nanopartical vectors, virus apparent parts and recombinating protein subunits, and some have been evaluated on animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunized individuals is an urgent and essential objective to control epidemic current.
However, it is a real challenge due to the important period (18 months in average) required to develop a vaccine and dynamic variations of the coronavirus.
As it is an emergency disease, COVID-19 is just understood by thousands of patients.
In most cases, sickness is progressively resolved.
However, in the context of the SAS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high mortality and higher mortality for the most serious cases.
Therefore, the establishment of a prognostic model is essential to enable health agencies to priorize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
According to clinical studies until now, the factors that may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients are the following:
age: age was the main factor for the pronostics of the SAS, and this seems to be the case for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects individuals from 30 to 65 years of age, with 47.7% more than 50 years after a study conducted in 8 866 cases, as described above.
Patients needing intensive care were more likely to present sub-year-old comrbidities and complications, and were clearly older (Mean age of 66 years against 51 years), suggesting the age as pronotic factor for patients reaching COVID-19.
Success: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 against 0.27/100 000), as described above.
Howrbidities and complications: patients reached by COVID-19 who need intensive care are more likely to suffer acute heart lessions and symptoms.
The cardiac events also constituted the main cause of death in patients reached by NAS.
The SARS-CoV-2 can also be linked to positive ACE2 cholangiocytes, which can lead to hepatic disfunctions in patients reaching COVID-19.
It should be noted that the age and presence of health problems underyears are strongly correlated and can interfere with each other.
Annual laboratory results: the rate of C-reactive protein (CRP) in blood reflects the inflammation or tissular lessions; it has been developed as a factor of prognotic potential of disease, treatment response and treatment.
The correlation between CRP and severity and COVID-19 was also proposed.
In addition, a high rate of dehydrogenase lactate (LDH), aminotransferase (AST), aminotransferase (ALT) and kinase creatin (CK) may also contribute to the establishment of pronostic.
These enzymes are widely expressed within several organs, including at heart level and heat, and are released in the case of tissular lessions.
They therefore are traditionally the cardiac or hepatic disfunction markers.
Main clinical symptoms: Thoracic radiography results and temporary progress of clinical symptoms must be examined in association with other elements for the determination of pronotic and COVID complications.
The use of steroids: as previously described, steroids are commonly used immunosuppressors for infected diseases to reduce inflammation lesions gravity.
Since high dosing of corticosteroids was widely used for serious cases of YAS, many survivors presented avascular osteonecrosis resulting in permanent incapacity and a medium-creased quality of life.
Thus, if necessary, the administration of steroids to patients at COVID-19 should be limited to a low dose and a short duration.
Mental stress: As described above, COVID-19 epidemiology has affected a large number of exceptional stress cases, patients who often known long periods of quarantine, extreme incertitude, and nearby disease or other patients.
It is necessary to propose a psychological accompany and a long-term support in order to help these individuals to overcome this stress and find a normal life.
According to demographic studies until now, COVID-19 seems to have different epidemiological features than those of the SAS.
In addition to replying in the lower respiratory ways, SARS-CoV-2 is also effectively reacted in the higher respiratory ways and does not lead to symptoms in the first phase of infection, inducing coronavirus to the origin of common rains.
Therefore, recently infected or incubated individuals may produce a large amount of virus during their daily activities, which significantly impede the control of epidemic.
However, it was considered that SARS-CoV was transmitted by seriously sick patients, with a very low probability of transmission in the first phase.
Current COVID-19 epidemia is therefore much more serious and difficult to control that wasn't the COS.
There are currently considerable efforts in China, including Whan's confidence and neighbouring cities, as well as the continuing development of almost all the population in order to interrupte the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures had an dramatic impact on the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases decline, indicating a decrease of epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates suggest that epidemia will end in March and that the decrease phase will last from 3 to 4 months.
However, all experts do not share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, and al., believes that COVID-19, which seems to be clearly more infectious than COVID, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, and al., have established a model to prevent epidemic injury and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the mid-natal cornex and the gorge of retablis patients two weeks after their outlet of the hospital, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclic episode in the influenza.
However, encouraging signs were observed in China with the progressive reduction of new cases, suggesting that implementing strategies would work.
According to the initial predictions, Ebola virus should lead to a million cases and a half million deaths.
However, with a quarter and strict isolation, the disease was finally controlled.
It is possible, as for SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 has failed in terms of infectiousness to finally end up or evolves in a less pathogenic virus that co-existes with humans.
A comparison of COVID-19 epidemia with the COS and MERS is provided below (Fig. (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible by all or long-terms, and may also be directly contacted with contaminated materials.
The virus was also identified in slass, thus denied a new possibility of feco-oral transmission.
A recent study conducted at 138 patients revealed that 41% of the cases were possiblely caused by niocomial infections, with 17 patients with pre-earth diseases and 40 health professionals.
It should therefore be taken care to protect individuals, including health professionals, social workers, neighbors and colleagues, and even any person may be contacted with patients or infections.
The first defence line possible to reduce the risk of infection resides in the port of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and respiratory masks N95 (1860) participates in controlling virus propagation.
Surgical masks prevent the projection of potentially infected balls or their deposite on surfaces where they could be transferred to other people.
However, only N95 (1860) masks are protected against the hepatic of 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of the virus that can be fully generated; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the SARS-CoV in size, as both measured around 85 nm.
Since particules are able to cross five surgical masks on each other, it is imperative that health professionals in direct contact with patients have N95 (1860s) masks and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health professionals have to bring adapted isolation browns to reduce the contact with viruses.
Virus can also infection a person by eyeway.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor had been infected in the SARS-CoV-2, even though it was a N95 mask; the virus could have been infected by ocular ways because of inflamation.
Accordingly, health professionals must also provide transparent visa or protection lunetres for patients' contact.
For the populations of the affected or potentially affected regions, it is strongly recommended to lay hands with desinfects more often than computers, to remain confined to the maximum and to limit any contact with potentially infected persons.
It is advised to keep a distance of a metro with illnesses.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent virus propagation.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new human virus, its high level of homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, must have placed China in a high state of warning after COS epidemic in 2003.
However, on January 19, 2020, the Director of the Whan's Control and Prevention of Diseases would raise the population by claiming that the new virus was little contagious, that it had been limited inter-human transmission and that it would not be difficult to prevent and contain disease.
This message introduced a notable delay, especially at the time when the whole country was prepared for the early morning Festival, and the critical opportunity to contain the disease in Whan was missed.
Chinese disease control agencies must take lessons and take measures.
For example, these agencies must be more careful in their public advertisements, since every word can affect the behaviour and the decisions of the population; (2) show more sensitivity and reactivation against clinical inhabited data than expecting formal reports of doctors or official bodies; (3) show more restrictive to contain potential epidemics instead of trying to re-establish the population; and (4) to achieve more targeted and relevant exercises in order to acknowledge the population about epidemic diseases, but also to monitor and to regularly improve the system of response to society.
COVID-19 epidemia caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of the drafting of this report, it extended to the whole of China as well as about 50 other countries around the world.
As this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 are also close to those of the SAS, COVID-19 epidemia is born as an already impression.
However, considerable differences between COVID-19 and COS, which should be taken into account in order to contain epidemic and to treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people than young people and more men than women; violence and mortality rates are also more important in older people.
The COVID (19.91 per cent against 1.44 per cent).
The transmission of COVID-19 virus is even possible in the absence of symptoms, while the COVID was mostly transmitted by patients seriously ill; therefore it is much more difficult to contain the propagation of COVID-19.
This explains, in part, why SARS-CoV-2 has been promoting better and widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular SARS-CoV-2 detection tests may be observed negative for some patients reaching COVID-19.
On the other hand, retailable patients may be positive with virus again.
This significantly increases the risk of propagation.
Despite the rapid progress in the COVID research, several critical issues remain in suspension, including:
Where did the SARS-CoV-2 come?
Although a genetic homology of 96% has been established between SARS-CoV-2 and two type coronavirus derived from suuri keys, this is not sufficient to conclude with sure that SARS-CoV-2 provides chiroptères.
What is the intermediary species that allowed the transmission of the initial host's virus, such as sugar keys, to the human?
Without responses to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to interrupte effectively the transmission, and epidemic can be recovered at any time.
Molecular modelization and biochimical analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 is linked to ACE2, but how is the virus exactly pending in respiratory road cells and how does it lead to pathological changes?
Is the virus also linked to cells expressing the ACE2 of other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible to define a fast and accurate diagnosis or effective treatment.
How long will epidemia take it?
How is the virus evolved on the genetic level during inter-human transmission?
Will he evolve in global pandemics, destroying such as the COS or regularly recurring surface as the grippe?
It is essential, even if it can take time, to obtain answers to all these questions and to many others.
However, unlike the expenditure that this must lead, we do not have any other choice to end this epidemic as soon as possible soon as possible to restore the normal course of our existence.
Generally, the incubation period of these two viruses is lower than one week, followed by about 2 weeks of illness.
Only rare immunodepressed patients have presented a serious infection of lower respiratory ways.
The first case of ŠS was back to the end of 2002 in the province of Guangdong in China.
Without the super-transmissioners, each case could almost generate two secondary cases with a incubation period between 4 and 7 days, the viral burden of the 10th day of disease was estimated.
Patients infected by SARS-CoV initially present a myalgia, head skin, fever, males and fruits, monitoring of disspine, tous and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, false tests of the hepatic function and high kinase creatin are current anomalies observed in laboratory analysis in the case of typicion.
Disabled allergyal lesions, proliferation of epidemial cells and increased macrophages are also observed in patients reached by ARS.
About 20 to 30% of patients need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to lower respiratory ways, several organs including gastro-intestinal ways, feed and king, may also be infected in these severe cases, often accompanied by a cytokinic shock, which can be fatal in particular in immunodepressed patients.
Since the time, huge efforts have been made to HCOV research.
HCOV-NL63 was isolated in a child of 7 months in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was predominant in young children, older people and immunodepressed patients suffering respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjunctite, fibre and bronchiolite is common in the disease caused by HCOV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from the birth of a 8-month child who suffers pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although he has been identified in the Netherlands, he is in reality in the whole world.
HCOV-NL63 is associated with an obstructive laringite, also called crop.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was isolated in a 71-year-old hospitalized man because of a pneumonia and a bronchiolite in Hong Kong.
In HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 is present at the global level, due to moderate respiratory diseases.
Generally, when these HCOVs obtain the ability to effectively transmit themselves and maintain themselves continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 cases confirmed.
MRS clinical manifestations are similar to the ORS and are characterized by an evolutionary pneumonia.
In contrast to the SAS, many patients suffering from MERS also developed an acute renal deficiency, which is characterized by MERS in relation to pathologys in HCOV.
More than 30% of patients have gastro-intestinal symptoms such as diarrey and disorders.
In February 14, 2020, more than 2 500 cases confirmed in laboratory were reported with high death rates of 34.4 per cent, which makes MERS-CoV one of the most known mortal viruses in humans.
A diarrey is also observed in some patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected in SARS-CoV-2 were reported and could contribute to the rapid propagation in the world.
The comparation and opposition of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCOV showed similarities and very interesting differences.
First, incubation period and HCOV diseases are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCOV.
Secondly, the gravity of COVID-19 symptoms is between the SARS-CoV and the four Community HCOV (see HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small subgroup of serious COVID-19 cases is also observed as in the case of SARS-COV infection, although the proportion is lowly lower.
Finally, as other HCOVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be deceived in samples.
However, the features of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, his pathogenity and sustainability after transmission to man will have an impact on the last destination of the current COVID epidemic.
The four Community HCVs caused moderate symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
In other words, both could be the survivors of the previous HCOV pandemics.
In order to produce this, HCOVs should be re-explicated in humans in a sufficient proportion to allow the accumulation of adaptive changes that comply with the host limit factors.
In this option, more SARS-CoV-2 epidemia continues and more the number of infections is important, there is more chances that the virus is completely adapted to humans.
If it is correct, his transmission between men will be difficult to stop by a quartenine or other infectious control measures.
For many years, the four CoV acquired in community are circulated within the population, starting a simple rhythm in immunocompetent subjects.
These viruses do not need to save animals.
However, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, high pathogens, have not been well adapted to man and their transmission between men is not sustainable.
They must maintain and propago in their zoonotic reservations and seek an opportunity to reach human target potential, probably through one or more intermediate and simplified hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 presents similar characteristics to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four HCOV acquired in community.
However, it is more pathogen than acquired HCOV in community and less pathogenic than SARS-Cov or MERS-CoV.
It is still to see if it will be completely adapted to human beings and will circulate among these latest without animal accommodation or reserve.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCOV, we will be able to discuss the definitions and features of the evolutionary, natural hosts, reservoirs, intermediaries and HCOV simplifications.
An evolutionary host service of HCOV is opening a nearly sharing a high-level homology at the level of nucleody sequence.
The origin virus has often been adapted and is not pathogenic for its host.
Similarly, a host opens HCOV in a continuous and long term.
Instead, HCOVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish a long-term deficit.
In that case, the intermediary host becomes a natural reserve host.
In particular, since 80% of the animals of the Guangzhou market present anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibilities that several smaller mammals may also be excluded can also be excluded.
These suuri keys are positive to the anti-SARS-CoV anti-corps and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These studies have put the basis of a new concept that the sugar keys are the hosts of emergent human pathogenes.
The enzyme of conversion of human angiotensine 2 (ACE2) is known as SARS-CoV receptor.
Despite high homology among these two viruss, it is generally estimated that WIV1 is not the immediate parent of SARS-CoV and that suuri keys are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
That's why the suicide keys cannot be the intermediate reserve of MERS-CoV.
In addition, studies carried out in the Middle East showed that the drugs were severe to specific antibodies that neutralize the MERS-CoV, as well as the mid-east chamels presented in several African countries.
In addition, infected chamels exceed the virus not only by respiratory ways but also by fecale way, which also represents the main way of excretion of sugar chairs.
We cannot exclude the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even less important than that which separates the coV animals associated with SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-2 of the pangolin.
Recombination is a significant factor of the evolution of the CoV beasts.
Scientists remain divided on the immediate zoonotic origin of the SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to high pathogenic HCOV, the zoonotic origins of HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-HKU1 have also been studied.
The phylogenic evidence indicates that HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-229E could both be issued from the sucres CoV, while the parent virus of HCOV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1 were found in ringers.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E was genetically associated with another Shuttle CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, whereas cameras were also suspected to be intermediary hosts.
When HCOV-OC43 was cut off the species barrier to infect humans from housebird around 1890, a respiratory infection pandemia was reported.
The history of the inter-specific transmission of HCOV-229E is less clear.
The HCOV-229E key-coVs close to HCOV-229E were found.
First, in contrast to the alpagas, men may have a contact with the sugar keys in a shared environmental neck.
Instead, people have close contacts with alpagas.
Then, the alpha-CoV of the suurie chair appeared in HCOV-229E are many and non pathogenes in sular chairs, while Alpaga's alpha-CoV alpha caused respiratory disease epidemia in infected animals.
Finally, the Alpaga alpha-CoV alpha has not been found in wild animals.
In fact, the sugar keys are the direct source of human pathogenic virus, including raw virus, Ebola virus, Nipala virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprised that the suuri keys can be transmitted directly to humans.
Another possibility, while the Alpha CV of the Southern Key will serve genetic reserve of HCOV-229E, alpagas and droiders could serve intermediary hosts that transmit to human virus, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of the inter-South-South Keys transmission to drugs and human drugs.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV found in the South-South keys is known by its initial identification and has also been strengthened by later discovery.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV is present in drugs since decades.
It has been well adapted in these rooms that have passed from intermediate hosts to stable natural reserve.
In contrast to the role of chameals in transmission of MERS-CoV, pangolins role in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2, if they have one, it is different.
In particular, pangolin CoV beasts are highly pathogeneous in pangolins.
several inter-specific transmission possibilities for human animals have been included or excluded from future studies.
First, the suuri keys could be the host's reserve of a virus apparent to SARS-CoV-2 almost identical with SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share an ecological nickel with the sugar keys through decoration or carbon mines.
Secondly, pangolins could be one of intermediate amplificator hosts with which a virus related to ±S-CoV-2 has been recently introduced.
Humans contract the virus by decoration and consumption of meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, can be sensitive to SARS-CoV-2.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the recombination and adjustment of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred within a third species that have been contacted with sugar keys and pangolins.
Research on animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 are undergoing.
Compared to other simple ARN viruses, the estimated COV change rates could be considered as "modified" to "high" with a average substitution rate of ~10-4 replacements per year by site, according to the CV adaptation phase to the new hosts.
However, CoV change rates are about a million times higher than those of their hosts.
Furthermore, the change rate is often high when the coVs are not well adapted to the host.
With regard to SARS-CoV, having a high variation rate, the change rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a human adjustment rate higher.
It can be suggested that it has already been adapted to another guest near the humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this applies also to MERS-CoV, which has been well adapted to drugs.
In theory, it is unlikely that genetic decrease makes vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 inefficients in short terms.
Thirdly, CoVs are random and frequently changing models in the replication of the NRA through a single "copie selection mechanism".
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination were found both for HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, as well as for animal coVs, such as SL-COV and BACOV-HK9.
Virus interaction in connection with transmission
Besides these three viral factors above, the viral interaction with a host receiver is another key factor that affects inter-specific transmission.
The recombination of the SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example here; it also shows evidence of positive selection during inter-specific transmission episodes.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be key factors of the adaptation of the virus to the human.
It is interesting to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellal receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the protein S1 unit means that this protein S can have been changed with human ACE2.
Indeed, an electronic chryomicroscopie study indicates an affinity of 10 to 20 times above this connection compared to the observed between human ACE2 and SARS-COV protein.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-receptor can be required for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Hence, HCOV-NL63 is also linked to ACE2 but with a different part of protein S.
There are many other HCOV receptives, such as anopeptide N for HCOV-229E, and sulic 9-O-accetyted suicide for HCOV-OC43.
The diversity of hosted proteins between humans and natural reserves of HCOVs, such as sugar chains, droids and ringers, could be a barrier to inter-specific transmission.
New HCOV emergency: return to the start case
The diversity of the Suuri key CoVs offers many opportunities for emergency of new HCOVs.
In this sense, the Suuri Key CoVs are genetic reserves of the HCOV.
Among SARS-CoV accessive proteins, ORF8 was considered important in human adjustment, since the SARS-CoV was isolated, but codified different ORF8 proteins.
This removes ORF8 in ORF8a and ORF8b and is pressed as a adaptive change that promotes host change.
Recombination sites have also been identified in Nsp9, most of the nsp10 and some Nsp14.
Similarly, it was demonstrated that the epidemic of MERS-CoV has known recombination episodes between different lines, which were produced in Dromears in Saudi Arabia.
While an ORF4 could be observed in the virus of the sugar chair and the chameau associated with HCOV-229E, the alpha coV alpaga presents a simple insertion of nucleoid, generating a decay of the read framework.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCOV is also stimulated by selective pressure operated in their hosts.
Asmptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when the sugar keys were infected by CoV, indicating mutual adjustment between CoVs and South Keys.
It seemed that the suurie keys were well adapted to CoV on anatomic and physiological point of view.
For example, anonyms in the activation of pro-inflammary response in suuri keys reduce effectively the pathology deployed by CoVs.
Furthermore, the high level of reactive oxygen (DRO) generated by the high metabolic activity of sugar keys could both remove the replication of the CoV and affect the "relection" by extrobonuclease, which would create a selective pressure and give place to high- pathogenic viral skins when they are introduced in a new host.
More pathogenic cows could also be developed by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics intended for the adaptation of the host.
Thus, it is not an accident if three new HCOV has appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are not pathogenic or caused moderate symptoms in their hosts to reserve such as sucres and chambers.
They are firmly replied without causing a strong immune response to the host.
Here is the resident of the secrets of observing asymptomatic portors and the cause of serious infection in humans.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactiveness of immune response and cytokinic shock; more immune response is strong, more pulmonary lessons are severe.
However, in the case of asymptomatic ports, immune response was discovered from the replication of the CV.
The same strategy for the elimination of immune response could have benefits in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be benefited.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome is deteriorating in suuri keys.
According to this reason, NLRP3 inhibition with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
While a slow-south-coV beast shared by 95% nucleody homologology with SARS-CoV has been found, there is also a sudow coV that shares 96% of nucleody homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Beasts of pangolin-CoV have been discovered with SARS-CoV-2, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin CoV animals could contribute to the genetic fragments of the final SARS-CoV-2 version.
CoVs have been returned under the fire of the rape because of the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the droid for a long time.
These rooms are an important means of transport and a large source of meat, milk, coal and milk for locals.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to save all rooms to control MERS, as it was done on the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the propagation of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop MRS's recurrent epidemics, a global approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MRS-COV in chambers, associated with other infectious control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could evacuate and cause epidemics.
several zoonotic coVs circle in nature.
In particular, the slow-souris CoV, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
The culture of wild animal consumption in certain Chinese regions should be abandoned in order to reduce inutile contacts between human and animals.
In fact, many viruses exist on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reserves until a contagion opportunity is presented.
A continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of CoV and their natural guests, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective means for human prevention of viral filosofs is to keep away from the environmental necks of natural zoonoses.
First, if the suuri keys transmit a parent virus from SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it would be interesting to observe the same environmental nickel and pangolins.
Secondly, if the suouris keys play a more direct role in the transmission to the human, it should be necessary to determine how humans enter into contact with the suurious keys.
Thirdly, if a third mother plays the role of real intermediary host, it is still clear how it interacts with the different species, including men, sugar chairs and pangolins.
If it is a sugar key, a pangolin or another mammalry, it should be possible to identify SARS-CoV-2 or the parent-identified virus observed in their natural guests.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as grip or rhythm, for example, to smell the hands before touching the eyes, nausea or mouth (e.g. mournings).
The main medical goal of hand lavage is to eliminate pathogen agents (bacteria, virus or other microorgans that may cause diseases) and chemical products that may be harmful or cause diseases.
The lavage of hands has many benefits for health, including the reduction of the propagation of grip, coronavirus and other infected diseases; prevention of infectious causes of diarhy; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as the reduction in child mortality rates in household accommodation.
In developing countries, children's mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrey may be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes such as the lavage of hands.
The pneumonia, one of the main IRA, is the first cause of mortality in children under five years of age, which makes nearly 1,8 million victims per year.
Similarly, diarrey and pneumonia lead about 3.5 million children each year.
The lavage of the hands also protects the empire, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Mineral effects, the frequencies lavage of hands can skin up by causeing cut-off.
A Danish study of 2012 showed that excessive hand lavage could lead to the ezema or demotitis at the level of hands, characterized by a squamed skin and demangeous skin, and especially frequent in health workers.
The too frequent lavage of hands is also considered as one of the symptoms of compulsory obsessional disorder (TOC).
The disappearing twice a year, associated with daily lavage of hands in the savan and daily brossage of dents with fluored dentists, is in the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The main action of knowledge and detergence is to reduce solution barriers and increase solution.
The only water is not an effective cleaner for skin because lipides and proteins, which are organic materials of the ground, are difficultly solved in the water.
The solid savine, because of its reuseable nature, can refer to bacteria about previous uses.
There is no evidence to suggest that the use of recommended anti-septics or desinfects allows to target antibiotics in nature.
Therefore, even though antibiotic skins are not the fruit of antibacteria, these lasts may not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the tensioactive and skin protection agent, the most complex forms can contain acids (actic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) to regulate the pH, benzoic acid, with antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe, vitamins, mental, extracts of plants).A rigorous analysis of the Oregon Public Health School has indicated that the ordinary samples were effective as well as the antibactrics used for special and triclos, to prevente diseases and the skinning of main diseases.
The warm water used to lacquer the hands is not sufficiently heat to kill bacteria.
The bacteria is much more faster than the body temperature (37 °C).
However, the tea and sweet water is more effective than the cold and sweet water to eliminate natural oils of salt and bacteria.
However, in contrast with popular faith, scientific studies showed that the use of tea water was not contributed to reduce microbian load on the hands.
A desinfectant or an antiseptic for hands is a non-heated hygiene product.
Most are formulated on the basis of isopropylic alcohol or ethanol associated with a divided agent such as carbon (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a gelo, or to a humidity such as glycerine to obtain a liquid or museum for a greater use facility and reduce the effect of alcohol.
Diluted hydrogen peroxide increases the antimicrobial activity.The desinfectants for hands containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol are effectively eliminating the gemees.
The hydro-alcohol solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and some virus (HIV, Herpes, VRS, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), and champions.
Hydro-alcohol solutions are almost entirely inefficient against norovirus (or Norwalk), the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis. A sufficient quantity of desinfecting for hands or hydro-alcolic solution must be used to move or cover both hands.
The increased use of these products is due to their use facility and rapid elimination activities of microorgans; however, they do not need to replace a suitable hand lavage if you do not have water and save in hands.
The frequency use of hydrocole solutions may result in a cut-off disappearing if the formula is not strengthened by emollants and/or skin hydroatric agents.
The adverse effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding to glucerine and/or other emolyans to the formula.
In clinical trials, the hydro-alcohol solutions containing emolytics have undergone clearly less irritation and cut-up sequence than antimicrobial detergents.
The allergical contact demativity, contact urtic or hypersensibility to alcohol or additives present in alcoholic solutions are rare.
In spite of their effectiveness, non-water products do not eliminate organic materials on the hands, but only desinfect them.
This is why desinfects for hands are not so effective as saving and water to avoid the propagation of many pathogenic agents, since these are still on the hands.
The efficiency of alcoholless hands depends strongly on ingredients and forms, and has always been clearly lower than alcohol and alcohol desinfectants.
More recently, the formulas used by benzalconium chlorure presented a sustainable and cumulative antimicrobial activity after the application, at the difference in alcohol, with the efficiency after repeated use, probably due to progressive progressive reactions.
The cemetery or the earth can be more efficient than the water only, but less than they save it.
If the earth or cemetery is contaminated by microorganismes, it may increase the propagation of diseases instead of frozening it.
The snake is also a desinfective agent because, in contact with water, it forms an alcaline solution.
WHO recommends cedar or sand as an alternative when it is not available.
Move your hands with the current water teed or cold.
The current water is recommended because of the risk of polluting water points, while water temperature seems not to be different.
Make a generous quantity of salt on the hands by frozen the one against the other, without forgetting the dust of the hands, between the fingers and under the legs.
Savine eliminates skin hermes, and studies show that people tend to lay their hands more carefully when they use savings than with water.
Frotter for at least 20 seconds.
The frotter action is created from the friction, which helps to eliminate the skin grums, and frozen more longer to remove more germs.
Get too much to the current water.
The blending in a staining water basin can lead to the recovery of the hands.
Search with a clean or air-friendly service.
Mood and humid hands are easier recognised.The most often forgotten zones are the pocket, the bridge, the spaces between the dogs and the bottom of the nails.
The artificial sheets and the scattered sheets can hide microorgans.
A hydrating lotion is often recommended to avoid having seed hands; cottage sequence promotes the appearance of coated lesions that can increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to lay the hands when the rabbit water and/or savan is not available, for example, to cover the water of a soft and perceived vessel and/or use it if necessary, in developing countries.The situations where water supply is limited (e.g. in schools or rural areas of developing countries), there are solutions to economize the water, such as “pipe-taps” and other economic options.
A tip-tap is a simple technology that uses a suspended cross using a corde, and a pedale that allows to save a small amount of water on the hands and a salt pan.
The effective hand seal is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to throw your hands in the public toilets is being discussed.
More research suggests that paper services are much more hygienical than electric sechs than often found in the toilets.
After the lavage and the seal of hands at warm air, it was shown that the total number of bacteria increased in the average 194% on the dog pulp and 254% on the palms.
A average increase in the total number of bacteria on dentists of 42 per cent and 15 per cent of the palms.
Following the hands, the following variations of the bacterial number were observed:
There are many different sequestrian manufacturers, and the seachs have been compared to the sequence using paper serviettes.
The lavage of hands with desinfect rings is an alternative solution during the movement, in the absence of salt and water.
Hydrocarbonal solutions should contain at least 60 % of alcohol.
There are electronic devices that escape reminders when hospital personnel forgot to lay the hands.
The medical lavage of the hands must last at least 15 seconds by using a generous quantity of salt and water or glass to move and frozen each part of the hands.
The hands must be frozen against the other by passing between the fingers.
After the seat, the paper service must be used to close the robin (and open the output door if appropriate).
The goal of hand lavaging in health structures is to remove pathogen microorgans (hermes) and to avoid their transmission.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby and al.
After an exposure to blood/a biological liquid;
before a aseptic geste; and
All jewels must be removed.
In the context of this procedure, hands and fronts should be laid up to the coast, generally for 2 to 6 minutes.
When the ring, it must be avoided that the water on the fronts goes up to the hands.
In order to reduce the propagation of germs, it is preferable to lay hands or use an anti-septic for hands before and after being occupied by a sick person.
With regard to the control of stafylocotic infections in hospitals, the main benefits of hand lavage were obtained during the first 20% of the lavage, and there was only a few additional benefits to increase the frequency of hands over 35%.
More research is needed to discover what is the most efficient interventions in different health structures.
For example, in the largest part of rural Africa, it is rarely to find routines to lay the hands near the private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options to build hand lavage stations.
However, low hand lavage rates may also be imputable to thin habits, rather than to a lack of salt or water.
Once minimum standards are reached, schools can pass from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand lavage stations can be included in hand higiene campaigns that are conducted in order to reduce child diseases and mortality.
The World Day of Hands is another example of awareness campaign that aims to promote the evolution of conduct.
However, a revue suggests that the promotion of the lavage of hands on the salt is quite more sensitive than other water and sanitation interventions.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to the fetidian shoes called mysm.
For example, in Germany shows the “good hand lavage techniques” were placed next to the ships in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The expression "wear the hands" refers to the refusal of a person to take the responsibility or to be complied with something.
Furthermore, those who are allowed to lay their hands after such thoughts are less strict to deliver to other compensatory measures of “purification”, such as the beneficiary.
Similarly, hindousism, buddhism, cykhism, judealism and Islam require the lacquering hands before and after each feet.

It should also be stressed that artificial selection can contribute to involuntary changes in viral genes, which are very likely to be followed by the pressures performed during the selection, in particular by the host immunity system.
For example, the loss of ORF4 can be quoted in the HCoV-229E prototype sugar, due to a deletion of two nucleotics.
While an ORF4 could be observed in the virus of the sugar chair and the chameau associated with HCOV-229E, the alpha coV alpaga presents a simple insertion of nucleoid, generating a decay of the read framework.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCOV is also stimulated by selective pressure operated in their hosts.
Asmptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when the sugar keys were infected by CoV, indicating mutual adjustment between CoVs and South Keys.
It seemed that the suurie keys were well adapted to CoV on anatomic and physiological point of view.
For example, anonyms in the activation of pro-inflammary response in suuri keys reduce effectively the pathology deployed by CoVs.
Furthermore, the activity of natural killing cells in the sugar keys is removed by the positive regulation of the receptor inhibiting natural mortal cells NKG2/CD94 and by the low speed rate of expression of the major history complex of class I.
Furthermore, the high level of reactive oxygen (DRO) generated by the high metabolic activity of sugar keys could both remove the replication of the CoV and affect the "relection" by extrobonuclease, which would create a selective pressure and give place to high- pathogenic viral skins when they are introduced in a new host.
More pathogenic cows could also be developed by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics intended for the adaptation of the host.
Thus, it is not an accident if three new HCOV has appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are not pathogenic or caused moderate symptoms in their hosts to reserve such as sucres and chambers.
They are firmly replied without causing a strong immune response to the host.
Here is the resident of the secrets of observing asymptomatic portors and the cause of serious infection in humans.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactiveness of immune response and cytokinic shock; more immune response is strong, more pulmonary lessons are severe.
However, in the case of asymptomatic ports, immune response was discovered from the replication of the CV.
The same strategy for the elimination of immune response could have benefits in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
The answer to the interferon is especially strong in the South-Souris keys.
Thus, the administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be benefited.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome is deteriorating in suuri keys.
According to this reason, NLRP3 inhibition with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 has appeared after the general scheme, by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were embarked.
While a slow-south-coV beast shared by 95% nucleody homologology with SARS-CoV has been found, there is also a sudow coV that shares 96% of nucleody homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While civets and other animals on the market were discovered as identical virus portators at SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate SARS-CoV-2 host has been identified.
Beasts of pangolin-CoV have been discovered with SARS-CoV-2, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin CoV animals could contribute to the genetic fragments of the final SARS-CoV-2 version.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that the human SARS-CoV-2 has been designed, that it is voluntary or accidentally.
CoVs have been returned under the fire of the rape because of the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of the CoVs in the South and other animals has strongly changed our perception of the role playing in zoonotic origins and animal reserves in the transmission of HCOV to humans.
Many factual data showed that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 come from the summer key and are transmitted to man through intermediate hosts.
Since the infection in the SARS-CoV originates from the contact between human and market civets, the closure of free products markets and the assault of the civilians who were found there would have been an effective end to SARS epidemia.
Following the same reason, pangolines should be removed from the costs products markets to avoid transmission of zoonos, taking into account the discovery of many co-co-lines of pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to man by pangolines and other mammals and, where appropriate, how this transmission will be produced, will remain determined in the studies that will follow.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the droid for a long time.
These rooms are an important means of transport and a large source of meat, milk, coal and milk for locals.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to save all rooms to control MERS, as it was done on the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the propagation of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop MRS's recurrent epidemics, a global approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MRS-COV in chambers, associated with other infectious control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could evacuate and cause epidemics.
several zoonotic coVs circle in nature.
In particular, the slow-souris CoV, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
The opportunities are not missing to evolution and recovery of these zoonotic CoVs, resulting in the emergence of new transmissible and/or mortal CoVs in the future.
The culture of wild animal consumption in certain Chinese regions should be abandoned in order to reduce inutile contacts between human and animals.
With the ravages caused by COS, MERS and COVID-19, it should be established a better plan for preparation and intervention.
In fact, many viruses exist on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reserves until a contagion opportunity is presented.
While the sugar keys present many features that are favorable to disseminate virus, the probability for human being in contact with the sugar and other wild species can be minimised if people are sensitive to the need to keep themselves away.
A continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of CoV and their natural guests, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective means for human prevention of viral filosofs is to keep away from the environmental necks of natural zoonoses.
Not yet all the secrets of the zoonotic origin of the COV-2 are known.
First, if the suuri keys transmit a parent virus from SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it would be interesting to observe the same environmental nickel and pangolins.
Secondly, if the suouris keys play a more direct role in the transmission to the human, it should be necessary to determine how humans enter into contact with the suurious keys.
Thirdly, if a third mother plays the role of real intermediary host, it is still clear how it interacts with the different species, including men, sugar chairs and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, are likely to contract SARS-CoV-2, it should be conducted both at an experimental monitoring and pollution.
If it is a sugar key, a pangolin or another mammalry, it should be possible to identify SARS-CoV-2 or the parent-identified virus observed in their natural guests.
Research in this area will enable the evolutional path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and have significant impact on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
A update of the "subspective cases" and "confirmated cases" of COVID-19 is required
On 6 February 2020, our team published a fast recommendation directive for diagnosis and the treatment of the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCOV), and this Directive described our experience and provides references to combating this pandemic at global level.
However, coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease is recent, our knowledge and knowledge gradually progress on the basis of the results of current studies and experience of clinical practice; therefore, the diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this mail, we have responded to a comment on our directives, and we have provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for a "subspective" case and a "confirmed case" in accordance with the last guidelines of COVID-19 (seventh version) published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCOV) caused epidemia that now officially brings the name of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus was called a severe respiratory syndrome to coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO qualified the COVID-19 pandemic.
To be able to fight SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has made a rapid recommendation that was published online on military medical research on 06 February 2020.
She took much attention since her publication.
However, please note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our knowledge and our knowledge are slightly progressing on the basis of the results of current studies and experience of clinical practice; therefore, the diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment guidelines published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) have known seven editions from 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020, which have been substantially changed.
Our directive received a comment from Zhou and al., these recently presented a simple evaluation proposal on the basis of their clinical experience.
Their work has made new evidence for our directive and are also a valuable reference for this world pandemic.
We approve their important work and thank you for them.
However, their work should also be updated in accordance with the last COVID diagnostic and treatment directives (seventh test) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), the confirmation of a suspect case must be associated with one of the elements of epidemiological anti-episode with two elements of clinical manifestations to form a complete analysis, or must match three elements of clinical manifestations in the absence of clear epidemiological events:
Epidemiological antiques: (1) a travel or residence in the city of Whan and in the neighbouring areas or in other communities where COVID-19 had been reported during the last 14 days before the symptoms appearing; (2) an anxiety of contact with infected cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test of nuclear acids) ; (3) an overview of contact with patients with fibre or symptoms of the city of Whan or neighbouring areas or other communities where COV-19 cases have been reported during the last 14 days before the appearance of symptoms; (4) a contact of the U.S.A.A.A.S.A.S.A.S.A.A.A.A., S.A.S.A.S.A./S.A.A.S.A.A. (S.)
Clinical diagnostics : (1) fibre and/or respiratory symptoms ; (2) images with the characters of COVID-19 infection ; (3) total white globe numbering indicating a normal, reduced or reduced lymphocytes number since the beginning of symptoms.
The confirmed case diagnostic should be supported with any of the following pathological or serological evidence: (1) a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the whole viral genome with a strong homogeneity with the new known coronavirus; (3) positive serial tests for IgM and IgG of SARS-CoV-2 anticorps; or amending the specific IgG anticorps of SARS-CoV-2 passing to positive or increased title 4 times in the phase of recovery.
We can see that the PCR in real time test of nuclear acids in respiratory ways or blood precipitations has been added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third edition (22 January 2020).
The pathogenic detection of blood injuries was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and the fifth edition (8 February 2020) and then the seventh series was added.
These changes are supported by the continuing work of researchers to find a optimal kit of nucleic acids for rapid diagnostics, as well as samples of respiratory ways including blood precipitation, with increased availability of different specimens, and contributed to the use of the positive result of the specific anticorps in the confirmed criteria.
Furthermore, more evidence reminds us of cautiousness about typical symptoms and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the graphic representation of Zhou and al. should be updated since they classified people who did not present clinical symptoms as “low risk”.
The evaluation system must also be checked in clinical practice and in future studies.
To conclude, we hope the emergence of more direct evidence and ask readers to submit their comments.
With regard to the diagnostic of "confirmed cases" and "confirmated cases", we suggest that they follow and respect the most recent directives in their country.
Our team will also update our directive to provide its help.
Bangladesh announces five new deaths related to COVID-19, a daily record
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths related to COVID-19 in one day.
The country thus records a mortality record because of the virus in one day.
Today, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Monitoring and Research (IEDCR) stated that the number of registered contaminated persons included 114 active cases and 33 healthy persons, which remained in the household.
A total of 17 deaths were registered.
The closure of public transport began on 26 March and ended Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential goods (medicational, fuel and food) was always authorized.
On March 19, these three people were already rebuilding.
Thursday, the total number of cases of infection by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus exceeded the million in the world, according to the Johns Hopkins University's data.
In the world, countries have announced more strict measures to prevent disease propagation.
Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the master of Moscow, extended the confidence of the city until 1 May.
Parliament of Portugal voted to extend the national emergency status of 15 days; the vote was adopted with 215 votes, 10 abstentions and a vote against.
Sonotic origins of human coronavirus
Severe respiratory syndrome (SRAS) and the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS) tended to see how a HCOV infection could be devastating and potentially mortal.
Most of the HCOV are keys where they are not pathogenic.
The intermediary hosts of some HCOV are also known.
The identification of animal guests has direct implications in human disease prevention.
The study of the coV-hôte interactions in animals could also enable better understanding of the CV in humans.
According to the differences in the protein sequences, the coVs are classified in four types (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV). The type of Beta-CoV contains the majority of HCOV and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenic evidence showed that the sugar keys and ringers play the genetic source role for most Alpha CoV and CoV beasts, while the birds are the main preserving coV gamma and delta coV.
To this day, seven human coV (HCOV) are known.
Among them, HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five coV beasts include HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-COV) and SARS-CoV-2.
The trace of the zoonotic origins of the HCOV provides a framework to understand natural history, motor forces and restrictive factors of the striking of species barrier.
It can also guide or facilitate the research of the host(s) reserve, intermediate and simplified SARS-CoV-2 hosts, with significant impacts in the prevention of future containers.
The animal coVs are known since the end of the 1930s.
Over the last decades, seven HCOV has been identified.
The first skin of HCOV-229E was isolated in the respiratory ways of patients with higher respiratory ways in 1966, and then was adjusted to grow in WI-38 pulmonary cells.
Patients infected by HCOV-229E presented symptoms of classic rhythm, including headbreaks, eternalities, males and grain skins, with fiber and sweat observed in 10-20% of the cases.
HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 are all present worldwide, and they seem to be mainly transmissed in winter, in temperature climate countries.
The stories in Australia reduce the amounts of toilet paper limits by purchase
Thursday and Saturday night, the Australian Wolworths and Coles store chain reduced their tuval paper purchase restrictions to two and a shopping package in all shops at national level, respectively.
Monday, ALDI also introduced a limit of a package.
These limits have been shown in the form of messages in the boxes and on the Facebook chains pages.
The buyers apparently massed reserves by fear of COVID-19 and the need to be confined.
Mercredi, Woolworths has also limited toilet paper purchases for home delivery to a command package.
These measures followed the previous limitation of four packages by purchase introduced by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March respectively.
Coles, in his press communication on 8 March, stated that with the limitation of four packages in force, “o many shops are still in stock rupture in the hour following the delivery” and qualified the request of “no previous”, while ALDI, in an Facebook publication on Tuesday, qualificated it "unexpectedly".
The sales conveyed a strong increase in the last week, according to a Woolworths' talking door.
The Costco shop in Canberra also limited the quantity allowed to two packages last week.
In order to reduce the debt, Coles commanded larger packages to providers and increased the delivery frequency, Woolworths commanded an additional stock, while ALDI had already available stocks for a merger planned promotion.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Detailers Association, stated that the detaillers are trying to increase stocks, but that the local counsel restrictions regarding vehicle delivery hours make it difficult.
It provides an increase in production costs, while suppliers try to respond to the request and less promoting.
Mardi, ALDI announced that after the pre-deblocation of stocks, some shops are not able to honor the promotion of mercury.
In a article published on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, experts from the Queensland Technology University of Technology, explained that shops are reapproving stocks every night.
It has noted that the toilet paper is a volumed article, involving stocks of a reduced quantity that, once slowed, leaves large white spaces in radios, strengthening the impression of a penis.
“Coles and Woolworths consider [which] if radiations are full, if products such as toilet paper rolls and desinfectants may be [awarded] and are available in large quantities, this will probably reduce panic,” explained Russell Roomman in ABC News.
The toilet paper manufacturer recycling Who Gives a Crap declared last Wednesday that they were in stock rupture.
Kimberly-Clark, who produces the Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris paper that produces the Sorbent paper, stressed that they worked 24/7 to maintain the supply, according to News.com.au article.
Domain.com, a real estate site, indicated that some buyers of real estate goods were offering free toilet paper at the first buyer in Melbourne, while less than sales to buyers were organized because the buyers were sold in the long weekend of the Working party.
The NT News edition, a daily newspaper in Darwin, included eight pages to be discovered and used as a toilet paper.
The stories were first refusal to impose restrictions, according to a report of 3 March by ABC Australia, in which they announced that they were not expected to introduce purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also had a strong request, including masks, desinfectants, sectic products, hygiene products for hands and fat.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed Sunday night that the British online supermarket Ocado limited toilet paper purchases Andres to two packs of 12 ruleles.
The World Health Organization qualified the COVID-19 pandemic
Mercredi, the World Health Organization (OMS) has qualified the current COVID-19 epidemic (the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2) pandemic coronavirus.
While the word “pandemia” refers only to the degree of dissemination of disease, and not to the danger of specific cases, WHO indicated the need to put Governments into action:
"All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries decentralize, test, treat, isolate, localize and mobilize their populations in the context of the answer,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the WHO.
"We are very concerned, not only by the alarming levels of propagation and gravity, but also by the alarming levels of inaction."
According to Dr Tom Peace, the former Director of the Centres for Control and Prevention of Diseases in the United States, pandemics are “not previously. ”
He declared, in the proposals published by CNN in February, that "no other respiratory virus has been observed from his appearance until its continued propagation on the world level."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, declaring that “We have never been witnessed from a pandemic caused by a coronavirus.”
What he added, “and we have never been witnessed from a pandemic that could be managed at the same time.”
The new pandemic status has followed the WHO decision in January to declare epidemic emergency of international public health.
The director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectional Diseases in the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said epidemia: “In order to make a short, the situation will impede.”
On Thursday, Associated Press announced that at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 were in the world, with over 4 600 deaths.
The pandemic of coronavirus 2019-20 is a coronavirus disease epidemic since 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe respiratory syndrome of the coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2).
The epidemic was detected in Whan, China, in December 2019, declared an emergency of international port health on 30 January 2020 and recognized as pandemic on 11 March 2020.
On April 10, 2020, about 1,61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territorys, resulting in about 97,000 deaths.
About 364.000 people are healed.
The letality rate is estimated to 4 per cent in China, while in the rest of the world it varies from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
Current symptoms include fiber, all and smooth.
The complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time between the exposure and the appearance of symptoms is generally about five days, but it can strike between two and fourty days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is a symptomatic and support therapy. Recommendated preventive measures include the lacking of hands, opening the mouth, staying away from other people, and monitoring and confidence of suspected persons to be infected.
The world's authorities reacted by establishing restrictions on movement, quarantaines, cups, risk controls on workplaces and establishments.
Pandemia has generated serious socio-economic disorders at the global level, report or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events, as well as generally aggregated losses of panic purchase.
Schools and universities have been closed at the national or local level in 193 countries, touching nearly 99.4 per cent of the world student population.
False information on virus has been circulated on the Internet, and the incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred towards China, other people of origin and appearance Asian and South-East Asia, as well as other people coming from regions with many cases of virus.
Because of the reduction of travels and closures in the heavy industry, there was a reduction in the air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Whan, China (the capital of the Hubei Province) reported a home of unbelieved pneumonia cases on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was opened early January 2020.
Most of the cases were linked to the huanan sea fruit market and, therefore, the virus would be a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused epidemia is called SARS-CoV-2, a recent and closely linked to the coronavirus of the sugar chains, the pangolin coronavirus, and the SARS-CoV. After that, the first known person who had presented symptoms was deceived on 1 December 2019, and this person had not shown link to the following home of the free product market.
In the case of the first home reported in December 2019, the two thirds had had a market link.
On 13 March 2020, an uncontrolled South China Morning Post report suggested that the first case could return to 17 November 2019, in a person of 55 years of the Hubei province. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as the new cases seemed to be decreased in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceededed the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There could be a strong sub-stimation of cases, including those with blessed symptoms.
On February 26, relatively few cases were reported among young people, 19 years and less than 2,4 per cent of the cases in the world. The United Kingdom Chief Scientist Patrick Vallance estimated that 60 per cent of the British population had to be infected before they could reach an effective collective immunity.
The cases are designated by the number of people tested in COVID-19 and the test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
On 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and many countries have been in official policies to not test those who had only blessed symptoms such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
One study published on 16 March revealed that, up to 23 January, the COVID-19 infections were estimated by 86 per cent, and that these non-registered infections were the source of 79 per cent of the documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the reported cases.
The first estimates of the basic reproduction rate (R0) of COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the Centres for Control and Prevention of Diseases in the United States concluded that it could be 5,7.
Most people at COVID-19 are curated.
For those who do not cure, the time between the appearance of symptoms and death is between 6 and 41 days, the most common one is 14 days.
On 10 April 2020, nearly 97 000 deaths have been inflicted to COVID-19.
In China, on 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths had been more than 60 years, and 75 per cent suffered preexistent health problems such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. The official accounts of COVID-related diseases are generally referring to deceased persons who have been tested with COVID positively according to official protocols.
The number of real victims of COVID-19 could be much higher, since it could not include non-tested persons, such as households, in retrait houses, etc.
Partial data from Italy shows that the overlife rates during pandemic are 4-5 times higher than the official COVID mortality decount.
A speaking port of the Centres for Control and Prevention of Diseases in the United States (CDC) acknowledged: “We know that [the number of announced deaths] is underestimated,” a statement confirmed by the anecdotic reports of sub-evaluation in the United States. A such sub-session is often produced at pandemics, such as sugar influenza epidemia H1N1 2009. The first confirmed death occurred in Whan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside China was held on February 1st in the Philippians, and the first death outside Asia was held in France on 14 February.
On February 28, outside the continental China, more than twenty-five deaths per country were registered in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
On March 13, more than 40 countries and territories had reported deaths on all continents except Antarctics, and several indicators are used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary according to regions and with time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the therapeutic options, the time from the start of epidemia, as well as the demographic characteristics such as age, gender and especially health. The case report represents the number of deaths separated by the number of cases diagnosed in a given period.
According to Johns-Hopkins University Statistics, the world case report is 6.0 per cent (97 039/1 617 204) to 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, the estimates of the case report reduced from 17.3 per cent (for the symptoms occurred between 1 and 10 January 2020) to 0.7 per cent (for the symptoms appeared after 1 February 2020), and other indicators are the rate of legitimacy (legality), which represents the percentage of diagnosed persons who succeed to a disease, and the infection rate (infection rates), which represents the percentage of containment (diagnosis and diagnosis).
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of disease.
Several scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of the University of Oxford believes that pandemic infection rate in its globality is 0.1% to 0.39%.
The highest value of this flat is coherent with the results of the first randomised COVID-19 tests in Germany, and a statistical study analyzing the impact of tests on the latality rate estimates.
WHO supports the control of pandemics.
The pic and final duration of epidemia are incertain and can vary by region.
Maciej Boni from the State University of Pennsylvania stated: "No controls, generally infected epidemias are stabilized and then start to regret when disease comes to lack available hosts.
But it is almost impossible to make relevant previsions today at the time that this will happen."
The chief medical advisor of the Chinese government Zhong Nanshan stated that “It could be completed from June” if all countries are able to mobilize to follow WHO's recommendations on measures to address virus propagation.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski from London University of Hygiene & amp; Tropical Medicine declared that SARS-CoV-2 "is going to continue to circulate, potentially for a year or two."
According to a study of the Imperial College conducted by Neil Ferguson, a physical distance and other measures will be needed “toce a vaccine is available (as far as possible, 18 months or more).
William Schaffner from the University of Vanderbilt said: "I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus, because it's very easy to transmit himself, is completely disappeared" and that "that could be transformed into seasonal disease, which may be reopening every year."
The virulence of this return would depend on the collective immunity and the extensive change.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are sometimes unspecific, and infected persons may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and seed towels (68%).
Current symptoms include fatigue, respiratory secreations (mucosities), loss of odorat, sweat, muscular and articular pain, gorge, cephalized, frustration, harassment, hemoptysis, diarrhesis or cyanosis. WHOS states that a person in six is seriously sick and has respiratory difficulties.
The United States Control and Prevention of Diseases (CDC) reports emergency symptoms such as respiratory difficulty, pain or persistent thoracic pressure, sudain confusion, difficult waves, and face or blue lips; immediate medical care if these symptoms are presented. The post-evolution of the disease can lead to serious skin, severe respiratory syndrome, semitic, septensive choc and death.
Some infected persons may be asymptomatic, without any clinical symptom, but with test results that confirm the infection, researchers gave recommendations that persons with close contact with infected persons should be closely monitored and examined to eliminate the risk of infection.
Chinese evaluations of the asymptomatic ratio vary from some to 44 per cent.
The normal incubation period (the time between contamination and the appearance of symptoms) is oxide between one and 14 days; it is more often 5 days. Good example of incertitude, the estimation of the percentage of the COVID-19 persons who lost the odort was initially 30% before dropping up to 15%.
Some information about how the disease continues to be determined.
The disease is intended to be transmitted primarily at a closed contact and by gloves produced by all, eternity, or speaking; this approached contact corresponds to a radiation of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that everybody without protection can design boards at a distance of 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
Some suggested that the virus could also be transmitted by guittlets that would remain in the air in longer periods, which could be designed by speaking. The breathing shoes can also be designed during the expiration, including speaking, whether the virus is generally not airported.
Postillons can swim in the mouth or nak of other persons located on the side or even be inhaled in the powders.
Some medical procedures such as cardiopulmonary invasion and reanimation (RCP) may cause respiratory secreations that are pulvered and therefore lead to air propagation.
It can also recover when someone touchs a contaminated surface, including skin, before touching his eyes, nests, or mouth.
If some are afraid that it can be transmitted by the sleeves, this risk is considered to be weak.
The Chinese government excluded the possibility of a feco-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the start of symptoms, however, propagation may be possible before symptoms appear and for advanced cities of disease.
People have been tested positive to disease until three days before the incidence of symptoms suggest that transmission is possible before the development of significant symptoms.
Only some reports of asymptomatic cases confirmed in the laboratory exist, but asymptomatic transmission was detected by some countries during contact research.
The European Centre for Prevention and Diseases Control (ECDC) states that if we do not know exactly what illness is breeding, a person generally contain two to three other persons.
precisely, the virus could be detected in the threshold of three days on the plastic (polypropylene) and inoxydable acid 304 after one day on the card, and four hours on the cup.
However, this depends on humidity and temperature, and domestic animals and other animals have been tested positively in COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, but the British authorities recommend to lay their hands after touching animals, as after having been contacted with other surfaces than infected persons.
The severe respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, initially isolated in three individuals with pneumonia connected to the home of the acute respiratory disease of Whan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in the coronavirus appearing in nature. Unless human body, the virus is destroyed by domestic saving, which removes its protective support. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the initial SARS-CoV.
We think he'd be a zoonotic origin.
A genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus belonged genetically to betacoronavirus, the sub-gent Sarbecovirus (B) in combination with two shoes of sucres.
It is identical to 96 % throughout the genome of another sample of coronavirus-suuri (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one amino acid of difference in some parts of the genetic sequences between pangolin viruses and human issues.
The comparison of the whole genome was at this time a maximum of 92% of common genetic material between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is sufficient to prove that pangolins are the intermediary host.
Virus infection may be diagnosed provisionly on the basis of symptoms, however, the final confirmation is performed by inverse transmission of polymerarial reaction (RRT-PCR) of infected or scanning secretions.
A study compared to the PCR and scanner in Whan suggested that the scanner is quite sensitive than the CCR, which is less precisely, because many of its image features coincidence with other pathological pneumonies and processes.
In March 2020, the American Radiology College recommends that “the scanner is not used to deceive or as a first intention test to diagnose COVID-19”.
WHO published several ARN test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with a first partition on 17 January.
The test uses the inverse transmission of the reaction in polymerrase in real time (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed on respiratory or blood precipitations.
The results are generally available in a few hours or days.
Generally, this test is performed on a rhinopharynx precipitation but can also be used. several laboratorys and enterprises currently develop serial tests that detect anticorps.
On 6 April 2020, none of them had been sufficiently reliable to be approved for generalized use.
In the United States, a seerological test developed by Celex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratorys only.
The elements of characteristic images on radiographies and tomodensitometery (scanner) of people with symptoms include asymmetric device depolis and the absence of lacking.
The Italian Radiology Society is currently a international online database of confirmed case image results.
As a result of recovery with other infections such as adenovirus, PCR is a limited precision for detecting COVID-19.
A significant study in China compared the results of the therapy scanners to the GDP and showed that if the image is less precise for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, predicting its consideration as a detection tool in epidemic areas.
Convolutionary neurones networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect virus characteristics in the image both on radiographs and scanners.
The prevention strategies for the transmission of disease include generally have a personal hygiene, the hands are laid, avoid touching eyes, nak or mouth with unleavened hands, and switch or eternity in a swimming powder, then switch the shore directly into a powder.
It was recommended that those who had already been contaminated to bring a surgical mask in public.
Physical distance measures were also recommended to prevent transmission. Many Governments prohibited or dismissed all non-essential movements to countries and sectors affected by epidemic countries or sectors.
Nevertheless, the virus has reached the stage of Community transmission in broad areas of the planet.
This means that virus is infected in communities, and some members of these communities do not know where or how they have been contaminated. The health professionals are advised for someone who may be infected to take usual precautions and contact precautions and to bring contacts to protective lunets. Contact research is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent future transmissions.
The use of telephone localization data by Governments in this regard highlighted confidence problems with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations who publish a communication to putting restrictions to such a monitoring.
Several mobile applications have been launched or proposed on the basis of the voluntary, and from 7 April 2020 more than twenty of experts groups worked on private life solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth to register the presence of a user nearby other portable phones.
Users will then receive a message if they are closely contacted with someone who has been tested with the COVID-19. The current wrong ideas are how to prevent the infection; for example, the nest is cut and maintained with the mouth bath is not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, but many organizations are now trying to develop it.
It is advised to lay the hands to prevent the propagation of disease.
The CDC recommends people to lay their hands often in the saving and water during at least twenty seconds, especially after having been at the toilets or when the hands are visiblely salt; before eating; and after being mourned, hesited, or permanent.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the savior household, which breaks its protective cover.
The CDC also recommended to use a desinfectant for alcohol base hands containing at least 60% of alcohol when saving and water are not easy to access.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nests, or mouth with unleavened hands.
The surfaces may be discontaminated in several ways (in a minute of desinfectant exposure for an inoxydable steel surface), including Ethanol to 62-71 %, isopropanol to 50-100 %, sodium hypochloride to 0,1 %, hydrogen peroxide to 0,5 %, and iodated povacine 0,2–7,5 %.
Other solutions such as benzalconium chloride and chloroxydine gluconate are less effective.
The CDC recommends that, if an COVID case is suspected or confirmed in an installation such as a office building or a cryque, all parts such as offices, toilets, common rooms, as well as common electronic equipment such as tablets, tablets, claviers, telecommands, and automatic distributors used by nursing persons are desinfected.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouth and nests with an additional sweet or a sleeve when they go or end up, and to shoot all right immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who would be infected, because taking a mask can limit the volume and distance by the postills designed by speaking, ever and all.
WHO has issued instructions that explain where and when the masks are used.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologue at Leeds university, “Makes can reduce the propension of people to touch their face, which is an important source of infection in the absence of good hand hygiene.” The use of masks was also predicted to those who care for a potentially infected person.
WHO recommended the mask port to healthy people only if they face a significant risk, for example, if they care for a disease reached by COVID-19, even if it recognized that mask port can help people not touch the face.
Many countries began to encourage their population to use masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the port of non-medical masks in tissu. China specifically recommended the use of jetable medications to healthy persons, especially in case of neighbourhood (1 metres (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends to bring a surgical mask into public transport or linked places.
In Thailand, health authorities encourage the population to produce facial masks in themselves and clean them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibited public outputs without mask or other ways to cover their nest and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam imposed the mask port everywhere in public places, so that everyone protects himself and protects others.
The Austrian government ordered that everyone in a supermarket takes a mask.
Israel requested all his residents to bring a mask in public.
Taywan, who produced 10 million mask per day since the Middle Mars, imposed the mask port to train passengers and inter-urban bus passengers on April 1.
The Panama forced the port of a mask for any exit, while recommending the manufacture of a artisanal mask to those who can't buy it.
The masks were also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapur.
Social distance (equivalently called physical distance) includes control measures for infections intended to raise the dissemination of disease by decreasing contacts between persons.
The methods include quarantaines, travel restrictions and the closure of schools, workplaces, cities, theatres and commercial centres.
The social distance methods can be applied by remaining in themselves, by limiting their travels, avoiding the peoples, without contact, and by maintaining a physical distance with others.
Many governments now order or recommend social distance in the regions affected by epidemic.
The maximum number of meetings recommended by the United States Government and Health Organizations has been rapidly reduced by 250 people (if there was no known presence of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 people and after 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany has banned public assemblies of more than two persons, and adults and the most older health problems such as diabetes, heart diseases, respiratory diseases, hypertension or a disappointed immune system, were also invited by the CDC to stay at home as far as possible in the areas affected by epidemia. At the end of March 2020, WHOS and other healthal bodies began to replace the term “social distance” by “the physical distance” to clarify the goal of reducing physical contacts in social preserve, as well as in the end of March 2020.
The use of the term "social distance" was to believe that a total social isolation should be used instead of encourageing people to keep contact with others through other means. Some authorities published guidelines on sexual health to be monitored during pandemic.
They understand the recommendation of not having sexual reports only with a person with whom you live, who has no virus or does not present symptoms.
The home isolation was recommended for positive diagnosis in COVID-19 and those who think that they are infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for a correct isolation, and many Governments have put or recommended the establishment of a number of quarters for the entire population in the affected areas.
The most strict of individual quartainine instructions were given to people of the most dangerous groups.
Persons who have been exposed to a disease reached by COVID-19 and those who recently traveled to a country or region where transmission was very important have been invited to place in quarentaine for 14 days since the last time they have been exposed.
Epidemia Control Strategics are adjustment or removal, and attuming.
The endangerment is implemented during the first phases of epidemic and aims to monitor and isolate infected persons, and to introduce other measures to control infections and vaccination to prevent disease propagation in the rest of the population.
When there is no longer possible to prevent the propagation of disease, efforts are turned to the stage of acceleration: measures are taken to raise this propagation and to extend its effects on the health care system and society.
Measures for adjustment and reducing may be taken at the same time.
The elimination requires extreme measures to inflame pandemia by reducing the base reproduction number of less than 1. One part of the management of a infectious disease is to try to slow up the epidemic pic: this is what is called to appeal epidemic curve.
This allows to reduce the risk of overloading health services and gain time for vaccine development and treatment.
Among the non-pharmaceutical interventions that can be managed with epidemia include personal prevention measures, such as hands, mask port, and quarterness; public social distance measures, such as school closure and religious offices; public efforts to encourage acceptance of such interventions and participation in those; and environmental actions such as the cleaning of surfaces. More dramatic measures have been taken in China since the gravity of this has become apparent, as well as the installation of cities and strict interactions of travel.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures to restrict virus propagation.
South Korea introduced the mass detection and the localized quartainine, and warnings on the movement of infected persons.
Singapore has provided financial support to infected persons who have been placed in quartain, and had inflicted deeply amended to those who did not.
Taywan has increased the mask production and sanctioned the accommodation of medical supplies. Simulations for Great Britain and the United States show that the slowing (the decline but not the elimination of epidemic propagation) and the elimination (reverse epidemia development) faces important challenges.
Optimum accumulation policies may reduce health care requests of 2/3 and half deaths, but cannot avoid hundreds of thousands of deaths, and health care systems are submerged.
The elimination may be privileged, but it must be continued as long as the circle virus in human population (or until the vaccine is available, if it happens first) because, in the contrary case, transmission was rapidly reached during the release of measures.
Long-term intervention to eliminate pandemic has a social and economic cost.
There are no anti-viral treatments approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are now, including existing treatment tests.
Without ordering medicines against skin or drinking, as well as relaxing may contribute to highlighting symptoms.
With gravity, oxygenotherapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory assistance may be necessary.
The use of steroids can increase the results.
several compositions that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently at the study of COVID-19 treatment.
WHO stated that some "traditional and artisanal remedies" may adopt symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The increase in the capacity and adjustment of health care for the needs of patients reached by COVID-19 is described by WHO as a fundamental response measure to epidemic.
ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have published guidelines to the attention of hospitals and primary health care services for the redistribution of resources at different levels, in particular by enhancing the laboratory services to COVID tests, by cancelling non-urgency interventions when possible, separating and isolating positive COVID-to-related patients, and enhancing intensive care capabilities through staff training and increased numbers of veterinaries and treatment available.
There are various theories regarding the original location of the first case (called Zero patient).
The first known case of the new coronavirus could return to the 1st December 2019 in Whan, in the province of Hubei in China.
In a month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei gradually increased.
They are generally related to the market of huanan's fruit fruits, which also sold live animals. According to a theory, the virus would come from one of these animals; in other words, he had a zoonotic origin. An unknown cause pneumonia home was observed on December 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian in the hospital of Hubei Province, who reported the Whan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors of the Whan Central Hospital reported their colleagues of a “coronavirus similar to the S.H.”.
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were repressed by the police for promoting false faults, and another, Ai Fen, was repressed by his senior to give warning.
The municipal health committee of Whan published a public opinion on 31 December and informed WHO.
There were enough cases of unknown pneumonia signaled to the health authorities of Whan to initiate an investigation in the beginning of January. At the first phases of epidemic, the number of cases were doubled about every seven days and half.
At the beginning and mid-January 2020, the virus promoted other Chinese provinces, assisted by the New Year Migrations and the fact that Whan is a transport pool and a main road matching place.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Pekin and one in Shenzhen.
The following official data showed that 6 174 people had already developed symptoms on 20 January 2020. On 26 March, the United States exceeded China and Italy with the most confirmed cases in the world. On 9 April 2020, more than 1,61 million cases were reported in the world; more than 97,000 are dead and more than 364,000 have been healed.
About 200 countries and territories have been at least one case.
As a result of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted the movement and established border controls.
National reactions included availability measures such as the quartery (as called for orders to stay at home, open or confinement) and coppers. On 2 April, about 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population, are subject to a form of confidence to the United States, more than 50 million are confined to the Philippians, about 59 million in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On March 26, 1,7 billion people in the world knew a form of confidence, a number higher than 2,6 billion two days later — about a third of the world’s population.
The origin of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was dated from 1 December 2019 to Whan, and a not confirmed report suggests that the first case would return on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a home of unknown cause pneumonia case on 26 December, which reported the Whan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
The initial genetic tests of patients' samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to ≥S.
A public opinion was issued by Whan's municipal health commission on 31 December.
WHO was informed on the same day.
The doctors in Whan received a warning to have “propaved rumors” about epidemic.
The National Commission of Health of China initially claimed that there was no "expressed evidence" of transmission between human beings.
By the end of January, the Chinese government started a radical campaign, later described by the Chinese Communist Party secretariat Xi Jinping as a “guere of the people” to end the virus propagation.

The impact on the cross-sector has never reached a previous level.
several cars and ferry ports have also been closed.
Epidemia co-incited with the Chunyun, a major tourist season associated with the New China Ancient.
A number of events involving important groups have been cancelled by national and regional governments, including the annual festivals of the New Year, and private companies also closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many events related to the New Lunes Year have been cancelled, and many tourist attractions have been closed to avoid assemblies of mass, including the prohibited city of Peking and the horns of the traditional temple.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the New Year holidays until 10 February, implying to most of the workplaces not to open before that date.
These regions represented 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong was the highest level of response to infected diseases and declared an emergency situation, stop schools up to March and cancelling its New Year festivals. The distribution sector has been affected at the global level, with temporary shops opening or temporary closure reducing.
Visits in traders in Europe and Latin America reduced 40 per cent.
In North America and the Middle East, traders found a decrease of 50 to 60 per cent.
This also decreased 33 to 43 per cent of the pietton movement in trade centres in March compared to February.
Workers of the whole world's commercial centres have made additional measures, such as the increase of cleaning frequencies, the installation of the heat scanners to control the temperature of customers and the cancellation of events. According to a estimation of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million additional persons with extreme poverty in Latin America in relation to a situation without pandemia.
In January and February 2020, during the pic of epidemia in Whan, about 5 million people in China lost their job.
In China, a large part of some 300 million rural migrant workers have been blocked in provinces in Hubei provinces. In March 2020 more than 10 million Americans lost their employment and requested assistance to the Government.
The coronavirus epidemia could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32 percent, according to the estimates of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. In India confidence left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (of a daily salary) to unemployment. The investigation of the Angus Reid institute observed that 44 per cent of Canadian homes had experienced a certain type of unemployment.
During the second half of March, 4 million French employees requested temporary unemployment and 1 million British employees requested a universal credit request, and about a half million German enterprises funded their employees to a partial activity device supported by the Government called Kurzwork.
The German job compensation device was adopted by France and Great Britain.
The art sectors of the spectacle and cultural patrimonie have been deeply affected by pandemic, affecting the operation of organizations and individuals at the world level.
The organizations of the art and culture sector have been able to maintain their mission (they are financed by the State) to provide access to the cultural patrimonie to the community, to ensure the security of their employees and the public and to support artists as far as possible.
In March 2020, the museums, libraries, spectacle rooms and other cultural institutions were closed to new orders and their exhibitions, events and representations canceled or reported.
In response, intense efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Other recent and accelerated consequences of disease, the cancellation of religious services, major sport events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and mode deficiencies.
The cinema industry has also known an interruption. Vatican announced that the celebrations of the Holy Seed in Rome, which held the last week of the Christian Pennsylvania period in the Caribbean, had been cancelled.
Many dioceans recommended that the older Christians stay home instead of assisting the Sunday's mixes; some churches distribute their religious services in radio, online and online or television while others propose to practice their worship in “Drive-in”.
Instead of the Roman Catholic diocese of Rome, which closed his churches and chapels and the place of Saint-Pierre, who had seen from all his Christian peers, other religious authorities also cancelled their services and limited public assemblies in churches, mosquitos, synagogues, temples and gardens.
The Minister of Health of Iran announced the cancellation of the sales prayers in the areas touched by epidemia and the holy places were then closed, while Saudi Arabia prohibited the entry of foreign peers as well as its inhabitants to the sanctuary sites of La Mecque and Medine.
The pandemic has caused the most important interruption of the global sport calendar since the Second World War.
The most important sports events have been cancelled are reported, including the EUFA 2019-20 Championship League, the UK football Championship 2019-20, the EUFA Euro 2020, the NBA 2019-20 season and the LNH's 2019-20 season.
The Epidemiology has deteriored the organization of the Olympic Games in the summer 2020, which was to begin at the end of July, and the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "replaned by 2020, but after the summer 2021." The casinos and other world games were closed and the poker tours were reported or cancelled.
This has led many players to be online, and many online game sites have found a significant increase in their number of new registrations. The world of the spectacle has also been touched, with several music groups who suspended or canceled their concert tours.
Many large theatres, such as Broadway, also interrupted all their representations.
Some artists have seen ways to continue to create and share their work on the Internet in replacement of traditional direct representations, such as online and direct concerts or online festivals, so that artists will produce, disseminate and promote their works.
In the online, many of the Internet on the theme of the coronavirus promoted, since many privileges the humor and distraction faced incertitude.
Since COVID-19 epidemia, a recruitment of prejudicia, xenophobia and racism has been observed against Chinese and Asian people, and against people from sensitive areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
In many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America, and in the Pacific region, there were incidents related to fear, suspicion and hostity.
Reports from February (if the majority of cases were still limited to China) described racist feelings expressed in different groups around the world, according to which Chinas merit the virus or have been sentenced.
Some African countries also found that the feelings of anti-China were increased.
Many of the inhabitants of Whan and Hubei have reported a remarkable discrimination on their regional origin.
The support was provided to China, that it is online or outline, and to the inhabitants of the virus zones.
Following the progress of epidemic towards new sensitive countries, Italy, the people of the first European country to suffer a serious epidemia of COVID-19, could also face the suspicion and xenophobia. The citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea first signed the demands to prohibit Chineses to enter their country in order to stop disease.
In Japan, the #ChineseDontComeToJapan has been furious on Twitter.
China, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States reported an increase in racist insults and aggression.
The American President Donald Trump faced the criticism to have qualified the "China Virus", a term considered by its detractors as racist and anti-China.
In Ukraine, manifestants attacked buses transporting Ukrainians and foreign evacuations between Whan and Novi Sanzhary.
Students from the northeastern East of India, who shared a border with China, and students in large Indian cities would have been linked to the epidemia of coronavirus.
The Chairman of the West Bengale Unit of Bharatiya Janata Party Dilip Ghosh said that the Chineses have destroyed the nature and “is why God took his place on them”.
The following comments were condemned by the Chinese Consulat in Kolkata, which is the qualified of “flasses”. In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chine were observed by pandemic, foreigners are described as “foreign distances” which would be “willing”.
Many newspapers who paid them have retired them for all or part of their cover on the coronavirus.
Many scientists have available their scientific articles in connection with epidemia in free access.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results quickly on prepublication servers such as bioRxiv.
Emergente infectious maldiction – infected maldiction of an emergent pathogenic agent, often new in the field of epidemic abruptness or transmission mode

The laboratory detection of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods for detecting virus and detecting antibodies in response to infection.
The presence of virus in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the ARN of the coronavirus.
This analysis is specifically designed to detect only SARS-CoV-2 ARN.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
The detection of anticorps (seerology) may be used both for diagnosis and population monitoring.
Anticorps tests show how many people have contracted the disease, including those whose symptoms were too slow to be declared or asymptomatic.
An accurate mortality rate of disease and collective immunity among populations can be determined from the results of this test.
Because of a limited detection, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of virus in its population in March 2020.
On 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests carried out in each country.
This variability is likely to affect significantly the notified legitimacy rates, which may be significantly overwhelmed in certain countries.
Using the inverse transmission of a real-time polymeration reaction (rRT-PCR), the test may be carried out on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including the nasopharinized echo or the sample of exploitation.
The results are generally available in a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test carried out from pharynged ecuvellons is only reliable for the first week of disease.
Then the virus can disappear from the gorge while it continues its multiplication in the pulmones.
In persons tested during the second week, a sample can also be preleved in the deep breathing ways by aspiration catater, or a cracket (expectory) can be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by Charité in Berlin in January 2020 through an inverse transmission of real time polymerization reaction (RRT-PCR) and was the basis of 250 000 Kit distributed by the World Health Organization (OMS).
The United Kingdom had also developed a test on 23 January 2020.The South Korean company Kogenbitech developed a clinical quality kit of SARS-CoV-2 based on PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
He detected the gene "E" shared by all coronavirus bees, and the specific gen RdRp to SARS-CoV-2.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive the urgency authorisation of the Chinese National Medical Administration for a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the CR.In the United States, the Headquarters for Disease Control and Prevention (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC) distribute their diagnostic devices by RT-PCR in real time from the Coronavirus 2019 (20-19) to public health workers through the International Resource Resource.
Among the old versions of the test kits, a genetic test obtained unfinished results because of defectuous reacts, as well as a strike testing goulot at Atlanta CDC. Thus, a average of less than 100 samples per day were successfully treated throughout the month of February 2020.
The tests used by two components were not considered as reliable until 28 February 2020, and only at this time federal and local laboratories received authorisation to start detection.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorisation. The trade laboratories of the United States started the detection at the beginning of March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability available at the national level of COVID-19 tests based on RT-PCR.
This diagnosis has also distributed tests of COVID-19 at the national level on 9 March 2020.
No quantitative limitation has been announced. The collection and processing of samples must be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the National Virhology and Biological Research Centre VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Monitor Service. On 12 March 2020, it was announced that Mayo Clinic had developed a COVID infection detection test. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA's authorisation for a test that could be performed in large quantities in 3,5 hours, which would also allow a device to be performed around 4 128 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted an emergency use permit (USA) to Abbott Laboratory for an Abbott system test. The FDA had previously granted a similar authorisation for Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepness also received an EUFA for a testing that takes about 45 minutes.
FDA approved a test that uses the isothermal simplification technology of nuclear acids instead of the CCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternative temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are now approximately 18 000 of these devices in the United States, and Abbott intends to intensify the manufacture to provide 50 000 tests per day. A test using a monoclonal antibodies that is specifically linked to the protein of nucleocapside (proteine N) of the new coronavirus is being developed in Thailand, in hope that it can provide results from 15 to 20 minutes, as a fast test of grippe.
A bibliographic study of March 2020 concluded that “Lunghearted radiographies have a low diagnostic value in the first towns, while the results of the TDM [tomodensitometery] may be concluded even before the appearance of symptoms”.
Among the typical symptoms on the TDM are opacity to see multi-lobal bilateral depolis with a device, asymétric and post-section distribution.
A sub-plorable predominance, a "chrocky paving" and a consolidation are developed as the disease grows.
A study compared to the TDM to Whan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, suggested that TDM is clearly sensitive than the CRP, whereas less specific, several of its image results associated with other pneumonies and diseases.
In March 2020, the American Radioology College recommends that “TPM is not used for detection or as a first line test for diagnosing COVID-19”. In March 2020, CDC recommends the GDP for initial detection.
The production of anticorps, including IgM and IgG, is part of immune response to infection.
These may be used to detect infection in persons from about 7 days after the appearance of symptoms, to determine immunity and population surveillance.The tests may be performed in central laboratorys (TLC) or by testing to the patient's cheese (point-of-care testing, PoCT).
The automatised systems of many clinical laboratorys are able to realize these analysis, but their availability will depend on the production rates of each system.
For the TLC, one single sample of device blood is generally used, although serial samples can be used to follow immunity response.
For the PoCT, one single blood sample is generally preleved by cutaned pointing.
In the difference of PCR methods, no extraction step is required before the analysis was analyzed. On 26 March 2020, the FDA has appointed 29 entities who had duely informed the Agency and, therefore, can now distribute their anti-corps detection tests.
On April 7, 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorisation.Fin March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorisations for their test kids, capable of detecting IgG and IgA antibodies against virus in blood samples.
Detection capacity is several hundreds of samples in a few hours, which is quite faster than the virus ARN PCR test.
The antibodies are generally detected 14 days after the start of the infection.Debut April, the United Kingdom realized that no anti-corps test kits purchased by the country was sufficiently implementing to be used.
Hong Kong has established a plan in which the suspect cases can stay at their home, “the emergency service will provide to the patient a sample tube,” patients fearing internal, return and then receive the test result.British NHS announced that it carries a pilot project to test cases with suspicious cases, which eliminates the risk that a patient is not infected by others by making an hospital or the need to desinfect an ambulance in the case of use.The framework of the COVD-19 drive for suspect cases, a precautional health risk in the precautional precautional precautions.
The “driving centers” allowed South Korea to achieve one of the fastest and exhaustive detections in the world. In Germany, the National Medical Medical Association of Compulsory Insurance Agency declared on 2 March that it had the ability to perform about 12 000 tests a day in the ambulatory environment, and 10 700 patients had been tested during the previous week.
The costs are supported by disease insurance when testing is required by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160 000 tests per week.
On March 19, Drive tests were available in several large cities.
On 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown because only positive results are declared.
A first laboratory study showed that at the 12/2020 calendar week, a total of 483 295 samples were tested until the week 12/2020 and that 33 491 samples (6,9%) have received a positive result for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers of the Technion and the Hospital Rambam have developed and tested a method of analysis of 64 patients, collecting samples and not resulting in the detection that if the channel combined is positive. Whan, an improved laboratory of 2 000 carremonies of 2 000 meters of carredoned "UU-Y" could be the "Furone of the French "5000" and "5000" of the French folks.
By its 5-day construction by Wang Jian, the BGI founder, the modelling showed that the cases in Hubei province would have been 47 per cent higher and that the costs corresponding to the quarter-term development would have doubled without this detection capacity.
The Whan’s laboratory was quickly monitored by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai in 12 Chinese cities in total.
On 4 March 2020, total daily capacity was 50 000 tests per day.Origami Assays has been published to test up to 1 122 samples of patients for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced models can be performed in small laboratorys without liquid manipulator robots.
In March, the insufficient react rates and react quantities have become a slow-scale for mass discharge in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States.
The situation was made by some authors to consider sample preparation protocols that implies to shoot samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release ARN genoms to continue detection. On 31 March, it was announced that the unilateral Arab Emirates were now the most largest part of their population by the Coronavirus, and they were able to intensify the detection to reach the majority of the population.
These results have been achieved through the ability to conduct drives and purchase a high debit laboratory at the population level at Group 42 and BGI (based on their emergency detection laboratory in China).
Construction in 14 days, the laboratory is able to conduct tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory of this capacity to be operational outside China.
Different target test forms have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula to produce kits sent to countries with low income, not having the resources necessary to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020, and the Protocol developed by the United States For Diseases Control Centre was only published on 28 January, delaying the availability of tests in the United States. China and the United States had problems at the level of fiavyness of testing kids at the beginning of epidemia, and these countries, as well as Australia, had not been able to provide sufficient kits to respond to the request and recommendations for the detection of health experts.
However, specialists indicate that the great availability of tests in South Korea has contributed to reduce the propagation of the new coronavirus.
The detection capacity, mostly in private sector laboratories, has been strengthened in several years by the South Korean Government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization recommended the intensification of detection programs as a better way to reinforce the progress of COVID pandemic.The strong demand of tests due to the wide dissemination of virus resulted in the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in the United States private laboratorys, and the reserves of cowl and chemical reagents have been delayed.
In March 2020, China reported problems related to the reliability of its test kits.
In the United States, the CDC's test kids presented “faults”.The government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that hindered private tests.Island purchased test kits at the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd but found that the results were not reliable.
The company explained that the wrong results could not be linked to the ability to collect samples or to correctly use kits.
The Spanish Ministry stated that he will remove the wrong results and replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits purchased to China by the Czech Republic provided false results.
The first Minister Matovič suggested to go to Danube. Atheist Kara from the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits that Turkey has purchased in China had a “high error rate” and that it had not been used. The United Kingdom purchased 3,5 million test kits in China but announced that they were unnecessary in April 2020.
The detection, followed by the quarentaine of those who obtain a positive result and the trace of persons who had been contacted with SARS-CoV-2, has given positive results.
For researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the place of the first death linked to COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two series of tests at the total population of about 3400 people, around 10 days of interval.
About half of the people obtaining a positive result did not have symptoms, and all the cases found were in quarentaine.
With the limitation of movements in the common, this measure completely removed new infections.
With the aggressive trace of contacts, the restrictions of incoming travels, the detection and the quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemia in Singapore has made a lot less rapid than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as the forced closure of restaurants and detail sales institutions.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore began to advise the residents to stay home on March 28, but schools were cut on the date scheduled at the end of the holidays on March 23.
A number of other countries also have managed pandemia through aggressive contact trace, incoming travel restrictions, deployment and quarterness, but with less aggressive confidence, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries who have performed most tests, compared to the number of deaths, have much lower letality rates, probably because these countries are more able to detect people only low or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without analysis and whose national laboratorys have only a limited experience of COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and ten negative samples of COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratorys to confirm tests.
Among 16 reference laboratorys, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the "Positive in % tests" column depends on the national detection policy.
A country who tests that the hospital granted persons will have a positive value in % tests than a country that tests all of the citizens, which present or not symptoms, is the same.
The lavage of hands, also called hands, corresponds to the fact that hands are cleaned to remove salts, grass, microorgans or other indeseable substances.
The fact that the hands are systematically laxed with savon to some "clear moments" of the day prevents the propagation of many diseases, for example, diarrey and cholera, which are transmitted by oro-feceal way.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as grip or rhythm, for example, to smell the hands before touching the eyes, nausea or mouth (e.g. mournings).
It is important to lay the hands in saving at five key moments of the day: before and after the defect, after cleaning the fees of a baby or changed its beds, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling of the flesh, fish or crude flight.
If you don't have water or saving under your hand, you can lay your hands on the floor. The World Health Organization recommends to lay your hands:
prior, during and after the preparation of food;
before and after being occupied by a sick person;
after changed the beds of a baby or cleaned a child who went to the toilets;
after being shocked or seated/eternated;
after touching a animal, food for animals or wastes;
Hygine of medical hands refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
The fact that your hands are laxed before administration of medicines or medical care may prevent or reduce disease propagation.
The main medical goal of hand lavage is to eliminate pathogen agents (bacteria, virus or other microorgans that may cause diseases) and chemical products that may be harmful or cause diseases.
This practice is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but also for the large public.
The lavage of hands has many benefits for health, including the reduction of the propagation of grip, coronavirus and other infected diseases; prevention of infectious causes of diarhy; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as the reduction in child mortality rates in household accommodation.
According to an study carried out in 2013, the improvement of hand hygiene practices could lead to a low improvement of child growth in less than five years.
In developing countries, children's mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrey may be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes such as the lavage of hands.
This simple practice can reduce the mortality rate related to these diseases by about 50%.
The establishment of action to promote the lavage of hands could reduce about a third of the episodes of diarhy, a number comparable to that obtained by providing potable water in low income regions.
The lacquering hands allows to reduce 48% of diarhy episodes and is the most effective and less costful means to prevent augmentary diarrey and respiratory infections (IRA). It is an act that should be automatically done in homes, schools and communities of the whole world.
The pneumonia, one of the main IRA, is the first cause of mortality in children under five years of age, which makes nearly 1,8 million victims per year.
Similarly, diarrey and pneumonia lead about 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, the habit of taking the hands with sweat before you eat and after being moved to the toilets can save more than any vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce nearly half the deaths of diarrhee and a fourth deaths that can be imputed to acute respiratory infections.
Hand lavage is generally associated with other health measures in the framework of water, sanitation and hygienic programmes (WASH).
The lavage of the hands also protects the empire, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Mineral effects, the frequencies lavage of hands can skin up by causeing cut-off.
A Danish study of 2012 showed that excessive hand lavage could lead to the ezema or demotitis at the level of hands, characterized by a squamed skin and demangeous skin, and especially frequent in health workers.
The too frequent lavage of hands is also considered as one of the symptoms of compulsory obsessional disorder (TOC).
It is important to lay the hands in saving at five key moments of the day to reduce the oro-fetal transmission of diseases: before and after using the toilets (miction, defection), after purifying the fees of a baby (or changed its beds), before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling of meat, fish or crude flight.
The hands should also be laid correctly to prevent the transmission of diseases, including before and after treatment of a cut or fertility, after being long-term, sicked or smoothed, after touching animal distances or handling animals and after touching horses.
In many countries, the savial cleaning rate is low.
According to an investigation carried out in 2015 at 54 countries and with regard to hand hygiene, 38.7 per cent of the households in average were hands with savan. A study carried out in 2014 showed that it was the highest rate (97 per cent), the United States was in the medium table (77 per cent) and China showed the lowest rate (23 per cent). Today, there are several methods to evolve the behavior and democratize the use of the savings for the mains at the key moments of the day.
For example, the Ministry of Education of Philippine has implemented a “primical health care program” in order to promote health and education of children.
The disappearing twice a year, associated with daily lavage of hands in the savan and daily brossage of dents with fluored dentists, is in the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
In order to better eliminate the microorgans present on the skin, it is necessary to add knowledge or detergents to water.
The main action of knowledge and detergence is to reduce solution barriers and increase solution.
The only water is not an effective cleaner for skin because lipides and proteins, which are organic materials of the ground, are difficultly solved in the water.
However, a suitable water flow facilitates cleaning.
The solid savine, because of its reuseable nature, can refer to bacteria about previous uses.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contained salt concluded that the transfer was unlikely because bacteria are raised with museum.
The Disease Control and Prevention Centre (CDC) also indicates that "auto-like salt distributors are preferable".
Antibacteria has been strongly recommended to people concerned about their health status.
There is no evidence to suggest that the use of recommended anti-septics or desinfects allows to target antibiotics in nature.
However, antibacteria knows contain current antibacteria agents such as triclosan, with many shoes of organisms.
Therefore, even though antibiotic skins are not the fruit of antibacteria, these lasts may not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the tensioactive and skin protection agent, the most complex forms can contain acids (actic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) to regulate the pH, benzoic acid, with antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe, vitamins, mental, extracts of plants).A rigorous analysis of the Oregon Public Health School has indicated that the ordinary samples were effective as well as the antibactrics used for special and triclos, to prevente diseases and the skinning of main diseases.
The warm water used to lacquer the hands is not sufficiently heat to kill bacteria.
The bacteria is much more faster than the body temperature (37 °C).
However, the tea and sweet water is more effective than the cold and sweet water to eliminate natural oils of salt and bacteria.
However, in contrast with popular faith, scientific studies showed that the use of tea water was not contributed to reduce microbian load on the hands.
A desinfectant or an antiseptic for hands is a non-heated hygiene product.
At the end of the 1990s and beginning of the 21th century, hygiene products of non-water hands (which called hydrocarbon solutions, anti-septic solutions for hands or hands desinfects) began to popularize themselves.
Most are formulated on the basis of isopropylic alcohol or ethanol associated with a divided agent such as carbon (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a gelo, or to a humidity such as glycerine to obtain a liquid or museum for a greater use facility and reduce the effect of alcohol.
Diluted hydrogen peroxide increases the antimicrobial activity.The desinfectants for hands containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol are effectively eliminating the gemees.
The hydro-alcohol solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and some virus (HIV, Herpes, VRS, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), and champions.
Hydroalcool solutions containing 70% of alcohol are 99.97% (reducing 3,5%, log equivalent to 35 decibels) of bacteria present on 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.99% to 99.999% (reducing 4 to 5 log) of bacteria present in 1 minutes after the application.The desinfects for hands are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some virus.
Hydro-alcohol solutions are almost entirely inefficient against norovirus (or Norwalk), the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis. A sufficient quantity of desinfecting for hands or hydro-alcolic solution must be used to move or cover both hands.
The pam and two of the two hands should be bound, as well as the interruptions between dogs and nails for about 30 seconds, until the liquid, museum or seed glass.
The American Centre for Control and Prevention of Diseases recommends the lavage of hands instead of use of hydrocarbon solutions, especially when hands are visiblely salt.
The increased use of these products is due to their use facility and rapid elimination activities of microorgans; however, they do not need to replace a suitable hand lavage if you do not have water and save in hands.
The frequency use of hydrocole solutions may result in a cut-off disappearing if the formula is not strengthened by emollants and/or skin hydroatric agents.
The adverse effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding to glucerine and/or other emolyans to the formula.
In clinical trials, the hydro-alcohol solutions containing emolytics have undergone clearly less irritation and cut-up sequence than antimicrobial detergents.
The allergical contact demativity, contact urtic or hypersensibility to alcohol or additives present in alcoholic solutions are rare.
The fact that hydrocarbon solutions have less tendency to cause irritating contact demates made them more attractive than the lavage of hands to water and saving.
In spite of their effectiveness, non-water products do not eliminate organic materials on the hands, but only desinfect them.
This is why desinfects for hands are not so effective as saving and water to avoid the propagation of many pathogenic agents, since these are still on the hands.
The efficiency of alcoholless hands depends strongly on ingredients and forms, and has always been clearly lower than alcohol and alcohol desinfectants.
More recently, the formulas used by benzalconium chlorure presented a sustainable and cumulative antimicrobial activity after the application, at the difference in alcohol, with the efficiency after repeated use, probably due to progressive progressive reactions.
In low income populations, many are those who do not have the way to buy savan, and who use the cemetery or the earth instead.
The cemetery or the earth can be more efficient than the water only, but less than they save it.
If the earth or cemetery is contaminated by microorganismes, it may increase the propagation of diseases instead of frozening it.
The snake is also a desinfective agent because, in contact with water, it forms an alcaline solution.
WHO recommends cedar or sand as an alternative when it is not available.
The United States Centre for the Control and Prevention of Diseases recommends that the hands are correctly laid to prevent the transmission of diseases, as follows:
Move your hands with the current water teed or cold.
The current water is recommended because of the risk of polluting water points, while water temperature seems not to be different.
Make a generous quantity of salt on the hands by frozen the one against the other, without forgetting the dust of the hands, between the fingers and under the legs.
Savine eliminates skin hermes, and studies show that people tend to lay their hands more carefully when they use savings than with water.
Frotter for at least 20 seconds.
The frotter action is created from the friction, which helps to eliminate the skin grums, and frozen more longer to remove more germs.
Get too much to the current water.
The blending in a staining water basin can lead to the recovery of the hands.
Search with a clean or air-friendly service.
Mood and humid hands are easier recognised.The most often forgotten zones are the pocket, the bridge, the spaces between the dogs and the bottom of the nails.
The artificial sheets and the scattered sheets can hide microorgans.
A hydrating lotion is often recommended to avoid having seed hands; cottage sequence promotes the appearance of coated lesions that can increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to lay the hands when the rabbit water and/or savan is not available, for example, to cover the water of a soft and perceived vessel and/or use it if necessary, in developing countries.The situations where water supply is limited (e.g. in schools or rural areas of developing countries), there are solutions to economize the water, such as “pipe-taps” and other economic options.
A tip-tap is a simple technology that uses a suspended cross using a corde, and a pedale that allows to save a small amount of water on the hands and a salt pan.
The effective hand seal is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to throw your hands in the public toilets is being discussed.
More research suggests that paper services are much more hygienical than electric sechs than often found in the toilets.
In 2008, a study financed by the Swiss Paper industry, European Tissue Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster (Londres), to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper serviettes, warm air seeds and the most modern air-good sequencies.
After the lavage and the seal of hands at warm air, it was shown that the total number of bacteria increased in the average 194% on the dog pulp and 254% on the palms.
A average increase in the total number of bacteria on dentists of 42 per cent and 15 per cent of the palms.
After the lavage and shoot of hands with a paper service, the total number of bacteria was reduced by 76 per cent in average on the dogs and up to 77 per cent on the palms. Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a growing potential of contamination with other tubes users and the environment of the toilets according to each seat method.
The air sequestrians, which suffers from the air outside of the device at an announced speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is able to expulse the hands and device microorgans, and may contain other tubes users, as well as the toilet environment in a metro walking up to 2 m.
The use of a warm air seed allows to distribute microorganismes to a maximum distance of 0.25 meters of seche.
Paper services showed that there was no significant propagation of microorgans, and in 2005, in a study conducted by the TUDV Product and Environment, different hand sequence methods were evaluated.
Following the hands, the following variations of the bacterial number were observed:
There are many different sequestrian manufacturers, and the seachs have been compared to the sequence using paper serviettes.
The lavage of hands with desinfect rings is an alternative solution during the movement, in the absence of salt and water.
Hydrocarbonal solutions should contain at least 60 % of alcohol.
The lavage of hands in medical environment has become obliged well after the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis found its effectiveness (1846) to prevent hospital diseases.
There are electronic devices that escape reminders when hospital personnel forgot to lay the hands.
A study revealed that their use was a decrease in infection rates.
The medical lavage of the hands must last at least 15 seconds by using a generous quantity of salt and water or glass to move and frozen each part of the hands.
The hands must be frozen against the other by passing between the fingers.
In the case of residues under the sheets, it is possible to use a powder brown to remove them.
As the helms present in the water are likely to stay on the hands, it is important to swim well and swim with a own service.
After the seat, the paper service must be used to close the robin (and open the output door if appropriate).
This allows you to avoid recognizing your hands at the surface contact.
The goal of hand lavaging in health structures is to remove pathogen microorgans (hermes) and to avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the inadequate hand cleaning rate remains inacceptable in most medical institutions, a large number of doctors and nurses that regularly forget to lay hands before touching their patients, which promotes the transmission of microorganisms.
According to a study, the fact that the hands and other simple procedures are correctly laxed may reduce 66 per cent of the blood infection rates related to cathéters. The World Health Organization published a brochure that describes the standard procedure to follow and frozen the hands in the field of health.
The draft guidelines on the Hygiene of Hands established by the Organization can also be consulted on the website to collect the comments of the internal.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby and al.
Trade devices may measure and certify hand hygiene, if respect for the regulation is increased.
The World Health Organization defines “5 indications” as regards the hygiène of hands:
After an exposure to blood/a biological liquid;
before a aseptic geste; and
After having contact with the patient. The fact that you add anti-septic chemicals to savon (which is "medic" or "anti-microbians"), you will see the hand lavage agent an action to destroy germs.
For "frotter" hands for a surgical operation, it is necessary to have an opening and closed wheel that can be opened and closed without touching it with the hands, a product of clorhexidine or iode lavage based on chloroxide or steel servicing to seek the hands after wearing the hands, a frozen brochure and a other instrument for frozen frozens.
All jewels must be removed.
In the context of this procedure, hands and fronts should be laid up to the coast, generally for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to frozen your hands for 10 minutes.
When the ring, it must be avoided that the water on the fronts goes up to the hands.
Once the hands are laid, hands should be sit down through a steel ring and packed a surgery house.
In order to reduce the propagation of germs, it is preferable to lay hands or use an anti-septic for hands before and after being occupied by a sick person.
With regard to the control of stafylocotic infections in hospitals, the main benefits of hand lavage were obtained during the first 20% of the lavage, and there was only a few additional benefits to increase the frequency of hands over 35%.
In comparison with the lavage of the hands carried out with a ordinary salt that is performed with an antibacterial savine, the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food is more than three times higher. Similarly, comparing the cleaning of the hands with an alcohol solution and the lavage of hands with a antibacterial salt during a mean period of 30 seconds, it is noted that the first bacterial contamination of 26% is reduced in comparison with the second.
But saving and water are more efficient than alcohol-based products to reduce the influenza virus A (H1N1) and difficult Clostridium spots on the hands. In order to improve the hand hygiene in health care institutions, it is possible, in particular, to train staff in hands the lavage, to put more alcohol base products to the disposal of it and to give them written and verbal reminders to this matter.
More research is needed to discover what is the most efficient interventions in different health structures.
In developing countries, it is considered that the lavage of the hands in the savan is a little costful and essential tool to preserve health, or to food properly.
However, because of the lack of reliable water points, saving or installations to lay hands at home, at school and at work, it is difficult to establish universal hand hygiene habits.
For example, in the largest part of rural Africa, it is rarely to find routines to lay the hands near the private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options to build hand lavage stations.
However, low hand lavage rates may also be imputable to thin habits, rather than to a lack of salt or water.
Promoting the lavage of hands in the savan and conducting sensibilisation activities in this regard can affect political decisions, know the advantages related to this practice and cause a long-term behavior change in the population.
In order to achieve this approach, monitoring and evaluation activities must be carried out.
A systematic review of 70 studies showed that local approaches are effective to increase the main lavage rate in the countries of low and intermediate revenue, and that social marketing campaigns are less effective, and in terms of the promotion of hands in schools, the example of the " Approval of three stars " of UNICEF, which encourages schools to take simple and less costful measures to ensure that students are laid down with savon, while respecting other hygiene rules.
Once minimum standards are reached, schools can pass from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand lavage stations can be included in hand higiene campaigns that are conducted in order to reduce child diseases and mortality.
The World Day of Hands is another example of awareness campaign that aims to promote the evolution of conduct.
Many studies examined the global cost-efficient report of the lavage of hands in developing countries in comparison with the number of good-governed life years (i.e., DALY avoided).
However, a revue suggests that the promotion of the lavage of hands on the salt is quite more sensitive than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hands for human health was identified for the first time in the middle of the 19th century by two publishers of the hand hygiene: the Hungary Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the modern nursing Foundation.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to the fetidian shoes called mysm.
In the 1980s, food epidemias and niocomial infections conducted the American Centres for Control and Prevention of Diseases to promote hand hygiene as an essential means for preventing infection.
The appearance of the sugar grippe in 2009 and COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 has led to a greater conscience in many countries about the need to lay hands with savings to prevent these infected diseases.
For example, in Germany shows the “good hand lavage techniques” were placed next to the ships in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The expression "wear the hands" refers to the refusal of a person to take the responsibility or to be complied with something.
It is a Bible verse of Matthew, in which Ponce Pilate laid the hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but this expression has been widely expanded in certain English communities.
In Macbeth, from Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth undertakes the hands into a compulsory way to try to clean a imaginative tache, symbolized by her wrong conscience regarding the crimes she made and urged her husband to do.
It was also observed that, after being reminded of having made infringements against ethical or considered to do so, some have tended to lay their hands more often than others and to give more value to hand lavage devices.
Furthermore, those who are allowed to lay their hands after such thoughts are less strict to deliver to other compensatory measures of “purification”, such as the beneficiary.
Some religions require the lavage of hands for both hygienical and symbolic purposes. The symbolic lavage of hands, which consists of using water and not saving to lavage hands, is part of the rituals of hands covered in many religions, including the baaiism and the hindouism, the immature (tevilah) and the ritual abuse of hands (Netilat Yadayim) in the Jewishism, the lavabo in the Christianism and whuhu in the Islam. The religions also require the hands to end genetics, in particular after action.
According to hindousism, Jewishism and Islam, it is obliged to lay the hands after being gone to the toilets.
Similarly, hindousism, buddhism, cykhism, judealism and Islam require the lacquering hands before and after each feet.
COVID risk controls on workplace
COVID-19 risk controls are designed to implement health and safety methodologies for risk control in the prevention of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriate risk controls on the workplace vary according to the workplace and tasks, based on an evaluation of exposure risks, the severeness of disease in the community and individual risk factors of workers that can be vulnerable to an infection by COVID-19.
According to the Occupational Security and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, exposure jobs have a minimum professional contact with the public and other collaborators. In this case, only basic prevention measures are recommended, including the lavage of hands, encouragement of workers to stay at home if they are sick, the breathing label and the maintenance of cleaning and desinfection of the work environment.
Mid-risk exposure jobs include those who need frequent or close contacts with people without COVID-19 suspected or known, but who can be infected because of an existing Community transmission or international travel.
This includes employees in contact with the large public, in particular in schools, high-depth population work environments and some large-scale detailed environments.
Risk controls in this group, including basic infection prevention measures, include advertising through high-efficient air filters, hygienical visions and disposal of individual protection equipment in case of meeting with a person reached by COVID-19.
The OSHA considers health and funeral workers exposed to persons with a COVID-19 suspected or known as a high risk of exposure, with a very high risk if they perform aircraft procedures or shifts or samples of persons with suspected or known COVID-19.
The risk controls for these employees include technical controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and individual protection equipment adapted to the task.
COVID-19 epidemias may have several effects on the workplace.
Workers can be dismissed because they have fallen sick, need to take care of others or fear possible exposure.
Trade models can change both in the goods requested as well as in the means of acquiring them (e.g. their courses outside point hours or use delivery or drive services).
Finally, the expedition of articles from severe geographical regions affected by COVID-19 may be interrupted. A plan for preparation and response to infected diseases can be used as a guide for protective measures.
Plans take into account risk levels associated with different workplaces and tasks, including exposure sources, risk factors related to the family and Community context and individual risk factors of workers such as advanced age or chronic pathology.
They also forget the controls required to address these risks and emergency plans for situations that may be submitted after epidemics.
Plans for preparation and response to infected diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The response goals to epidemia include the reduction in transmission among staff, the protection of higher risk of medical complications, the maintenance of commercial operations and the reduction of unwanted effects on other entities of their supply chain.
The safety of disease in the community where the company is located is affected by the answers applied.
Risk control heerage forms a comprehensive framework for health and safety in work in order to group risk controls by effectiveness.
If COVID-19 risks cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are technical controls, monitoring administrative controls and finally individual protection equipment.
Technical controls include isolating employees from work-related risks without having to be displaced on the behaviour of workers, which can be the most economic solution to implement.
Administrative controls designate changes in policies or procedures to work that require a action from the employee or employee.
The individual protection equipment (EPI) is considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but may contribute to preventing certain exposures.
All types of EPI should be selected according to the risk for the worker, correctly adapted according to the needs (e.g., respiratory masks), correctly and systematically, inspected regularly, maintened and replaced according to the needs, and correctly removed, cleaned, and stored or put into the powder to avoid any contamination.
According to the United States Occupational Security and Health Administration (OSHA), exposure jobs have a minimum professional contact with the public and other collaborators.
Infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include the lavage of frequent and minute hands, the encouragement of workers to remain at home if they are sick, the breathing label, including the mouth and the nail to strike and everlasting, providing swimming and powders, telephone preparation or work hours, dissuasion of the tools and equipment, and maintenance of the cleaning and the desinfect of the labour environment.
The identification and rapid isolation of potentially infected persons is a crucial step in the protection of workers, customers, visitors and other people on a workplace.
The Centres for Control and Prevention of Diseases (CDC) in the United States recommend to employees who are presenting acute respiratory symptoms to stay at home until they are not present for fiber, fever signs or any other symptom since at least 24 hours without using febble or other medicines on symptoms; they also recommend to apply flexible disease congestion policies, to allow employees to stay home to care for a family member and to inform the employees of these policies.
According to the OSHA, people who need a frequent or strict contact, at least six feet (1,8 m), of people without COVID-19 suspected or known, but which can be infected by SARS-CoV-2 because of a Community transmission around the company or because the person recently traveled a international journey in a region with a reduced COVID-19 transmission.
This includes the technological controls for this group and the higher risk include the installation of high-efficient air filters, the increase of the ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plasma visions and the installation of a drive window for the customer service. The administrative controls for this group and those who are higher risks to increase the degree of disabled workers to stay in the house, the location of meetings by persons by virtual communications, the place of their employees, the emerging age of the emerging age of the age of ages of the age of ages, the age of the age of the ages of the ages of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the ages of the age of the ages of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the ages of the ages from the ages of the ages of the ages of the ages of the ages of the age of the ages of the ages of the age of the ages of the ages of the ages of the ages of the ages of the ages of the ages of the ages of the ages of the ages of the ages of the ages of the agesss of the agesss of the agess of the ages of the ages of the ages of the ages of the agess of the ages of the agess of the agesssssssssss
The workers of this group of risks have random need to use respiratory masks.
If a person is sick on a flight, the appropriate controls for the protection of workers and other passengers include the following measures: separating the disease by a distance of 6 feet, designating a staff member to care for sickness and offering a protective mask to the sick or requesting to cover the mouth and narrow when he goes or ever.
The chain equipment shall take Jetable Medical Gants when it takes care of a ill-passer or touchs organic liquids or surfaces potentially contaminated and, if possible, additional individual protection equipment if the sick passager is present in the fiber, a continuing tube or respiratory difficulties.
Gants and other jet items must be put in a shuttle for dangerous biological wastes and contained surfaces should be cleaned and desinfected after. For commercial navigation, including cruise vessels and other passenger ships, risk controls include travel reports in case of disease, auto-isolation and immediate information from the board medical centre if it is developed a fever or other symptoms once on board.
Ideally, medical monitoring should have been carried out in the chain of the isolated person. For school and child guard institutions, CDCs recommend short-term closure for cleaning and desinfecting if a infected person has become in a school building, independently of the Community propagation.
In the case of the minimum minimum Community transmission, social distance strategies, such as the cancellation of pedagogical outputs, assemblies and other important assemblies such as physical or chorale education courses or cantine food, increased space between offices, slowing the arrival and outcome hours, reduceing non-essential visitors and using separate nurse for children presenting grimpling symptoms.
In the case of important transmission in the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, a long-term school vacation can be considered. For the order forces that carry out daily routine activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by CDCs.
Order force agents who have to contact people with COVID-19 suspected or confirmed must follow the same directives as ambulances, including the port of adequate individual protection equipment.
In the case of a arrest, workers must clean and desinfect their service equipment and cemetery before reuse by means of a ringet or a detergent spray to house and follow standard confidence and establishment of EPIs used, as well as the confidence and landing of clothing.
OSHA considers certain health and funding workers as high or very high risks of exposure.
High-risk exposure jobs include health care, support, laboratory and medical transport workers that are exposed to patients with suspected or known COVID-19 patients.
They become very high-risk exhibition workers if they perform aerosols or plotting or manipulation of patients with suspected or known COVID-19 samples.
Aerosol procedures include invoices, tube induction procedures, bronchoscopies, some dentist reviews and procedures or invasive samples.
High-risk funding jobs include workers in the preparation of persons with COVID-19 suspected or known at the time of their death; they are a very high risk of exposure if they practice an autopsie. Additional technical controls of these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with suspected or known COVID-19 patients, including during the implementation of aircraft procedures.
A negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health and funeral environments.
The samples should be handled using biological security precautions of level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends to separate patients in separate COVID-assistant waiting rooms. In addition to other EPIs, OSHA recommends respiratory masks for people who work less than 6 feet of patients with a suspected or known infection by SARS-COV-2 and for aircraft procedures.
In the United States, respiratory N95 filter masks, approved by NIOSH or higher, must be used in the context of a complete and written respiratory protection programme, including adjustment, training and medical reviews.
Other types of respiratory masks can ensure higher protection and better comfort of the worker. WHO does not recommend combinations, because COVID-19 is an respiratory disease rather than transmitted by organic liquids.
WHO recommends the port of a surgical mask only by the detection staff at the entry point.
For those who collect respiratory samples, take or transport COVID-19 patients in the absence of aircraft procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, protection lunetants or facial screens, blue and gants.
In case of aerosol procedure, the surgical mask is replaced by a respiratory mask N95 or FFP2.
Since the global EPI supply is insufficient, WHO recommends limited EPI's needs by telemedication, physical barriers, such as transparent windows, limit access to a local employed by a COVID-patient to persons directly involved in their care, the use of EPIs necessary to specifically task, the continuing use of the same respiratory mask without retiring it to support several patients with the same diagnostic, monitoring and coordination of EPI supply chain and the dissuasion of the use of massage masks for the asymptomatic individuals.

OBJET: [Covid-19] To load and to prepare the future
DATE/HOIRD : 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENCE : CC0 : No reserved rights
We find this month in an exceptional situation.
COVID-19 epidemia is a clear demonstration of our global human interconnection and of the responsibilities we have to do with each other.
His challenges are without precedence, but we know that our best answer is about the type of empathy, cooperation and Community strengthening at the world level, which is at the heart of this organization.
The partnership and the well-being that we have observed among all our colleagues in electronic mails, calls and immediate conversations are a marvelous witness of the unbelievable human beings with whom we have the opportunity to work.
I couldn't be more appreciative and proud to all of you among my colleagues.
Last week, someone made me part of his gratitude for our work.
This person recalled me how important it is for the world to be able to consult Wikipedia at the present time, and the strong symbol that represents the fact that this essential resources remain online and available to all.
This is possible thanks to your work, which you maintain the operational websites, to pay our colleagues or to the security of our communities.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a moment where not only what we do, but also how we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
As a result of the importance of this mission and the role you play on it, we will process resulting adjustments in the way we work together from the next week.
Adjustments of our work and time jobs
As Robyn mentioned above, the team was meeting last night to discuss our approach and our job of time in the days and months to come.
During this conversation, we considered what would be an appropriate response to the situation we face and the best way to ensure the organisation's sustainability during this period.
We first tried to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to take back, don't worry.
All staff members, subtractors and contractors:
our daily work time goal will be around 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week to new order.
We will not declare holiday day: if you are able to ensure more normal working hours, you may be useful for the mission.
However, the world is unpredictable at the current time, and if you need to take care of your neighbors, to cut courses or to consult a doctor, your welfare is our priority.
We're not watching your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
That should go without saying, but we're gonna say it.
No illness or payment stop required: Prevent your superior and help your team review time calendars and jobs to ensure that the main work areas are covered.
(If you are positively diagnosed in COVID-19, please prevent Bryan from the T&amp;C Division to help you and ensure that your situation receives the necessary attention from the direction.)
The temporary staff will be completely paid.
We have already announced it, and we will reiterate our commitment to respect our responsibilities to our sub-traders and colleagues of temporary staff.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of its ordinary working hours carried out in normal conditions.
That's if you're sick and in the ability to work.
If you want to work, we will support you.
Many people use the work as a way to evacuate their stress related to the world around us.
What we are doing can be incredibly gratifying, especially in periods such as it.
Once again, the goal is to keep you.
We simply ask you to communicate with your top, so that we know what we expect and can take the necessary provisions.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There's some things we need to continue to do.
SRE teams, Ops RH, Confiance & amp; Security and fund collection (including other) carry out an essential work that might need to strengthen.
We will start a process with all departments to assess the current objectives and focus on supporting fundamental tasks for our mission.
There is enough work for each of us, we will simply focus on the most essential projects.
Ralentir now will not be bad later.
We don't intend to "work more than two times to take the lost time" when pandemic will pass.
We will not ask you to make additional hours to comply with unrealistic deadlines now.
We recognize that the circumstances have changed, and we will try to establish new objectives and to achieve the case.
What is the APP (annual planning)?
In order to adapt us to our new reality and to daily worktime objectives, we intend to adjust the timetable for the delivery of our Annual Plan 2020-2021.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which provides more time to establish a budget to allow employees to focus on the essential work, care for them and their neighbors, while adapting to those who need or want to see their reduced work time in the coming weeks.
This extension of the extents significantly reduces the labour charge and the pressure of current planning in the whole organization.
We will submit our proposal to the Council in the next week, and we will inform the delegates and teams of the next steps as confirmed.
Thanks for the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Situation, exposure and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues based in San Francisco could have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, by exceeding prudence, we called a antiviral cleaning team to desinfect all the surfaces of the San Francisco Bureau.
They used a hospital quality antiviral solution to desinfect all surfaces, as well as the entry hall and the ascensor boxes leading to our floor.
The building has requiring its own protocol of diligence duty that uses products that ensure the safety of its locations.
We are convinced that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return.
Our Washington DC office is located in a WeWork location, which shared with us and all the members of the staff based in Washington DC its COVID 19 protocol.
Since last week, our Washington DC office has adopted a completely distance configuration in accordance with San Francisco's advice.
As we know some of our colleagues established in New York, we also discussed the idea to locate a local in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue, but they could be adjusted.
Some of our colleagues work at distance for the first time.
Our distance work colleagues realize that adjustment can be difficult and wished to offer you a few advice:
Reduce the duration of meetings at meetings of one or two hours.
If longer meetings are needed, consider to divide them several days.
Determine the meeting clearly, have a agenda and send the documentation forward.
Make the standard, thanks to tools such as Google Docs and Zoom, to encourage cooperation and direct exchanges.
A coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the immediate conversation and the list of speakers, and someone who helps to take notes (or take a collective note).
Send an email to technical support if you need a comfortable box.
Use your good payment for collations.
To join the #remoties on Slack to talk to your colleagues of the work distribution
The RH Operation team is studying the ergonomic guidelines based on weblinarys to support increased work distribution in the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all the beneficiaries of the Community's subsidiary to cancel public events financed by Wikimedia, such as the editors, until WHO announces the end of pandemic.
We have explained that we understand that our demands for cancellation and other restrictions could not make it possible to achieve their agreed subsidiary activities and that no one would be punished in cases of delay or amendment of these objectives.
The next week, we published additional Wikimania directives and other thematic and regional Community conferences.
The general sense of the international community seems to be angry towards the smuggling and smoothing and clearness and the possibility of focusing on its own communities, Wikimedia and others.
As soon as possible, the CRT works for the creation of a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space so that the community can monitor the impact and continue our communications with them.
Keep in contact despite the problems related to COVID-19
We will send a invitation to your calendar for a extraordinary meeting of the next Thursday staff, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will benefit from this moment to share other updates, answer your questions and take together time.
This situation concerns us all and we are here to help you in any way.
From here you can always find the information contained in this e-mail, as well as all other essential information related to COVID-19, about the Wiki Office.
The CRT will update these pages and gather all the information on the same place.
We are also striving to maintain regular communications with the members of the resident personnel in countries that are now seriously affected.
If you have questions regarding movements, events, an important flow of work or covering difficulties, or if you need help for anything else, don't hesitate to prevent and work with CRT.
We're here to support you and ensure the connection as appropriate.
For any confidential or sensitive issue, please send an email to Bryan Judan, Director of International Global Operations RH.
No of these amendments should be considered as a leave of our work and our obligations.
This is the contrary to recognise that at the present time our work and our responsibilities must probably be adapted in a way without previous.
These steps are the necessary to support us mutually and to continue our work, to provide our movement the help that it needs, and to provide the world's service on which everyone can account.
Our planned work will be here to wait for the moment coming.
For this moment, it is time to get married and prepare for the important work that will arrive in weeks and maybe the months to come.
We need each of you to reach it, that's why you need to keep and take care of your families so that you can give the best time of yourself.
Finally, if you go: Lay your hands and don't touch your face!

b'The conversion enzyme of angiotensine 2 (ACE2) is a enzyme related to the external face (cellular membranes) of the pulmonary cells, arts, hearts, kings and intestins.
ACE2 against the activity of the conversion enzyme of angiotensine (ACE) by reduced the quantity of angiotensin II and increased the Ang (1-7), which makes it a promising medication target in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.
The human version of the enzyme is often designated under the name of HACE2.
Angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme is a metalenzyme containing the zinc situated on the surface of the endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains a M2 peptidase area of termination N and a range of renal amino acid collector at the end of C.
ACE2 is a single membrane protein of type I, with the active area on the enzymatic level is exposed on the surface of the pulmonary cells and other tissue.
The extracellular area of the ACE2 is cut from the transmembranary area by another enzyme called icedae; the solutional protein that is in result is released in the blood flow and finally excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is presented in most organs: ACE2 is connected to cell membrane primarily to the cell cells of the type II pulmonary alveols, the enterocytes of the green intestin, the artery and veinary cells and the arterial cells of the lick muscles of most organs.
The expression of the ACE2 ARN is also presented in the brain cortex, striatum, hypohalamus and the cerebral tronk.
The primary function of ACE2 is to compensate the ECE.
The ACE clevers angiotensin I hormone in angiotensin II vasoconstrictor.
ACE2 clicked to its tour the fenylamin amino acid with carboxyle of angiotensine II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Pro-Phe) and hydroxy in angiotensin vasodilatector (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also accumulate several other peptides, including [-Arg9]-bradykinine, appleline, neurotensine, dinorphine A, and ghreline.
ACE2 also regulates the membership of the neutric amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmember protein, ACE2 is the main entry point in certain coronavirus cells, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus original of COS), and SARS-CoV-2 (the COVID-19 virus).
More specifically, the connection of SARS-CoV-CoV-Spiel protein S1 and SARS-CoV2 to the enzymatic field of ACE2 on the surface of cells resulting in enzytosis and translocation both of virus and enzyme in endosomas located within the cells.
This entry process also requires the lovement of S protein by hosted protein TMPRSS2, the inhibition of this last fact is now the object of inspection as potential treatment. This leads some to think that ACE2 rates in cells may contribute to combating infection.
However, several professional companies and regulatory bodies recommended to continue standard treatment through AEC and ARB inhibitors.
A systematic review and a meta analysis published on 11 July 2012 showed that “the use of ECE inhibitors has been associated with a significant reduction of 34% of the pneumonia risk in relation to witnesses.”
In addition, “the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced in patients treated by ACE inhibitors that had higher pneumonia risks, in particular AVC victims and cardiac deficiency.
The use of ECE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia related mortality, although the results were less probable than for the global pneumonia risk.”
Human recombinant angiotensine 2 enzyme (rhACE2) is pressed as innovating treatment of severe pulmonary lesions and seems to improve pulmonary hemodynamic and oxygen saturation in porcels reached by acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by lipopolisaccharide.
The half-vive of rhACE2 in humans is around 10 hours and the action period is 30 minutes over the (during) period of 24 hours.
several conclusions suggest that rhACE2 could be a promising medicine for persons intolerant to the classical inhibitors of the retina-angiotensine system (SRA) or for diseases with high angiotensin II. rhACE2 was evaluated in the context of clinical testing for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are mobile applications to facilitate contact tracking in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the identification of persons likely to be contacted with a infected individual.
Several applications have been developed or proposed, with the official support of the Government on certain territories and in certain courts.
several infrastructures have been designed for contact trace applications.
These systems, in particular those who are on the track of the geographical location of users of applications, substantive issues regarding the respect of private life.
There are other less intrusive options, including the use of Bluetooth signals to store the nearness of a user with other portable phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced the direct integration into Android and IOS systems of functionality to support these Bluetooth applications.
The Chinese government, in association with Alipay, has deployed an application in China that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with the port of COVID-19 people.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore has opted for a application called TraceTogether.
Developed by a local informant community, it was provided in an open source and will be delivered to the government. The Northern Macedonia launched an Bluetooth application which ensures the transmission of exposure to potentially infected persons and quickly communicated with health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
Since April 14, 2020, the application was in wait for approval by Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the implementation of contact trace was at a advanced stage of development and could be deployed during the next weeks.
Australia and New Zealand consider the establishment of applications on the TraceTogether model in Singapore and on the basis of the BlueTrace Protocol. Russia wants to introduce a geo-operation application for patients with a COVID diagnostic and resident in Moscow to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Safety Ingenieur at the University of Cambridge, addressed several practical problems related to the use of application systems, including positive and the lack of potential efficiency if only a small part of the population uses the application.
In response to concerns about the diffusion of false or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple authorizes only the "official" or generally confidence bodies to add applications related to the App Store.
Google and Amazon applied similar restrictions.
Warriors for the protection of private life have been concerned about the implications of the coronavirus applications in mass monitoring, in particular the possibility of the infrastructure of monitoring created to address the pandemic of coronavirus once the distant threat.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have published a statement to restrict this type of monitoring.
These organizations have established eight conditions to comply with government projects:
monitoring should be “legal, necessary and proportional”;
monitoring and monitoring extensions should include extinction clauses;
the use of data should be limited to the goals of combating COVID-19;
data security and anonym should be protected in a demonstrable manner;
digital supervision should ensure that any exacerbation of discrimination and marginalization should be avoided;
any share of data with third parties should be defined in the law;
Provision of protection against abuse and remedies for citizens in the case of abuses should be provided;
The "important participation" of all "relevant parties" would be binding, including the ones of public health experts and marginalized groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and unlimited Reporter (Reporter without border) (RSF) also published check lists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of continuing monitoring by removing the control mechanism of the exploitation system of their devices as long as it will not be necessary.
Some countries have used a network geolocalization system instead of applications, which eliminates both the need for downloading application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, the network trace was approved.
Network solutions with access to brutal geolocalization data are important potential problems in respect of private life.
However, all systems on central servers do not need to access personal location data; several systems have been created in order to use central servers only for intercommunication, which allows to respect private life (see next section).
In South Korea, no application was used for contact tracking.
Instead of using a detailed application, the system collected trace information to various sources, including the data of tracking of mobile devices and card transactions, which they have then associated to send SMS warnings to potentially infected persons.
In addition to the use of such information to warn potential contacts, the Government also provided information on localization available to the public, which was authorized following the deep changes in the information protection laws of confidence after the epidemic of MERS that had affected this country.
These information are available to the public by several web applications and websites. Countries such as Germany have considered the use of centralized systems that preserve private life.
The details have not yet been reported on 6 April 2020.
The trace of contacts with private life is a well-established concept, which has been established by a large data volume since 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a twenty-five of experts groups worked on solutions regarding private life, including Bluetooth Low Energy technology (BLE) to register the nearness of a user with other portable phones.
However, the PEP-PT project is a coordinated efforts that associates centralized and decentralized approaches and does not constitute a unique protocol. The decentralized protocols Englobated Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (CN, old contact numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT), among others.
These protocols are enabled to ensure that the identification personal data never leave the device and that all corresponding devices are performed on the device.
The Privacy Group of MIT Media Lab is currently developed by SafePaths, a private life conservation technique platform in the collection and use of data of location or contact to monitor the propagation of COVID-19.
This technique is based on the results of the white book "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an epidemic" published in March 2020. The SafeTrace Platform of Enigma MPC, a company that develops private life protection technologies, which is initially based on MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses safe material technology to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities, without engaged in confidentiality.
On 5 April 2020, international TCN Coalition was established by groups assembled around a common approach and protocols essentially equivalent to reducing fragmentation and ensuring the global interoperability of trace and warning applications, an essential factor of their adoption by a wide public.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced the publication of the source code of the BlueTrace Protocol used by its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which controlled Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact trace initiative, declaring that it would enable private life to maintain and associate Bluetooth Low Energy technology and a confidential cryptography.
They also published the specifications of the basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
deployment of tools to enable Governments to create official transaction applications of the coronavirus in respect of private life
Direct integration of this functionality in iOS and Android. Google and Apple are intended to resolve the problems for the adoption of the solution and continuity of monitoring by initially distributing the system through the update of the operating system and then removeing it once the distant threat.
The reposition of a medicine (as well known as reorientation, reprofilation, re-administration or re-administration or change of therapeutic indication of a medicine) designates the conversion of an authorised medicine for a disease or a different medical affection from which it was initially developed.
This is an current scientific research axis to develop safe and efficient treatment against COVID-19.
Other research axis include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and the transfusion of plasma of convalence people. SARS-CoV-2 presents about 66 therapeutic target protections, each of them has several ligaments linking sites.
The analysis of these link sites offers the real development of an effective antiviral drug against COVID proteins.

It can't be sure for pregnant women or those trying to procreate.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a association of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirals, concluded that "no benefit was observed".
These medicines have been designed to inhibit HIV replication in relation to protease.
A Colorado University research team tries to modify these medicines to find a composite linked to SARS-CoV-2 protection. There are critics in the scientific community regarding the use of resources for the reposition of medicinal products specially for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in international Solidarity test.
The redésivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as the treatment of Ebola virus and the virus of Marburg. Gilead Sciences later found that the redistribution had an antiviral activity in vitro against several philosovirs, pneumonius, paramyxovirus and coronavirus.
A problem of antiviral treatment is the development of a resistance by the bleeding of mutations that can generate more severe disease and transmission.
Some early studies suggest that redésivir may have a high genetic barrier against resistance. Several clinical trials are in place, among which two of Cleveland university hospitals are conducted; one of the people suffering from a moderate pathology and the other on those reached by more serious forms.
There are three current clinical tests on vitamin C for patients who are hospitalized and seriously ill with COVID-19; two controlled against placebo (China and Canada) and one without control (Italia).

A multicentric study of 300 patients and studied the use of sodium ennoxaparin in preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a large number of researchers focused on the reposition of approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for previous epidemics such as MERS, NAS and West Nil virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th issue of Chinese guidelines
Umifennovir: Umphenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th issue of Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially repositionable as COVID treatments-19:
tocilizumab (anti-receptor-IL-6): approved by China.
Tests are also undergoing in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab #COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetic vaccine against coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed clinical tests, many development attempts are undergoing.
Finally, in February 2020, the World Health Organization (OMS) stated that no vaccine was expected against SARS-CoV-2, disease virus, at least 18 months before.
In April, five vaccines were under the I phase security study.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major epidemic has been declared over the world in 2020, resulting in significant investments and research to develop vaccine.
Many organizations use the genes published to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Defined in April, the imperatives of the CEPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, ECPI scientists indicated that 10 different technological platforms were conducted in research and development projects at the beginning of 2020 in order to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The targets of the previous main platform in phase security studies include:
Nucleic acid (ADN and ARN) (developer I phase and candidate vaccine: modern, mRNA-1273)
Virus vector (Fase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, adenoviral vector type 5)
As the CEPI scientists stated in April, 115 vaccine candidates are in the first development centres of 78 (79 according to the Milken Institute) confirmed as active and 37 other announced, but with few available public information (presummary in planning or design).
A I-II test of preliminary safety and immunity tests, is normally randomised, controlled against placebo and performed in several centres, while determined more effective doses.
Phase III tests usually include more participants, including a witness group, and test the effectiveness of vaccine in the prevention of disease, while monitoring the indeseable effects of the optimal dose.

This means that they can provide benefits beyond their predicting disease.
Another randomized test in Australia prescribes 4 170 health professionals.
It is possible to not be sure or effective for the current development vaccines.
Initial research to evaluate the efficiency of a vaccine using specific COVID-19 animal models, such as ACE-2 transgenic mouses, other laboratory animals, non-human primates, indicate the need to implement bio-safety confidence measures for life virus manipulation and international coordination to ensure standardized security procedures.
Vacuums against OAS and MERS were tested on non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no curative or protective vaccine against the SAS that has demonstrated both security and effectiveness in humans.
According to research documents published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat the SAS were a priority for world governments and health agencies. There is no vaccine tested against MERS.
When the MERS was broken, it was thought that existing OAS research could serve models to develop vaccines and medicines against infection with MERS-CoV.
In March 2020, a single vaccine against the MERS (based on DNA) had been completed by the clinical phase I tests in humans and three other were in progress; all vaccines were viral vectors, two to adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Publications on social networks distributed a complex theory that the virus from COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
Patents referred to in several social network publications refer to existing patents on genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus shoes such as the coronavirus of the SAS.
The disease of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a infectious disease caused by Coronavirus 2 related to severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Current symptoms include fiber, all and smooth.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscular pain, diarree, gorge pain, loss of ghost and abdominal pain.
The time between the exposure and the appearance of symptoms is generally about five days, but it can strike between two and fourty days.
While most of the cases generate moderate symptoms, some evolve to a viral pneumonia and a deficiency of several organs.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in the world in 210 countries and territories, generating more than 153.000 deaths.
More than 568 000 people have been healed: the virus is mainly produced at close contacts, often by balls produced by all, ever or speaking.
These bottles are produced at the distance, generally falling on the ground or on surfaces instead of representing an infectional risk on long distances.
People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface, then touching their eyes, nausea or mouth.
Virus can survive on surfaces up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious in the first three days after the appearance of symptoms, although the contagion is possible before the symptoms appear and during the following phases of disease. The standard test method uses the inverse transmission of polymeracea in real time (RT-PCR).
The use of masks is recommended for those who think they are infected by the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations on mask ports by public generally vary, some authorities recommend their use, other recommending their use, and others still imply their use.
No vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19 exists currently.
Local transmission of disease was recorded in most countries of WHO's six regions.
The virus infected persons may be asymptomatic or develop grip symptoms such as fever, tumor, fatigue, sweating.
Emergency symptoms include difficulties to breathe, pain or continuing thoracic pressure, confusion, difficulties to walk and blue face or lips; in the presence of these symptoms, it is advised to consult a doctor immediately.
Not frequently, higher respiratory symptoms such as eternity, birth or gorge pain can be observed.
Gastro-Instinal symptoms such as nausea, digestion and diarrey were observed in different proportions.
Some cases in China initially presented only a thoracic pressure and palpitations.
In some, disease may cause pneumonia, deficiency of several organs and death.
That's what we call the incubation period.
The COVID-19 incubation period is normally five to six days, but it may go up to 14 days.
97.5% of people who are developing symptoms will do it within 11,5 days after infection, and reports indicate that all infected persons will not develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic drivers in transmission is not yet completely known, but preliminary elements suggest that they could contribute to the dissemination of disease.
The proportion of infected persons who do not present symptoms is currently unknown and at the study. Korean prevention and control centres (CDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their hospitalization.
The Chinese National Health Committee began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; on 166 infections observed this day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
Expectorization and salt may both be transported from important viral charges.
The fact of speaking stronger lies more than the fact of speaking normally.
A study in Singapore revealed that all of them without protection can design balls at a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not generally transported by the air, the National Science Academy suggested that bioaerosol transmission could be possible and that air collectioners were placed in the pool outside the patients' rooms have produced positive samples to the virus ARN.
Some medical procedures such as injury and cardiopulmonary reanimation (RCP) may disperse respiratory secreations and therefore lead to air propagation.
Although there are concerns about the propagation by the seals, this risk is seen as weak. Virus is the most contagious when people have symptoms; although propagation may be possible before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Prevention and Diseases Control (ECDC) states that if we do not know exactly what illness is breeding, a person generally contain two to three other persons.
precisely, the virus could be detected on the card one day, three days on the plastic (polypropylene) and inoxydable axe (IASI 304) and 4 hours on cows to 99%.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
Savine and detergents are also effectively used as well; savine products degrad the protective lipidemic skin of the virus, which disables skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalconium chloride and chloroxydine glucoonate (a surgical desinfective) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, salt samples were produced in average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five patients on six, the first sample showed the highest viral charge, while the highest viral charge was at the sixth patient at the second day tested.
The coronavirus 2 linked to severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new responsible coronavirus of the severe respiratory syndrome, initially isolated in three persons affected by pneumonia in the home of Whan’s acute respiratory disease.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are presented in the coronavirus apparent in nature.
In the outside of the human body, the virus is destroyed by domestic saving, which breaks its protective cover. SARS-CoV-2 is a nearby parent of the origin SARS-CoV SARS.
The pulmones are the most touched organs by COVID-19 because virus is accessible to host cells through angiotensine 2 (ACE2), which is the most abundant in lymph alveolary cells.
Virus uses a specific surface glucoprotein called “picture” (pleplemmare) to connect to ECE 2 and to pull in the host cell.
Augle heart lessons were reported in 12% of the people administered to the Hospital of Whan in China, and are more frequent when disease is worse.
The rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to the systematic inflammatory response and immune disorders during the progress of the disease, however, myocard acute lessons can also be related to ECE 2 receptives in the heart.
ACE 2 receptors are strongly expressed in the heart and in the hearts involved.
A high effect of thrombosis (31%) and veinable thromboembolic disease (25%) was observed in patients in intensive care units of COVID-19 infections and may be associated with defective prognosis. The autopsis of deceived COVID-19 disorders demonstrated divergent allergy (DAD) and inflammation infiltrators containing symptoms.
While SARS-COV-2 presents a tropism for the epidemic cells of the respiratory ways expressing the ECE-2, patients attained in COVID-19 are severe symptoms of systematic hyperinflammation.
These are in particular GM-CSF secreatory T cells that have been associated with the recruitment of inflammation monocytes secreted by IL6 and the severe pulmonary pathology of patients reached by COVID-19.
Lymphocytic infiltrators have also been reported in autopsie.
WHO published several test protocols for disease.
The standard test method uses the inverse transscription of polymerara reaction in real time (rRT-PCR).
The test is generally carried out on respiratory samples obtained by rhinopharynge precipitation; however, a nasal or exectoral precipitation can also be used.
Generally, the results are available in a few hours, even up to two days.
Blood tests can also be used, but they require two blood injuries taken at two weeks of interval and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists could isolate a coronavirus shock and publish the genetic sequence so that laboratorys all over the world could develop independently on the tests of a chain polymeration reaction (CRP) to detect virus infection.
On 4 April 2020, anti-corps tests (disceptable to deceive active infections and previous infections of a person) were in development, but not yet largely used.
The Chinese test experience showed a specification of only 60 to 70 %.
The FDA in the United States has adopted the first test near the patient on 21 March 2020 to be used at the end of this month. diagnostic guidelines published by the Whan University Hospital suggest methods of detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risks.
Multi-lobary bilateral depolis options with a device, asymétric and posteral distribution are typical symptoms visible at the beginning of the infection.
Domination under pleurale, crazy paving (seven interlobulary switch with variable alveolary compression) and consolidation may appear with the progression of disease.
Many data are available on microscopical lessons and COVID-19 pathhysiology.
The main pathological findings of autopsie are:
Macroscopie : laughness, pericardit, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary odem
Four types of viral pneumonia gravity may be observed:
Moderate pneumonia : pulmonary odema, pneumonic hyperplasis, atypical pneumonics extensive, interstituteal inflammation with lymphocytal infiltration and multinucleated gene cells
Severe pneumonia: diffused alveolary damage (DAD) with alveolary exposure diffused.
DAD is the cause of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) and serious hypoxymia.
Hepatic pneumonia: organising exsumed in alveolary cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrose
Sang : intravascular desemination (ICVD) ; leuco-erythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include resting at themselves, avoiding bonded places, laying the hands in water and saving at least 20 seconds, having a good breathing hygiene and avoid touching the eyes, nausea or mouth with unleavened hands.
The CDC recommends to cover the mouth and nail with a skin when it is sweet or permanent and to use the inside of the cow in the absence of shoot.
A correct hygiène of hands is recommended after sweating or everlasting.
The CDC recommended to cover the face by using a tissue in public places in order to limit transmission in cases asymptomatic individuals. Social distance strategies aim to reduce the contact of persons infected with large groups by stoping schools and workplaces, reducing movements and cancelling the important regrouping of persons.
The distance directives include also the compliance of a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) minimum between persons.
There is no drug known to be effective in the prevention of COVID-19. Since a vaccine has not been expected before 2021, a key element of COVID-19 management is to try to reduce epidemic pic, which is also called “approving the curve”.
The CDC also recommends the individuals to lay the hands often in the saving and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after having been at the toilets or when the hands are visiblely salt; before eating; and after being mourned, hesited, or permanent.
It also recommends to use a desinfect solution for alcohol base hands containing at least 60% of alcohol but only if water and saving is not available. For areas where desinfectants for trade hands are not available, WHO proposes two forms for a local production.
In these forms, antimicrobian activity originates from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial sprays in alcohol, it is not “un active anti-septic substance for hands”.
Glycerol is added as humidant.
Persons are treated by support care that can include hydrogen treatment, oxygenotherapy and support other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that people suspected to be virus portfolio have a simple facial mask.
Extracorporal oxygenation by membrane (ECMO) was used to treat respiratory deficiency cases, but its benefits are still analyzed.
Personal hygiene, healthy life mode and food were recommended to promote immunity.
Support treatments can be useful for those who have pre-infected symptoms. WHO and the Chinese National Health Committee have published recommendations for the care of hospitalized persons for COVID-19.
Reanimators and pneumonics in the United States gathered therapeutic recommendations made from several agencys in a free resource, IBCC.
In April 2020 there is no specific treatment of COVID-19.
With regard to symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamole (acetaminofene) instead of the first line ibuprofene.
Precautions should be taken to minimise the risk of transmission of virus, especially in care conditions when the implementation of the procedures can generate aerosols such as insulting or manual ventilation.
For health care professionals with COVID-19, the CDC recommends to place the person in a isolated room to airway infection (IIR) and to use standard precautions, contact precautions and precautions for air traffic transmission. The CDC stresses the guidelines on the use of individual protection equipment during pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: PPE Blue, respiratory or facial mask, eye protection and medical gants. If available, respiratory masks (facial masks).
N95 respiratory masks are approved in industrial conditions, but FDA allowed the use of these masks under an emergency use permit (USA).
They are designed to protect air pieces such as powder, but their effectiveness against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for non-specific uses.
When the masks are not available, the CDC recommends to use facial protection screens, or in the last time, artisan masks.
The majority of COVID-19 cases are not sufficiently severe to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases is.
The type of respiratory assistance for persons with high deficiency of COVID-19 is actively studied for hospitalized persons. Some evidence show that insulation can be avoided by using a high-frequencies natal or a positive pressure of respiratory ways at double level.
It is ignored if one of the two or both generates the same benefits for people in a critical state.
Some doctors prefer to keep the invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the distribution of aerosol particules compared to a high-frequency natal skin. The serious cases are more frequent in adults (they more than 60 years of age, and in particular more than 80 years).
Many developed countries do not have sufficient hospital beds by persons, which limit the capacity of the care system to handle a smooth number of cases of COVID-19 sufficiently serious to need hospitalization.
A study in China showed that 5% of the cases were admissible in intensive care, 2.3% had needed respiratory assistance and 1.4% decreased.
In China, about 30% of the hospitalized with COVID-19 are finally admissible in intensive care.
Mechanic ventilation becomes more complex with the development of the acute respiratory respiratory syndrome (SDRA) during COVID-19 and oxygenation is more difficult.
ventilation devices offering pressure control modes and high PEEP are required to optimisize oxygen deliverance and minimise the risk of pulmonary lesion associated with ventilation and pneuthorax.
The highest PEEP cannot be available on older venture devices.
Research of potential treatments to be started in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are subject to clinical tests.
Redesivir seems to be the most promising one.
Although new medicines can not be developed before 2021, several testing medicines have already been approved in other indications and tests have already been advanced.
An antiviral medicine may be tested in persons suffering serious disease.
WHO recommended volunteers to participate in tests on potential effectiveness and security of treatment, and FDA granted an temporary authorisation to plasma convalents as an experimental treatment in cases where the life of the person is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not been subjected to clinical trials to demonstrate security and effectiveness for disease.
In February 2020, China started a mobile application to manage epidemic.
Users are requested to enter their name and an identifier.
The application is able to detect close contacts by using monitor data and therefore detect a potential infection risk.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application is not only recommended by the quarter, it also warns the local health authorities. The analysis of the massive data of mobile phone data, the facial recognition technology, the localization of mobile phones and the artificial intellectuality are used to localize infected persons and those with which they have been contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli Government allowed security agencies to place mobile telephone data from suspected persons to have the coronavirus.
The measures aimed at respecting the quartenine and protecting people who could have been in contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Germany Telekom shared aggregate phone location data with the Federal Government Agency, Robert Koch, to analyze and prevent virus propagation.
Russia has deployed the facial recognition technology to detect people who do not respect the quarter.
In Italy, the Regional Minister of Health, Giulio Gallera, has been informed by mobile telephone operators that “40 per cent of people continue to move.”
The German Government conducted a hackathon weekend of 48 hours with more than 42.000 participants.
The Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid launched a global call to find creative solutions to prevent the propagation of the coronavirus.
Persons may suffer from Quartaine, movement restrictions, secondary effects of treatment or fear of infection themselves.
BBC quoted Rory O'Connor, which states: “Augmented social isolation, solitude, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are a perfect cocktail to smell mental health and people’s welfare.”
The disease may have a moderate evolution with little or not symptoms, similar to other common diseases of respiratory ways like rhome.
Moderate cases are generally retailed in two weeks, while the serious or critical cases require three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may present a higher risk of COVID-19 infection, according to similar virus data, such as COVID and MERS, but there is no data for COVID-19. In some cases COVID-19 may affect pounds and cause pneumonia.
In the most severely touched cases, COVID-19 can rapidly progress towards a syndrome of acute respiratory deterioration (SDRA) caused respiratory deficiency, sectic shock or multivisual deficiency.
COVID-19 complications include setticemia, coagulation disorders and heart, renal and hepatic lessons.
Coagulation disorders, especially an increase in prothrombine time, were described in 6% of the hospitalized cases with COVID-19, with renal insufficiency observed in 4% of the people of this group.
About 20 to 30 per cent of people at COVID-19 have a high rate of hepatic enzymes (transamines).
According to the same report, the average time between the start of symptoms and death was ten days, with five past in hospitalization.
However, patients transferred to intensive care had a average period of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an early study of cases, the average period between the start of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total beach between six and 41 days.
In a study of the Chinese Health Committee (NHC), men presented a mortality rate of 2.5 per cent, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7 per cent.
The histopathological exams of post-mortal pulmonary samples present a general damage with fibromyxoide cellular exsoms in both pounds.
Virus cytopathic changes were observed in pneumonites.
The image of the pulmone is similar to a acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
On 11,8% of deaths reported by the National Health Committee, cardiac lessions resulting from high troponin rates or heart arrests have been observed.
According to the data from Mars from the United States, 89 per cent of hospitalized persons had preexistent pathology, and medical resources and socio-economic conditions of a region may also have an impact on mortality.
The estimates of disease mortality vary because of these regional differences, but also because of methodological difficulties.
The sub-numbering of moderate cases may result in overview of mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of previously contracted cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Fumors were 1.4 times more enclined to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and have a risk of 2.4 times higher in intensive care or decrease in non-food disease.
Hospital administration in Hong Kong observed a decline of 20 to 30 per cent of respiratory capacity in some healthy persons, and pulmonary scanners suggest organic lesions.
This may also be conducted in an intensive syndrome after treatment.
In March 2020, it was ignored if an previous infection had an effective long-term immunity in disease-related persons.
Immunity is considered likely, on the basis of the behaviour of other coronavirus, but cases of healing of COVID-19 tests at a later date have been reported.
These cases are considered as a aggravation of a late infection instead of reinfection.
It is thought that virus is natural and animal origin, through the propagation of infection.
The real origin of the virus is unknown, but in December 2019 the propagation of infection was almost only conducted by human transmission.
A study of the first 41 cases confirmed by COVID-19 published in The Lancet in January 2020 showed that the most old date of appearance of symptoms was returned to 1 December 2019.
Official publications of WHO indicated the first appearance of symptoms on 8 December 2019.
several measures are usually used to assess mortality.
These figures vary according to regions and in time, and are affected by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the therapeutic options, the time from the beginning of epidemic, as well as demogmatic characteristics such as age, gender and health status.
Finally 2019, WHO affected the pathological emergency codes of CIM-10 U07.1 for infected diseases in the laboratory infection in SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for cases of COVID-19 diagnosed by clinical or epidemic point of view without infection to SARS-CoV-2 confirmed in laboratory. The Dece/ca report reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given period.
According to Johns-Hopkins University Statistics, the world's death/case report is 6.9 per cent (153 822/2 240 191) to 17 April 2020.
Other measures include letality rates (CFR) which reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals that decreased from disease and the rate of infected letality (IRF) which reflects the percentage of infected persons (diagnosed or not).
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of disease.
Although all infected people do not develop anticorps, the presence of anticorps may indicate the number of persons infected.
In the epidemia epidemia in Italy, a small village of 4600 inhabitants, 80 of them (1,7%) have already been deceived.
In Gangelt, sickness was promoted by festivals, and young people, generating relatively low mortality rates, and all diseases related to COVID-19 may not have been officially classified as such.
Furthermore, the German health system has not been discovered.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of people may have anti-corps, according to a blood donors assessment.
69 deaths (0.004 per cent of the population) were confirmed as COVID-19.
The impact of pandemia and mortality are different in men and women.
Mortality is higher in humans in studies carried out in China and Italy.
The highest risk is in the five-year-old men, the difference between men and women who disappeared by only 90 years of age.
In China, the death rate was 2.5 per cent in men and 1,7 per cent in women.
The specific reasons for this difference between gender are unknown, but genetics and behavior factors could be part of it.
Immunological differences according to gender, the lower prevalence of smooth smooth smooth smooth and development in man comrbidity, such as hypertension at less advanced age than in women could have contributed to a higher mortality in man.
In Europe, 57 per cent of infected persons were men and 72 per cent of COVID-19 people were men.
In April 2020, the United States does not collect the data associated with COVID-19 infections.
Studies showed that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influence and SAS affect men and women.
A higher percentage of health personnel, in particular nursing personnel, are women and are a increased risk of being exposed to virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of disease would be COVID-19.
The Director-General of WHO Thedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means corona, VI means virus and D meaning disease, 19 as the first identification of epidemic: 31 December 2019.
This name has been selected to avoid references to a specific geographical place (e.g. China) to a animal species or to a group of people, in accordance with international namenclature recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The virus caused by COVID-19 is called coronavirus 2 related to the severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses “COVID-19” and “COVID-19” in its public communication.
The disease and virus are both commonly called "Cronavirus".
During the initial epidemic in Whan, China, virus and disease were often called “coronavirus” and “Whan’s coronavirus.”
In January 2020, WHO recommended the use of provisional disease names 2019-nCov and acute respiratory disease for virus and disease, in accordance with Directive 2015 against the use of places in names of diseases and virus.
Official COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Taking into account the capacity limits of standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers print the care material as ecublons and breathing parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed an emergency respiratory valve and the supplier could not supply it in time, a local startup recovered and printed the 100 valves required in a night.
After the initial epidemic of COVID-19, complex theories, false information and information have emerged on the origin, expansion, prevention, treatment and other aspects of disease and rapidly spread online.
It seems that man is able to promote disease to some other animals.
Studies have not been able to find viral replication evidence in porcs, canaries and powders.
No medicine or vaccine is approved to treat disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs against COVID-19 is currently conducted by government organizations, university groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched “SOLIDARITY” to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compositions with the most promising effectiveness.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are being actively developing vaccines.
Previous SARS-CoV work is used as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are both using the ACE 2 receptor to generate in human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are the object of research.
First, researchers try to create an entire virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, which is inactive or dead, aims to cause a rapid immune response to the human body in case of new COVID infection-19.
A second strategy, sub-unit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that acknowledges the immune system to some virus sub-units.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, these research focused on the S-pic protein that helps the virus to filtrate the ACE enzyme 2.
A third strategy is the vaccines based on nuclear acids (ADN vaccination or ARN, a new vaccination technology).
Experimental vaccines from all these strategies should be tested in terms of safety and effectiveness. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical test of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an inoffensive genetic code copyed on the virus that causes disease. Independent anticorps activation was suggested as a potential challenge in developing a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, but it is controversed.
In April 2020, more than 300 active clinical tests have been undertaken.
Seven tests have evaluated already treatments against malnutrition, including four studies on hydrochlorokine or cloroquine.
Converted antiviral drugs represent the majority of Chinese research, with nine clinical phase III tests on redésivir in several countries whose reports are expected at the end of April.
A dynamic analysis of the clinical development of vaccines and medicinal drugs against COVID-19 was also established in April 2020. several existing antiviral drugs are evaluated in the treatment of COVID-19, including redésivir, chlorokine and hydrochlorokine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir associated with beta interferon.
Provisional data suggested the efficiency of redessivir in March 2020.
Clinical improvements were observed in patients treated with compassional use redésivir.
Clinical phase III tests are undergoing in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, which was previously used for the treatment of malnutrition, was studied in February 2020, with preliminar results.
However, some request an independent analysis of research works.
Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend the use of cloroquin.
However, Whan’s Virus Institute, although recommending a daily dose of a gram, indicates that the double of this dose is very dangerous and may be mortal.
On 28 March 2020, FDA authorized the use of hydrochloroquin and chloroquin in accordance with an emergency use permit for the discretion of doctors with COVID patients-19. The 7th issue of Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umphenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirine are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for the continuation of an in vivo study after showing a low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies showed that the initial sculpture protein is aware of the transmembranary protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE 2.
The studies on cloroquin and hydrochlorokine with or without azithromycin have major limits that prevented the medical community to adopt these treatments without additional studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and does not present any role known in the treatment of COVI-19.
The cytokinic shock can be a complication in later COVID-19 cities.
There are evidence that hydrochloroquine can have cytokinic anti-choc. Tocilizumab was included in the guidelines of treatment by the Chinese National Health Committee after a small study has been conducted.
Fase 2 testing is being not randomized at national level in Italy after having demonstrated positive results in persons with a serious form of disease.
It should be contrary to such developments that are suspected to be caused by the death of some touched persons.
Interleukine-6 antagonist was approved by the FDA on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of the syndrome of refractial cytokine ratio caused by a different cause, the treatment by CAR T cells in 2017.
There is no randomized and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment of the SCR.
The transfer of concentrated and cleaned antibodies produced by immune systems of people healed from COVID-19 to those who need it is to study as a non-vacual method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for the SAS with few conclusive results.
Virus neutralization is the action mode expected by which passive anticorps treatment can generate defence against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as cell cytotoxicity depending on anticorps and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other passive antibiotic treatment forms, for example using monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
The production of convalence people, constituted from the liquid part of the blood of hepatitis patients and containing specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased for a faster deployment.
Coronavirus diseases, a closely apparent syndrome group
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Whan's Central Hospital, who then contracted the COVID-19 and died after the attention to the propagation of the virus.
