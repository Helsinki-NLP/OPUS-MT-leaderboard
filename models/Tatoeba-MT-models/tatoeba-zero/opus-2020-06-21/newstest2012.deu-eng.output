No free news for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian Parliament today rejected the request to decrease the paragraphs of the Criminal Act under which the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko was sentenced.
The new arrangement that could have been able to evacuate the Deputy Minister of Experience in the second reading of the request to reduce the penalties for economic crimes.
Timoshenko was sentenced in October because of the conclusion of an appropriately partial treaty with Russia on the purchase of gas to seven years of death.
The sentence is not yet legal, and in December the profession of the judges should be negotiated before the court.
Timoshenko even called the judgment as a political rush of the regime, and also in the West, the trial was condemned by the court's prejudiciary.
The request, paragraph 365, which was sentenced to remove the Minister of Experience from the Criminal Act, was supported by 147 Members.
226 votes would have been necessary for its approval.
Libyscher win
The history of Libyan liberation campaign or libycan rebellion already knows their losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is located in a unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners are to define.
Like him in this region, they are blessed in the elections of Islamics, the question is only what - the short or roots.
The National transition Council was known about the customs law of the Scharīa, which now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would be to the country without criminality, for the steel is shortly cut off.
Women should also forget the thoughts of emancipation as fast as possible, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, the society will be joined by the Coran for the future.
Kurtly - in Libya will rule a order that would be unprecedented in this country and, above all, would not be desirable.
Only - our life style is now not the only and objective one, probably not the best, and the displacement of the Libyans mentioned would be little suitable.
As you see, it is most comfortable that the moslim fighters have always helped the unbelieving dogs.
The fact may be that the NATO air attacks are not by any General from America, but by God itself, which has been led to all the power after every succession.
The winners in Libyan?
We only took part in a shock, servicing the interests of the Islam and our politicians, we were dealing with the person of the dictator of a political partner, without that it had benefited any benefits.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghan and Iraq, we looked better after a Libyan military rule.
This is how the snakes are worried - the disappearance of the cross drivers.
But without occupation, the mineral oil companies become the black gold to the spott price?
However, the western can finally end up with the right of his self-defence in matters of protection of human rights.
If this is not to destroy the Sharīa decreetors.
Starting a new crisis age
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of investors.
On Monday, a statistical storm was needed by Europe.
The individual States published their information on their BIP for the 3. Quartal.
The twenty-fourth economy was slightly slopeing in comparison with the Premierquarter, Germany and France.
The obligation market is now all of the records.
Investors are not only in Greece but also in Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical officials of the European Zone, Germany, Czech Republic and some other European countries published their provisions on economic development in the third quarter.
Germany expected that the GDP was 0.5%, which was 0.4% from France.
At the same time, both countries corrected their data for the second quarter, in which Germany marked a higher growth as originally expected (which was 0.3% predicted instead of 0.1%), while France had a slight decline of 0.1% (of the original data only said by stagnation).
The Czech economy was 1,5 per cent in this year compared to the previous year.
However, in comparison with the Premier Directorate, the Bruto Inlands product was stated and, according to Ts. Statistical Office, the trend of growth speed in economic performance.
Thus the results are worse than the analytical prognoses.
The most important events:
However, in this year's third quarter, the Czech economy was 1,5% compared to the previous quarter.
According to the preliminary and seasonal information, the German economy in the third quarter was 0.5%.
In the whole euro area and in the EU, the economy marked an increase of 0.2% in the previous quarter, which corresponds to the expectations of analytics.
The Greek economy was 5,2 per cent compared to the previous year.
The refunds from their 10-year-old State loan were 28.45%.
The residents of the Italian and Spanish state endorsed up to their critical borders.
Also Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries, start to feel problems...
Rendues in Czech State loan are less than 4%, even though the situation in the region is decreased.
In Germany, votes will be made to the ECB to be believers of the last institution.
The Czechs were qualified for Euro
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has measured the most serious task of the whole season!
Thanks to a good-building Torwarts śech and a beautiful gate of Petr Jiráček they won in Montenegro 1:0.
With a great portion, the Czech football was able to defend its luxurious pretension of the home game and will never again be missing at the European mastership.
IHNED.cz follows the rising game in an executive reporting.
We have a first half-time in the first half of the year and a riesenporation happiness in the second.
The Czech selection also wins thanks to the final chain of the homemanship, a brilliant śech's and the herd of the day Jiraček in Montenegro rightly blessed 1:0 and thus resolved her ticket for the football-EM.
Also, because of the precise defence game of the Czechian Manager, they have put the mountainegringers in the second half-time more pressure.
The pechs of the party were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who shocked two channels.
The Czech selection will also be communicated with the European Meetings, and it is also pleased that the home football has a premium of about 200 million.
From the first minutes of the battle ball was played right.
Both teams combined long-term and, in particular, the media lines were played.
In the second half-time, the press of the homemanship remained excited, and the wide explanations in front of the radiation were successfully disfellowshipped by the Czechian distortion.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They formed a living shield.
Some hundreds of high school students formed a living shield around a nuclear object in Iran.
They wanted to demonstrate their support for the nuclear programme of their country before a possible Israeli attack.
Students had prayed on Tuesday before the object and then proclaimed the death to the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students of the university in Iranian Isfahan formed a living shield around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan, which was processed in Uran on Tuesday.
In this way, they wanted to know that they were ready to protect the nuclear programme of their country, if necessary with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted in its report, which the Irani seemed to have long-term efforts towards nuclear weapons.
In Israel also talks about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear plants.
Students prayed to complexly on midday before the entrance and then proclaimed the death to the United States and Israel.
In the case of a attack which was intended to impose the Iranian atomic programme most widely, the Israeli press would also be the Natan's target of the centre of Isfahan.
The food card of a fat child: it doesn't eat for dinner bret
More than a third of the children from 9 to 13 have overweight problems, 9% of all students and 5% of all children are overwhelming.
Current surveys show - adipous children are mostly from families with unsuccessful lifestyle.
So again shows how important it is for the healthy development of a person, the environment in which he wakes up and the examples that turn to him.
On the table, the swimming kids are up to half more often on the table than in families where normal children live.
More than 19 per cent of the overwhelming children had an outstanding action under the Motto "Adiposity is no accident" bomb for dinner bret.
In families with Dickerchen, the sport is not just about the favorite jobs, but also the majority of today's students - only 15 percent responded that their parents are at least once in the week for active movement.
Inquiries under 900 children
The survey was held last year against the end of the school year, and about 900 children from basic schools were asked in all the Czechs.
This was already the second year of the action "Adiposity is not an accident", which is supported by the general hospital and the Unilever Society.
For now, more than 12 thousand students participated in the project from 4. and 8. classes.
Insufficient costs and lack of movement in the family are decisive factors responsible for the terrible number of children with overweight or even fat demands.
"After half of the children asked, for example, five times on the day, in the bedroom-wide mode, midnight-metagessen-vesper-endbrot - one of the main provisions for healthy food," says one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and breakfast for dinner bret
Experts indicate that relative difficulties, such as the regular breakfast period of the family, are important for the healthy development of a child.
But in Czech only 23 percent of the students' family.
And - in most families, everybody's buried for himself alone.
The worst thing was that it was not to be collapsed in every ten family.
The breakfast applies as the basic stone of healthy daily food.
The investigation test, among other things, led to consumption of overwhelming children in the family.
And almost everybody - without view on weight - drinks sweet limonades every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40% of the children incumbent sports, but only less than half of their parents do it - only 15%.
Put your own menu together
Another part of the survey enabled the selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools), which were offered by appetit and views of their own food plans.
"The Czechian children to predict from 12 to 15 in puncto Food is far away from the ideal of a healthy food.
Among their favorite specimens, many meat skins, meat skins and natural sweets were found.
"Alarming is mainly the great popularity of sweet limonades," is stressed in the final report on this survey.
At midday, so the main direction, teeth products seen right before the birds.
The fruit fruits could not almost be, but also the popularity of fish and vegetables as a meal was very low.
Health help
At the same time, the survey also showed that children are ready to change their habits when they get the right information.
In the results of the project, "Adiposity has not been completed in the control group of the investigators who were subjected to the questionnaire after the end of the proposed sentence "Adiposity is not an accident", it was indicated in many cases.
This was, for example, the sweet limos, where many children began to give priority to the common water.
The children also crossed a lot of open birds or fish as the main direction of the day and were ready to eat less cooked or sweet food.
Remarking professional - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the leading article about how to learn stylists, I had a little measured that this was a bit too much for the beginning.
I didn't know what's going on.
Reviews of three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar about how it runs "in the place".
It's gonna be worse.
Be closer to the test so that more information and practical tasks are before us.
But even if the course happens on Saturday and Sunday, he is completely involved.
This time we discussed with Director Alena (the course does not share a single man), as a woman who has no ideally proportionated figure.
And these are most of us.
The one has a too short hals, the others are a young figure without ordinary curves and the other are molecules.
It is something of the styleist to optically cook the wide shoes, extend the sleeve, or to switch the necessary curves.
We also find tips like a woman type like Jennifer Lopez - so with a large bus, large half and sweet size - nice and figure bed, without being too provocative.
If, for example, the difference between size and doors is so large that the rock or the hose does not really pass, at least one piece should be cut into measure.
This will not be worthy, because good sit clothing is simply unpayable.
In such a massed rock, you feel much better than in one of the stages that are always too high and cut in the size, etc.
Children's figures can be allowed to take clothing with fat, buildings, applications, strikes or refinees.
With this amount of information and figure types, I'm glad I have a week of time to leave me all greenly through the head.
And yet, I am afraid that it is not almost to create in view of the household.
Each of the coursers was allocated to a promi for which it was intended to consider the suitable outfit - day clothing and evening robbery.
In this way, we should take into account the current appearance to the model of the corresponding star and its figure type.
I want to get Miranda Kerr to know you maybe from the Victoria's secret.
In the interior I jump, because this is much better for me than to do with Briney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who recently had taken to the hundreds of kilos (too, this is a bit over) or also the young Selena Gomez.
The clothes should be disabled from magazines or search, print, and then edit graphicly.
In the "Moodboard", as the whole result is called, our entire personal style and our relationship with graphic design should then be expressed.
Indeed, it is very important to think about the graphic side of the tyling.
In fact, the models are not only slightly physically, but also established the so-called product page in the newspapers (for example, Trend-Hands, Mantel, etc.).
This told us the Stylist and Designer Mario Kameník.
But it's just on Sunday.
That means that a stylist must have a good overview.
The sabbath term filled with information on figure types was equal to three visitors from the sector:
by the Stylist Jan Pokorný, the Modest Creator Jakub Polanka and the model photograph Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that Mode Illusion is and that should be a stylist to use this.
And the enabled stylist was able to work with a single clothing room in a completely different way.
The magic word is variable.
For instance, you can take a thickcoat, like a T-shirt or a mantel, but you can also put it on the naked body, shoot it and put it into it as clothes.
It is enough to put the smells or rags high and the entire look looks very different.
"True so," he stressed.
But most of me came the following counsel: "If you should know the rules perfectly."
"And you should hurt them," said Jakub.
Finally, I will find out why we must cut all these teachings, what we can combine with what we can, and why, even if you see all other things in modern journals.
From moderations to smile.
Thanks to the photo Ben, I now know that a stylist has had to prepare a lot of more clothing options than he last photos.
So you must be prepared for a fashion store with ten sides (sprich 10 outfits) to style at least fiveteen.
And also that clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories looks very different than in reality.
So all of this must be received when the outfit is designed.
This image and style, including half of the success, confirmed Jan Pokornī.
There's only a time for Madonna to see a not just brilliant songman, made a world star from the image and marketing.
In Czech, the services of a styleist are more reserved.
Also known personalities keep this often for exited money (the main matter is that I bring something, how I see it is secondary).
And if someone allows us to style, then we should recognize that he or they are slowly slowing us up a totally different (picture) size than he or they really need.
Then you're only needing to go back to see with safety that the boulevard pressure writes that the corresponding promi has returned or decreased, etc.
Jan and Mario took us the heart on Sunday to believe that a stylist is only focused on the mode and then the outfit "building" needs.
When he works, he needs to communicate with people he's starving and to be a tragic psychologist.
People are grateful without offering themselves and standing at his opinion.
"When a manager orders us to sit his clothes and add sweet pieces, then we can't embrace you all the pain and say - my God, that's horrible."
"It must be found at least a few pleasant things to which you recommend what you can bring", says Mario.
He also showed us a very concrete thing to keep a so-called "plasteasche".
Thus, a taste that you use on the dimension and in which you are taking all the properties necessary.
Besides such clear things, such as shoes, sleeves for hair removal or safe nails, it also contains instruments such as a nylonfad (by helping the stylist to picture products such as handbags or garments), special clips, with which the clothing is obtained behind, if it is too large (stecknadels or other sleeves are understood so that the substance does not pass) and obviously seeing products.
In order to hear not only, but also to try something practical, we learned how to shoot correctly.
Also, when photographing in the shop where the footland is, you can damage the shooting shooting, shoot the outside.
Our clothes and we clothes...
You can't even shoot the shoes with the shoes so that you don't hurt them.
So you really need to be sent.
Mario enjoyed me by loving my "creation" without restrictions.
This is not just my strength.
All this was only the brown of what we had to hear at the second weekend end course.
One has become clear in this way - to styling at professional level, it's not child game.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal cost either by America
Recension
The originally sorglose driving is fully preventable, dynamic errors to the route driving to the spring.
However, it has been difficult to fill the ambitions largely, but what is the use of this if there is no joy to do a little more.
Soon before he came to the Ladentique, the new part was shooting with the subtitle "The Run" high expectations.
But he talked to move a piece to a new dimension, and he seemed to be not only one of many actions players.
We were also sweet about how the adjusted passengers, where the main protagonist grows from the car and continues to foot.
But as you've already been wounded with NFS, it's finally much different than you expected.
Secure - potentially, it's right to adherent Arkade loans, but in total the game of some overwhelming errors, which are present in this series more or less than a few years.
So there are no more errors, but more signs of an incomprehensive fault of the game developers in principle.
The abendment starts very good.
The first time you will be introduced in the history of which the mainfiguring Jack has some personal characters; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illicit race or by the United States.
In San Francisco, so on the west coast, you're on Lencrad, with the task to be first in New York.
The fundamental idea contains a number of interesting elements.
The whole route is divided in ten floors and in more than 50 individual rains.
This means that every wage is extended to other roads and that individual steps are occurring in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don't have the impression that the game will always offer the equal.
Some environments are still well viewed, although the technical level of the graphics does not depend on the previous parts of the series.
So no world moves.
But the driving through the desert, through the landscape or above by deeply disappeared landscape was very pleasant.
Towards and again untypical elements bring a little switch into the individual costs.
In the desert, for example, it is surprised by a wilderness that is strongly limited to the vision.
In the mountains again, you must be fully able to observe that you are not protected by a lawin.
On the other hand, the individual costs are well built.
Just a few, but they're rich.
One time so you're trying to get the number of enemy (in principle, a classic wage), then you have to take time (classical wages against the stoppuhr), then a personal dual is expected with a single contractor.
And there's still a lack of the police who wants to mass the whole thing.
A news is a passenger where Jack leaves the car.
This is more about some interactive animations in which Jack runs before someone and where the player needs to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprised, however, that there are much less passengers in the game than you would expect (for example only three).
Finally, this is most advantageous, since this element has at least no opportunity to be slow - it belongs to the elements mentioned above, which make the game more switch.
The driving model rose in the footsteps of the previous parts.
This means, from today's point of view, if there is no trees out, otherwise it could not be said that it would be bad.
Those who seek realistic simulations need to look at different places.
But an action-loaded rear will also continue to be very right, although you can find better in competition.
Together, it's better.
Real problems are only seen after a certain time.
On the contrary to the bicycle model, the collision model is not completely O.K.
From a game of this type is little expected that it's complex deformations and collisions, but if you are almost no objects knowing how the car is, then it's obviously not all right.
typical example: In close shopping or swimming cars "strippet" on some places, the other cars are only easy, in other, nearly identical situations, but you are in the slaughter and rounded pirates.
Or the cart is equal to the shoot.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn't work out anymore, and it's not always bad.
The restarts are so solved: if you have a total chain or far away from the line, then a game turns back to the last input point of the line.
Only - in every cost you have only five restarts.
If you're shooted her, everything's going out...
So the restarts are more than a tool, for the case that something doesn't happen, but it shouldn't be liked to leave.
Sometimes, however, it does not help the restart, but it helps nothing else than learning the critical section from the head.
Only unacceptable is that the same things often happen to the same places.
Some curves, for example, need to be conducted in a completely specific way, otherwise not.
Otherwise, on the corresponding place of "vivil" cars, it is always in the same configuration, unlike if you come as first or five seconds before or a minute later.
This is especially in situations where you see that the container is going through before a played two cars, but until you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you need to run or brem.
And it's unlike when you get there, it's so designed that it's always close to this situation before your neck.
The contractors have further benefits.
There are several places in the whole game where you are always obtained in the same place from the same enemy and also here without regard to the time.
This is the most crazy to end the game on the long bridge that happens in direction.
The constraint must, obviously, overcome a devil here.
And when he's just a minute before, then he's obviously taking a view, so it's starting the car a few times in a slump.
Clar - you want to make the game easier and swimming, but this is so clear that it's quick to avoid joy in the game.
And this is harmful, because despite the easier drive model, the game is totally maintained and, of course, also loaded as actions that you almost don't know where one is.
And in principle, it is different, what "fault" is - the concept with 50 unique routes, the arrangement of pensions in a way that no long-term end can arrive, or something all other...
A uncommon idea is also the car change in the course of the rain.
You can't see the tank stations on the road, because just here you can change the car, although in most cases the car is sufficient to you just have.
The cars are divided in three categories.
Sport cars are suitable for the urban areas, the strong American limousins for the simple cars and exotic super-sport cars for the technical drivers, for example, to the Serpentine in the mountain.
Manually with the game history is also the task mode (requirements) - so the pensions in the individual localities that you know from the history.
There are not only medals, but also experience points for the own profile, which is commonly for the tasks (profits) and the history.
In order to achieve the higher driver level, different objects must be closed: start from the car to the backward for the profile.
This is simultaneously connected to the online autolog, which compares the results made by the other players and also ensures for further collective functions.
One of the other unconscious skins is a situation in the last time of the history.
In fact, this is the car in a U-Bahn Tunnel (minuteways), where you are cut on the dark sides (minuteways).
The Tacho views quotes between 150 to 200 km/h (minuteways), but there comes at once from behind a U-bag and leads an uncompromissable to Schrott.
In our editor, we'll still be stricted about whether it was a blackout of the player or whether the authors keep us so busy.
The technical page is nothing overwhelming but at least the visual general impression is right in most cases and even brilliant.
It is worse that, in some slow moments, the image ball frequency becomes slower and this is very dramatic.
However, this concerns the accidents with increased numbers of participants, where a continuing FPS does not use anything.
The snake is so far O.K. and the sound track is shock.
In order to speak to a scale as far as possible young publishers, a sound track came there "of any thing" - but who buys a game already because of the music?!
The total impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are most mixed.
If the game wouldn't fail by the totally unnecessary errors mentioned, we could be able to note with the Brustton of the conviction that The Run is the best part of NFS in the last few years.
But that's how the game works somewhere unfortunately.
A classic enjoyment for you, but you should be prepared for this error with the power of aircraft assets in the eyes.

Vicenova, EU Botschafter:
The Czechs have the call of negative and Euroskeptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has felt the balance among the individual institutions."
I hadn't expected that such a hard war would be broken."
"The five, six years will be duration until the residences have been entered and all have been dealed with their new role", began Milena Vicenova, the Tschechian embassy at the European Union.
How serious it is to take the moto "Only understanding and openly over Europe", it has already shown in the first part of her talk, in which it has been possible to describe the individual bodies of the EU and their mutual relations to such an overviewable and comprehensive way that some readers of the university of Karls could soon be able to overcome.
Mrs Vicenov also commended the new permanent President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy:
"In the first place he was criticized that he was to be unexpected - a green official who has not grown such a role, but I have to say that it's all shut up the breath as he well accepted the thing.
"He is a person who is ready to listen patiently to seventy Member States, to communicate with them, and especially with clear ideas about how it should continue with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for External Affairs and Security Policy then explained as a answer to the question: Who is this, really, the European Union? What number I call?", so as an important step to enhance the EU policy towards States such as China or India.
No one wants to forgive us our mortal quarter.
Ms. Vicenová, also, lived and remembered the agenda, according to which the European Union lived.
The Czech Presidency of two years ago called it successful.
The Czechs had measured the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also held the Summit for Eastern Partnership.
The case of the Government during the presidency, it was called a great Negativum that had strongly damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
Czech delegation in the EU has to do all the hands now.
With the words of the messenger, it went not only to the presidency, but also to the following crisis that has not yet been overcome until now.
And there is still a need to be approved by the EU's seven-year budget, which makes the matter so much more complicated because of the current economic situation.
If it will be a weird and disadvantaged budget, which economic priorities, which countries are more and less fostered - all of that is now on the agenda.
The messanger also reminds her own slogan, with which she came to Brussels: "Only understand about Europe".
"If I don't like anything, then there are green crowds, foreign words and specialists that no one understands.
As citizens, how to know whether you really cross in Brussels or around the mountains and different large bananas, or if someone really wants to prohibit us the quarter.
It would also be pleased to use the EU's land in order to obtain more Czech in European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds
The EU's Ombudsman believes that the Czechs are called to be Euroskeptics, which are more negative than the positive sides of the matter.
Indeed, the weak delegation of Czechs in European institutions is worse.
Thus many factors are debt, including the retaining of our candidates, whose incapacity to write motivation letters and not lastly the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she also expressed the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the V4.
"Crede me if a Poland or Hungary comes to me and a slowake is near me, then the Francis says to me, "Hey, what you shut up there together - is that your V4 again?" and it makes a very sweet mine.
Mrs Vicenove, in the future, the EU is expected to have strong rules for the budgetary policy of the Member States.
As much more real than a 'European Federation', it looks at the concept of a Europe of the two or even different speeds.
"We have the countries of the euro zone and the countries outside the euro area.
"We have the Schengen room and we already have the Instituto of Strengthening Cooperation."
"In the first time, it was said that only countries should cooperate with which they want, and those who do not want to be quiet."
"There will be given more institutions, which finally goes beyond a strong "Europe of the different speeds", Mrs. Vicenova expects.
In this regard, she also acknowledged the role of the Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuyes in implementing the principle, which, according to all the topics, should be discussed with effect on the whole EU by all Member States and not only by the countries of the euro zone.
Brand Story:
The Innovator IBM enters its existence in the second century.
If you are looking for a suitable word that the IBM Strategy characterizes the most accurate characterizes, then this would be the word "Langleness".
For the wide publicity, IBM is the synonym of technological revolution, you know it as modern companies, although since its creation has already been established a century.
The basis for this long life has already been her first chief – the Visionary Thomas J. Watson Sen.
Until the slogan, there are unwise global problems that could be easy to solve if people were ready to think about a little.
His slogan "Think" was so marked to play the life of the future giants (and at the same time as the title of the vast internal magazines that were started to be released at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of the business culture prepared by Watses.
"For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous movement in direction towards the future.
IBM survived and, therefore, succeeded in the whole century, since it remained faithful to his principles and did not be afraid to change all the other ring sums.
This allows us to transform technologies, business and also society during our first century.
We hope we're creating more in the next hundred years,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, today's director of the company from the Jewish Jewish.
Intelligence system
Watson has already employed social responsibilities in the thirty years of his employees - in similar way, as the employee Baśa in the Czechoslowakei: The IBM was a vacation paid as one of the first American employees, an insurance by the employees more elegant units than workshops and a swimming relocation system for the best new and handlers.
Similarly, the long-term relationships of IBM are also excited with their customers.
The company had been generous in Talenting - as one of the first enterprises worldwide, IBM shouted every discrimination, and was able to look out.
In accordance with this anti-discrimination strategy, the present plan is also changed by Palmisan at the IBM's sight in the next year of a woman - from Virginia Romatty.
It has been 30 years old at IBM, until then she took the position of the Vetriebs, Marketing and Strategy Chef.
IBM has grown in the past few future strategies and innovations.
No wonder - there is no ideas enough, there is almost a half million people employed in the company.
A institution with good call
Your unforeseen position in the business guarantees the company a strong image and this towards internal and foreign.
"In the beginning, IBM had the concept of a institution than a blue technology company", said the Economist professor of Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Canter.
"IBM is not technology companies, but a company helps solve business problems using technologies", adds George Colony from Consulting Company Forrester Research.
As the company itself emphasizes, it is a difference to be presented on the market or to form it directly by this presence.
IBM - in the countries of their logos for the family "Big Blue" is growing to one of the largest companies of the world in a century.
It is one of the most diversified technology companies - IBM developed hardware and software, infrastructures, hosting and consultation services in an incredible product width - from servers to nanotechnologie.
IBM has most patents and five of its employees with the Nobel price.
For example, bank automobiles, credit cards, financial wave, strike code or also the discs.
With about 220 billion dollars of bursen value (market capitalisation) IBM was the second largest technological enterprises in this year (such as after Apple), which overcomes the first time since 1996 Microsoft.
Previous look
Not all products and innovations faced the shock of customers today - unfortunately, for example, the trial with the own operating system OS/2, the online service Prodigy or also the IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on the previous movement, so you should not be emotionally binding to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM has no problem to build its basic machines on different platforms - and if they do not work to leave them again.
On the contrary to the Microsoft player, which is in principle with its operating system Windows.
Successful technology
The winners of IBM are mostly involved in services, software and hardwares at each time.
In 1990, hardware was represented with one of the most strongest parts of over 50%.
Since 2000, IBM has made little profits in the value of $15 billion, but in the same time, it was $58 billion in the purchase of new technology.
In these investments, IBM continues after 2008 when the current financial crisis was the first time as a storm over the world.
The IBM also remained faithful to his first Chief Thomas J. Watson, who increased its investment in the world's great economic crisis in the middle of the world.
It seems that the company IBM is inevitablely exceeding today's crisis.
The value of IBM shares has increased significantly by 120 per cent since 2008, and the rear wine of the company is continuously increased.
The IBM company log is: everything can change - only the values are not.
Hence, it should be expected that this flexible guigant is also the next crisis.
IBM history: from kitchen swimming to world-wide flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines) founded for centuries in New York had first a rightly complex name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name of IBM was only 1924 - originally a mark name for a delay in Canada and South America.
The basic Steel for the later society IBM led the fusion of four companies whose history was rewarded until the 1980s of the 19th century.
They include technologies, such as the famous technicians to register the start and end of the work.
Charles Ranlett Flint, who was also presidency in the Supervisory Council until 1930.
And it was Flint who established the chief of the competitive company Thomas J. Watson so that it helped him to lead the company.
This leader even put the founders of IBM in the shadows - based on Watson's ideas until today the unacceptable culture and identity of the company.
Watson led the company up to 1952.
IBM, started, as was the name raised, with the manufacturing and the distribution of all possible machines for the trade - from wood- and swimming machines, to the box.
In the first four decades in which Watson led the company, he doubled its shares to $9 million and extended the company after and after all the continents.
Watson was so unreasonable for the company that he was sit in the chief for all fourty years, then he was dissolved from his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
The IBM began working on the development of art intellectual intelligence and also developed the first programing language.
In the 1960s, technicians and computers of NASA's IBM helped flights to lead to all – to Mercur and Saturn and in 1969, also the famous human flight to the moon.
In addition, IBM developed the first host family with the same computer architecture - the number of IBM system/360.
A classic PC that determined the computer standard at that time came in 1981 under the name IBM 5150 on the market.
Twenty years later, IBM declared his computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, otherwise she purchased the advisory part of the Price Waterhouse Coopers company and fully increased in the business with advisory services and services.
The Strategy, which is payed by IBM in the last three years, is the concept "Smarter Planet".
It emphasizes the aim of implementing technologies in areas that have not yet been planned until now, for example, to improve the situation in the transport and in the city management.
In the trade sector, IBM introduced the "Smarter Commerce" platform which would help the handlers to lead to the whole commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in Czech.
Until 1932, IBM founded a delay in the current Czechslovakia, as a first country in the Middle-Est and Eastern Europe.
Today IBM is a strategic outsourcing centre in Brussels, among others.
The central for the Mediterranean and Eastern Europe is located in Praga and is also a top research team of the world's level, which is the technology of voting.
Darina Rychtáová about its unfaithful gates:
Iveta, you can keep this slee, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rychtáova (53) says - now it's conclusion!
After her husband Josef Rychtá (53) from the protector of Iveta Bartochová (45), Darina remained the hope that Josef comes from his rosed dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patientity, and for the further life it has made clear rules.
"Joseph can go home, but not more than my partner," said D. Rychtáóva.
When Darina Rychtááová of the Snake I. Bartošova offered refugee in their own house, you wouldn't even have been in dream as it appears to your husband.
When Iveta went to her drone for 30 days and returned to the śíčany, Josef went along with him.
Yeah, he even known that he loved them.
With the time called Darina, yeah, it seems even if she wanted to turn back with her unfaithful man - but now she finally gave him the pass.
Rychytan is wrong with whom his wife sleeps
If Iveta Bartochová should leave in the future, then he will be safely received at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams, and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, I will not leave him."
"But not as a loved, disappointed old sleeve, but as a man to whom I still have a certain bond," Mrs. Rychtáova; but she also said that she has already been emotionally separated from him and best on mutual responsibilities.
The condition that Darina has locked him the door, Josef has brought him with conviction until now.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'm staying together with Iveta, nothing changes."
"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect it."
"The company continues to run, I'll care about the repairs, the garden, the basement, I'll buy the buys."
"My Darina has me very normal, only we do not share the bed," said J. Rychtá (to Blatt) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he won't stop them.
"We don't sleep with each other, so it's not me if she has a friend or who it is.
I'm clear that it's my fault, I loved Iveta, and therefore I am able to overcome any responsibility.
The worst women injuries: How is it with you?
If the men are invited to call some typical women's injuries, they will soon protect some of them from the smell.
Love Women, can you recognise the following lines in which we leave a few unsettled revues that let the men take the blood into the Adrens?
Securities
Do they want to be shopping?
Should you buy at least one hair weekly?
Do you like to buy and can it be a little more at actions?
Then, in your case, it's probably really about a weakness.
Some women are at least conscious of it and try to keep their purchase loss halfways under control.
But hand on the heart, whose woman already seems to swim by searching for a good sit-sized up-level only through a clothing business and try not all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even though the buying for most women is a hobby, for men it is often the clean hell.
You're thinking about how often they told her husband... you're gonna be more liked to be outside...
Permanenced inconsistence
"Don't I be too tick?"
"I should take at least five pounds - I should begin to join or to gymnastic?"
"Is I ever like you?"
Does that happen to them?
Yeah?
Then you are also part of women who are regularly aware of how they look.
This does not mean that you should leave, but many men react allergicly when their wife always hurts her appearance.
The stronger sex is insufficient - with the increased frequency of complaints, women are always more inevitable.
Order and cleanness at first place
It's a battle against windstorms.
Lay windows, shoes and stairs that shoot the waves - and that's at least two times in the week.
Shut up with her partner, because he smells again with shoes on the clean shoes, you shoot the kids, because the shocked bag is back and because the glass door has a thickness of the room, where the police makes so much effort?
If you suffer under this kind of "Devianz", then you should know that you can overcome nothing and order and cleanness in family life will not stand first.
This unprecedented cleaning filling may finally damage the mutual relationships and, in particular, the peace in the family.

"Turning tours come in the wooden carb."
"Do you really want to get the old sucks into tomorrow?"
"A naked hand tube is not just on the footsteps."
If your partner has been deleted such a tirad, you should not be surprised that this brings him to the palm.
Of course, it's not bad, but they just want to do what he's doing.
If the men knew that, then the women may not need to smoke so much.
Clash and tratch
Some women like to smell and smell, where they are cut behind or cut down or smiling shoes.
Women are now focused on relations, so they are pleased to discuss such issues, such as - who, where, how and why.
Even if each of us women have a little harmless class and trace on shopping.
Hand on the heart - that's probably all women own.
However, this is not to change with classists who are no holy and no one who thinks of everyone in their environment, and especially for women's collectives is a significant danger.
Yagr and Voráček help Philadelphia with their assistants to win
The Eishockey Tower Jaromír Yagr had two assistants in the Monday game with a large part of the 5,3th seat of Philadelphia on the iron in Carolina and is again the most productive Tschechian player in the NHL.
As a result of the overview of the ninety-year-old Eishockeystars, there was two cases of Clude Giroux, who added an assistant and was called to the best player of the matchs.
Two assistants in the same game also signed Yagr's player Jakub Voráček.
Yagr said after the game of journalists, he had Giroux a great night prophecy.
"After the game, I'm telling him that he's a hattrick today."
"I had some feelings."
"It and again overcome such a feeling," Yagr explained, after which Giroux action had reached a gate at the first shooting of the Flyers.
One minute later, the second traffer also had "one Czechian scene".
Preáček struggled behind the gate of the Hurricane and put him between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
A second prior to the posting of the first third party, the home player Patrick Dwyer reached a short-hand, but the second third was back to the Flyers.
Concrete Giroux.
In cooperation with Yagr, he reached his third strike, and then Wayne Simmonds led his shooting to the fourth gate.
"I love it to play with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player of the liga, but he's intended to belong to the best three," Yagr accepted his center.
"I wouldn't be in life that I'd play together with a eishockey player as with him."
"I'm happy."
"I'm shutting my game on me."
"All the years in the NHL, my partners put their game on me and now turn the smell towards me," Yagr smuggled.
Carolina made a game to the Drama - through the traffer of Tuma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who was slaughtered from a crime shooting, came to a gate.
But Matt Read prevented any further complication in which he was in overnight two against a success.
"Assigned prongers still acted in our area."
"He learned the pocket, I took driving up and (Read) moved to removed phoses."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad that it's shut up," preâček described the last part of the party from his view.
With this victory, Philadelphia was placed on the pitches of the Eastern Conference.
The twenty-third player of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček was injured in the game against Buffalo and, in the second-third, slaughtered because of an injury on the top body.
The Candians also learned their leadership in the Penalty shoot 2:3.
One of the criminal committees could not convert Tomáš Plekanec.
More than the lost points paind the train of the homemanship the high-conditioned decline in the defence - the game was just finished by five players.
"It's bad."
"We just played with a unique experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But there is nothing to do so we need to be finished," said Jacques Martin.
"At every channel, we had nothing to do with the other."
"We had to make the game easier and take the pocket out of our third."
There were still reservations," said P. K. Subban, one of the players.
The Czechian torches Ondśej Pavelect shocked thirty-five shoes from Tampa Bay and took part in the 5.2-See over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the Jets, which ended a series of five shoes, had five different shoes.
Travel price development since 1989
To 1989, only five government travel offices were authorized in the event of C.S.S.R.: śedok, Sportrist, CKM, Recrea and Autotourist.
The traveling offices only sell travels in the socialist blocklands, in the west, only then chosen.
And so Czechian tourists travel to the East Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - the DDR), in the Soviet Union (Sotchi on the half of Krim on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to Black Sea and to Hungary at the Balaton.
A light exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when we traveled to Yugoslavia, then Jugoslavia took a foreign course, and therefore travels were strongly limited to Yugoslavia.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that it was not once allowed to travel in the Eastern Block (e.g. the Czechoslowakens) in the context of the socialist countries.
If, for example, a citizen of the ŠSSR wanted to travel to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he needed such a invitation letter, otherwise individual trips could not be possible.
On the other hand, travel offices also offered travels to the western, but they had to purchase huge skins or also pass in the bed sack before the travel office, or at least have "good known" in the travel office.
That's how it wasn't done for a long time.
The suitable adjustment - the condition of a travel to the West - was only distributed "politically reliable" people - the others did not even travel.
In fact, the Czech Republican currency was not an overwhelming currency, and it would therefore have not been possible to spend the necessary financial resources (which currency) for a travel to the West.
The largest Czechs therefore passed their holidays in the country, no wonder that the Czechs purchased several weekend houses and dates - a habit that slows up to this day.
The same revolution of 1989 followed a repertoire of the Czechs on the foot.
While a vacation in the DDR or Bulgaria had been the measure of all, the Czechs past 4,5 million in the past year of their foreign holidays in countries of the whole world.
A powerful paradox that you have not yet known today is the fact that you were not able to travel in the current popular vacation country of Czech - Croatia until 1989 because it was part of the current Yugoslavia.
As since the beginning of the last century, the obligation of responsibilities was taken to the nearby Western European countries, which increased a great wave of short visits, especially in Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovakias couldn't just get enough from their travels to the west, everyone wanted to be there at least a few days.
Thus, the Czech holidays were living at traveling to Paris in the park, because whoever had already had the money for a accommodation in the hotel or in a pension.
A typical feature at the foreign journeys of Czech was then one of the conservation, beer and duration, etc. complete copper rooms.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the twentieth Czechic chrone - after decades our tourists finally could buy the Western currency.
Our level of life and the average levels also increased in 1997, which was an important moment further.
With the increased demands of travel, travel offices began to regularly prepare traveling after 1997 by charter flights, with the possibility of treating quantitative discussions, in comparison with the past.
Finally, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, had already unreasonable payment traffic with all the high-developed countries in the world, which made the journey easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of the "post-center" travel movement in 2000, thanks to the high demand of the first direct flight to a exotic country - to Thailand.
Sither, every year, direct charter flights are flying with Czechese passengers in far away sunlands; in this year, 12 exotic destinations are directed from Czech Republic.
To the 100th Czechs every year travel to exotic countries!
Another important moment in the epoch that marked our "post revolutionary" development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States launched the visa obligations for Czech Tourists, which finally engaged in our country under the high-developed countries of the world.
In 2008 the Czechs first passed over half of their holidays in the foreign (50.3%) and gave them the first time in their history for the only holiday stay in the holiday place more than 15 cm CZK per head.
The main Assembly is to find a new chairman - again threatens a counterparty.
Some five months ago, the Czech football did not have a chairman and threatens that the followers of Ivan Hašek will never be known after the extraordinary main meeting in Nymbuk on Thursday.
Indeed, there is no agreement on which election regulation should be chosen.
And without this, it is not possible to vote on the three potential followers.
Three interests want to manage the Czech football - Jindśich Rajchl, Miroslav Pella and Tomáš Paclik.
In June Haschek returned from his function, when he asked his colleagues to find some and a strong personality that could lead to the football in the future.
Only - in the years of Hašek, the old snakes reaffirmed between the two associations chambers that are not able to take place on a common candidate.
This showed clamp and clear on 16 September when the new Chairman should be selected.
The delegates of the main Assembly had come to the National House in the Prayer Quartal Smichov, because the negotiations did not result and it was not only about the choice itself.
We could not even be able to do some of those who are in the full assembly - only the post-representatives, or also the officials who have a full power-related position.
At the same time, at least partly agreement was reached, with the recommendation of the State and Law Institute, whose opinion was not inconsistent.
However, the strictness towards the election rule continues to be accepted.
The Executive Committee also did not have a clearness to the matter at which meetings - unlike the ordinary or extraordinary - in principle there was nothing else on the agenda.
Even if the opinions relating to the election several times changed - the neuralalgical point remained the same.
The question is: how should you go in the 3nd round to avoid a patent situation?
"The point of struggle relates to the question whether to be taken in accordance with the statute, or whether a whole model is to be found", said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three stakeholders of the FAśR, who are in the management of the Professionsball.
According to an overwhelming model, the third round of this candidate, which receives the largest percentual support in the room for which it is candidated.
Mothers are willing to accept the compromise that the candidate is assigned to receiving the higher number of votes from two rooms.
The twenty-fourth side is again the condition that the winner obtains at this percentage of styms at least a second level.
"When the two fronts have no sense any more, this mode would ask the whole two chambers' concept, Svoboda understands the explanations of the marine side that it is at the best moment, not to add the election order, but to choose, according to a valid sentence.
It is surprising to Tomáš Paclík, even though it is declared that the suppositional election regulation of all candidates is most likely to be taken by Pella.
"My desire is that the most widely chosen after the sentence."
"In order to do not have an innocent substitution variable, as in the last congregation," the owner (the football club) Victoria Plześ explained, who was first candidated and circled in his opinions, especially against Pelta.
But it's still optimistic.
In Nymbuk, he believes that the candidates will also cooperate constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the National Manager for football-EM today would be safely helped to swallow the feet."
"When the football is only on the euphoric wave, then the ready for cooperation is greater", means Jablonec official, which is the largest experience of all three adeptes, and it is both at professional and regional level.
Rajchl's staying there.
"I hope that a agreement, but the situation is deeply deceived."
"This is not a matter between the people from the wicked and gentle, but there are certain efforts to "justify" the rules for their own purposes."
"There is not excluded by a renewed blocking at the main meeting."
"But I hope that the healthy human mind finally sees", said Rajchl.
Only - a lot of time to accept all sides is not left.
Some negotiations should seem directly to be played in Montenegro, but who knows whether football generation will be completely complete to the qualification game.
The charter flight, which, among other Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl to Podgorice, could not start in Prague for a technical disaster and, as a result, seeks a substitution variant, as a part of the Executive Committee still to the location of the barrage game.
Finally, the meeting on the ministerial level is decisive to which it will be held at midnight.
Josef Dobeš, Minister for Schools, Youth and Learning, would like to move out the shared parties within the largest sports partnership of the country.
In fact, it is much on the game: public applications, the confidence of the Czech football, and also the subsequent main gap of the STV, which will lead to the Czech Sport in terms of the financial problems of Sazka.
Pacific is in the fight on the position of the Chairman, because he does not see appropriate candidates.
If Tomáš Paclík, the chief of the footballers before the extraordinary main Assembly, could have made a strong candidate who had completed all his views on the new Chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAśR), would never have taken place in the fight for this pitting position.
"If I gave it a good advertising, I would fight for him and reject the choice."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a appendix," said Paclica.
The main foundation for Pacific to go with Miroslav Pella and Jindčich Rajchl is therefore to prevent the appropriate preferences of the election, Pella, towards the spot of the FAśR.
Pacific also stresses that, in the case of his victory, he is only a year of the office of the Chairman, that is, until 2013, until the end of the General Assembly.
In the position of the Chairman, he would like to see a learning top manager that has not yet been cut into the football.
"I have talked personally about some of the people in question."
"Child to believe that some say to me they did not want to identify with the Czech football.
"Solche views would like to change", he urged.
In most cases, Pacific is able to link Pelta's with the President of the Pillner's Department's Floor Group, Roman Berbr, a man with contraverse call, which applies behind the cults as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to influence delegated votes on major congregations.
For Pacific, it is unacceptable for this reason that Pelta had the position of the President.
"In his victory, the state of today would be preserved, and in the Czech football it wasn't going to pass."
"The support by Berbr, a clever businessman, is doubled by the football," emphasized Pacific.
He also argued that Pelta's name had fallen in a corruption case before some time in connection with telephone hearing, but it was punished from the Pelta.
"I don't know what pretty victory Pelta should bring to the football."
"And how we would be in the eye of the EUFA and FIFA," said Paquik, whose previous exhibition, "he will sell the Pillner football club if Pella will be chaired," but it's still something left.
If Pacific would be blessed on Thursday, however, he could present a future cooperation with Pella.
He also thinks of another candidate - Rajchl, who supported the Pacific before the main congregation in October, which ended with a Fiasko.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to which I would go."
"He has great ability."
"I could like to represent him well, for example, as the Chief of the National Employment."
"Af I don't think he was able to lead the association as a manager."
"I did not stand my nase in matters where I do not understand anything," said Patrick, who was so careful in September, that he was on the sight of the Scheeds Directorate Commission with Luśk Macela on the sight of Dagmar Damkova.
Pacific itself succeeds that he feels the role of the President of the Association.
And it takes place on his ability to lead private companies since last summer, he is also the Chief of Pilsen, who celebrated with his support in May the first triumph in the Liga.
"I have the power to change something in the football million and to contribute to a certain culture of this."
"In order to limit the impact of certain interest groups that tend to affect discipliners and professional committees, which seems to be in present situations," Pacific pointed out, which does not make a heal from his antipathy for example towards the Head of Spirta Daniel Kåetínský.
As one of his priorities, he looked at the establishment of the relationships between the FAṣṭR and the Czech Republic of Olympic, with the help to lobby with the political spots policy that more money from the lottery tax to the sport.
"This is one of the decisive things that the new Chairman should take place."
"If it comes to tax the games of happiness, how the political parties declare, I understand their arguments, but then they must also be clamped and clearly telling where the money goes", he said.
His link to the Pilner Club does not also look as a handicap, although he himself emphasizes, the President of the FA RowlandR should be "transparency".
Pelta again is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl with the Ducla Prayer.
"It's not just ideal."
"But my opinion does not make much sense to transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club to a third person to return back for a half years," said Pacific clearly.
Pella promised the new sets of the FAśR, which defeat a Pat situation in the future.
Two days prior to the Football Assembly, one of the candidates, Miroslav Pella, will make himself strong in the case of his choice that the FA disagree new statues, which will be excluded in future on the election order.
The official of Jablonec is confidential before Nymbuk's nymbuk nymbuk nymbuk's negotiations and believes that the election campaign will be safely strengthened in a possible success of the Czechan selection.
Pelta had promised that before the non-exercised election in September, he wanted to concentrate in the case of his election on the nationality and the benefit of financial resources.
He just decided at the last moment to participate in the election before the last meeting, and so he wanted to help the two-month pause to defend his proposals on the board's leadership and present in a broader context.
"Only at all levels are the football, they are indulgent and therefore expected that the Chairman is known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is the highest time that the association is leaded to someone, means the man who is particularly connected to the Jablonecer club, but who also acted in Sparta and in the Executive Committee for many years.
He also believes that he has enough experiences to lead to the Czech football.
He is convinced that the Euphorie is responsible for today's problems with the choice, which was dominated at times by Ivan Hašek.
"The leaders were approved at the Headquarters in June, which were not as perfect as they were all accepted.
If they didn't have allowed various discussions, we had already been a chairman from September," said Pella.
In addition to the revision of the most important document of the Citizenship, he used as a lock for delegates.
"If I would be Chairman, then I'm taking it personally and I'm ready to take personal responsibility if it doesn't hurt."
"This is a principle thing that he can't be", said Pella.
In addition, he does not try to limit himself to his contradictors.
Soon before he had announced that he could present a cooperation with Jindčich Rajchl that he recognized because of his legal education and knows well that his opposite candidate would be his first vice-president.
Also, Tomáš Paclík wasn't shocked for a long time, which left no sweet faden on Pella.
In the football, he moves over a year and can already be shown to certain success."
"But his attacks were decreased and many were shocked by his election campaign."
"But now many doubts of his real character," he addressed his counterparts, who must be faithful to his proclamations that he already expressed in September.
His opinion is that his strongest weapons are the knowledge of the football from the lower game classs, until the nationality.
And this should be the twenty-football shoes.
"I would also try to end all the affairs - from the Bohemian Cause, to the posts of the corruption channel last year."
"I would then spend on negotiations with the private and state sector to ensure sufficient financing for the whole football." said the 28-year-old candidate ŠTK two months ago.
Thus he also promised that his access to the twenty-five ball would not mean personal savings.
"I should be aware of the maintenance of all employees once," he said in direction of Strahov, where, under the long anarchie, nervousity is understood.
In spite of the present catastrophic scenarios, which join the chairmanship, he believes that the delegates do not go to Nymbuk on Thursday.
"If you really should be the only strict point, how you choose in the third round, then we will go through it."
"The football needs credibility and the wins only when he is finally a new leader," Pella remains two days prior to the possible day of his functionary career optimistic.
Rajchl promises that the FAśR starts working hard under him
If the previous Chairman Jindśich Rajchl should be selected at the main meeting on Thursday to the new Chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, this would likely be the laune of many people in the association.
Rajchl promises to start working hard in the case of his choice.
He wants to introduce system changes and to make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the case of Bohemians to improve the relationship with the EUFA and FIFA, to bring more money into the football and, on the other hand, to continue to work that Ivan Haschek began.
"To the Chairman, I want to spend the football as a whole."
Starting from the international contacts to EUFA and FIFA, on national choice, on the vocational football, towards the performance ball for youth."
"I don't want to say that I want to do everything alone," said Rajchl in the conversation for ŠTK.
"I am a team player and I would therefore like to distribute the competences in the Executive Committee so that each member is a certain area."
And I will distribute hard tasks so that the football will be forwarded in each segment with milk strikes."
Moreover, many wouldn't just be comfortable because they, instead of criticize the work of others, should now really start working hard now," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, it has not yet been considered to candidate.
"For me it is known that I work 20 hours a day."
"Af I have to know that it makes sense and that people stand behind me who do not cut a button between the legs and any step I ask", he said as a statement why he denied.
"My people told me that I shouldn't stop because others would do it."
"This is confidence that you can't play," he said.
It also motivates him to continue to work that he started under Haschek.
"In two years, we have taken a large part of work and I don't just want to get away."
"It was started processes that, likely just in a few years, come to the application, and I would just see that she stopped someone," he said, and thus expressed his concern that for the case the other candidate - Miroslav Pella would choose the situation in the days before Haschek.
"I believe in systematic action, and that's something that Mirec Pella doesn't bring."
"In his maintenance, people who would make the football so that he would be only for the chosen."
I'm sure I can imagine some, but not that I'm partial."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because then it's all good and not only the chosen," said Rajchl.
He also opposes the statement that he is only a Chairman of the Czechs.
"After some people say the opposite, I really have to do the best possible for masters."
"For example, it is time to overcome whether the liga should not be shared in a Czechese and Moriar part whose winners will then spend into the first liga."
"And it couldn't happen that only three marine clubs today play in the liga, which is especially a problem for young players in women," says Rajchl.
Because also the Chief of the Pillner Club Tomáš Paclík has joined the function of the Chairman, Rajchl did not believe to evaluate his opportunities to be chosen.
"I condemn a strong support in the Czech room, which has chosen me to their present President and now recognizes that clear successes are behind me," Rajchl, who also seeks the allocation of zig million chrones for unprecedented contracts, the agreement of TV contracts and the negotiations on the Lotterie Act as a success.
On the other hand, it is the responsibilities that the association is not at a single point.
While he says from Pelta, "he is disqualificated before to help the Czech football to new trust," he holds the second rivals - Pacific for a strong candidate who really offers something to the football.
"No one can question that he has done a great job in Piles in only one year."
"If he would be chosen, then he would, likely, continue the things that Ivan Haschek has led, and also the personal condition in the Commission would not, obviously, change."
He would certainly not want to give the things to his favors," Rajchl judges his rivals.
Europe's best Pools
Spring in blue
From Julia Stanek
Plants in Ufo-Optics, Prunkpools in Budapest: Who travels through Europe can experience its blue wonders - and after a city tour or a migration the tears in smuggling trees.
A book shows where Wellness is the most beautiful in the water.
When Iris Meder went to search for a half years in the past, one in her bathroom was not missing: her bathroom shop.
Returned on the water, she looked high in artificially shocked balls, smiling marmor pounds that were waiting at the beach, and surprising over acribically restored young sleeves.
Having filled a bath, she took it into her notebook - and then knowledgeful details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools learned architecture historic meder in this way - and now put it in their book "Bade fun" before: people's bathrooms in Munchen, historical bade palaces in the blackwald, "Hardcore beton manufacturers" in Taunis.
Through 13 countries, she traveled to the most outstanding farms in the Mediterranean: in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and everywhere a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a real Badeculture Enthusialist.
With sports, she doesn't have much on the hot, says meder - only in the water is different.
Nevertheless, the swimmphans must be distant with blue shoes and clorgestank, while Jogger can take the devastating duft of fifty trees or pleasant bird witchers in the park.
"I asked me a day, why the snakes must always be so sweet," they say in Vienna.
"And I began to collect beautiful bottles."
Water surface double architecture
Plazas in the spring bath and atheric sauna wood - the wellness factor in baths is so large that all the sense are sweet, so meder.
And when the manufacturers have made up their efforts, smim hairs can be a real eye shock: "Instead of a footland, you have got a water surface in the grounds."
"He's insecure, but reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubles optically: high cotton, swimming cakes, spring bread.
In 190 pages, the small formatted "Badefreuden" image shares knowledge about the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness - but in particular, it makes it lust to a pleasant in blue.
Remarkable examples found the pool sammler meder at their searchs in Hungary.
Besides precise healing plants, such as the 100-year-old Szechenyi bad in Budapest, she found a nitrate water in an emergency card height (Foolbad in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath, which has filled its beaches with alcalized water and has been found in a flavorable building (Városi Termalforde in Yaszbereny).
Instead, spectacular views offer many swimming boats in Switzerland and Austria: While you have the whole city in the eye, you can look at the swimming Arlberg in St. Anton and: There is a window where you can observe the skin on the ski camp.
The most extremely pool design may be expected to be bathrooms in the long field: The Aquadome Occidentally looks like a right in the Alpen Ufo.
From three to the top open skins it is in winter, while in the background, the mountains of the Oriental are rained in the heavens.
Alhambra in Blackwald
Not in any swimming powder, the pool sammler meder increased the snake of clor in the nase.
Many thermal bottles rise to sweefel, in the Arpád-Bad in the Hungarian Bekescsaba, it is so strong to heiz oil that is not believed to be in a health bathroom.
The skin comes from the alkali-hydrogen carbon hydrocarbon water that is almost black and its slipper is clothing on the skin when you can swim into the skin - a Wellness experience of the special type.
However, Iris Meder was also disappointed at her search for beautiful bathrooms: when she wanted to visit the free and sunbad in the Czech bath Luhatschowitz bath, she found an outstanding terrain.
The 1902 Architecte Dušan Jurkovic established bad was closed here.
When meder saw a shocked window of the red-wheeled young-style buildings, she saw how unkrain was broken between the streams.
However, the disappearing was affected in a soft swimming pool in the black wood: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three building fascinations have already been behind this bathroom; they can not only find Neroman elements that are from the time of its establishment in 1844, but also a Maurice Hall in the Alhambra style added to 1900.
Since the 1995 careful modernization, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite bathroom of the Pool-Cenerin Iris Meder, and it is not just because it was originally out of the black wood.
"It's already a performance to spend such different construction styles into such a great unity," said Meder.
With such a palace, the smoking in the thermal pool is clearly only the next case.
Advanced Speculation
German bank allows to switch Rohstoff shops
From Christian Teevs
The German bank has its business with agricultural materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has employed a working group to check the consequences of the speculation of the world's poor.
In January, the concert chain will take consequences.
Hamburg -
For the federal citizens, the matter is clear: 84 percent of the Germans are not acceptable in a study that banks with agricultural raw materials, such as wheat or mass, are not acceptable.
Two thirds of the questionnaires call for the German Bank and other credit institutions to increase this business because it causes the problems of the doctors of the world.
This is the result of a Forsa survey in the order of the consumer Foodwatch organization.
The study is based on a report presented by the Foodwatch Middle October.
The author Harald Schumann shows that the laws on the global raw materials are the prices - and therefore the banks have a debt to the world's hunger problem.
Consumer protection campaign is directed against German Bank Chief Josef Ackermann, even if large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley.
Originally, raw material laws were thought to decrease handlers against price changes.
However, the majority of experts agree that the zoockers have joined themselves from offers and demands - and make it possible for the doctors' benefits.
Unlike the US Concurrents, Ackermann reacted to the criticism: he promised to review the predicts and said that no business is "valued to put the good call of the German bank on the game".
According to the information provided by SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group currently examines the substances from the Foodwatch report.
To the end of the year the test will be completed, then the results will be presented to the Head of the German Bank, together with the recommendation of how it should be implemented.
In the end of January, the bank's spectrum will then inform the consequences of the bank.
At the end, a reduction of the raw material business may be, or even the complete decrease.
Ackermann bastels on his image
Foodwatch Chief Thilo Bode welcomed the message, but also confirmed its criticism in the financial sector: "The laws on increased food prices are especially drastics as unrespective banks today damage the general well-being."
Ackermann now stands as the top of bankenlobbyist, especially in the obligation.
"The German bank must strike all the installations from its portfolio where money is used on food prices," said Bode.
"If Mr. Ackermann goes for hungry or for the call of the German bank."
The vision of Ackermann is surprising to the first view, but it is clear that the concerchef wants to give a perfect image a few months before his departure from the office.
In Monday, the German Bank announced that the head of the head would not be changing to the Supervisory Board.
With a decline of the surrounded agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And to make possible invasions, he needs to be slow - so he would finally do his followers.
Each second would declare Rohstoff plants
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure up on the manager.
For now more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the Organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, the floor published a survey for which the Institut Forsa asked on 7 and 8 November 1001 people.
Only 11% of them are in law that the German Bank offers installations for which food prices are offered.
Many bank researchers would also have personal consequences when they know that their bank is involved in such businesses: each second would, according to the investigation, declare all the installations in which money goes into the Rohstoff Speculation.
43 per cent of the accused members of such a bank, 49 per cent were able to think about proclaiming their account and to change their account to another institution.
21th house in Vienna
The turned Palillon
From Ingebor Wiensowski
An architectural history with heights, depths and Happy End: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavillon of Brussels was in Vienna, standing empty and hiding in the museum.
Now he will be reopened as an exhibition house.
When heat by modern post-fight architecture, of clear forms, glass halls, smooth sleeves and new materials that are typically for the faith in the technical progress, then the Austrian pavillon of the Architecte Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels World Exhibition in 1958 is an excellent and famous example.
The Grand Prix d'Architecture was then obtained for its easier and slightly easier steel-glas construction.
The construction is applicable to the Millenstein Time Architecture until today.
He made the architects so known that also built in the next world exhibition of Austria Pavillon.
With his legendary BMW-4ercylinder house in Munchen, he was finally famous internationally.
Pavillon, planned as a temporary exhibition construction, had been established after the world exhibition in the Swiss garden at the South Vienna Railway Court of Vienna, rebuilding and opening a museum of the 20th century - the "20th house" was called it.
The building was suitable but not spacely and technically as a museum - no walls for the hands of the art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used so long until the modern art in Vienna received a new house.
Since 2001, the building was empty and came down.
Now the Architect Adolf Crischanitz has built the pavillon, now he's called "21 house" and is used in the future as a museum for temporary art.
The Belvedere Museum, which belongs to the house, opens the first exhibition - a case of happiness in each regard.
Used the new start of Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Galerie Belvedere 2007.
Husslein-Arco, promoted artsthistorin with attractive carriage, etc. in the youth as a iron artist, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as the Constitution Director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, made the reconstruction in political and thinking protection, which provides public resources and private sponsor payers and sets the use.
Besides the presence, the works of the image hour Fritz Wotruba should be issued from the same foundation, a coffee and a bookload should be given, and a office house had to be built.
Strong supervision, small level
For the implementation, Crischanitz was the ideal condition.
Not only because he turned and enhanced Joseph Olbrich's sequence in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied in the technological university of Wien and the pavillon was a "unnecessary important place" for him, in which he had regarded the exhibitions.
He knew the ur-project, and he knew the problems of the building that lost in his translation to Vienna and its use of greatness and lightness.
The building was "one energy switch", says Crischanitz.
The window profiles of the glassfassade were used, strong glass flash isolier glass and replaced the glass snake by special security glass.
Clean bridges are reinforced or replaced, and fully filled cuts were sanized.
Two undergrounds brought places for the new use, a cut light grain between the house and the road ensures the lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new construction, but still the light swimming pupil.
The original foreign doors have remained, the house is stolen in the old red blue red protection color.
And the cinema is even exactly as he was previously.
And that's all under closer supervision of the thinking authority and with a small state.
"If you had to find a material that is good and suitable, and also filled with the thinking protection office", says Crischanitz, and spends on a ruling ground in the underground.
In spite of all traces, problems and rebuilding, the building is flexible and easy to stay.
Unfortunately, it had been with the pavillon, "the one from Brussels" said recently, a typical "Drop-in-the-City history".
Thus a architecture was "forever on the wrong place" and, however, wants to "wear a right conscience."
But in this case the 21th house is not in the wrong place, because it is a city's lucky case: for the Swiss garden, the entirely newly planned "Hauptbahn Courtquarters", with offices and households.
And there may be another lucky case: the 21th house could be strengthened by another crisis bau, since the Sammler Francesca of Habsburg has purchased the Berlin temporary Kunsthalle, and, as you hear, it is already negotiating with the city about a neighborhood location in the Swiss garden.
Rail plant Winter Crisis package in millions higher
The rail has implemented a crisis plan to prevent additive accidents in winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
That costs millions.
In the fight against winter-conditioned additives and passes, German trains have a newspaper report in this year more than 70 million euros.
The "image" project previously reported on a concerted crisis plan, with a total of EUR 300 million to 2015.
This aims to improve the availability of vehicles and steel networks in extreme strikes.
It is planned, among other things, to double the internal and external employees for the removal of snow on rail stations and rail trends to 16.000 people.
It is aimed to release trains up to the start of operation and 90% of the skin and ice-free times within 4 to 5 hours.
Two months ago, Ran-Chef Rüdiger Grube was also warned in this winter after a piece with government and industry prior to accession accidents and losses.
In the past winter, the trains had significant problems in personal transport, as it was lacking in reserves, among others, in difficult weather conditions.
Thus many new regional routes have been waiting for a permit of the rail station for years.
Furthermore, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trends.
The rail has also been able to create years that they have to be more frequently examined by ICE trains after an ICE in the Köln main station was broken.
German Bank pays millions of punishment in the United States
After the Tumult to Chief Josef Ackermann comes new income from the United States: the German Bank needs to pay a million bus.
If the problems are not yet sufficient for the German bank, the sectors are still in the United States: the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million in comparison with $145 million (106 million), in order to accompany strictness because of the pledge of five major share banks during the financial crisis.
It's about sales of hypotheken papers.
The financial market regulator NCUA proposes a whole series of large banks to have led to the Community banks with false discussions on the purchase of financial products; they would have played the risks.
Such papers have been deteriorate during the financial crisis and the banks slowed to the depth.
"We are satisfied that we could solve the topic without having the parties to take the court", said a German bank talker in New York.
The bank did not have a debt with the comparison.
This also applies to the citizens group, which obliged $20.5 million to pay.
Debbie Matz, President of NCUA, welcomed the income of the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (CNUA) is responsible for the US Society Banks and is launched to protect the customer facilities.
The NCUA is trying to replace the resulted billion damages.
The present closed comparisons are the first of their type.
In the summer JPMorgan Chase, the Regulator also declared Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The fragrant hypothecus papers are named "mortgage-backed securities".
These are based on households.
When the US Immobile Blase was placed in 2007, this was a variety of financial enterprises.
In September 2008, at the level of the financial crisis, the US Investment Bank Lehman Brothers slaughtered.
Even if the events are back for a few years, the banks today in the United States have a huge wind.
Investmenters and supervisory authorities have struggled in numerous cases to obtain re-advisory or adverse errors.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has solved the biggest wave.
It offers 18 international banks to have transferred the two state financial fans Mae and Freddie Mac in hypotheken businesses in about 200 billion dollars.
The German Bank must also provide a share of the FHFA, which is about several businesses in value of a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The Supervisory Authority requires that the Frankfurts be just for "substantial losses" without calling for a precise amount.
The German Bank had reaffirmed the demands as a decrease and declared to want to smile.
Warren Buffett increases with 10 billion in IBM
Financial guru Buffett invests strongly in IT companies IBM.
Since March, he has purchased shares of more than ten billion dollars.
The great American investor Warren Buffett has always stated that it was not to invest in IT and computer companies, since the long-term development of the company was just badly prognosed.
But now he read the business reports of IBM and changed his opinion on investments in the sector.
He has already understood that IBM offers services in particular and provide computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment of Warren Buffett applies to the financial world.
As a result, the IT original IBM should now be called "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett now enthusiasmed in the CNBC US, that he has purchased IBM shares in value of $10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has resulted in one of IBM's largest shareholders with a share of 5,5%.
Buffett said that even IBM had not been aware of something of the commitment.
He glorified the management that had been made in the economic crisis even for the general profits.
"You've done a great job," Buffet said to Strategy.
IBM has been placed on the lucrative IT services, such as the operation of account centres.
The more than 100 years of old computer pioner also offers software and advice, as well as performance company computers.
Buffett had been more measured by technology companies.
He says he only investes in businesses whose business he also understands.
Instead, Buffet took place at a shipping train, with a machine manufacturer or machine manufacturer.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway has about 80 own daughter companys also shared in a number of large concerts such as Coca-Cola or the Munich Re, the former Munich back.
In the 1960s, the 81-year-olds had received the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and developed them with pleasant investments to one of the most valuable enterprises in the world.
But it's his lifestyle.
Hence, he is a figure of culture for innumerable investors worldwide.
His almost unreasonable sense for money service has introduced the "Orakel of Omaha".
Following the advertising complaints of Buffet investment, the IBM action was predominantly increased by a percentage.
"Big Blue", as also called IBM, is a total of $220 billion in the barse, and it is together with Apple and Microsoft to the most valuable technology companies in the world.
With Microsoft, this said Buffet, but he didn't want to get up.
The founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is cruel
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Cell", Turkish media are doubtful in the German legal state.
A newspaper speaks of a "blue ideology", which now lives again.
The murder of eight Turkishs and a Greek small employee in the years 2000-2006 had a legal extractive background.
This message is reacted with fear and concern in Turkey and in the German population in Germany.
Because for many German turks, it has been a long-term confidenced scene: since the burning events in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has no comparable violence against Turkey.
However, what is foreign in Germany, it has never been questioned.
However, the discovered right extremist network reveals the extents of which the size is still not reducable.
"When the blue ideology live again?" titled the internet output of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
However, the newspaper "Sabah" notes that one of the murders should have been a V-man of the Constitution, and is concerned that German authorities could also be implemented in the legal radiical summary.
Betons reacted to the Turkish community in Germany: she recalled the weekend with a guard in front of the Brandenburg Tor to the victims of racist violence.
First two weeks ago, the Turkish community in Berlin had thought together with German and Turkish politicians in a fifty-first-year anniversary of the German Procurement Agreement.
In pleasant colors, the one was inspired as a history of success.
As a listener, the reporting of some Turkish media: "Germany's gift to the fifty-first" is the heading of a article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
In addition, Germany's expenditure of the "conservation" is not able to take this thankful connection.
"It's starting to strike," says the title of the columns of Ahmet Kulahci.
He emphasizes that people were murdered, paying taxes and making a significant contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
It is also critical in the German Internet Forces, the police's action and their later expert followers are discussed.
Why the German authorities haven't been much more invaded to search for suspects in legal extreme circles, the authors are wondering.
Some are at least rhetoric to drastic means: "If the migrants continue to be shocked here, there is nothing else than self-defence and weapons."
"This will probably be the best self-protection."
"Under the goodness of the declaration and compatibility of the punishment of the whole network is very strong of the internal peace in Germany," writes "Selen".
What does it mean, if the internal peace in Germany is in danger, the cases of males and solvents in the ninety-years.
The photo of Solingen' Brandruine is deeply vulnerated in German and Turkey's memory.
Because no other event showed the living Turkishs here more clearly that there is a huge threat, and the Germans that mis confidence and distance can be in the right violence.
However, the appeal was shocked by our feelings on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat past errors
In the Turkish press, mainly, the errors of German policy were understood: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of moulds.
After the fire attack of Solingen, he sent a telegram to the Turkish presidents, but was on the celebration of Köln, his Minister of Foreign Affairs, Klaus Kinkel, who was then counted in his speech how many expenditure were cutting towers.
Just as the value of a person will be calculated after its tax rates.
The present reporting of the Turkish media again shows how deep the infidelity of many German turbulents is in the fair state of law.
In addition to the efforts of a comprehensive declaration and re-evaluation of the legal extreme terrorism in Germany, it is necessary to open words.
The Scandal Bank of the Zürisee
The most desperate European bank is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS was almost bank-roaded in the financial crisis, and it was painted from a crisis to the next.
Now it's a German.
That's how Axel Weber didn't think.
After his spectacular department from the Federal Bank, he was known in July that in 2013 he would have a new job nearly as spectaculaire: the Swiss Council President of the Grand Bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative carriage.
Axel Weber was publicly pleased, loving the Switzerland if it was their beauty and the UBS whether her newly gained solidarity and made friendly comments on the future colleagues.
"The UBS has done the tournament."
"I'm glad to cooperate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grobel."
But in September it was clear that everything would be different.
A UBS handler in London had crossed all bank security systems and shooted around 1,7 billion euros.
The UBS supervisor Oswald Grubel, who was not only in the Swedish bankers, had to go.
The UBS Administrative Council has also been assaulted - and all asks, when will Axel Weber finally come?
It was noted that Weber could consult the bank from February 2012.
And the Council's presidency has already been overlooked in May - not only in 2013, as the bank was informed on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, it's hard.
He is not a banker, more economic prosecutors and notes and had certainly been necessary for a processing period.
He then takes the responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has reaffirmed the title "great Skandal Bank Europes" for a while.
Because the UBS is a huge part - until recently she was the largest possession manager of the world - and, on the other hand, has been painted from a scandal in the next.
Nothing, so it seems to be, the first time the Swedish bank remains so proud.
It started in the financial crisis.
By 2007, the UBS had an excellent call.
The image of the disappeared and solid, but also equipped Swiss owner has combined with ambitious objectives: she also wanted to become a whole large number in the investment banking.
Thus, UBS 2007 managed $1.6 billion more money-related customers than any other bank in the world.
And otherwise she was represented as an investment bank in the liga of the largest banks in the world.
That made it impression.
The only banker and later long-year bank professor in Zurich Hans Geiger told: "My students have always set the UBS as a pattern of a good bank."
"But today's view is asking, how could I just be so irritated?"
He was struggling.
In 2007, it was obvious that some part in the UBS was the first time.
In the middle of the year, head of the head, Peter Wuffli, was surprisingly returned, who became high-intelligent and also generic bankers.
A few months later, he was shocked why he was gone.
The bank's investment part had been shocked with sub-Pres-papiers and had to register billions.
In order to debt this, the UBS announced an increase in capital in the level of say and writes 13 billion Frances.
For this, she found investors, however, which were, some of the skins soon before: an intransparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab State Fund, who was so unexpected that they did not ever learn his name.
But that was just the first thing.
In April 2008, it was worse.
The Bank had to announce new billion losses, Mr Marcel Osple, President of the Governing Council, 2006, and the Switzerland's second most paid administrative Council.
In October 2008 the disaster followed: the UBS was in view of their error investments in the financial crisis before the slaughter and had to be saved by the State.
The National Bank has purchased the UBS for several milliards of difficulty papers, which the Swiss Swedish Employment gave six billion Frances for a slow-scale change rate, which could become a mid-sized parent of the bank.
The whole Swedish was shocked - because she noted how dramatic it is for a small country when it hides so large banks.
Finally, the UBS balances in 2007 were more than five times large as Switzerland’s economic performance (see graphics).
"We couldn't save the UBS again," she says banken researcher.
The first disaster closed the second.
Shortly a few months ago, the UBS was capitalized in the tax line with the United States and was ready to issue the data of the ownerships who could have sent taxes with the bank.
She also agreed to a payment of $780 million - as a reimbursement of unjustified profits from these businesses and punishment.
In this regard, the UBS was known more or less open to help in tax interference.
At the same time, she lost something that has been in the competition for rich customers: the nimbus of the deficit.
After the skandal, the Swiss bank secret was not the same.
The retreat was followed by the Head and President of the Governing Council.
And the exodus of customers.
Thus the bank had lost their credibility in two central business areas within less months: in investment banking by slow speculations and in the ownership management through the aid to tax interaction.
And just when there was something more quiet, just as you thought, now the UBS will go back to it, as follows this unlike handler history: a single handler hide 1,7 billion euros before the bank notices that something's driving.
And it will be obvious: with the risk management in investment banking it is obviously not yet.
"In the case of Adoboli, the risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, Economic and Financial Profesor at the Bank Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial term of a large German bank is also safe: "The problem of the UBS is that it has no risk controls".
It was exactly the idea of the swedish bankiers had happened long ago to be the gardens of the great possessions of the world: there was no too large risks for money - also the Alpen Republic would take the world together.
The Swiss banks' treasurers were the symbol for unforeseen confidence, such as Lindt and Springli for special shocklade.
The UBS Center in Zurich still goes to the clinic of the Swiss private bank - she is just a bit greater.
Soon the situation is classical.
The bank has its headquarters on the Züicher Railway Streets, which leads directly to the Zurich Sea, which is rounded by the Swiss mountain hills.
The buildings here are clear, the loads belong to the highest in Europe.
Youths like Tiffany are found here between Swiss Traditional businesses such as the Conference Springli.
Since centuries, the Swiss banks live here: from the National Bank over the palace of the Suisse to the elite private banks like Juliaus Bar.
The UBS receiving room is involved by a serious drought door.
There are the walls of marble clothes, since there are swimming lederssels, along with the bank logo, a large switch to "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has both Swiss big banks, UBS and credit Suisse, but somewhat swimming - or surprised how the chief found a small Swiss private bank.
He would not like to read his name in the newspaper, but finally makes it, like all Swiss bankers, also with the two large banks businesses.
The UBS has become too large, and he finds, especially in the investment bank, where the Angelsachsen had also expanded.
The Swissers had nothing to say there.
"And if, they've been adapted to the Angelsachsen for a long time."
Indeed, it was the remarkable investment banking that changed the UBS, which was the first high profits and then the debate: No European Finance Institute has lost so much money as the Swiss Great Bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was visible.
"In the midday, the government coalition of the small seven million Denmark decided the greatest rescue action in the history of her nation," writes the author Lukas Hassig in his book "The UBS-Crash".
Up to 68 billion Franco or around 45 billion euros, politicians were allowed to save the large bank in front of the bank route.
How could it happen?
You're talking to Swiss bankers, so you see the problem, especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss large banks were closed to a violent concert.
There was a bank that was already too large for the Swiss Switzerland - and was still grown.
As a result, the two different UBS banks complemented: a rich but sleeping bank with the main point of ability management in Zurich and a warm but more internationalized.
The internationalized investment banks were so favourable that they could turn a huge root.
Two names are linked to this increase of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Osple, then President of the Board of Administration.
"I always thought Wuffli and Osple were a dream team," says banken researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high-speaking news, which understands much of models and statistics, and Osple, the bottleman who has worked up from the bank teacher to the top."
But Ospel's finally left on Wuffli.
And at the end, Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models are the reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
Clearly: Persuasion came before the case.
The UBS workers have clearly reminded the leadership meetings, on which Conzernchef Wuffli has always been the same pieces: the Goldman Sachs stood from the throne.
The American Bank was the most powerful land investment bank.
She introduced the "League Tables", the ring lists that documented the success of the banks at that time.
That's what the UBS wanted to get up.
A few steps you'd been happy.
In the carriage business and in the share trade, she played fully above.
However, enterprises advisers who were employed have a weakness: in international interest business, in the "Fixed Income" language, there is a huge distance to the largest banks.
UBS has skins in American hypotheks products.
To close this laugh, UBS was in an absent that she almost costed the existence.
Unfortunately after growth, both the bank itself and a sub-American sub-stated hedge fund invested.
It was developed to a violent machine that packed and extended value papers on American hypotheken crops - but it also had risks.
Even when other banks have long been looking for the expansion.
"And in the summer 2007 when the US real estate market was in Flammen, the UBS has purchased there", said Banken experts.
So large the Euphorie, so deep of the case.
A manager had to go after the other than making the attempts harder than thought.
The posts at the UBS were switching and they are safe until today.
Whoever leads the big bank now has a job nearly impossible.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank that has come to all the nearby business models.
Bank researchers have already a idea: finalized with investment banking, concentration on property management, return to Swiss roots.
It's not so far as the bank (not yet) wants to go.
But the investment bank has to be shocked strongly, so much is clear now.
On Thursday, the new bank chief Sergio Ermotti in the world wants to present its future strategy.
In fact, the 51-year-old Swiss was only considered a transitional solution when the bank was surprisingly trended by transgressors.
In the midst, he was able to conduct the business of the UBS on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return to the state of the ninety-years of the investment bank.
3500 places strict.
But that's not going to be rich.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to win?
That's the questions that Axel Weber is safe now.
He's only saying he's going to find one apartment with his wife once in Zurich.
Next year.

Europe will not be able to free from a recession so quickly, and there are further signs of the weakness in the banks.
The investing warren Buffett just confirmed this perspective: it is not clear that Europe is enough to do everything for the end of the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.

Intelligent forces are wide in cities
Many places apply to seed power as a "unfortunate birds": but from the cities the high-intelligent animals are not allowed to disappear for a long time.
The ones they liked to quickly get away from the others: the powers belong to the city image for centuries, but in many communities, the complaints of the habitat are struck by dreck and laugh of the animals.
There is no means a means against the "unfortunate birds" until now.
Seven forces were not to get out of the cities, experts said at the first sympathy of the East African League.
There were experts from the whole federal territory on possible ways.
You're looking for alternatives in the towns
Natural protectioners also returned the problems in the cities to the agriculture of the specially protected seed forces: the chemical impairment in the agriculture increased the traditional lives.
The jagd, growing construction and the case of typical brown trees made the birds difficult life.
The powers are under natural protection.
The large colonies with more than 600 brown couples are located in the west, in the northeastern west, in Jever, the depholz and acim in bremen and in empty.
There 2005 had been a restraint project on the massive killing of powers in the landcraft for Negativ slaughter lines.
Critics were called the fish of animals in birds and the shooting with buttons was particularly brutal.
"The normal disappearing, the grain, brings nothing", has found the city and landscape planned Werner clubs from empty.
Instead of splitting with water or falling trees, often have unwanted consequences, said also the environment expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals smell, great colonies split up and distribute themselves to other places."
Restriction is only possible for exception of hospitals, age houses or schools.
"We have to live with them, we don't get them away."
Without the Umland, the problem was not resolved in the cities, Mr Wolfgang Kelner said from empty.
It is likely to be a combination of animals' plants from sensitive housing areas and logging offers to restore them to other places.
"Infotafels instead of chat skins", however, were psychologists and ethnologists Uta Maria Jürgens for a very common interference with the animals: "Uta Maria Jürgens, we can finally produce the best consciousness."
Jürgens had found the Ascheberger Force-Learning in Schleswig-Holstein, to inform the instructor about the life of high-intelligent seed powers.
The project is already adopted by tourists.
Also to criticize the birds, Jürgen had a own view: "There is every number of communications that have to say much."
The intelligence and availability of the animals are legendary: seed powers are not only used for helping to come to a lecker drink, but also to make their own tool.
Conduct researchers at the university Cambridge tested four seed powers as far as the intellectuality of the birds is available.
In a experiment, birds learned rapidly that with stones they had to put a snake into a shoe to reach such a skin wheel.
Without a lot of training, they were strict to recognize what size and shape they had to have a stone to put the platform into.
In a second trial, the efficient forces had to solve a more slipper problem.
The researchers had plated a small egg-merce with a mood wheel.
The birds couldn't reach their legs with the snake.
However, the researchers had put their droughts.
Thus, all four animals formed a hake, with the help they shocked the eggs on the griff out of the roof.
Three of the four seed powers were even on anfieb.

Mass switch at a personal level
Peter Englinds begins a new book "Brightness and shame. A story of the First World War, in nineteen sleeves" with a long list of main persons that go to heart.
Here is a tip how you can go: Switch this page carefully and make it to your bookmarks.
You will know these people in English very well. And these main persons will work as your GPS, as a light tour in these few moments, in which you lost the Englind men and women in the nebule of the war and have lost your illusions.
Peter Englind is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Price for Literature.
He has written an infinite book that he does not describe as "a work of the anti-story."
There are only few large names, important contracts or famous dealings. There are no posters, rather reporters or discussions on tactics and equipment.
It's less than a book about what happened, but it explains, more than "A book about how it was." It's about "Smotions, impressions, experiences and stimulations."
"Beauty and shame" almost the war trials of more or less unreasonable men and women on both sides of the war, from schools and botanics to mountains, doctors, hospital vehicles and officers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some will be disappointed or died for war prisoners, loss of membership.
Each of these lives reflects as the vowkers in a church, some come up while solving others.
The English book depends on the customs books.
It also corrects the idea that the first World War was only the promised position war on the Western front.
"Beauty and sharp" flows with expertise on other war views: the Alpen, the Balkan, the Eastfront, Mesopotamien, East Africa.
On the soldiers in this book, bird crowd falls, a celebrated Christmas among the piramids in Egypt, Tsets were an unsolvable problem.
This is almost from the beginning to a moved book.
The war exceeds the life of these people like a natural disaster, such as a hurrican Katrina who smiles to Cordit.
You think you're a woman who's home with her children and canon fires in the television. Do you stay or take the flight?
Who's coming?
When someone understands what happens or why this war will be carried out.
"Filt facts," says english, "bearing with confusions, acceptances, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiration theories, dreams, alpsome dreams and gratitudes."
"Beauty and shame" follows individuals like Florence Farmborugh, a English sick sister in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German shipsman.
Their stories were mainly taken memories, letters and other material already published.
Your life reports can be horrible or enormous, but they are extremely living in England in the assembly of small moments in detail.
Many of them acts of lack and help.
In the history of a German school girl, he said, "Please, overall replacement."
"Off coffee, false aluminium, false radiergummi, paper associations, wooden head."
He told more than the replacement in Germany.
He describes "Flee that made from pressed trip and was backed in Hammelfett (and lastly served with a false skin from wood), Tabak, which was made out of wooded roots and shooted shoes, which were resolved with wood."
It was noted that, as he noted, "837 registered food supplements that were allowed in the production of wildlifes were registered in 511."
Some stories act on honor and tapness.
One American acknowledges his own gang to wildness and says about the war: "It is feeling that, despite all this is what was prepared for men to sit in the slope, with the nightblatt or the bisseller, and a cigarette and a wisky in the hand, and as a result of such a fascinated civilization and, as a result, no barbary behind the own and shocked stomach."
On the other hand, a British soldier recognises that he probably dies and no one takes care of it or will take care of it.
"If you think of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that this happens before a public", he writes.
Instead, it's so terrified as "un condemned man in the secret."
Other observations are conducted by the old Europe, which is different and about new types of terrorism.
"The conflict has grown growing to an economic competition," Englind writes, "a war between the manufactures."
He begins to arrive in what he calls "a new species in the Bestatiarium of the young century": "the word used and ideologically convinced masses murderer in a measure that kills while he sits behind a desktop."
People act in an unexpected way, and there are also free behaviors like heroism.
Englind is the soldiers who were active to move in a prostituted with sexual disease to depart from the front service.
"The great expression that can be found in the trade with the Gonokokes, because soldiers purchased and smiled on their genitals, in hope to come to the hospital's home," he wrote.
"They who were really desired shouted him in the eyes, which leaded to the rest of their life blind."
In this translation from the Swedish Peter Graves, the Englinds Poesie is ridicule and is perfect to his human task.
Independence of small scenes, he starts the way the war "in one way uncontrolable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hair".
People start to ask why their leaders bring them to battle.
The best books over the First World War were most false than Paul Fussells "Great War and Modern Memory" or Romane like Erich Maria Remarques "Im Westen nothing new" than an extensive shooting book.
Englinds Band is involved in an unconventionable ruhmeshalle.
His book has the most excited end that I read in a spectacle.
I don't give it anymore.
But it's like he would have shooted us with his book with the main persons before the nase and shooted us with a slipper.
After a preceding failure, a minute planned transaction
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them had an approximation.
You had decided for Monday's night, because at that time there are little people in the Zucotti Park.
The operation was held secret and only few high-range officials were informed. All others believed that they were starting to participate in a practice.
President Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence stressed that the operation had full challenges.
The incidents of the last weeks such as the use of Pfefferspray against protesters, which disrupts the rules of the cernat, and the householders had a huge increase in public sympathies, were no longer to repeat.
And so the police action was carried out to remove Protestors from the Zuccotti Park after two weeks of planning and training.
The officers had prepared this by watching how designments were handled in other cities.
A catastrophic process was held with a view of Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
The officers strengthened the so-called chaos training - measures to combat terrorism, which also includes a large number of police officials to concentrate on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit was located on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The command to get into the park came "in the last minute", said someone who is trusting with the command, which said for a declaration as "exercise".
"The little police that were involved in my knowledge did not know that it went about the Zuccotti Park," said someone who wanted to remain anonym.
"The only ones who knew it was about the Zuccotti Park were the high-ranging officials of the resort."
A reason for the secret was a lesson that had learned the city.
On October 14, the officers wanted to spend the park, but then they returned when hundreds of protesters came together after they had learned from these plans.
The officers of various police units were involved in the operation of Tuesday, including hundreds of mobile officials, which are normally in high criminal neighbourhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day, many people in the park are in and out, almost like Pendler, so that 1 hour in the night is a good time to get in.
"It was appropriate to do this when the smallest number of people stand in the park," he said.
Reservation vehicles with jupiter lamps and sound speakers were ready before the drive on the Pike Slip and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive close to the Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the previously signed news that triggered from the speakers are seeming to be threatened by many protesters.
When the public officials entered their blue windjacks in the park, many protesters simply cooked their things together and left the place.
The police said that until 1:45 hours there would not be a strike to give the Protestants time to pack her hair and good together.
Other staff teams were seen how they gathered together in the area to enter into, the arrests should be required in the park.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, speaker of the President of the police, said that this happened to their own security.
But many journalists said they wanted to stop watching the police action at the park, and they said that the officers were very distant.
Mr. Browne said that television cars in Church Street could be done on the west side of the park photos.
When the police moved in the direction of West through the great interchange of personal things of the Protestors, including coppers, arts and murders with clothes, followed her employees of the city's rule, which was left away.
Some protesters, who refused to go, were shocked outside. Images from this appeared shortly on the Internet.
A main tank of protesters was close to the kitchen area of the ladder in the center of the park position.
Some barriers created, and the police continued their methodic arrests.
About 10 people in the epicentrum of the lakes were assembled with their arms.
And two people held themselves on trees, said Mr. Kelly.
The officers of the Protection of the Catastrophe were called to disable them.
As Mr. Kelly said, there were no arrests in the park until 3:30 p.m.
The residence was closed after the police's reports over 75 minutes.
Mr. Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
The majority of the arrests, as he said, was "invalid infringement and resistance to a arrest".
The most powerful official was Joseph J. Esposi, head of the Division, the highest uniformized official of the Division.
Phil T. Pulaski, Head of Criminal Officers, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly, "Don't work", as Mr Browne said.
In the case that they should access, a second group of officials waited on the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
In the Cortlandt Street, a road block north of the park, and in the Pine Street, a block on the south, barrikats were built.
It could be observed how these positions from the police continued to extend the surrounding around the Zuccotti Park.
On a place, it was observed as several officials, many of them with protectors, people run outside.
About 28 people were located in the northern environment.
Some of the most violent actions of the night were found in the south of the park.
On 5 p.m. on the south of the Pine Street a Protestler on the jail of a police vehicle and other demonstrators left the air out of a police bus.
There was a lot of pieces of sperrrow on a place.
At the end, a officer and a protester came to the hospital.
Training the employee will be accompanied by dismissing the city
The workshop, which has lost their job in the last month, plans to spend the city at midnight, as the releases resulting in their unreasonable impact on the schools teaching the poor students were not necessary and discriminatory.
The complaint is likely the latter possibility that the company, the Council of Justice 37, is still open in its efforts to make the discharges back.
Sixty-third school assistants, care coordinators and other employees who were belonging to the worst payers of the city and lost their work on 7 October, the employees were described as a political rush that the access to a health fund that had been undertaken by the working groups should be closed in the last year.
This accused was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the City Council, Dennis M. Walcott, Director of the Schools, said in the last month, the exemptions were part of the budget that were adopted in June.
A member of the city Council turned back and explained that in the budget there is nothing more specific that workers would be left for school assistance.
The officers of the City Council 37 said they had been and waiting for the Ministry of Education before a complaint. In the mid-day, it will be given a press conference on which the inquiry of the complaints is formally announced before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The complaint will deal with Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education in the city as a complaint and eight employees decided to be able to count as firms who are the whole city's fabric or Latin American women, such as most of the helpers who have lost their job.
Elizabeth Thomas, a speaker of the Ministry of Justice in the city, said that the city was not able to be commented on their individual auctions.
According to a New York Times project, the workshop has focused on the number of school releases in the poor parts of the city to support an inequalizer treatment. They said that the poor schools would have lost more helpers since they were chronically funded.
She claims that, while there were no releases on State Island and only few departures in the upper East Side or TribeCa schools, 17 school helpers in the district 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, have lost and 46 helpers were abandoned in the districts 8 and 9 in South Bronx.
With the determination of the loss of five of eight school helpers in Harlem in the public school 36, where 68 percent of the students lived in poverty, the complaint states: "This is no neighbouring parents who are visiting to organize costs in order to get budgetary shortages."
P.S.: The budget of 36. district was slowed to 3,26% this year. In addition, money lost when the city changed their calculation method for extra financing for each army school.
The workshop also claims that the leaders of the High Schools were conducted through the language in a memo, which approved the discharge of the care coordinators.
The Memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even though "excess" (excess: transfer) in the United States generally describes the changing of a teacher from the content list of a school in a pool available workers payed by the central place.
"Sixty-sixty-four coordinators were dismissed, not overcome," said the draft of appeal.
Mission End, Congress will be ready to understand Libyan
Lastly, it seems like the Republicans and Democrats in Washington to understand the situations in Libya.
All that was necessary was the success of the Revolt, the arrest and murder of the long-year Diktator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of the American infringement.
On Thursday, the Senate's International Relations Committee decides a resolution which is supported by the President John Kerry (Massachussetts) together with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Amorrman (Connecticut) by loving Libyan for the successful rebellion and the US-American troops for their "Mut".
"This resolution respects the sweet people of Libyan who have started to rebuild their country," said Kerry.
"He is a confirmation of supporting its democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may be innocent, but until now there was nothing simply in the Libyan debate.
This summer, lawyers of both parties and the White House were strict to select a series of resolutions for approval or missing the role of the US military in the Libyan Mission of NATO.
In June Kerry and McCain proposed a resolution which approved the restricted use of the US military forces in Libya.
The law was resigned by a wide group of both parties, and there was no vote.
However, on the same day, this law went to the Senate, and the Chamber also agreed a decision on the reducing of the money for American operations in Libya.
The United States mission was in a kind of legislative fegefuer - with a convention that was enough to criticize Obama's action within the mission, but is not sufficiently angry to finally remove the ground under his feet.
Then the unsolvedness of the convention was taken from the events.
Tripolis was killed in August under the libyan rebelles and Gaddafi on October 20.
The NATO Mission officially completed on October 31th.
Now the Senator may be ready for trade.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "gratulizes the people of Libyan to their huge courage and outstanding duration in their self-determination" and "goes the men and women of the US-American military and their coalition partners, supporting military operations for the protection of humans in Libya, for their extraordinary courage and professionality".
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States to a successful and unrelated transition to democracy".
Will new measures receive full support by the Agency for Foreign Relations or will they hear the legislators as it has done in June?
The latter sentences on the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the Spitzen-Republicator of the Committee.
Lugars speaker said on Monday that he has not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Capitol, this week is to vote on a constitutional amendment, which calls for a balanced budget, a top priority nearly every conventional period of the Republicans and some democrats.
The measures under the direction of the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change of the budget or another area which comes to vote at the Senate or Congress at the time.
Other legislators have already tried to make their amendments to vote, although they have often tried enough.
Good change is only one of 68 constitutional changes presented by this Congress and includes a whole band width of the topics.
Some are doubled - the same law has been presented to both the Congress and the Senate - the others have only slowly declined.
There is only 15 versions of the balance budget change in the Senate and another twenty-five that would "controlle land expenditure".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their contractors - especially the committees with the Republicans who want to oppose their life course - the possibility that they have a "verified" measure.
The budget control law adopted in August requires both Senate and Congress to vote on a change in the budget compensation.
In March 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution which supports the idea of such a change.
Furthermore, some members want to limit the number of provisions that the members of the Congress are able to present, while the Republic of José E. Serran (New York) wants to reduce the limitation to two official periods of the President.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) proposed a number of amendments which guarantee the right to good education and health.
An amendment prohibited by a council under the same gender is as a change that subjects to the breaking of fabrics, a always reversing model.
Some legislators also want to allow the suspension of federal laws if the two-thirds of the States reject them.
As the Member States proposed amendments, they move as fast as in the past years.
At 111th Congress, legislators introduced 77 such amendments in 110th Congress 66.
The time is allowed in comparison with the previous 1990s, in which members regularly prescribed more than 150 changes every two years, so the numbers available by the Senate Library are available.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment that has been added - on 27th - was ratified in 1992, but it was already proposed to the 1789 Congress.
Gifford's first television interview after the attack
Ten months after a weaponed man was shocked on them during a election event in Tucson, the Republic of Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) took up the Monday at the national television. She sang only to Broadway Suck "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to get back to the Congress was greater than the one to return.
When she met with Diane Sawyer in the ABC news "20/20", she took words and needed help to go.
The sending showed the serious slow recovery of the damage that the ball that shared its shoes, the left side of their brain and has established her head from front to the bottom.
Three months ago, she was surprised to return to the Congress to triumphantly depart their voice to a debt break.
In her first television interview after the attack in January, when six people killed and 13 were blessed, Gifford laughed and sanged, and described their geneticness as "swimming".
When Sawyer asked how she felt, Gifford (41): "Good good."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a unique "20/20" specialist, which was recorded short before the publication of the new book of the wife: "Gabby: a story of courage and hope".
The special follows Gifford's genes since the attack of 8 January.
In videos that Kelly recorded in the first weeks, you see her in the hospital bed, with a shocked head and a long shock over the shore.
She can only have one or two fingers if her husband encourages her.
Months later, Giffords sits in a roll table while therapy shows how they perform simple movements.
A Nick with the head.
A sugar with the lips.
And then, their first words, "What".
After a few days, Giffords fly another word: "Toast." You want to change your breakfast.
Videos played in the ABC show show that music played an important role in Gifford's genesis: You see how the Congress members are sing with Cyndi Laupers "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Pettys "Free Fallin".
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords said that therapy was two hours daily that she could not remember on the day of the attack.
Her husband said that he had read a article of a day period about the attack on 12 March when she interrupted him and first asked the six people who were killed during the attack.
The smooth shooting Jared Lee Loughner sits in a prison in Missouri and is illly treated while waiting for his negotiations.
"My people died," Gifford's Sawyer said.
"Harth, heart, heart."
In the course of his wife's generous, Kelly Sawyer told her, "I was taken."
"So, I would say, "Gabby, you weren't settled?" said Kelly.
You've only got it.
And you'll get it, and you'll get back to you and you'll return more stronger than ever before.
Trumps are more suffering than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that collected millions of dollars for unobserved veteranos in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, flexibility and loss.
On a shuttle, hundreds of soldiers, matros, pilots and marine were assembled around him.
The amount in black smokings standed up and applauded.
"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the spending action in the early year.
A rangy military officer on the Gala, which was observed by the chief and then President, was observed by the Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the armies differently.
"They were introduced as skins," the officer wrote in a email.
I'm sure the organizations have done it well.
I know.
But it wasn't respect, really not.
The crowd of opposite impressions illustrate the serious relationship between the military and the most distanced, sometimes wonderful American publicity.
The troops will be overcome with Lob for their victims.
But the Lob has his price, say the officers.
The public is growing as you did the people in Uniform suffering.
"We were no way victims," said General Brigade Sean B. MacFarland, who defended the armies in Iraq and soon goes to Afghan.
"But it seems to be the only way of supporting those to press us in the role of unfortunate souls."
The theme is extremely sensitive for military leaders who want to appear to be unacceptable or in conflict with the public they serve.
They also recognized that the wrath that returning armies in the past years of Vietnam war was worse.
As a result, there are discussions on suffering in the style and private between war veterinaries.
After his two sons were returned from battle with the Marines, the Colonel A.D. Mark Cancian warned them before that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would be viewed with a sense of honour, because they were shocked to rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would ask whether a "weaponable veteran is hidden under the surface", said Cancian, who struggled in Iraq and took a higher state post in Washington after his return.
During his work search, he said, he felt that some of the questionnaires asked whether he was able to stay back after his return from the fight to the pressure of a requested post in Washington.
"If you speak about your service, you should keep the negative impressions", Cancian explained his sons.
The lack of light of the military causes part in the missing interest of the Americans in the war.
A country that has little experience with the army and only little benefits in the wars in Iraq and Afghan, will be a country of struggle.
"We're as a nation not looking for military heroes as it was absolutely in the Second World War", said Leutnant General David Barno a.D., who defend the US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the gratitude of the politicians and the public is mainly focused on the suffering of a service member.
Trumps find recognition for the number of attacks they have brought, the number of friends they have lost or the weight of their injuries.
The army is the growing pressure to struggle in assault.
In this week, an important hearing decides whether 28 women and men are accused of non-accepting in a crime before the military court.
If not, hundreds of customers are ready for the next hearing.
Oberge free Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11-week pregnant when she was forced by a soldier college.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her castle in Miramar north of San Diego from the dinner with a friend when she met to a men's colleague who had a 12-pack of beer with herself.
He asked her if he had to join them to a drink in her room.
"My alarm locks went," said Lyman.
But the Texaneanine was shocking their concerns.
I thought, "What, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I had heard of my cup's feelings."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man went behind her, pressed her down and forced her.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other military officers were waiting for a process with a historical hearing in Arlington, Virginia, where a complaint was decided to have been authorized before the former Minister of Defence, Robert Gates and his preachers, Donald Rumsfeld.
The complaint states that the gates and the rums field have not been inflicted against the widely assault within the army and under the violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February of Susan Burke, a law envoyed at Washington, D.C., entitled the complaint of 17 guests who, in the following months, increased at 28 months: 25 women and three men, who claimed all that they were inflicted or sexually misused by soldiers, and that the army was condemned to condemn it, to condemn it or to provide a suitable legal practice after the attacks.
Burke says she follows the top army, as the problem begins there.
"The army has been built here archively," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in the position to shoot the culture's reward? The leadership."
Burke also says that she has contacted about 400 other survivors since February, many of them could be part of future cards.
Your strategy: Instead of putting all skins into a corb, they will, if necessary, reach a lot of other complaints in order to maintain the pressure.
The Defence Minister of Defence, designated by the Federal Prosecutor Neil MacBride, has requested a complaint.
The Acts of the Court, which are presenting Newsweek, are explicitly implementing the Defence Strategy, in the main sense that the army cannot be sentenced by current or previous soldiers for infringements to which it has come to the warrious forces.
On the basis of a law of the Supreme Court of 1950, which is mentioned by the Feres doctrin, the Government does not impede for infringements accompanied by soldiers in the active service.
"The substantial damages occurred during the Military Service of the Chairman," said the document.
The Defence Ministry rejects any comments to this story.
The things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in the battle, the distinction is only in the name: modern wars have only rarely clear fronts.
Even in Iraq as in Afghan, soldiers' teams are increasingly playing important roles, especially in contact with indigenous women in war areas.
The result: between these two wars, 150 soldiers, two thirds of them in combating.
It's time to modernize the army, says Burke.
And she is not in their fight alone; three more than her are depending on.
At the Yale Law School, Veterans' legal Services Clinic provides a complaint against the four most important military rakes because of the promotion of a feminine atmosphere.
Independently, the communal Vietnam veterans of America presents a complaint against the military in which it is concentrated on the diagnosis "Persistence Destruction" which has been offered the responsibilities to resolve them from the service - an ordinary actionists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, her group was enriched against the Veterans Administration (e.g.: War Veterinary Management), in which it provides its discriminatory practices with performance requirements for persons indicated to be sexually misused in the service.
Nine laws were submitted by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties to the Congress, which offers a number of maintenance points.
According to the 2010 Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (t.e.: Office for Prevention and Notification of Sexual Abuse) of the Ministry of Defence was shown 3.158 sexual miscarriages.
However, most of the missiles are not reported and, according to the own estimation of the Pentagon, this number takes into account about 13.5% of the estimated 19.000 cases in which it comes per year.
The report published in March also investigated the penalty rates: in 2010 20% of the most investigated cases in the army were before the court, only half of which was in civil law.
The applicants in Burke's case describe their attacks only the first series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the absolute assault of the military police less than one hour after the crash.
In this night, as she says, she was requested 11 times to tell the details of her magistrate a whole number of police, doctors and command officers.
She was found in her bed in her blood of her murderer.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge, and during this hearing she was asked after the sex that she had before her friend.
Six people said to be characterized in the name of the mumous murder, which was finally released.
"I remember the day when the judgment was read," says Lyman.
"I thought I would use the wheels, and I smile out of the court hall."
"He brought me to the psychiatric department and I remembered that when I came back, I said to my commander, "It wasn't his procedure. It was my procedure."
Lyman was requested to visit a military sychiater who finally diagnosed a personality disastrous and explained it for non-service.
In January 2010, she was unreasonable, so that no support was received.
If the complaint, which has submitted Lyman and the other clients, is pure speculation, says John Turley, Professor of Law Science at George Washington Law School.
However, he notes: "I think they should come forward."
What is between them and a sentence, this doctrine is criticized since it has been questioned for the first time.
I'm a criticy of the fees doctrin.
The military has a decade behind, because they do not have the same incentive and the same delay that brings up a detainee with themselves.
He adds: "The opportunities are against them, but it's important for them that they try it."
These things will only change when good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing does not follow their way, Burke, the applicant of the applicant, starts with hundreds of other customers for future cases.
"We're going to fight the military in this regard until it comes to reform", she says.
Or until we die, what always comes as first.
The walls have eyes: How Researchers look at Facebook
Before he became the new face of the legal extremism in Europe, Anders Berring Brevik was only one of many people who sent their anti-immigration reduction online.
On Monday, Breivik, who was intended to have started at an amok cycle in Norway in July, was killed by 77 people, his first public hearing before the court.
Although Breivik could have treated alone, he is not alone in the Cyberspace: he has passed a lot of time to his attack before his computer and has shocked with some of the millions of nationalists who support the legal extreme groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find her?
This is easy - you just have to login to Facebook.
"We have found that it was not hard to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the principal author of a recent report of the British idea manufacture DEMOS about the digital population in Europe.
Facebook's hiding personal data is so encyclopædiac, Bartlett says that the researchers simply need to use the advertising tool of the page to determine their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - as it is marketer for years.
Bartlett Team found a half million Fans right-to-left groups in Europe and then lived with adds, but instead of linking a new band or a new diet product, the Adds users requested a survey in which after their educational status, their attitude to violence and assessing their own future was asked.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to ask more than 10,000 members of 14 extremely rights parties in 11 European countries - without having to leave their office once.
"It's a right new research method," Bartlett says.
Some of the results are little surprising. Online supporters are mostly young, men and hungry about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising rotation, "they who combine their online activeism with an offline activeism are more sensitive, democratic and less violent than those who are sit behind their computer screens."
DEMOs work is only an example of how Facebook will become a new warm tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideal manufactures, medical researchers and policy researchers use the site to study everything, from health issues to society, such as "Likes", text news and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users who add a average of three contents per day, Facebook's "datasupernova" generates a research tree that increased nearly 800% of the scientific works on the name of this page in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that you can study people by this page that normally do not reach with his clipboard on the street.
"If you had previously tried to ask people of the British National party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to first inform the party and have never given them access," says Bartlett.
"Beside Facebook, you're going to go directly to them."
Others say that the page offers an opportunity to recognise and solve social health problems.
A current study by Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and its colleagues found that students who have discussed their full discussion on Facebook are more significant to drinking problems than students who are about this topic.
Moreno suggests that equal students, such as home advisers, monitor the page and help a student if they post too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos Ko-Actor and Chief of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle of Washington Post.
"We found a possibility to identify dangerous children that wouldn't be found otherwise."
Facebook also continues to accompany the data of his own population.
The data team of the page has created statistics about the relationship status and the Valentsday, election participation in the 2010 election and a national happiness index (which was used in the main line of information on which only has access to Facebook - Master of the digital freedom has long known that the page should make its large base of data available for others to research courses).
But the users of Facebook know that the page looks to them if they want it or not. To play with a friend that is removed from thousands of miles, the page will be allowed to deliver the personal data.
But what if the users of Facebook become part of a survey from which they don't ever know anything?
While researchers have strict directives as they gather offline their data, online is all allowed.
"I don't believe that many users have thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a socialist at London Knowledge Lab, to a study from 2006 where he studied the public pages of students on Facebook.
"What she's about, it's only about her and her friends."
Then there is still a question of methodology.
Even offline does not guarantee that a researcher is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the information are true in a user profile and contributions.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two very different things," says Selwyn.
That's why Selwyn thinks, despite his years, as technology researchers that a clipboard and a stift are still the best research tools that everyone can use.
"There is no replacement to go out into the real world and to speak to real people," he says.
"Social research must be careful for the social - and every amount of social life is still offline."
"Inhuman": Ander round Brevik appears for the first time before a public court
Anders Berring Breivik, the man who had established two amoklopees that were killed in Norway in this summer, described himself in his first appearances before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" fighter.
"I'm a military commander in the Norwegian rebellion movement and a norwegian temple leader," he said before a court hall with over 500 people.
"I urge the court, since you have received your mandate of organizations, support Hasssideology, and because it is supported by multiculturalism."
"I recognise the laws, but I don't acknowledge guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monolog, as "Breivik did not want to give the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform in which he can express his views."
For the same reason he refused Brevik who made a preceding speech the permission to apply to the members of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also stated that the police Breivik was in investigation for 12 further weeks, he had no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will be controlled accurately by all visits and the whole corespondency over eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and the families of the victims took part in the hearing.
Some came to hope to see Brevik in the eyes, others wanted to confirm that he was left behind the closure and the rigel.
Everyone took part in the goal that everything goes out of the way.
"I thought he works cold and inhuman," said a survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian sender of NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it's going to be a part after I saw the suspect and heard."
Breivik took a dark approach and a blue claw and worked in the whole hearing. He looked at journalists and survivors in the eyes when he treated the building and left the building again.
Despite the strange indication of Breiviks, he would be part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge came to the conclusion that he wasn't a physician and said that there was no evidence that he had complicated.
Some may seem that the attacks of 22 July seemed to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radikers.
But is this automatically facilitating the smiling and confusion that still feels a whole nation?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he didn't do it," said the family of a victim.
"It would be so easier if he did it."
7 Lections of the interview with the defeated Steve Jobs shown in a theatre this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5th, some compared him to Henry Ford and showed the technology as a great modern researcher.
But what Apple fans may find in the most recently discovery jobs interview, which has been discovered in this week special film proposals on the important markets, is how much this creative head-making and jobs have understood.
He certainly was a designer, a dream and himself called Hippie, but he was also an acribical organizationer who was able to build diagrams - a man who believed that many business leaders suffered of "a illness of thinking" "what is a very great idea of 90% of the work... [aber] there is a huge amount of handwork art between a wonderful idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the "Triumph of the Fachiotes" TV series on the breakdown of the computer, and he sat more than one hour with jobs in which they conducted one of the rare, explicit discussions.
At that time, as a 10 years ago, jobs were shocked from Apple. And he worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, and was pleased at the wide acceptance of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in fachidiotes, he said that the copies of the interview failed to deliver.
First after Job's death, a complete VHS copy was found in the garage of the director.
This easyly revised film material forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The lost interview", which comes to the Landmark theatre this midday and Thursday.
For someone who knows that he has an extensive interview, the jobs appears to be surprising in the review of its technological philosophy and business strategies.
And unbelievable.
In the course of the interview, there are four times more pauses between questions and answers - 10 to 15 seconds in which jobs clearly decline their thoughts and work for accuracy.
There are also moments in which Job's perfectionism comes to day when it seems to be indulgently reacting to Cringely's questions and appealing to the questions or side treatments of more importance.
Before the time of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, the Loserine Interview appears to be an uncommon interview when you evaluate the jobs, what other companies do correctly or wrongly and its own vision towards the future of the computer.
It's a thing to read posthume estimations of the career's jobs. But works here to see as the pleasant dreams that are on the slope to great quality is something very different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision how to be the things and should be.
Soon after he did this, he went out and did it.
A fast look at seven remarkable sequences of the lost interview:
How he learned to lead a company:
"When the whole years of business I always ask, "Why are you doing things?" And the answer you always receive is, "Oh, that's how simply it will be done."
Nobody knows why he's doing what he's doing.
I found that.
Jobs continues to rationalize the booking at Apple.
It was noted how expenditure was registered - mostly you started with "standard costs" which were covered by simply polluting and then adjusted to "excise" – developed a automaticized manufacture that ensured that business costs could be set up to the smallest.
How the Pope was born:
Jobs talks about the "Blue Box", which he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which you could get into the telephone society and talk on the other hand.
Over the device has already been written much, but job's enthusiasm when he describes the blue Box as an act of self-permission.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a switch phone, operating a call and then connecting to a different network, while it is as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things half a twenty-four times around the globus and when you broke into the phone, there was a minute later out in the phone, " said Jobs.
"We were young and we learned that we can build something to control the billions of dollars of infrastructure in the world."
We both did not know much, but we could build this little thing that could control a giant thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think it would give without them apple.
Jobs continued to talk about a glorious strike, the residence and he closed to calling through Blue Box in Vatican in the middle of the night and wanted to talk to the pope while they were so well able to observe Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic Heritage were called in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomates, the two of them had to leave before the pope himself came to the phone.
How he loved himself in the technology (and not prepared Bill Hewlett):
In the age of 12 years, when he searched for replacements to build a frequencies number, he searched for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone phone, Jobs received a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
"This had a remarkable impact on me. It was the only company I had seen in the age and formed my views about what was a company and how good it was treating his employees."
Later, one of the HP employees who visited the research laboratory of the company in Palo Alto, where he "the first desktop computer that was ever produced".
He was so big as a copper, had a small screen with a brunscher rohre, and I loved me in him.
I would write up with HP as adolescents to top clothes and to this machine and programs for them.
How to improve innovations:
Many times in the interview, jobs talk about how to find new products.
Soon in his career, when he built some plates, he was requested to build the whole computer.
He worked with a payment duration of only 30 days and had to take into consideration both the construction and the delivery of the prepared devices.
Later at Apple, he recalls the problems he had in the development of a computer music:
"I remembered the arguments... you shouted me that there would be five years [as to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I stood out, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later we had a mouse that we could build for $15. This was unbelievable.
About large enterprises:
For a long time before he left Apple again, Jobs saw the ways that so many industrial gymnastics went with their visions in stolpers and lost control over their shares.
"Do you work with IBM or Xerox, so do you make a better copy or printer, after and?"
They have the acentmonopol, so the company is not successful.
Sellers and marketing make it more successful, so that [as far as such people], which finally lead the companies and the product with which people are put out in decision-making.
The gene of product which has led to this monopolation will be destroyed by people who have no concept on good products, such as bad products, - it is necessary for handwork art.
This happened to Xerox.
Xerox could have had the whole computer industry.
You could have been ten times greater, if Microsoft could be in the 1990s...
You've shocked the overwhelming position.
About innovation as art format:
"There's all kind of handwork art between a wonderful idea and a wonderful product... when you develop this wonderful idea, it changes and grows."
You're learning much about your fenomena.
You have to make votes, certain things that you can't, but electronics, glass, robots, manufactures.
You have to note 5000 things, these concepts, and they're all assembling...
Finally, it goes out of the smell, it goes out of trying to get together with the best testimony that people have created, and then try to bring these things together with what they are doing.
Picasso said to copy good artists, creating great artists.
We're always unclean in the steel of great ideas.
It was part of what Macintosh made great, that the people who work there, musicer, tears, artists, zoologists, historics, who are eventually the best computer scientists of the world.
If it wasn't the computer industry, they would create wonderful things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas divorce with the enemy of health laws, as a court case
On the day on which the Supreme Court gathered after the doors closed to discuss the politically participating question, whether a threat to the health laws of President Obama was heard, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a dinner, which was discussed by the Canzlei, that the case was present.
The incident was held on Thursday, when all nine judges came to a discussion to consult the requests for test.
One of the cases to be treated was a complaint that had taken 26 States against the broad reform of healthcare, which was decided last year by the Congress, a law which was a word for the conservative aktivists throughout the United States.
The judges agreed to the hearing, and indeed, in March, a substantial discussion is expected to be a 5 1/2-style, which is likely to be cut to the 2012 Presidency campaign, which will be full of the date in which the court decision is announced.
The lawyer, who is before the court and claimed that the law is to strike, will probably be Paul Clement, a general lawyer under the government of George W. Bush.
Clements Canzlei, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the almost twenty companies supporting the annual dinner of the federalist society, a old group that was the defence of conservative law principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the economic associations, the National Federation of Independent Business that fights the law.
Another sponsor was the Pharmaciegigant Pfizer Inc., who is financially involved in the result of the process.
The dinner found a few hours after the court had consulted the case in a Washington hotel.
Service, among others, had Mitch McConnell, the Head of the Republic of Senate and a declared enemy of health reforms.
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges visit the events of the federal society for years.
And this does not abuse moral rules.
In fact, the judges are free of the Code of Communication which regulates the acts of the reciprocal federal guidelines.
If they do, they would probably fall under the principle 4c of the Code, which says: "A judge may be closer to the meetings of the law and other organizations where the judge cannot be a guest of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme nearness of Scalia and Thomas to two of the cancers related to the case and to a company with a massive financial interest in this to warn moral and government activists.
"This strict breach with Moral and the opposite to the codex punishes the complaints of some judges of lies, which the court holds the same rules that apply to all other federal leaders," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a civil law movement in the United States.
"The judges winned and advised during a beneficiary meeting with lawyers with disadvantaged procedures."
Their appearance and support of a cost action for this event are subject to any right to non-partiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas shown little attention to critics who say they would be easy to judicial matters with groups that lead to the agenda, such as federalist society.
And the wife of Thomas Ginni is a famous conservative activista.
However, the conservators pointed out that it was judge Elena Kagan, who had a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the general complainant under the Obama government when the first laws were in the court.
Their critics stripped Kagan to turn back from the hearing of the case because it was too much involved in the defence of the law to be unprecedented.
Kagan doesn't make up this.
Bueing records of $18 billion to country
Airline Emirate 50 two-year aircraft of the Boeing type 777 with a option on 20 other aircraft.
Moreover, Boeing sixs Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a business in value of more than 1 billion dollars.
It's really a rare message that a company receives a contract over 50 pieces of its products.
But it is a great business when the company of the Boeing Co manufacturer is and the list price for these 50 flights is totally in a record sum of $18 billion.
As well as Boeing’s contractor, the Middle East is a growing gold mining for future aircraft.
In a prognose published on Monday, the Chicagon company estimates that aircraft companies from the Middle East in the coming 20 years of 2.520 airlines need to be $450 billion.
Boeing announced its greatest task at the weekend of all times for commercial aircraft, measured by the value of the order: 50 2nd Bueing 777 Jets.
The department came from the aircraft Emirates from Dubai.
The aircraft has also announced that Boeing is 2011 on the Dubai aircraft, a option on the purchase of 20 other aircraft that allows to increase the total list price of $26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing Oman Air sixs Boeing 787-8, which is called Dreamliner, which enhance benzine consumption and the comfort of passengers.
The list price for six of these aircrafts is at more than 1 billion dollars.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," Neal Dihora, Börsen Fachman of Morningstar.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many aircraft companies in the Middle East are in the possession of oil producing countries.
So they have not only the money to pay the aircraft, but many more are an increase in the oil price, which usually damages the aircrafts, as this is one of their largest cost points, not so harmful as the country has a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend less than other airlines to shoot or move aircraft orders when the oil prices increased, Dihora said.
"He has a natural insurance," he said.
The order of Emirates confirms the management position of Boeing on the market for large space flights and helps to keep the Airbus Concourn SAS in shock, which accompanies the precaution with the A350.
Boeings wins on the aircraft will be announced four months after the Airbus, you would move to the introduction of the largest A350, which is directly competitive with the 777-300ER.
The entry was denied to win more confidence after the customers had requested a higher profit and scope.
The boeing shares were 1.3.5% to $67.94.
Sister of the Mexican President loses a apparent choice in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon states that the drug leaders supported Fausto Vallejo from the PRI in the rent towards the guest posts.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon seemed to have lost their requests for the office of the Governor of Muchoacan during the violent states.
According to the provisional results, Fausto Vallejo has winned the rent towards the guerrors in the Western State by the institutional party of Revolution.
"The invasion of organized crime during the whole election process and especially strict day is alarming, not only for Michoacan but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview a day after the election on Sunday.
"You threatened our candidates, our employees in the surveys ... you have put election boxes to build road blocks ... and employ people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled seven decades in Mexico until it lost the Presidency in 2000.
But they are trying to return and the victory in Michoacan is a important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have just shocked Claderon, which had still conducted in the investigations before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate of the conservative party Action National PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left Democratic Revolution Party PRD, who is still an official governance, came on place Drei, a serious strike for the divided and unpleasantly left leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the provisional results.
Vallejo, former citizensman of the capital city of Morelia, lifts contacts with drugs, and brings the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has been registered for a long time of drug cards that have specialized Marihuana, Heroin and Amphetamine.
It is the homeland of President Calderon and has chosen Michoacan to start a military offensive infringement against drugs in December 2006.
Violence still continues.
A PAN citizen was killed a week before the election during a election meeting for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates were extinct from the local elections.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, as the elections in Michoacan are now appearing.
The man, who will be represented in the resident of the President, is Enrique Pena Nieto, who was grateful to Vallejo from Washington, and said: "I think that this victory can see us courageously in the next year."
Asylum has help in the saving of the euro zone
The Asian Development Bank (Asian Development Bank, ADB) calls for India and China to support the salvation of the euro zone in its serious debt crisis to prevent a long-term disaster that will raise the growth of Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, Director of the ADB with Sit in Manila, said that the two of the rapidly growing economics in the world had to do "all in your power" to accelerate the recovery of the currency block, either by the international currency fund or by direct mutual agreements.
He warned the BRIC countries (Brace, Russia, India, China), the "freeness" of the difficulties in Europe, and said that the financial support of European guidelines and European resources was helped by Asia to avoid a long-term counterparty of the global economy.
"We all sit in the same boat."
"It is also every helpful who can help Europe from this crisis," he said the Financial Times in an interview at the edge of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected until a certain degree, but it's not immune."
"If China and India so can help, then with all resources."
The European Monetary Union has been a serious debt crisis in the past months.
In the past days, Italy’s interest costs were dangerous and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have fallen.
The emergent serious debt crisis in Europe is worried that global economy could slow in recession and lead to calls that leading weight countries should be together to support the euro zone.
Mr Nag said that every Asian support will be analyzed by the IWF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of Bonds of the EU Saving Fund, the European Financial Stabilisation Facility (EFSF) - offered the European partners to a greater negotiation force in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Trade Minister, said that "Inland will do everything that is in his power" to help the euro zone, since its economy now leads to the slight exports and the extracted foreign capital flows.
"Nobody wants to keep the euro zone instable and turbulent," he said.
"We have great challenges and we have to receive a high level of growth."
"It's no option, it's a task, because where otherwise we find work for millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India do not have an event to help the rich Europeans if they themselves face large economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, Professor at the United States Brown University, said that it would be politically very difficult to sell the 1,2 billion people in India to help Europe, from which more than 800 million of $2 or less than in the day.
"When they will find that Greece goes with 50 pensions and spend fellowships on the beach, then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, Director of the World Economic Forum, asked similar reasons why India's reservations should be used to keep the numerous and well-bearing employees in Greece in the public service, infringement in jobs, losses such as rail trains.
Mr Nag said that the crisis in the euro zone "significate domino effects" will be on the whole Asian.
The ADB's prognosis with an economic growth of 7.5 per cent in Asia for the years 2011, now threatens "the risk of absorption" because of the threatening risks from Europe.
He said that the deceased weak markets should create "Crise Plans" to protect themselves for a distance and a significant capital migration of their words.
Drug warnings from the Pentagon before possible inputs in defence
On Monday, Leon Panetta, Minister of Defence, warned that automatic budget disadvantages would uncertainly deficiencise national security, so he solved a financial reaction from the Pennsylvania to the war views in Afghanistan and the civil flight countries.
The Pentagon already considers the estimates of $450 billion in the course of the coming decade, but it is fearing that further costs of $600 billion or more will be necessary if the Congress cannot reach the expenditure.
"The impacts of these turbulents would be encouraging to the Ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to the Republican Senator John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a shipping of the Congress in the achievement of a budget agreement that will lead to such a statement would lead to 23% general cuts and a stop of numerous new projects.
"As a high shock, conducted in such an unexpected way, would make the majority of our ships and construction projects unlikely - you can't buy three neighbors of a ship or building - and other modernization efforts seriously damage", wrote Panetta to the senators.
"We would also be able to separate us unvoluntaryly from a majority of our civilian personnel and, as the reduction would be applied so quickly, we should allow civilians to achieve the goal with the safety of the border likelyness."
"This change would destroy the faith of those who receive our military and seriously damage our alarm preparation."
The struggles were finally meeting the struggles", said Panetta.
"If the war period in the fight against terrorism is not directly affected by the assignment, the severe invasion in the basic budget would have a positive impact on war threatening", warned Panetta.
"Personal settings were reduced, which would lead to delays in the settings and settings that support the war."
"The staff's holders would shorten, which leads to late payments to war timers and would be the legal and political support."
The two senators answered Panetta 10 days ago, and requested further details about the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the defence ministerial.
"The consequences of the Ministry of Defence would lead to a rapid decline of the United States as the leading military force of the world."
"We are closely against this dramatic act," the senators said in a common statement on Monday when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is an outcome with which we can't live, and it's certainly no one that you should smile us."
"The complaint is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and its entry should not be allowed."
Whether Panetta's letter and the new warnings of the senators will increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget, or strengthen the demands to remove the pentagon of turbulents, remains expected.
Panetta has increasedly expressed the possible burdens, although he had been able to collect experiences with the budget in the Congress and in the White House before he came to the spot of the Pennsylvania, and knows that he faces serious decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defence was a deep picture, which could be predicted - a military with a shoe but without nuclear.
"It's a ship without matrosen."
"It's a brigade without munitions."
"It's a air-weapon weapons without sufficiently busy pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, a army of the casters, buildings and bombs without sufficiently debt soldiers that are able to fill the mission," said Panetta in his opening conversation in Pentagon.
"It's a war which lacks it to moral and alarm preparation and which is not able to take it with potential enemies."
"You can actually be a foolish."
In an attachment to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta introduced new details as "significate operational risks: delays in crisis times, conflicts and disasters, serious limitations of our global use and inclusiveness, which leads to an unacceptable risk in future war operations".
And Panetta said that some of the greatest defence projects could fall to the victim, including those who were already tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list also belongs to the fighter F35 Joint Strip Fighter, a planned new bomb flight, the next generation of ballist U-boats, the new littoral Combat Ship and the new ground fighting vehicle, the army and the marine, to replace the Humvee.
If you stop the further development and test of F35, this would cover up to $80 billion in the next 10 years, but the preferenties say that it is an important step to rebuild, so that possible risks can be benefited from China and other enemy.
How Can You Lie?
A view of the current slaughter lines shows how intense and wide expansion and lies are in daily life.
The Presidency candidate of the Republican, Herman Cain, is concerned with the prosecution of sexual condemnation to be a number of women, and both sides are opposed to the lies.
The leadership of the Penn State is accused of my own, since you have retained reports, after which a pensioned footballtrain boy has been sexually misused.
Last week, a open microphone was acknowledged when the French president Nikolas Sarkozy was a lie against the American President Barack Obama, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Like destroying carriages and murdering countries.
The New York Congress Deputy and the Internet Exhibitionist Anthony Weidner became angry when he took up circles, which were very quickly reflected by unenvironmental evidence.
The previous Presidency candidate John Edwards is accused of the infringements in the campaign financed in relation to the discussion of an extraordinary business.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it is the media circle, which tried President Bill Clinton when he lied during his second office at the Oval Office on his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
History about sculptures in the school and college tests are widely spread.
There were incidents where teachers of their students provided the test responses to their own performance reviews.
Mentors who should teach the opposite, send a message that lies and smells are good.
How many explanations are we experienced?
Like studies, we lie each day between 10 and 200 times.
But many of these lies are as an emergency.
Another study shows that foreign one three times in the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Mention of lies or "looking lies" is one who is important to learn for each person, and that is both of personal and professional reasons.
With regard to a social game, such as Scharaden, where it is the goal to call you, the detachment of a series of knowledge is based on scientific data that have been collected during the last six decades of universities, which conducted wide research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physics.
A result of the research is that most old myths have been distracted over the lie.
Lies look at one in the eyes.
They're wearing, stealing, riding, and not always calling.
However, it is not possible to conclude that these lies are difficult to stop and get away.
A gentleman of lies can turn to the truth by learning something about the structure of the defence, the slightly face expressions, the question and the Timing.
I have been conducted for several years to investigate the scientific results of the comprehensive and steadily growing area of distortion, and it is clear that the distortion of an objection is a modern ability that is easy to learn and help us in our complex world, especially if the establishment or demands of persons or negotiations or administratives belong to their own professional responsibility.
Good lies are very good to evaluate others whose interest is to spend and to dominate their own emotions, and they feel intuitively how they are taken by others.
Thanks to the research, the extreme people are often lie than introverted people that men often "self-related" lies as women whose lies are less "a different orientation" - in general they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people are less often lie than unmarried persons (and the lie they tell are most "fair lies").
We also know that if a person has been deceived as a wicked one, others feel less guilty to lie this person.
How do you understand whether someone lies?
As first by observing the normal behavior of this person.
This is called "Baselining", the original position.
It provides a reference point to the later evaluation of changes.
Observe the situation, the laugh, the stimm quality of their trial person.
You should better know when someone normally trips with the foot, so that they do not accuse him to injustice when he trimps with the foot during a meeting.
Then take care of adverse addictions and adverse behaviors.
Consider these advertisements as alarm blowings, not as a evidence of distortion.
Those who are angry may be shocking if they try to remember their history. Maybe they show their feet in the direction of the door or spend in direction, change their position in a significant way or show a "speaking after the setting talk", this deep, relaxing switch and the change in the position when all hard issues are over.
The questions are often wrongly signaled that a seting discussion is about only to keep the view after the settings.
Besides, take care of the language of your trial person.
Scott Peterson's sponsor is famous when he used the past form when he said that his murdered wife is still alive and a national search for her.
Incredible people can also use a distance language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Ms. Lewinsky" or if you repeat a clever question in general.
The most frequently covered signs are subtil.
Some people use "qualifiing language," when they answer a clever question: "Now... to tell you the truth ... as long as it is known to me ... according to the best knowledge and conscience."
The answer is more accurate than guarding, often shocking the alarm shoes.
There is no power to discover lies, but you can learn abilities that are possible for distortion.
Thanks to these abilities, everyone can become more rare for the victims of entrepreneurs, both in private and professional life.
Restricted plan of oil pipeline is revised after danger by delayed US authorisation
A few days after the Obama government has threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline of Canada in the Golf of Mexico, which increased the workshops and swallowed the environmental protectioners at the same time, the Pipeline manufacturing company is trying to plan the project to return to normality.
TransCanada said on Monday night that you will be killed by the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the parliamental building of Nebraska.
Alex Parabax of TransCanada said that the company is still trusted, which is finally approved by the pipeline, even with another history.
In the past week, after an advertising of the Foreign Minister, a decision on federal approval for the project was made to be carried out until the new event was examined that the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala acquire, a great subwater service, was meide.
"This is a step forward," said the Republicn Lee Terry, a Republican of Nebraska, against Fox News.
The new environment review, which has been ordered by the Foreign Minister, may be made a decision up to 2013, after elections in the coming year, even if officials lie that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama explained in a written statement that the decision was a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and said to support it.
The 1700-mile Pipeline was connected to the Golf of Mexico.
She would pump 700,000 barrel oil per day from the Alberta province to the Raffineries in Texas.
The Pipeline should go through six States.
Environmental Protectors hate them, but they love the job markets, because they believe that Pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
However, the legislators, which are against the plan, derogate the laws to prevent a derogation from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala acquire, a main source of drinking water and drunkening.
The current study on the impact of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project had only a little influence on the environment, but the source of energy industry indicates that the main auditor of the Ministry has requested a separate area of the review procedure, which is focused on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist who was established by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was in 2008 by Hillary Clinton, was in an interest conflict.
The other is whether an undertaking employed to conduct the original study was an inadequate choice because it is connected to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused of being a little kid of fear
A New Yorker family states that the Disco Diva Patti LaBelle had got an accident in the lobby of her manhattan buildings that had so feared her little daughter that she had given himself fear.
The Tirade of the "Lady Marmalade" speaker of the 18 months old Genevieve Monk made such fear that she suffered from "fellowships of personality, sleeping" and "discreased fear for foreigners", said her family before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on November 10, last 10, when the employer Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, was a child farmer, and Genevieve wanted to attack a family flight.
While Kevin Monk bought the car, Roseanna Monk went with the bag and Genevieve on the arm in the lobby building at the Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stood near the door and stopped her daughter for a moment.
"Another one appeared behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her back to the arm," she said.
LaBelle encouraged the pregnant woman to smile.
"He said in a aggressive sound, "You should not leave your daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I said to her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She was angry and started to shoot - she used the F word and the A word and became very...
She had a glass water in the hand and began to smell water from the flat on me.
She said Genevieve would have become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "See what you've done with my daughter," the mother of the child said.
LaBelle turned up on the mother that still took Genevieve on the arm, and had to stop with their guiding and to be taken to a waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The baby shouted so much that it had to be delivered, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family asked to apologize, but no answer was received.
The lawyer and representative did not respond to calls for an opinion.
The complaint is based on a not closely specific damage, but the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis, said that he does not take account of the honour and the family plan, the money they get, the child cancer aid.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take the responsibility for her behavior," said Davids.
"This kind of behaviour is absolutely inacceptable, especially if there is a child farmer towards the day that takes 18 months old baby on the arm."
Climate climate clusters deteriorate the economy
In the first year, in Mario López Valdez at the government, the unemployment and black work in Sinaloa increased while foreign investments returned and the economy was stable.
It is the first year in Mario López Valdez, who is called himself as the initiative of the shift, and great hopes regarding the economic growth, is in the government. However, because of the climate challenges, it is not the speech of growth, but on the contrary, the most important economic indicators deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February have not only caused losses in millions of agricultural, but also the growth of the state economy in closely limited borders, and in the first fourteenth year, the economic activity was 3,6 per cent in mainly 31.16 per cent of the historical decline of agricultural development.
According to a report issued by the Council of Mexico for Rural Sustentable (c. Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development) on the impact of the Frost, 582.000 hectares of agricultural use of lands, which were completely destroyed by 78.03% and the remaining 21.07% were partly destroyed.
In the first 40th year, the National Institute of Statistics y Geography observed a rapid increase in the unemployment rate, since from January to March 55 053 inhabited Sinaloas had no employment, which corresponds to 4,53% of the enterprises. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate increased by 5,28% and from July to 6,19% of which 74,000 unemployed in Sinaloa.
Increased liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa in the year is back to several factors. The Economist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dekan of the University of Autonome Economic and Social Sciences, comments on the policy of public institutions indirectly explains the growing unemployment.
"What we now observe is an increase in the unemployment that has to be done with several factors, among others with liquidity losses on the market by means of the legislation which has been adopted to combat the currency in the Congress, because for those who are banned for dollars, it is not easy to let them work to invest or use them for something else," he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that the growing unemployment also involves a demographic factor.
"The number of people who have left the country to search for jobs in the foreign country, especially in the United States, has been left, and this is to return to the leading problems and, on the other hand, because there is difficult to find work. These people remain here and are looking for the work that allows to increase unemployment," he said.
Black work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious when you take into account the high part of black work, which includes NNGI 60.38% of the employees working in the country without paying their social insurance boxes.
Labour unemployment and black work are the lowest wages in Mexico, in accordance with the statistics of the Instituto Mexicono del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Insurance Statute) and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Prevision (Regation for Labour and Social Care in Mexico).
The average month income of workers in Sinaloa was until September 5352 Pesos, which is much less than the average public average of 7375 pesos.
Decline of ADI
In addition to the reduction of economic activity and the growing unemployment, in 2011, the highest decline of foreign direct investment (ADI) in the last ten years is marked. According to the Secretaria de Economy (State Economy Authority) ADI from January to June 630 597, which was 87.74 per cent compared to the $5.143.312 in the same period.
The Government Economic Development Secretariat (Economic Development Authority) also represents a total investment of 17 280 000 Peso in 2011, which is before all enterprises from the Territory Sector.
Debts
In view of the economic crisis, the country government requested in July a credit at the National Congress of 3,000 000 Peso, which should be invested in the reactivation of the economy in infrastructure projects in the 18 communities.
Reactions
For the representatives of the entrepreneurship, Mario López's first government invalidity was obvious.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the Câmara National de la Industry de la Transformation (National Chamber of the Training Industry in Mexico) conveyed in 2011 that no effort was made to harmonize the views of the different sectors, including the country government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very urgent in this year. It must be hard to re-start the lost terrain in this year, and 2012 we need to do a double effort. The efforts of all and in particular the progress of the well-organized government team are not sufficiently adjusted to each other," he said.
Late economic development
Loredo López expressed that events, as the Frost started the country's economic development and delay.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, e.g. of the Frost. One of the most important effects is a short economy that is not sufficiently moved to make a economic dynamic that could produce an admissible flow of processes, products and services, so we will end the year far beyond our expectations," he said.
Redefinition of vocational training
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, Chairman of the Confederation Patronal de la Republic of Mexico (English Group of Mexico) in Sinaloa, said that the State should take part in more dynamic production activities.
"In general, we have observed that it was worked. We believe it is necessary to develop a long-term programme for re-determining economic profession and lines of the country, because it is important to activate all material and human resources Sinaloas," he said.
There's a lot to do
The Chairman of Coparmex stressed how important it is to develop a future perspective that led to the efforts of the government in better bags.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas, but economic development has been advanced, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he explained.
He stressed that the current state power has made progress in the government.
"These are areas for which you can say that the government has been more treated, and what I can say is that it was worked and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work before her," he said.
arrest by 8 kg Marihuana
For five years of prison and 100 days, a inhabitants of Navolato was sentenced because of the ownership of eight kilos of Marihuana.
The State Authority of the Republic announced that the drug-training manager was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was sentenced for a crime against public health, here the certain possession of Marihuana.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I Act, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by Mexican military in the supervision of the Cypriano Valdez Street against the guard post No. 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug kitchen was in a white car where he stood a black stone in a box in the car and on the car rental, a small rucksack in which the military soldiers found eight kilos and 23 grams of Marihuana.
For this reason, the enquiry product was transmitted to the judge of the district and the punishment remains in the full position.
Debts for construction work
The social constructions for migrants in the programs Habitat, Rescate de Spacios Públicas and 3x1 are risking to not be completed because of missing resources or only with a large delay, Miguel Angel López Miranda said.
The head of the city's Social Development Authority explained that, although the construction programmes have been continued, they are now in danger, since the Government has not paid the resources that the three programmes have exceeded 11 million weights.
He said that the overall investment in these three programmes was almost 50 million Peso, from which 25% flee to the State. To now only the Federation and the Community had been taxed on the construction funds, as it expected that the construction end was delayed.
"12 million they have to be taxed, and although the year ended, they didn't give us a fifth to us, and that, although they had to pay us a part in July," he said. "To be not too late, we have started with the construction work, and they've already been advanced, but we need the money."
He hoped that under the government of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State had not complied with its obligations, as the community had to take up a credit of seven million at the beginning of that government.
"It was so that in the last legislative period, because the State had not sufficient economic resources, and the programmes continued, and we had to provide the resources that the State had not made to participate in these programmes in this year."
Even if the State authorities were obligation to pay these resources, he commented that the Minister for Administration and Finance was requested to accelerate administrative work and pay as soon as possible.
"After 12 million, they have to be taxed, and although the year ends, they didn't give us a feast."
The Court authorises the transition to the digital television in Mexico for 2015
The conversion of similar to digital signals belongs to the most important changes in the last years of the world.
The Supreme Court of Justice of Mexico (SCJN) showed that the Constitution records presented by Senate and the House of Deputy against the Presidency must be introduced and that the switch of similar signs to digital signals of 2021 to 2015 should be put back, because of the lack of eight votes required for enforcement of law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court of Justice, Juan Silva Meza, was the view that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed its responsibilities when he was dealt with the legislation with the details on the switch of the earthquake digital vision.
This Decision was rejected by the Constitutional Strategy called by the Senate, as it did not receive the necessary majority of eight votes in order to decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality, and thus the law remains in force.
In the project for the composition developed by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed to explain the Constitution Dedekre for Constitution, as for which the radio and the television on regulations the Federal Commission of Telecommunications (Coffee) (Federal Commission for Telecommunication in Mexico) is responsible for which the legislative department would oppose the Hierarchic principles and the preservation of laws.
For the project only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero itself.
With this argument, both the Senator and the Deputy Chamber of Constitution claims against the Deputy of Legislative Discrimination, and the Minister Sánchez Cordero did not refer to the legislative decree and put all the activities to establish digital transmission.
The Council also rejected the complaint submitted by the Deputy Chamber without taking place in the debate on the project, which also was responsible by Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In its contribution, the President expressed that it was not agreed with the arguments of the project, but in the sense that the country government could not regulate the measures to take the public administration in general provisions.
"I also don't believe that if you would do this, it would affect the independence of the regulatory body", she also recalled that the planning of strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunication sector, is responsible for constitutional reasons for the central government, because it leads to state affairs.
The replacement of similar signals by digital is one of the most important changes that have occurred throughout the world in recent years, and it makes better use of the radio spectrum, a increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The shift of the conversion, she said, was an impact of the use of digitalization, which is a decision in public interest, not only in technical perspectives, "withstanding economic, social, political and security technological aspects".
These matters, stressed, "If the operation of the entire system, they included a group of features in which the Constitution was in the hands of the central government."
It remembered that many world countries had already done digital conversion, although they had high-specificized institutions.
It would not be concluded that the government could enter into the competences of the Congress, because the laws adopted by the legislative would be maintained by the government," firmed.
The possibility of counting the stims in Michoacán is taken into consideration
According to the details of PREP, the difference between the first and the second place in the election of the Governor is nearly 27%, where 879 votes from total 6074 have not yet been paid.
The possibility of the individual explanation of the smimulet is a reality in the elections in Michoacán in this year, as in accordance with the data issued by the program de resultos Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between the first and second place of the gubernamental elections is about 27%, while 879 votes of total 6074 have not yet been calculated.
In this sense, the President of the General Council of the Institute Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Angeles Llanderal Zaragoza, reminded the election office of a number of arrangements on the harmonization of local rules with the Government reforms in election matters once last November.
It should be remembered that Michoacán, nor his political Constitution, nor his election law, nor his law on election justice had adapted to the reforms adopted by the Congress, so that they were not in force at this election round. The Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided its publication in the State indicator within the deadlines set out with the argument to have no admissibility.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional complaints submitted by the local legislative and judged the vote of the advocate of the Constitutional Reforms as "invalid and legally", since this does not have the right to "decise or adjust a veto".
In an interview, María de los Angeles Llanderal declared the possibility of individual votes that thanks to the adoption of Directives by the General Council of IEM, the local election authority could be partly or completely counted.
Thus, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more of the electoral packages may not be agreed in the protocols; the vote numbering and calculation protocol does not exist or is not in possession of the Chairman of the Electoral Committee or there are clear errors or amendments in the Protocols.
Furthermore, the total explanation of the entirely completed election appearances may be performed if there is a distinction between the smooth winner and the one who is on the second place, which is equal or less than a percentage, prescribed at the beginning of the meeting, is a express request by the Chairman of Coalition, which is the second candidate.
The vote can also be achieved in its entirety when a express request from a representative of the party whose second candidate has become a second person is excluded. In this case, the election package was issued by a partial payment would be excluded.
It is estimated that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation, where, according to PREP, the difference between the first and the second place is almost 0,16%, although the votes of 129 are not yet calculated by a total of 923 election protocols.

In the mid-week education of the new Italian government
The designed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, is tomorrow with the President of Italy to propose the new government that has led to the crisis that Italy has led to the edge of the economic adjustment.
The designed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, is tomorrow with the President of Italy to propose the new government that has led to the crisis that Italy has led to the edge of the economic adjustment.
A message from the presidency was announced that the Monti called on Sunday would meet with the President of the State, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm government training on Sunday.
It will be said that it will be a majority of a cabinet collected from technokrates, although it is not clear, when the new Minister will be held by his office.
Monti said he would present the results of the discussion with the political parties on government training.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to be completed with these difficult times," said the former Commissioner of the EU to journalists.
Monti did not expressly confirm the government training, but its comments show that the obstacles were overwhelmed.
The "Rahmen is now well shocked", he added.
Monti has made it in less than three days to form a government, which is much less time than normal, but it fights Italy against a political and financial crisis that has led to the costs of debts in an uncertain amount.
The new government, conducted by the former Commissioner Monti, must adopt a strong sphere package requested by the European politicians to re-established confidence in Italy.
The pressure on oil, which is on Monti, still increased by the deteriorate market position, due to which the Italian state citizens had been stolen over 10 years with 7 per cent of interests, which corresponds to the position that Greece and Ireland had to be obliged to invite the European savings scheme.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian Industry Association Conf industry, shared the press after a meeting with Monti with: "We said we would support this government according to all powers."
We believe that this government is the last opportunity that Italy comes out of this emergency situation.
The success events of Montis were significantly increased by the support of the PDL Party of Silvio Berlusconi, which had to be taken on Saturday after the crisis.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are intended to make good results", said Angelino Alfano, secretariat of the Mediterranean.
The support of the PDL, the largest party of Italy, is essential, since many of its members have been expressed against a majority of the technological government that is now represented by the Monte.
Support by Parliament
The new Government of Monti needs a strong parliamentary support for the implementation of the probably unpleasant speech measures.
Reverse against its efforts or the restraints of reform could again affect a deterioration of the financial markets.
The Italian foreign banks' association indicates that a false Montis is a catastrophic, also pressing.
Monti began on Monday with his debates with political parties, workshops and entrepreneurs and youth organizations.
The service provider shall be closed.
Monti was appointed this Sunday of Napolitano, which has established a extremely rapid government exchange in Gang as a response to the crisis.
After recent investigations against the end of the last week, as it was known that Berlusconi would return, the insecurity of the success of the new Minister has been reached the costs of the Italian states again critical borders.
An Italian savings with a State debt of EUR 1.8 billion would be too much for the current EU saving scheme.
Monti said that his government should continue to the next elections that are expected to be held in 2013, despite the predicts that the politicians will be given to him only time for the implementation of the reforms instead of providing elections.
Monti expressed that he would like to take the politicians in his kitchen, but the major parties found that this should only exist from technicians, a reference to their concerns in view of the procedure laid down by the press of the financial markets.
Political sources point out that mutual infidelity and unity between parties make complicated the participation of persons from political life.
Spain has more game affairs than the Ticos
From the 22 players from Spain, ten more than 50 international games have been on the buckle.
From pages Costa Rica has only one of the 22 calling 50 games behind.
A rich difference for Costa Rica, when the 22 for the friendship game today at 15.05 at the National Station of San José, are compared with both countries.
While the World and Europe Meister, the number one at the month's FIFA, can look back to a considerable number of selection games of Classe A, the three colorful manity only has over the defence players Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
This number reached him on the last Friday with the game against Panama (0-2) in the Roman Fernández.
The Spanish players playing in Liga de las Estellas (Starliga) and the influentious clubs of the Premier League of England each year have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (Liga and Cup masterships) and high-ranging Europeancups such as Champions League.
Additionally, experiences with the Spanish Fury in complex divorce games at Eurocup and football environmentality.
However, Tico Fitzballers have little international engagements within the Concacaf, which is fully below the FIFA ring list.
We will see how the Spanish Mania stands on their last registers: Den Torwart Iker Casinos, who reached the last Saturday against England (One 0-1 in London) with 126 foreign games a balance with the former Torwart Andoni Zubscherreta.
Casillas will today play against the three colors and Spain's new record of 127 foreign games.
Xavi Hernández, a football club player of Barcelona, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi last week even received a recognition from the EUFA, together with others of the magic number 100: the quoted sugar network with 126 and the Mediterranean of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The number of hundreds also closes Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He follows Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the Ticos sides and close to Michael Umana, the left wall Júnior Díaz are with 48 games and the storr Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there only five up to 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The littleest games.
More than 30 games show in the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazola (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31) on.
From pages of the nationality come on less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myry with 23.
The rest is not closer to the 20th Great.
While Aftero Moreal has only four games and Jord Alba two, signed in Costa Rica Victor Bolivar only one and Oilman Vargas and Edder Nelson had not yet a debtor.
The shooting tours of Spain is David Villa with 50 parts, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz shot the majority of the towers, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The Pentett entered Costa Rica in his tour to celebrate his 20-year-old existence.
"To play in Costa Rica is a dream that is realized."
In the exclusive conversation with Viva, the Basist Jeff Ament von Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give it the next Sunday at the National Station, one of its best concerts.
More than 20 years were expected, but the band assures them a dream when they play in Costa Rica.
The insurance of the Basist and Constitutor of the group, Jeff Ament, gave the Viva last week from Brazil from an exclusive interview.
The band is located in the South America part of its tour to celebrate their twenty-year-old existence and on Sunday 20, they make their only stop in Central America.
To this day, they started at 19.30 a.m. in the National Station together with the The X band from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You read a outcome from the conversation to find its complete post in the online output of La Nation.
For your coarcan fans, a dream comes when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what this means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that also realizes for us.
This is just the second time that we play in South and Mediterranean, and it has been great until now.
I've been just once for a vacation in Costa Rica. It's a beautiful country that we're going to stay there for a few days.
For us, it's funny to bring our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are completely given. They experience the day before the concert.
What do you say your most excited fans?
Thank you for staying on our side all these years.
We used almost 21 years until we came to Costa Rica.
Some people even believe that your concert will become the biggest show of the year.
Don't it take a little pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we have added in the last 21 years were found in the last two weeks.
We have played a few Rises shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that those who have done us for this concert in Costa Rica.
Indeed, we've got fun to play there.
We love this country, we're pleased to surveilla and are deceased from the dschungel. For that reason, Costa Rica belongs to the best countries of the world.
How did you know Costa Rica and his waves to surfen?
Many of our friends are Surfer and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo where the waves are simply unpredictable.
My friends are always going to surf to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. With Mexico, we have learned about people who love the surfing.
With a view to the tour you offered a lot of songs.
What plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there, we haven't putting any borders.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fan a good and multiple repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I believe that's partly because we have nine plates and can play more than 120 songs. Everyone likes another song, so that the decision we play each other is not easy.
If we haven't played two or three songs in the repertoire, we can get our concentration better and they surprise us because they call us the reasons to remember why these songs have fallen in us. On the other hand, they could be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I believe, so also for the public.
With this tour you celebrate your 20-year-old history.
If you look back, are you hard to believe your success?
Yeah, totally.
First, I believe that no one has imagined us to play once in a great rockband, and that's also over 20 years. It's like a dream.
We also put on these blessings and find it great, even now to make music together.
We like and are encouraged to bring music.
We have a luck to walk to the places of the world that we always wanted to visit.
The things couldn't be better.
What does it mean to have active participation in the birthday of the gring?
It has always been a honor to belong to this group of big bands.
We are well enjoyed with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and inhabited when a movement from a group of friends comes from.
A band is out of a city, but it's already uncommon when five or ten groups come from the same city simultaneously.
We are proud of it and we feel honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we're still playing together.
In the last year, we were on a festival with Alice in Chains and Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on her tour. We are still happy to be with them all and it is honored to be part of this deceased Seattle sound.
It's also very uncommon that a band as your band has remained so long with the same musicians.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) had been with us 13 years ago. It's just a lot more time than many bands.
First, I believe that we all are happy to be in life and also to care for each other.
We are all close friends, because they have opened musical ways that each individual gives the freedom to experimentate.
One trusts the other and the music, it couldn't be better for us.
Your relationship with spirit has not always been easy. On the other hand, you could always do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we have grown has made it easier to find a balance.
We make sure not to be too often on Tournee, because it's too easy to lose this game with rich people who love your music.
As long as you think that people have come because of the music, you remember that you've got to take care of the music and what they've called in life, without saving to be a famous rock star, that never interested us.
What memories do you have to your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we've written very good songs and at first it was great.
We were a band that never had issued a plate until the death of Andy (Androw Woods) for three years.
We were smiling about having been used as long as. We are still well with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who built the band with us. When I heard a song or see photos, I think what was for an unbelieving man Andy and how he brought me to laugh. It was always a joy to go to work together, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person, and we're missing him.
The domestic band Las Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Do you think you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and then the band asked for opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups, and this band was pleasant to us. So we're going to see what Las Robertas can live. This will be sweet.
Why do you always change the text of Yellow Ledbetter when you live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I don't know.
He sing him, and I think he sing the first thing to him.
From whom you have been influenced as a basist?
From so many+
For the first ones I got, they belong to Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
It's so many that I could talk all the midday about the basists that I got.
How did Pearl Jam have been able to keep the gangs in life, although it's no longer a modern appearance?
I think we all do not feel very linked to the word Grunge.
If I think about it, I'm going to get the bands that I mentioned before, for example, Mudhoney, Soundgard, Nirvana and all the other who come up at the same time. If they are still important today, I'll find it great because it's good to hear this music and make bands like Mudhoney now better music than ever before.
At first her music was dark, now she's more positive.
Why?
This is interesting because I think there are some songs on the new album that can be easier, but there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe, which are covered as a very dark song, although they have some positive.
To the two, the tears came to me when I heard like Ed she played, and it's very dark.
I believe if you're older and something traumatic happens in your life, for example, if you lose a family members or a friend - you're going to affect your arts creatures and your music and these two songs clearly for me.
But I am also thinking that you can be a happy man and even do dark music.

The former President Alberto Fujimori was invited to a public hospital to investigate the loss of the muscle, informed his home doctor on Tuesday.

Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
Official regulations, given by the Uruguayn President José Mujica, which consists of several ministers and employees, starts on Tuesday, to extend the trade between two countries and address political issues in the region
Mujica is in the next midday with his mexican official Felipe Calderón, who will be in detail the Uruguayn President's highlighting point of its explaned terminal plans with politicians, business students and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayrs living in Mexico.
The discussion of both Presidents in the city of Guadalajara is "approximately for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries", announced the President of the South America country on his website.
According to local media, Mujica searched for the support of Calderón for the interference with France when the French government chief Nicolas Sarkozy was placed on the G20's meeting in the French city Cannes the South American country on a list of tax paradise.
In his discours, Sarkozy threatened to exclude the countries still as tax paradise from the international community, which was rejected by Uruguay and asked for his posters in the European country.
The President of the G20, a group consists of the most powerful weight and industrial countries in the world since November. Since January this year, an agreement on exchange of tax information on the prevention of double event with the South America country.
In recent years, the Uruguay Government has tried to accelerate the concretization of agreements on exchange of tax information to strike out the "green list" of the OECD organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which have not introduced all international standards for cooperation in fiscal matters.
A free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries since 2004.
The shooting installation includes the third size of "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been struggling for the saving of Princess Peach from the clauses of the bad bowzer for 25 years, but until now he never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the love of the girl in Stereo Technology.
The game that this month comes to the load themes around the world has been assembled from the beginning to the properties of the tragable console named 3DS, which can be played without a special bridge threedimensional.
"Marrio is the figure that must say how the stereoskopy works without brille", firmed Omar Alvarez, responsible for the specialized press in Spain in the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez explained, "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game of Nintendo, which has been developed from the beginning to this console" because until now they were successful articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" adjustments already existing.
The speaker of Nintendo stressed that, although it's three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D country" is a "exciting" video game that allows a fast, flexible game.
Alvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" two games were entered in one: the first part is "speak," to start the less shipped users.
Then the experts can turn to the different game levels that are always more difficult, a "wide round".
Furthermore, users may, in real time, choose between a "agressive D" or one that is only the depth of the action. In order to overcome obstacles, without being victims of the "optical effects", however, must always be played threedimensional.
This Super Marios flight in the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a tragable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo declines the fans of the Saga and repeats the success reception of the last expenditure: The shooting installer must overcome with dangerous platforms to free the princess Peach.
However, the player is on news when movements, environments, clothes and enemies, and a "speakable" Luigi.
Colom offices for the extradition of Porillos to the United States
The President of Guatemala, Alvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday, that he would allow the extradition of the former Governors Alfonso Portillo to respond to the conspiration of $70 million in the United States.
Thus the process ends on the request of the United States to extract Porillo so that it can be sent before it.
In a press conference, Colombia confirmed its decision based on the independence of the Judiciary and the Government, taking into account that a final court had already sent the extradition.
He pointed out that during his Government he did not mine himself in court decisions, and that all the contracts that he has been informed have been made.
Besides Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marocchin will be extracted for murder and serious body injury, Edgar Esterada Morales and Victor Esterada Paredes, both for drug traffic.
The Columbia's action is a government act which follows when all legal and constitutional institutions are exempted to condemn the former Presidency (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Porillo must be delivered when its position is declared in Guatemala and guaranteed its human rights.
Portillo was released for the submission of 120 million Quetzals in the Ministry of Defence during his period of government, which was predicted by the delivery, but the Minister residued the case in the new case.
Trinijove helped 6000 young people from the social exclusion
The organization was called to avoid the marginalization of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of life of the social aid organization Trinijove have resulted in important results: In this fourty-year years, 6000 young people have been supported by the social exclusion to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, hundreds of jobs created for this social group are placed.
Last year, at an event in the former work buildings of Fabra i Coats, more than 300 people participated in the year.
Trinijove was called to help young people with low education, without work, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginality in 1986.
At the strict celebration in Sant Andreu, numerous responsibilities of institutions and institutions who have cooperated with the Agreement in these 25 years.
The participation of political representatives in various directions to the election warming was the inpartiality of the work done by Trinijove.
In addition to the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonome Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas and his preacher Jord Pujol took part in the festivals of the former Socialist Education Minister Ernest Maragall and the former citizensman and currently left-green townrat Ricard Goma.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats also visited the current Catalogue Minister for Sociales and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of the Social Work of Spain La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
But he stressed that Trinijove was called in very difficult times and that today's times are not less complicated, but he added that the work done until now "is a good basis".
For the Presidents of the Generalitate, Trinijove is an example that is aware of fighting against difficult circumstances and has hope in difficult times.
"The economic crisis is for the agreement and work he does, nothing new," he explained.
The placed house, in which the Riesen party was registered, was empty
The householders had placed 11 of 13 apartments in the building at the street Balmes No 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve householders left the building last afternoon without resistance.
Everything emphasizes that the alpine rooms of the neighbors of the house No 51 have found a end on the street Balmes.
Twelve people left on midday, volunteerly the building that they had maintained illegally and organized great festivals that had carried out neighborhood to destruction.
After the space, the door close was changed to avoid similar situation.
"The access will be controlled from now," the house manager confirmed.
The householders, who had placed 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took the whole electrical facilities and part of the water supply. In addition, they were cutting the walls and left all kinds of milk, especially doses with alcoholic drinks.
In the three lower stages, huge partys were celebrated until two days, and the mixers were going to disappear.
Besides the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also damaged it.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, declared Europe Press that her business had been up to 80% since the beginning of the household.
Discothek's owners pointed out that the householders made their unlawful competition because they sold the drinks to three euros, while they cost 10 euros in the disk.
Furthermore, the owner of the free-time local was shown by the neighbors because of the dishes of peace, while, according to their statement of the clouds, the visitors of the disk was not cut by, but by the householders, and in particular by the guests of the festivals that were organized there, and the neighbouring neighbors were always more and longer in the past weeks.
The responsibilities of the discothek stated that the appropriation was so large that they agreed with the owner of the building, not to pay for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana also confirmed that in the past weeks they received more complaints from the neighbors.
The President of the PP (Partido Popular - Volks partyi) in the city Council of Barcelona, Alberto Fernández Díaz, requested the building immediately swiftly and the problems of the civilian community and the outcome of the city garden in the Griff.
He explained that before the summer the building was only a eye of the building, but in the last months the householders were predicted in all the stages of the building and almost all the apartments were predicted.
In that sense, he added that "this is necessary to put the end of the imprisonment and to interfere against the assorted acts in the building."
Yesterday, a new building in the city garden Nou Barris was buried by the Catalonia police.
The police approached the Montral Street No. 35 after receiving a call of a neighbor who had observed how four people wanted to enter the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
The architectures are agreed with the strikes on the honourary with the description.
The 16th Tower is opening the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the middle of the 1980s, as a point of the lost Corporation Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its resignation on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona City.
He was even compared in numbers with the Central Park of New York.
In 1987 the park was back to the top level of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia belongs to the few not extended to the north-South direction, but to the top (gears) and below (Meer).
The design Collserolas as natural park plays with this idea.
As an example, the Central Park had no longer served, but Yellowstone with wild sweats in the role of the Yogibar.
So far, when the city was in September a rise booking, consisting of 16 competitions, for more accessors to Collserola.
Unfortunately, a door refers to the concept of a park.
Anyway, it's like, or someone's planning to put the doors on the country.
The question is taken by itself: Collserola, Park or Berg?
The description is not only from organizational view, but also in terms of reflection on the city, the conversation in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a recursive theme which can recur on the two members of this old box, which are covered.
And this is precisely the substance for one of the rare agreements between what three architects from Barcelona think about, and some university professors that have tried on the project.
Michael Roldán, Daniel Model and Marta Bayona: The description is appropriate.
For Roldán "it's necessary," after attacking the coasts about the "Front on the mountain" as far as the discours of Ildefons Cerda, which has not been exhausted over the green clouds.
"It should come from the principle that Barcelona's largest park is.
Among other things, because he's good.
Collserola is more complex, the architecture, for which the title "Tore of Collserola" is a "lexical case" in itself: it should not be "represented as adjustments to a park, but as a restriction of areas where to be treated".
Model, such as Roldán and Bayona with urban development experience, considers the proposal as a "intelligent challenge", which "also dangers".
The risks resulting from the "insecurity that brings up a public space today" after the experiences from the 1980s, which had their "skins" in the field of the Forum.
The first fear is the own limitation to what can be built.
"All things to limit always means to determine the next step," to overcome it, i.e....
"We need to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current [as part of the General Metropolitano Plan (PGM)] can lead to a real disaster."
Model, who stands closer to the question, means simplifying the page of Collserola, which is in direction of Vallesana, "we can be understood as a park, which is not in the direction of Barcelona", or because of pure topographic reasons.
Model recalls that there is already a study of the patronat de Collserola that should not "shoot on the board", although it was grateful to the administration of the city that she gave his body the opportunity to act on this project "in the first moment".
He also notes that near the mountain is the city of the letter that allows it to participate in the discussion, although he expresses his "certainness" if this technical profile is a multidisciplinary team called in life ("as the right," he says, "We should be a tool".
Bayona states that the answer to the question in the subscription of this article is complicated, as a global view of Collserola was missing: "There were 16 competitions in the currency average," he says, "to the axes of the mountain sea, but there is no length perspective that the area considers in its entirety."
This has resulted at least in the case of it to participate in the 16 competitions.
On the other hand, the program and definition of a project for a port would be collected with the architecture of the gate.
His view of the city should indeed ensure that the strikes are equipped directly over the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length, which depends on a decreased transition between the city and the green zones.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrazábal, who is free
After 72 days Sweden, the volunteer of the Casino Red freed the brother of the Citizensman of Monterrey from the process which will lead to him because of a massive pressure.
After 72 days of prison, Manuel Jonas Larrazábal will be released, after the author of the Casino Red forgive him before the second penalty of the district which led to the process against the brother of Monterrey's civilian master because of pressure.
After the attack on the casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, owner of the Casino Red, published a number of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás is able to see him to pay a amount of money so that the city management authorizes the secret operation of the reward house.
After the punishment, the State Authority opened a criminal procedure against the brother of the panistmanman who was arrested on 2 September for 30 days.
After four hours with the official of the Public Ministerium 3 in Delitos Periferial, he was put to the Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Antiguo capital Barrio de la capital.
There he remained 49 days after a second prison order, after the officers of the Public Minister had rejected the crimes because of the arrest and organized crimes.
On October 19, he was transferred to Caderyta's arrest because he probably had shocked the owner of the Casino Red with a half million pesos, but only a few hours in the Mediterranean Security Trade, as murder threats were against him.
The authorities authorized him to participate in the court proceedings as an insurance of the city prison of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, the secretariat of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, stated that there was sufficient evidence for the investigation of almost two months to speak of Jonas for payment of 1.5 million Peso to the representatives of the Weather House, to open this opposite.
This Monday, the author of Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gómez, the judge José Luis Pecina, who was sentenced to the brother of the Citizens, was invited to take the punishment in the next hour.
During the judiciary, Ramiro Arias asked the officer of the Court of Justice, García Gómez, whether he had dismissed the damages and whom the owner of the committee had expressed his forgiveness, but the lawyer returned the name.
According to the case 197/2011, Jonas Larrazábal is free to speak, and there is no injustice against the process, and no punishment is required.
After listening to the author of the house against 15.50 a.m. Larrazabal Bretton was immediately set on free foot.
The Judiciary, Jorge Yánez, went to the city prison of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonah that he was freely spoken and to put his case on the records.
He also informed him about the order for immediate release.
The Secretariat Dionisio Pérez Yacome provides details about the aircraft accident in which the government secretariat Francisco Blake and other seven people lived.
The Secretariat of Communications and Transports - SCT (Secretariat for Communication and Transport in Mexico) reported that the results of the accidents in which the government secretariat Francisco Blake Mora and other seven people lived, showing that the slaughter was directed against the ground without that the pilot had been able to make an emergency.
In a press conference, Dionisio Perez Yacome, Secretariat for Communication and Transport confirmed that the pilot had been confirmed before the starting, the conditions of warning were appropriate for the flight.
"The scene that the propeller flights had a contact with trees in 25 meters high, while the shooter lost the smell, it seems to show that helicopter had several ground contacts."
He also explained that the slaughter was built for 19 instances, as it met all the conditions for the transport of the staff.
He also said that the investigations in the area where the machine had been deleted were not found in the fabric.
"After the search, no aircraft was found at other sites, the shooting was the whole structure.
The slaughter was built for 19 instances, as it complied with all conditions for the transport of persons.
The area has a strike of 7 to 30 degrees.
Today, it is priority to obtain the results as soon as possible, however, these several months may, perhaps even one year.
On the other hand, Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Aeropuertos and Services Auxiliares (Secretariat for Aeroports and Help Services in Mexico), insured that the President of the State Major flyed with a flight speed and the aircraft was slowly delayed.
"This information strengthens the acceptance that it was a normal aircraft operation at the time of the appeal."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Perez Yacome, had six relevant points to be taken into account in the investigation:
View flight:
In accordance with the standards, it was a flight in accordance with the rules of the vision flight, which means that the management should have had been sufficiently viewed during the flight and on the ground.
Conditions of warning:
The AICM marked appropriate shift conditions at the start. During the continued flight on the border area between Mexico and Mexico, some deep light clouds moved.
Selected flights:
It is possible that the management has chosen a lower area, with better view on the Cuernavaca Tal because of the clouds.
Availability:
The surrounding coordinates and the last radar record of the Hubschrauber agreed to. Maybe it had not given any control loss on the aircraft nor a disappearance of the flight route before the shipment.
Residue of the rest of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available to this day showed that the hamper was covered from a direct and slower direction.
The template of the disappeared aircraft makes it possible that the slaughter was shocked with its unreasoned structure on the ground.
No instructions on burning or explosion:
The rest of the flight offers the accident, nor closure on fire or on explosion.
The last research results indicated on several ground contacts.
The aircrafts were found at 9200 feet above the sea level, and the floor has been shocked and a seven to three-year degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the shooter probably went to break.
Some information shows that the slaughter could have had a number of ground contacts.
After a minute search on a zone that discovered the accident, no aircraft was found to be discovered, which increased the acceptance of the unfair aircraft structure against the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol to detect the gene for fertility
The Social Insurance Office of Mexico leads a research project to detect the gene for fatality in children and adolescents supported by specialists of IPN.
The Instituto Mexicono del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Insurance Statute of Mexico) announced that it was a research project to discover the gene for fativity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of Feeability in Child and Youth" which should be found in connection with the genetic brands.
Michael Cruz López, Director of the Medical Research Unit in Bioquímica (the Department of Medical Research, Biochemia, Headquarter of Biochemia) at the Clinic Hospital de Specialities of the National Medico Center of the XXI century stated that an interdisciplinary team, consisting of doctors, nurses, food specialists and social workers was established.
This team is supported by specialists and students of post-graduated studies at the National Institute of Health Public (INSP) and at the Centre for Investigation and Studies Avanzados (Cinvestav) of the National Political Institute (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interestors can come to the sports places of the IMSS in Mexico, where every Saturday from 8.00 p.m. tests are performed with children and adolescents.
He pointed out that the investigation on the Sports of Cuauhtémoc (West of the Federal State of Mexico) began and was continued on the sport site of Nezahualkoyolt (in the east of the Mexico State).
If the objective of 500 to 600 researchers is achieved, the study is continued on the sports place of Independence (south of the capital centre) and closed to the of Morelos (on the north of the capital district).
He explained that the purpose of the study was the knowledge of the factors and the role of the genetics in connection with the development of pharmaceuticalness and the identification of risk factors of mexican children and adolescents to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
In response to the World Day of Diabetes, he stated that three thousand children and adolescents should comply with the understanding of their parents and with the supervision of food issues.
You will also put questions about their physical activity and their family diseases in order to control risk factors that may have diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He increased the measurement of research persons (length, size, massage), its blood pressure and blood values such as the glucose level, triglycerid, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (required the identification of genes in relation to fativity in the age of children).
Cruz López stressed that this investigation would be carried out on the concern of the health personnel on the alarming weight of young people.
"The health summarises from 1999 and 2006 showed that in only six years the proportion of fettleibian boys has increased by 77% and by the girls with fativity up to 47%. The overwhelming has also been dramatically increased," stated the ISS specialist.
He acknowledged that the search for genetic brands was based because the genetic history of the people of Mexico was different from the other people.
He acknowledged that a (e) Mexicoan (in) average of 65% of Indian and American, 30% of European and 5% of African population is reflected in the genes related to diabetes and overweight.
In general, he declared that the genetics of fativity were expressed in the incapacity to destroy the overwhelming of the energy taken to us, so that it was put into the form of fat.
The researcher declared that the direct benefits for the investigators were conducted in a comprehensive investigation of children in which it would be determined whether they demonstrate a degree of overweight or fertility.
It would even investigate the event of dark skin variety in the nak and in the internal arm (acanthosis), which indicates the probability of substance change disorders and diabetes in the pre-state.
All information would be treated confidencely and the parents are writtenly informed by the doctors. The doctors explain all the results of the medication and propose changes in the life system that are appropriate to prevent sicknesses.
Cruz López explained that there are three fundamental factors responsible for overgewicht, fatigue and other chronic diseases: the lack of movement, which means the lack of movement every day, to carry the most time of the day before the television and to use transport instead of walking short ways.
The high calorium incentive, which means an increased consumption of sugared drinks and carbon hydrocarbons (Tamales, bread, pizza, Hamburger etc.), together with a high fertility and iron, and the genetics to be analyzed in this research project.
Assistance by UNAM prevents smugglers
Rafael Herrera, researchers at the University of Mexican Chemistry in UNAM developed with polymers modified asphaltes to make the mixing of oppositely against weather conditions and temperature changes
Whether the signs from the road bar, it would not be necessary to repair almost 200 000 swimming pools when the rain period at the UNAM University of Metrópolitana del Valle de Mexico (stadt area of the Tals of Mexico), Rafael Herrera Nájera, researchers at the University of Chemistry (FQ) warned and warned that if the exhibition and maintenance of the slaughter's skins were decreased or even fully avoided.
In his presentation "Trabblers of Technical View", which he took to the chemical of the International Year, he knew that the laboratory for which he is responsible develops with polymers modified asphaltes to produce similar mixtures, which, however, represents a greater mechanical resistance in higher and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera said that this kind of modified asphaltes should be used in areas of extremely warm climate, such as in some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behaviour of the road ballet and thus to avoid the event of slaughterers.
He explained that the asphalt - the most serious part of the earth oil - is a coal water connection, one of which has a high molecular weight - the asphaltes mentioned so - and the other part - are low - the Malthenes mentioned.
Azolelastic behaviour means that this is in high temperatures of almost 180°C as a liquidity, with 120°C it is very slightly and almost 50°C, while it is blue at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt is not equal to the roads, but changes one day in depending on the shift conditions and temperature changes," the Chemistry Engineer expressed.
The researcher of the FQ noted that the streets of Mexico have mostly had a flexible street ballot, which was set out of six material strikes, including the last three asphalts.
Between the top shoes, a shock of asphalt, which was covered by small, in asphalt and then fixed stones best.
Each individual stone of this skin is assembled in asphalt.
If the vehicles continue and are generated by the forces, this switch allows a good power distribution on the road.
"If it would be modified asphalt, the forces would be better distributed," said the Chemistry engineer.
"Over the tragedy," he explained, "If a last shirt that is called a trag stone that consists of stones, that is, from sand, which was also assembled in Asphalt.
Since this switch is in contact with the vehicle trails, they need a greater mechanical power than the weapon and they need to purify.
The majority of the forces of this road day is accompanied and distributed, and the tractor is also necessary to maintain a suitable ditch and the material from which it exists.
The conditions of heating, especially the temperature and temperature changes, are further important factors to take into account, in front of all things, the water," he said, "When it affects the behaviour of the behaviour significantly.
When the shooting is shocked, water enters into the shooting and only gets difficult. This causes an indication of all shoots of the road ballet, and then the event of slaughterers.
When a slagloch comes up, he said, "It will first be shocked, while the slaughter will only be affected, but the damage is not soon, but it is a process that should be maintained in the first signs by appropriate maintenance programmes."
The member of the National System of Investigators (National Research Systems Mexico) stated that the vehicle charge is a further important cause for the emergence of slaughterers, and therefore the thickness should always be in relation to the vehicle load and should be ensured that the ruling should be maintained in order to avoid a frequencies drivers.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there were still many research works that were waiting for, for example, about asphalt emissions that were even on the market in other countries, and with which the slaughter was simply and without applying high temperatures.
What lacked the candidate of the Valle to be the new Miss Columbia?
Analysis of the factors that resulted in the fact that Melina Ramírez Serna did not get the chrone of Miss Columbia.
El Valle receives his 14th missile.
Again, Valle del Cauca was empty when the Krone for Miss Columbian.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied to stand on the winner podium, to set up a silver crone and the band that she expressed as a new Columbia.
With the results received in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantico took the crown and the cedar, the Department is joined at 14 missiles and Melina at the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who were close to the crowns. The declared Missiles: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Dominingguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Lake Blaque (1988), María Conomica Pinedo (1989), Romana Diaro (1990), Roberto Diaro (1993), Lorena Altale (Gartalina 2000), Catalina (Gartalina).
The great question, which many today, is: what did it miss?
Because the result corresponds to the decline of a great favorite showed in each presentation that she had everything available to be the new Columbian Miss. Nevertheless, she was elected to the Queen of the Police and Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that also received the Beauty King Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and who took the Krone of Miss Columbia with home.
The first factor, which is decisive for the decision of the Jury to recall her to the first miss, is that she did not convince the answer to the question: "What book has influenced you most and why?", which she had been put by Martín Murillo Gomez by Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca answered the questionnaire:
"I read a lot, I really believe in the literature, I believe it is a kind of civilization, finally I believe that the book that for my childhood was the most strong one, 'the little prince' is a deep book.
Today I read 'Schuld and Sühne'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I just read a book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book that is the 'leadership'.
An answer that was on a few opposites, first because of the term “sik civilization” and second, because she did not have explained concretely how it had influenced any of her books.
But after the end of the ceremony, Melina explained to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what must happen.
And for all people, please read a little 'The little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the favorite of El Valle is burned.
A journalist from Bogota pointed out that the fact that she was the most favorites of all the cases, which had received all the prices in advance (Gastronomie Competition Oster, public vote on the best handed cost and reina Madre), "the other candidates had made unfortunately what was stressed by the Queen's Queen, which was therefore not able to explain."
And this was the first idea of the bathroom at the beach of Hilton's hotel and their two surroundings at the Peninsula Festival.
Although she was safe with both, she lacked the strength and the sweet that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic were able to look.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the "Como en house" in the RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina has been struck is "it shows that the candidate who wins most prices during the competition will not be king."
In addition, Vale went to the end of the press from the way - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jury about their interests in social work, which is finally the key of the national beauty competition.
It will be reasoned that two days before the collection of the international Jury Lucy Doughty, they searched for a woman who joined himself in the social affairs of their country.
"The beauty is not enough for a Miss Columbia only. You have to look over the body and concentrate on the social reputation that she had already worked before the participation in the competition in projects," she explained.
It is also spectacular that Valle had sinned with their defects of the grain and fibrose that you noticed in the magnificent, but it is contrary, since the jury chose it as candidate for ‘natural beauty’ with a healthy body, good food habits and responsible physical work.
The trainer of the Queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, said that Melina did not have the best body that it had better, "but her problem with the fibrose in the bottle that was honestly not to be seen for me, expressed their number of points on the last day."
The journalist Guido Hoyos, from the Chromos magazine, was viewed that the error of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the surgery attacks herself.
"The operations are okay, but Vale didn't know how they should do it right.
Your body has never been their strong side, and this place had to pay them."
Because this price, which is forgiven the first time from the National Beauty Competition, was a green prediction that should be true in the night. It was said that Raymundo Melina had given a comfort price to not let it come to the Genuss of the Cross.
Unlike that that is true or not, the fact is that Melina takes its year from today, not as Queens, but as princess, a position that you offers the possibility to represent in the name of the National Beauty Competition Columbia in one of the international competitions.
However, she will be one of the Queens, who had come into the history, despite her overwhelming invasion for Cartagena.
So was the work of the doctor identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lophoskopist from Cali went into the story as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
On the past 4 November, a lophoskopist of the State Authority's investigation unit (CTI) confirmed Cali as the man who was the identity of the FARC leader (Fuerzas Armada Revolutionaryias de Colombia - Revolutionary forces of Colombia), a: "Alfonso Cano" by comparing the finger pressure.
From the seven lophoskopists in the CTI Division, Eliazar González was working this week with a man from Puerto Tejada since 21 years of criminal investigation.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez worked in the municipalities of Choko, where he was often in the dschungel for five days to reach the place where the bodies he had to identifie.
He settled after the Valle over and after the completion of the necessary course, he specialized on the lophoscopie, which is the investigation of the skin, i.e. the hands and foot surfaces.
In the week of use against the same Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was noted to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big waited for him.
On Friday night, he went to Cauca in the swimming pool of Palmira.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that the suspect was that one of the oldest guerrilles of the world could be able to take the ten-finger paint of Guillermo León Sáenz (of his real name).
However, when he reached with the investigator the place in which the body was found, he could not identify him due to his physical appearance, because this was not less than the forms he saw in the mass media.
He had no bart, was like a farmer in the area, didn't have a brick and was very dignified.
But the fingers do not lie.
Armed with a luxury, tinta, a plant class and a ball lamp compare the finger pulses of the body with those on the board.
He saw it right, it was "Alfonso Cano".
On the same night, the man who was defenced from Puerto Tejada was responsible for the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón, to report that it was actually the head of the FARC.
Search for the search
It was very important for a dactylope from the Sijin in Cali that was shared by President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the use of "cano".
Many people don't know our job.
Daktyloscopie is a exact science without error quotes that can be a key factor in solving a criminal.
Lophoskopists are not only identifiing bodies, supporting investigations in murder and robbery cases and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
In their arrest, many criminals have false proof papers or have no.
We're taking the finger pulses and searching for them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to get a piece of wall from a house at a staircase, since the helmet had opened himself in this place with his hand when he was shocked out a safe with shock and money.
"When are difficult, because their surfaces are inadequate for the delay of fingers, but in this case we could take the impression of the whole hand and identify the criminals who had participated in several traces," he remarked.
With the finger pressures, the murderers can also be loaded or worried.
Before short, a death was discovered by snaps flanks.
In the investigation, a family member could be suspicioned, and indeed, a finger pressure agreed to the flash.
Although this does not guarantee that it is about the murder, he will be linked to the place where the crime was started.
A dactyloskopist of the CTI declared that "the finger pulses with chemical or physical reagents would be taken from the object."
When they appear, a plant cell or a band shall be used for mixing.
Afterwards, the expressions are sent to Asif, which is the bank of infringement data or standard for persons.
"The problem is that there are still many colonies without reference papers," the CTI experts explained.
He said he wasn't all like it would be shown in the SCI TV series.
As not all gold is that brilliant, it's not all that you're drawing up, a finger impression.
However, it may be used when you run a corresponding comparison.
The "recommendations" calls for the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrates were shocked in the Zuccotti plate.
A majority came to the residence order and changed his location in a nearby park.
The members of the movement Ocupy Wall Street requested the New York authorities to find out on this Tuesday when they tried to join the Manhatten plate, after they were displaced from the place in the morning grain and tried to put another place on the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators wanted to join the Zuccotti plate, where they were able to make access to the "recommendations" to this place. During the time, a other part of the movement to the residence order was held in the northern town where it came to nine prisons.
"Our idea is that, if the court does not allow us to camp on the place, we are assembled to another place and the battle with legal means to go back to the home with seats and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the speakers of the movement "Ocupy Wall Street".
Bray concluded that the response of the "recommendations" to the place of her shippers, which was directly ordered by Michael Bloomberg, the Chief of New York, was before the court, where the judge Lucy Billings made a order that prohibited the violent location of the place and the demonstrators accepted the ceiling.
Moreover, the "recommendations" had a new park that is connected to the crossing of the central Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue, near the invasion in the Holland Tunnel, New York and New Jersey, and is the property of the Trinity Church.
They could stop the place at least one hour, but then the police came and arrested some of the demonstrants, although Bray couldn't give exact numbers. He assured the news agent Efe that he also saw several journalists with hands.
The organization ensures that there were hundreds of people who had been found in this place where a religious leaders also had been a sign of their support to the members of the movement and to communicate with the police.
The Succotti plate is closed in the expectation of a requested hearing still adopted for this service day, and the legality of the places in the morning greenage should be analyzed.
Some of the demonstrates who were embarrassed by the place took photos of this kind of order and distributed them. They even gave them some of the police who were waiting for the place, which had resulted in "one small crowds" as Bray reported, who showed that some of the police had attacked demonstrates.
The relevant instruction prohibits the authorities to shoot from Occupy Wall Street's members and the application of "the places adopted after the stipulation and prohibiting the demonstrates to return to the park with their cells and other things they had previously used."
Citizen Bloomberg clears that the new opening of the place for public traffic and demonstrates was due to the press, and the demonstrators pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to resort again with cells and sleep shoots to this place.
The Citizensman personally defended the place of the Soccotti plate, which was held in the morning grain, where almost 200 people were arrested, and that was decided because the demonstrates were "surrected the right".
Bloomberg explained that he had given the arrangement to relocate the place, because it had become "in a place where people came not to demonstration, but to break the laws and in some cases to add any other person's damage," because "also some business had been threatened" and the inhabitants asked "to their quality of life".
"The place in the morning grain was earnest and shows that Bloomberg is interested in the protection of financial interests and not in the protection of the interests of North American workers", added the speaker of the movement that the Chief acknowledged "not respect the freedom of press".
The responsibilities of "Occupy Wall Street" reported that they were thinking about organizing "great action" for Thursday, together with communities and workshops, to remember the two months that the Protests have already been held since 17 September.
Pamela Anderson is in the TV Christmas show the young woman Maria
With Michael Bublé and other Canadian famous audience she will be held in the TV program "It's a Russell Peter's Christmas" on 1 December.
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allens Assistant in "Home Improvement", Saving room in "Baywatch", Caninchen with "Playboy", the wife of the Rockmusic Tommy Lee, and now the artists and models will be a Christmas meeting of the Canadian television.
The private television CTV has known today that Anderson, together with the "crooner" (Balladens speakers) Michael Bubllé and other Canadian hostings on 1 December in the TV program "It's a Russell Peter's Christmas" and will find a very special young woman Maria life.
CTV today distributed images from the television program, in Anderson - the also for the distribution of a own pornos in the Internet, where she together with her former husband, the slaughter of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears - as a boyfriend Maria with a shoe in the shooting that Jesus is to present.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian committee of India, recently worked as a moderner at the post "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" of Charlie Sheen, as Jesus.
The Christmas programme of CTV is not only on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian Single Bublé, the Argentinian model in Buenos Aires, and this contrast is not far.
Currently, Bublé was called the North American Kim Kardashian in one of his concerts in New York.
Japan will be reborn after the earthquake
The GDP increases up to 1,5% thanks to the internal consumption and ends the spirit of the free case from March at the beginning of March
Since March last, Japan's economy has been paralyzed, which has still been in the drought after the devastating earthquake, which has entered into a nuclear crisis, and the worst disaster that Japan had experienced in the second world war.
The first estimates of the government in Tokyo estimated the damages of $30,000,000, which seems to be decreased, despite the difficult world economy.
After three quarter cases, the information on the Brutto Inland Product was finally concluded by July to September: the GDP was up to 1,5% compared to the previous quarter and up to 6% of the quotas calculated for the year.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan starts the business year in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth from January to March 2010.
The rebuilding may, in part, be declared by the machinery sale for the reconstruction of areas covered by the earthquake and the following Tsunami.
In fact, undertakings increased their investment by 1.1% compared to the decline of 0.9% for capital installations registered from January to March, the first decline after six months of inconsistent access.
However, the real change of the Japanese economy is not only based on keysians that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructures.
In particular, Japan is expected by the development of the internal consumption, which currently represents 60% of the Japanese GDP.
This variable increased up to 1%, affected by growing expenditure for vehicles, travels and free-time jobs.
The Yen Stimm
Tokio agreed to the internal market after the Yen - the Japanese currency - is in one of the "floor-floor-floods" of investors who are in the debt crisis of the euro zone and the four prognoses for the United States, a privileg, which is like a Grabstone on the accounts of the export companies.
A more deteriorate currency are the products in the foreign, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of the large technological producers.
For example, Toyota and Sony returned their weak business results from July to September to the notation of Yen.
While the markets continue to be the peripheral countries of the EU, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda remains awake.
"It must take care of the continuing risks, for example, of the deterioration of some foreign economys, the impacts of the overlaps in Thailand and the rapid evaluation of Yen," said the State Secretary for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa last night.
The perspectives are not really very honest.
The OECD Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most Member States had shown clearer signs for the delay of economic development in September.
The indicator, which predicts the channels of the world economy, showed that the biggest economic potential would be cut the brems.
Because he grew up to four tenth to the 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The euro zone is even below this average value, which is at 100 after it is cut by eight decades to 99.13 points.
Athen can reverse doubts
Papadimos says that the sperm measures would be adopted, but the conservatives will not be signed in a written agreement.
With the peripheral risk premiums and the broad insecurity of Greece continues to be in the labyrinth that the European debt crisis is produced.
The impression that the "consonance" of the new Greek transitional government is a reaction to the pressure from Brussels as a real conviction of political forces, which is slowly understood by facts.
During the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday showed that there were no alternatives to structure reforms and that hundreds of days may be too short for their implementation, assured the leaders of the conservative parties New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, that he supported the new sparm measures, and that, in no case, his call for new elections to be taken on the scheduled date of February 19th.
"The most important task of this government is the implementation of the decisions taken at the Summit of October 26", said Papadimos yesterday to open a parliamentary debate, which will be achieved tomorrow with the new government's trust voice.
The first initiatives are a package with 24 programmes for employment promotion, reform of the legislation for officials and new measures against tax interference.
Nevertheless, Samras reports the doubts in his position: "We have obligation to support the transitional government but otherwise nothing."
The conservative leader had to develop a step far with its challenge of the EU and the IWF, the body, which the 8000 million urgently needed to take care of the atmosphere, clearly indicated that he would not have an obligation to fulfil the fulfilment of the sperm measures.
However, the European Commission, which has yet been irritated because of the impact of the poker game with Papandreu Referendum last night, reaffirmed that it would not be able to subscribe economic aid if the new government and leaders of the Greek most important parties would not sign a clear written agreement as soon as possible.
The speaker of the Ministry of Economy, Amadeu Altafaj, declared that the inspectors of the Troika "soonly" returned to Athen to speak to the new government, "what for the payment of the sixth Section" as of €8,000 "required", although there is no final date.
The Greek kneel has still for a while.
"These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen emphasized the Spain's "preaching" position in respect of this type of financing
Spain “the world has a priority position in the role of smaller financing.”
In the last two decades, the Queen Sofía of Spain recalled that Spain has developed the second expenditure for this international cooperation in the last two decades of the world, which "Women" is based on a "instruction for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for the whole humanity on the basis of confidence in people".
The Queen's Fifth World Summit of Valladolid yesterday was convinced that it was "no doubt" that this kind of business would be "absolutely unnecessary" to achieve the national goals set by the United Nations until 2015, and "in particular the goal, the number of persons who have to live with income of less than one dollar a day, so under the "amusement limit".
Spain "is still working" at the expansion of the beneficiary network "towards the latest part of the world and it is responsible for this task," noted the Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will be taken by the Summit until Thursday, "the creation of new capacity and better opportunities for the doctors and in particular for women" as the principal beneficiary of these donations are guaranteed.
"We have marked many success" and "we have a lot of challenges towards".
The Summit on Small Croatia is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform to endorse "two basic objectives".
The Queen stated that until the end of 2015, 175 million poor families should have access to these financial services and that 10 million of these budgets will be exceededing the poverty limits.
The concept of the small crowd goes back in Spain and the rest of the world on the way launched by Muhammad Yunus for years, which the Queen Sofia is a "act of justice and recognition".
The father of this financing instrument described it as a "exciting idealist who has described the fight against poverty" and whose work has been known for 15 years when the Queen's travels to Bangladesh to learn the loan money strategy.
A year later, the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings at the Headquarters Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. In all of them, "we can observe a continuous development", the Queen, whose commitment to this project last night introduced its evaluation as 'Familienoberupt' in Valladolid and 'First speaker'.
Finally, the Queen Sofia finished their debate by an animating the attendants to participate in the debate and to find solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethics order."
The Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez stressed that solidarity is "ethic order" for the whole democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was an error to bind development aid at times of economic trees, which is a "sufficient commitment".
Jiménez was the view that the small crowd was a "precise and strict policy for the eradication of poverty", and that the governments of the industrial States should now work "more than every" according to solidarity criteria, and should not permit the solidarity of the crisis to sacrifice.
For Spain, the smallest credit is one of the "the most important forms of development aid".
The State Secretariat for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, declared "the success", "marginalized" people, "the always standing before the doors closed" and the Citizensman of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, called the attendants in a city, the "suther Tower, which is covered by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to choose the EU Chairpersons on the basis of the general scheme.
The first day of the Christian Democratic Congress (CDU on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, took place for Angela Merkel, Kanzlers and Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, without real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the programme, but has been implemented in the beginning, in particular for those activests, which are assessing the government policy today and perhaps Italy as a lax for tomorrow.
The European Commission's Presidential proposal was almost unilaterally adopted by the Bureau.
Under 1001 delegates, only nine votes had been voted, and ten were the vote.
The several minutes long-term Ovation, which was obtained by Angela Merkel as well as a few hours later Wolfgang Schauble, had no doubt by the three European Financial Ministers.
The main ideas of the Kansler - as well as the requests - are the following slogans: the answer to the crisis is not less but more Europe.
It is not only because European peace means, but also "one million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the officers, "the time for an interruption in Europe."
This could be expressed by the amendment of the Lisbon Treaty on the budgetary policy of countries in the euro area, but it could also be a view to the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general stage."
This is, however, one of the proposals adopted by the Congress which were clearly Wolfgang Schauble Pate.
Of course, it's just little likely that the 47 are fast towards this revolution: the Great Britain is rejecting the matter, and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is the same view.
However, the milk stone is covered.
The delegations also rejected the proposal for a country's weight in the ECB's viability in a excessive majority, which apparently constituted a decrease in the position of Germany.
Consequently, the candidates that have been considered on the climate within its party have strengthened the reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, it has no longer tried to win their congress on the costs of the "klens" or the European countries who are in difficulty that would immediately criticize the arrogant Germany.
As far as the European appeal to the importance of the German-France friendship has a paragraph, Angela Merkel France does not call on the plan.
Not at least directly.
Because this remembers that Leipzig was in the middle of a blue battle two centuries ago.
Factly one of the most deceased strikes of the Napoleonian army.
What represents fraud in nurses?
After family aid, UMP and the Government are now attacked.
Nicolas Sarkozy will take place on Tuesday 15 November in Bordeaux, to visit a family aid box and to provide a talk about it, which has always come back since 2007 - the subject of the fight against social fraud and the economic dependence of the State.
In order to accompany this attack, which is intended to submit the economy in a detention test, on the other hand, it is not less preserved for a axis of the right presidency campaign, the majority will concentrate on workers' reports.
First with budgetary objectives, the government aims to introduce a fourth quarter day before taking into account a notice of hospitality in private workers.
A good German means that a sick worker would lose the payment of four days without the authorisation of the specific company, therefore at least 15% of its monthly income.
A measuring that threatens the shame of “Les Echos”, however, would help to bring $280 million.
And the income of the other symbolic characters was more: the State officials would have a uncompensed carennial day in the diseases (for the same time there are no career periods, in contrast to the three carennial days in the private sector.
While these issues are in the debate, the majority also depends on the new fraud topics, which are now engaged in the malnutrition associated with labour absent.
"The controls will be more important, and moreover, these returns are to be paid if it is requested", warned Xavier Betrang on Sunday, 13 November before the Sender RTL's microphone.
Like in other cases, the effects of this report on the reality of pregnancy in the field of nursing are a little unproportional.
This is, in fact, already since 2002 the object of permanent observance, as well as political offences, which have led to the most common fruits.
The Frenchs are not more often sick than people in other places in Europe.
However, let us first disappear in the country-wide numbers.
According to the country hospital CNAM, more than EUR 237 million were paid in 2006.
As regards the Economic and Documentation Institute of Health, daily derogations in 2008 were 11,3 billion euros 5% of health expenditure.
In this amount 46% of maternal permissions and labour accidents and 54% related to disease permits, which is 6,2 billion euros.
And then 2,5% health expenditure.
In 2010, the Frenchs faced 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study of the Alma Consulting Group, only 14.5 hospital days were allowed.
A fund that deduces certain differences: another, in 2007 by Monster.com, the website for carriage planning, has shown that 75% of the 40.000 interested French employees had not been given to have received no single day of hospital.
Another study, present by the hospital insurance, clearly reveals that 37% of illness reports in 2010 were shorter than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and a month, 15% between one and three months and 11% of them.
In comparison with their neighbouring European neighbors, French workers are therefore not more than employees in the other places of unemployment.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers of the French, State Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global decline rate (environmental or otherwise) was occurred between 10 and 11% in France, 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% to 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud of nurses represents a disappearing part of black work.
With regard to fraud, only a weak exma is reached here.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 makes it possible that there are systematic controls in nurses exceeding 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (occupied high school for technicians and intellectual training) has found under 1.5 million controls that 13% of the 285,000 experienced, short-term reports heavyly in 37.050 cases were unfair or too long.
In the systematically controlled disease cases of more than 45 days, there were under 1,1 million or unjusted cases, which are 132,000.
In total, 169.000 "unjustified" cases are subject to a number of millions of employees that have been applied to hospitality.
A point representing only a weak shape in respect of those of black work.
According to the UMP Deputy Dominica Tian, a reporter in July on this issue constitutes 9 to 15 billion euros per year, which is more than the total costs of daily payments, and therefore significantly more than the defraudation in the last callers.
Papdemos: Greece should introduce a new adjustment plan
Greece needs a new adjustment programme for its economy.
This had announced on Monday 14 November by the Prime Minister Lucas Papademos before the Parliament, in addition to the fact that his government was not sufficient for hundreds of days to complete this task.
"In order to continue the efforts to strengthen the economy, we need to support our European partners and a new programme for the Budgetary Adjustment", the Governing Chief stated in its first public talk at the opening of the debate on the confidence of Parliament on midnight.
The implementation of the decisions adopted on 27 October was the "the headquarter" of the new Government, since the participation of the country within the euro zone has been added to the game.
Consequently, Mr. Papademos planned to reduce the State deficit of the country to the 9% of the Brutto Inland Product from today to the end of the year, after that in 2010, 10.6% and 15.7% in 2009.
The rights refusal the new spans.
Antonis Samaras, Chief of the Right Flight, had agreed on the already approved measures relating to a trial of income from the debt crisis, but predicted that his party would not be prepared to purchase an additional spamation.
"We will not vote for new steps," he said with a Membership of its Party of New Democracy.
He had prepared to declare the requirements of reducing budget deficit and debt as well as the fight against abuse, however, any policy which would be bound to the economic restructuring would be bound.
Olli Rehn, with economic and monetary tasks, who prevented that IWF and the EU had not freed the necessary loans of 8 billion euros without written guarantees of all parties on their support, responded that his word would be sufficient and that it would not be signed under the pressure of oohles.
Euthanasie and joined freedom must be legalized, so an expert body
Canadians live in refusal of the death, as provided by a report of the Kingdom Society of Canada
The body declared that governments, health institutions and doctors cooperated in terms of painful treatment in order to provide the best painful means, and that also resulted in cancer cases.
The Canadian society lives in a refusal against the death.
Only 9% of the Canadians are actually allowed to talk to their doctor about conditions in which they want to die and have disposal for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of a imminent report of the Kingdom Society of Canada, which was involved in the six experts linked to various areas of ethics, laws and medicine.
This body recommends that the Government derogate the criminal law in order to allow closed suicide and Eutanasia where this choice is taken, and in patients who are considered in a position to take such decision.
As a result, experts share a recent survey of the independent society of EIU, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the earthquake.
Although Canada has planned on 10th round, the study notes that "the medical care of death in Canada has produced a culture in which people fear to cut death to the subject".
Medical care or not: 77% of the Canadians do not have access to painful resources, so inform us of the experts appointed by the Kingdom Society of Canada.
And despite the major desire of Canadians to die at home, however, 68.6% of these died finally in the hospital.
In the whole country, the rate of death was higher than 86% in the hospital house in Quebec.
In the heavy question on Euthanasia and joined suicide, the advisers of the report on conclusions that the position of the federal government that has already been struggled has no amendments of the Criminal Act on Eutanasia and a joint suicide.
Now, however, there is no evidence that such discrimination would be in their application, such as the practice of Eutanasia or the accompanied suicide of non-competentious persons or non-acceptable persons.
On the contrary, more cases of such transmissions are confronted only in countries where Euthanasia and the closed suicide are not legalized, such as yesterday Jocelyn Downie, the secretary of the report, confirmed in a teleconference.
"Euthansia is practitioned in Canada, where she is clearly illegal."
"Another associated suicide is practitioned in Canada, although this is clearly illegal," says Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians promised the Euthanasia
We forgot that, according to an Anus Reid investigation carried out in 2010, 85% of the Canadians were swept in favour of Eutania, since they are the view that they would allow them to cure their sufferings at the end of their life.
And 66% believe that the content of a legitimation of Eutanasia does not have the consequence of telling the message that life of older or lower people is less value.
With regard to persons who have already practiced a joined suicide, the questionnaires feel that they should not be pursued criminally.
With regard to the maintenance or vision of resources in patients, the situation is less clearly, as the report providers are.
They also in their recommendation registered that the criminal law should be indicated that the derogation of the funds for which a legal refusal has been proposed should not apply as criminal.
The expert body also calls for the task of the health experts to respect the resources at the end of life, and it should be feared without criminal persecution.
The body declared that governments, health institutions and doctors cooperated in terms of painful treatment in order to provide the best painful means, and that is also out of cancer cases.
Finally, the body calls for consideration at least for the resources already used in the Canadian institutions for healthcare, which are widely used to deteriorate or reducing pain, as they were required to reduce physical pain and to deal with the same procedures.
Reserves of other experts
Some experts on the legal area of health have already presented preserves on the conclusions of the expert report of the King Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has called the position of the reporting experts as "extreme" as these are not limited to the Euthanasis practice in nurses in the end phase.
"This opens the challenges for a situation in which everybody who is life-free and older than 18 is to ask another person to help him at his self-assault," says RA Descamps, who held a collection of the report last night.
RA Descamps also emphasizes that the promotors of the report seem to set the individual's own responsibility over all other values involved in the social impact of society.
But, as he says, give it "lines and obligations in a society."
Margaret Samrville, a specialist for health law, has also expressed the conclusions of the report which they were referred to as "Pro-Euthanasie-Manifest".
Margaret Thorville, who is a member of the Kingdom Society of Canada, doubts, in particular, the reports relating to the non-proliferation of miscarriages in certain countries where Euthanasia and the accompanying suicide are legalized, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The king of Jordan calls President Assad to shut up
Damascus plans a "complot" to
Syria is a isolator
The Partisans Baschar al-Assads have demonstrated last night before the authorities of the Authen Minister.
The diplomatic pressure on the Syrian Baschar al-Assads, which, however, is enhanced by Russia's support and a "complott" opposed to the country, has recently been strengthened.
Two days before the Syrian Liga by the Arab Liga, the European Union has reduced its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring countries of Syria, had been able to benefit from the department of President Assad.
King Abdullah II. From Jordan on the eve of the former Arab Prime Minister, the President of Baschar al-Assad had requested her officer to shut down in Syria, in which the fourty civilians and members of the government were already killed.
"Love Baschar the interest of his country in the heart, so he would take place, but it should also create the necessary conditions for a new time of Syrian political life," says the king of Jordan, Nearland of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
The Turkish diplomatic chief Ahmet Davidoglu, on the other hand, claimed that the Turkish communication survey has not been successfully successful since the beginning of the year.
"They in the Middle East who are not in peace with their people and are not able to satisfy this," he said, in response to Syria, the neighbouring country, to which Turkey takes a strong standing.
The United States welcomed the "reforcing consensus against Assad and the powers of the Syrian regime" in accordance with the decisions of the Arab Liga and of the European Union.
"International Community, the United States, the EU, the Arab Liga and countries such as Turkey have attacked a sound that has always been intensified in Syria," says Mark Toner, a speaker of the State Division.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government power in the region of Dar'a in South Syria were dead, thus the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights OSDH declared.
Another two civilians, according to this NGO, had lived in the armed city of Homs.
A press conference was, however, the Syrian Minister of Authentication Walid al-Mullim viewed the country's taxes at the end of the crisis."
He, on the other hand, has to suspend the decision of the Arab Liga, Damaskus from his tasks, reacting to what his appreciation represents a " dangerous step".
"Do not submit Syria," he added under the invitation, "the compromises which would not be evacuated against Syria".
According to the decision on the suspension of Syria, the Arab Liga currently investigates a "studio mechanism for civilians" and wishes to remove 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers in the country.
The French Minister of Authentication, Alan Juppee, had also spoken to the department of UNO observers in order to be protected by civilians against the repressions of the regime, after him in his "Parlania".
The Lega's audience planned new Assembly is prepared for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan decided on 2 November on the crisis, but in particular the strict, probable department of military forces from the armed cities and the release of demonstrates.
The Russian Authenic Minister Sergej Lawrow last night introduced the decision of the Arab Liga as "unjust" to make up the basis of possible sanctions against Damascus, although China had already called for the implementation of the crisis growth plan.
Italy
Monti requests the markets to be patient and Italy to sacrifice
Mario Monti, the future Italian government head, has requested a little more time from the markets to build its stage and implement a program that requests "Offer" to restore the lost creditability of the Berlusconi government during the last months.
Last night the former EU Commissioner had held a negotiation with the political parties before the present meeting of workshops and workers.
It was his task to call a cabinet to Parliament, which is relatively strict from external technicians.
"Monti spoke of a major programme with a number of victims," says Francesco Nucara, one of the many smaller parliamentary groups who participated in the meetings, after he met with the official President of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber, had, on the other hand, expected that Mario Monti brings to the Parliament a vote of trust until Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The debates will be gathered in the presentation of a strict list submitted by Mr Monti, which will, unfortunately, be rich from a duty of ministers to the Head of State, Jorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented that the strict nervousity of the Börsen markets and obligation markets requested their time.
In "a democracy there are certain deadlines to prepare a government and a government programme, he stressed that it was "certain that the markets will be dual and conscious".
His order by the Presidents was welcomed by the markets, but the disappointment was renewed, especially after an unexpected industrial decline in the euro zone in September.
The officer of the Prime Minister was intended to establish a stage of existing technicians, although he had emphasized that it would like to include "politicers" also.
The new government should only be estimated until 2013, the date of the next Parliament's election.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the President of the Chamber, the new Government should receive the evidence of confidence of the Parliament until Friday.
Mr Monti has been obliged to work in all urgencys in the sense of the goal to make Italy as an "excited protagonists" in Europe.
A speaker of the EU Commissioner Olli Rehn highlighted that "if our diagnosis is not changed to the Italian economy itself, taking into account the new government."
The EU, which is convinced that Rome has its goal of the budgetary balance in 2013, despite the sampling levels covered in these last months, has requested new illnesses in particular.
Emma Marcegaglia"Chefin des Chefs" Italias, who is meeting on Monti, is also the need for economic excursion”, where a country who has no strict growth that cannot respect deficiencies."
Mr Monti, who is known for his skills and its independence as the Commission of the EU (1994-2004) is for a "epoking exchange" Italys after 17 years of "Berlusconismus"; the "Professor" symbolizes the "decision of confidence" as well as a "other Italy" in the leadership.
The big unknown one is the long life of his stables.
President Napolitano would like to prevent previous elections since Italy has reached 200 billion euros obligations until April 2012.
Russian researchers help the Iranian nuclear energy programme
A Russian scientist, Wyatcheslaw Danilenko, helped Iran to develop a nuclear-weapon-based spray, thus confirmed on Monday a specialized, American NGO on nuclear risks.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS is based on the result of the recent report of the International Atomic Safety Agency and other documents from this UNO Agency to identify this scientist.
Last week the IAEA had informed its "excellent concern" due to a "powered military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to the initial study of the IAEA documents, the ISIS, born in 1934, apparently, had been working since the beginning of the 1960s over three decades in a Soviet Military Nuclear Center in Tschejabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
1989 or 1991 he would have left the center to establish a company in Kiew, which is built by "Nano Diamant".
The economic difficulties of his company had led him in 1995 to contact the Iranian message in Ukraine.
Before his return to Russia, he has taken into an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
The IAEA's last report stated that the Iranian development is supported by the work of a foreign experts who had not only been used in this technology, but also on the way a member of the Agency has shared its entire professional career on this technology directly in the military energy programme of its country of origin."
Anti-Islamic crimes and crimes have increased by 50%
The crimes and crimes raised against Muslims increased by 2009 to 2010 by 50%, where other racial or religiously motivated violence crimes, according to the FBI statistics published at Monday during the same period, have been easy to go back or have been low.
According to these data, the total number of crimes prohibited against Muslims from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010 increased by 49% in 2010, where 13% of violence against Catholics, a decline of 4% against Jewish offences and a global increase of 14% to anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hassmotive crimes" has increased in very weak mass on 6.628 cases, including 47.3% by racial differences and 20% by religious differences in motive criminals, as the FBI.
"After a decrease in 2009, these crimes and crimes are insufficient to grow again", the Human Rights Organization highlighted."The increase of anti-Islamian violence acts is especially significant,” added the organization in a communication.
"Human Rights First had long-term emphasized that violence against Muslims should be considered as a serious contrary to human rights, as well as all forms of hate crimes, as a serious contrary to human rights," added Paul Legendre, responsible for the organization.
"The American Government may and should do more to combat these crimes," he further estimated that this could be done in a better way towards the "hasted crimes".
The "Hass Crimes" in the American Federal Law is a heritage from the era of the fight against civil rights.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther Kings in order to punish violence against race, skin, religion or abuse, which also includes sexual inheritance.
Twitter changes the platform and continues to vary more Facebook
The Microblogging website Twitter has introduced changes on Monday in the presentation of its platform to enable its users in particular to observe the activities of those who follow their entries, which allows the service to be more different from Facebook.
The new tab "Activity" and another "Name" allows better readily to comply with the activities of other "Twitter", the Internet users whose messages you follow and follow your messages.
This allows us to find out whether they can follow their messages, whether they are subscribed to new contributions, favour certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter messagebot was tested before its general Internet distribution on Monday" in August at a low percentage of users”, and the Twitter speaker Carolyn Penner acknowledged before the French press agent AFP.
Twitter was for his little instinctive functioning, with something etherly anchotenant wordlaut (RT for referring to the Repeat of Contributions of another person). followfriday to recommend following another user's happiness, opening up a more wide public with a more comparable manner to that of the large public Facebook and Google+ networks.
In the network, users discussed with a number of "Tweets" via the Internet about this innovation.
"This is inutile, strict and too much Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The function" activity will help me to follow some elements of my flux twitters better", relucted @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a 'Goldene Budgetary Rule' in the Constitution
The government of the great social-democratic and Christian coalition in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include a 'Goldene Budgetary Rule' in the Constitution to reduce public deficiencies and to avoid a possible degradation of rating agencies in the Top of Austrian zone (AAA).
It was the Social Democratic Chairman Werner Faymann, who had announced this decision of the Council of Ministers, although the public Austrian State debt was 74.6%, so it is noted that 60% of the criteria set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debt level of countries such as Italy, Greece and Spain.
"If Austria's ability to pay, we shouldn't be able to pay more than three billion euros every year," said Michael Spindelegger, Vice-Cansler and Christian Democratic Democratic Minister.
Austria also calls for the Brussels Summit of the Eurozone Member States of 26 October: The Heads of State and Government had then requested the reducing of public deficit until the end of 2012 and a return to public balance in the Constitution or by adopting a equal law.
The measures taken here by the Austrian Government are similar to the German model, since Germany was the first European country which had included such a "Regel" in the Constitution.
To 2017, the structural budget deficit should be reduced to 0.75% of the Great Inland Product (BIP), and the structural budget deficit of the State should not exceed 0.35% of the BIP, in spite of which regional countries should be equal to the Community budgets.
The objective is to reduce the budgetary debt under the 60% criteria laid down by the Maastricht Agreement in the horizon of 2020/21.
Starker Yen
Noda threatens a new intervention on monetary markets
The Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese Office would re-interview the monetary markets if the Yen should continue to increase.
"If we have a extreme volatility" in the Yen changing course, we will also intervene as we did last time," Mr. Noda said in Senate.
On Thursday, the Yen was once close to the historic level, which the Japanese authorities had forced to intervention on October 31.
On this day, Tokyo had sold massive Yen against dollars to sell the Japanese duty value, which is to tax a new record value since 1945 against the dollar.
However, the Yen has been regularly increased in this, baptized by buyers of investors that consider the Yen as "relief value" in these uncertain times of global economic abuse and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar was fallen on Tuesday under 77 Yen, the euro is stolen under the symbolic lake of 105 Yen near the levels that had struck the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the $ 120 Yen reported more than 160 Yen.
This japanese stroke fire damages the exports of the archipelles, since it condemns the costs of the "Made in Japan" producers and reduces the value of income taken by Japanese companies from the foreign, as these are turning into a countrywide.
"Japan fights after the earthquake and the Tsunami on 11 March, which has destroyed the Tohoku region for its rebuilding," said Mr. Noda, who fears that the Yen smooth could already kill the weak resurrection in the Keime.
The third economic world has gained the growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter to the first time in this year thanks to the springed export increases and the consumption of the "plambed" budgets by the disaster.
However, the Prime Minister estimates that the smooth of Yen does not reflect the economic funds of Japan.
The Minister of Finance Jun Azumi, on the other hand, asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a second-day meeting of its committee on Tuesday, to take all remarkable measures to resolve the Yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, the representative Governor of the Institute, noted that the BoJ has already introduced "approximate pieces" in which he read reliable that there is no additional currencies expected at midnight.
At the end of October, the Bank has increased its State obligations purchase to 5,000 billion Yen (47 billion euros) to reduce the 55,000 billion Yen (519 billion euros) decking amounts which had been used for several purchases of financial titles to exceed the liquidity market.
Euro zone:
Invasion fast in the height, bridges make backsets
The risk of the debt crisis is indefinitely defined by the European identification numbers.
In spite of the office of the new government heads in Greece and Italy, as well as the best growth rates in France and Germany increased the rates of the defeated countries.
The burns, which are still concerned about the stability of the euro zone, also decreased this Tuesday, on 15 November a little more in negative filling.
In Paris, the CAC lost at 10 a.m. at 1,4% and lost 3.064 points.
The dax in Frankfurt went back to 0.4%, London at 0.1%.
"In the light of the new expenditure regarding the rates of State interests in which the global share markets continue to make a part of their recent profits in difficult times.
"The capital lingers are nervous and are very well conscious of the risk of shoot", says Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG marketets, referred to by the press agent Reuters.
The Börss in Tokyo, which, on the renewed fear of market operators, in terms of capacity in Europe, had closed with a debt crisis of 0.7%.
""Japan has directed his eyes on Europe as the rest of the world, and the trade moves on a limited variation coridor, as long as investors do not have evidence that the situation has stabilized", estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ioiyoshi Investment Management.
This recovery of concerns about the future of the euro zone has damaged the unit that continues to continue their breakfast on the Sunday.
The euro has been moved at its lower level for a half months.
At 10 p.m. the European Valuta was 1.3570 Dollar, so it was 0.4%.
According to the Börsenmakers, the CDU, a party of the chairman Angela Merkel, who was assembled at the Monday at the Congress, was returned to a request, especially for the possibility of the countries in difficulties to get out of the euro area without leaveing the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish rates are far below the 6% green.
The Italian and Spain loans remain at a very threatening level.
This Sunday morning the rewards of Italian obligations reached by 6,85% of those of the Spanish titles reefed to 6,2%.
These rates of interest rates in the Southern countries, but also in France, continue to draw closer to the fears of investors.
The future Italian government Chief Mario Monti requested the markets more time to restore the situation threatened by the debt load in Italy.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lukas Papademos, has confirmed, on the other hand, the implementation of the decisions taken by the Euro Zone Summit on 27 October.
Spain is in the visibility of the markets, as the election of Parliament is held on Sunday in the country.
The interestshere ("expread") between the German and Spanish 10-year-old obligations have, however, reached a new historical higher.
In expectation of growth rates of the euro zone
Statistically, France has registered an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, and was a little better than 0.3% expected.
However, the Statistical Federal Office INSEE had revised the decline of the second quarter, with a minimum of 0.1% of the gross domestic product (BIP) instead of a stagnation.
Indeed, it is the fourth quarter that the economic experts worried mostly.
Germany had to decrease a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first higher calculation of the whole euro zone will be expected at 11 p.m. by the EU Commission warns before the risk of a renewed recession.
Energy Policy:
The facts should be blessed over dogs
There is a question that cannot be treated on the basis of short-term reviews or because of emotions, this is certainly the energy policy.
Availability and costs of electricity affect the acquisibility of companies in direct mass.
It is convenient to take an election meeting on this subject and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only take fruit when it examines the entire economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The Frenchs should based their views on objective facts, rational data.
Although seven billion people are on this planet, the demographic evolution has a duplication of electricity demand until 2050, there is no need to refusal a large part of the world population to a vital element.
At the same time, it is necessary to smooth the reducing of fossil resources in order to continue to produce continuous electricity without reducing the necessary need for the reducing of the gas emissions, an issue that has been disappeared from the environmental debate, to forget to combat climate irregularities.
The accident of Fukushima does not change this parameter.
Germany therefore continued to be isolated in its decision to reject nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium that undermines its decision of the need to find a substitutive source, nor in Switzerland that is just in mind to build nuclear powers of the last generation.
The Great Britain, Finland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil to call only some countries, continue to follow their projects with a decision.
The United States have decided to join a new unit after Fukushima in their park by re-exploding the work of three Mile Islands that remained after the nuclear accident.
Although the German model is currently set up as an example to renewable energy sources, the reality of the discurso is in contrast.
The election in Berlin will be in the form of a defence of the electricity price, an enhanced energetic dependence on import gases, especially from Russia, a increase in the CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal energy.
The totality of this unfortunate effects will be marked within less than months.
The Denmark case is a matter of thinking.
Denmark is one of the most intensive users of coal and gas, which is used with wind energy, and because of its CO2 emissions and its electricity price at 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average value.
Thanks to the ability of our energy policy, our neighbors pay a higher electricity calculation in contrast to our French budget at 40%.
Since the energy prices in the globalized economy represent a key role of competitiveness and an industry's stability plant on national grounds, the French companies have an advantage because of the most favorable electricity in Europe.
Each significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore be a strong increase in the energy price, which will be readily readily about the re-industrialization of our country and the defence of the purchasing power to illusion.
Inquiries show that the price is a price, which is also unlikely to pay the large majority of French people as well as how they can recognise the resistance against the principle of these energy sources.
We convince that the energy policy of our country has enabled it to build an industrial trend with 125.00 direct and 410,000 jobs induced.
As a result of its strong export characters, it brings a large number of smaller and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes it a number of jobs in creators.
If France decides to increase the nuclear power, a major part of these SMEs would fall to victims, and the annual EUR 6 billion in investment and nuclear energy exports would be more and more.
What electricity would be involved in the functioning of a designed EPR for sixty years if the decline of its producers is planned?
In order to solve the energetic balance, it is necessary that there is little like a demon work a wonderful means to produce electricity.
The company developed, CO2 arms solutions to use nuclear power and renewable energy are produced by the complementarity of energy sources.
The highest security level to be reliable is an absolute imperative for the nuclear power.
In France, we have carried out a security authority that is uncompromising and transparent controls in already existing works such as the construction in Flamanville.
The work teams who have made a name because of their professionality are just to be accompanied by the security proposal.
Over 50 years the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents.
Only one, which is in three Mile Islands, is under normal operation conditions, so he lost no consequences for human and environment.
In Tschernobyl, the drama was slaughtered by reactor construction as well as indeed, human faults.
In Fukushima some looks like to forget that the accident of two natural disasters has never been called as a result of the death of several ten thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will also get their teachings out of this accident as they had done according to the two previous cases.
The EPR is a project which allows him to resist to such phenomena as the fruit of this action, as a result of the work of the security authorities of French and German operators and constructions of nuclear power works.
As it is considered to build a nuclear power tool among the electronic technicians, a building in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competitiveness of Areva and EDF by reading free trains to travel to the leading position in the unforeseen nuclear development.
It is unreasonable and legitimate to search for the best source of energy for our country, but it would be unresponsive to allow emotions, dogmen and parties to dominate a debate that also defines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration Last or chance for the economy?
The immigration policy carried out under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized by a variety of angles - the transfer of police, courts and administrative bodies because of one of the numbers subjected to the policy, the compatibility of this policy with the status of a "Lunde of Human Rights", as it itself stated in France.
Recently, the appointment of an alien students had shown the weekly views that the Ministry of Internal Affairs had proclaimed (see Libration of 23 May) that France had no talent, murder or Kelner needed from the foreign."
But this policy has been analyzed only rarely by the economic perspective.
Indeed, this topic is an extensive consensus between the right and the left.
From the right side, the sound of Jacques Chirac was attacked in 1976, which stated that "900,000 unemployed people, including more than 2 million immigred workers, should not be a problem for a country," from the left side by Michel Rocard, which was described in 1990, France could not take the whole poverty of the world."
The unique difference consists of the grain of greening movement
The fear of the national earth invasion by Poland's Hordes was shared by both right and left in 2005.
From the two camps, the immigrants were decreased as a loss for the economy and the French society.
The only difference is in the degree of the movement of the immigrants.
Francois Hollands are limited to banks that indicate partnership development allows to solve our "immigration problems".
This idea of immigration as last, as a problem, may be affected by choices, but it is economically costly.
Like the economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent work that has been assembled with the latest knowledge of immigration (Exceptive people: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 S.), exists a large consensus among the specialists regarding the positive impact of immigrants on economic growth, loss and jobs in immigration countries.
Limiting immigration would reduce growth and damage the labour market situation.
The fears against the impact of migrants are based on the idea that these are threatening the domestic workers, especially the less qualified, by exercising pressure on their wealth.
However, the experience shows that immigrants in truth are significantly more complete than the domestic salary workers, since they exercise severe professionals in sectors that are technically unleased.
The smaller qualified immigrants are working in sectors that travel in domestic salary workers, who work more qualified among immigrants in dynamic sectors where training is not compatible with the job offer.
Positive loan effects
As well as a surgery would have difficulties to work in a country where the lack of antastheists is, this complementarity also affects a positive effect of the access to immigrant to losses and national labour market situation.
John Peri has calculated this way that an increase of 1% of immigrant flows is a combinated, long-term increase in real solutions between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And that without taking into account the fact that the variety of the ideas introduced by immigrants and the growth of the economic growth (a high part of immigrants under American Nobel prices; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute to social systems, in the European countries, almost 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Working Organization estimates that a person who is inmigrated to Germany in a age of 30 years includes a net amount (minus expenditure) of the EUR 150,000.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to join his mandate the lack of snippets" with the dents ".
However, these adverse denses, which should decrease immigrants, have achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has created democracy, and now remains to be discussed by European democracy.
Democracy is a valuable good; also a remarkable good.
The European Continent should be able to remind himself of whom, after its introduction in Athen, had been held over the 20th century on the tragedies of the First World War, the totalism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece.
Some have certainly believed it is rich to exercise the moral rights, but in a way as far as possible, to observe the democracy for all times.
Since Napoleon's little one, it was a character of the spiritkeeping.
The general election law, which represents the necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient for this, and can also be well as the "Strong instrument" as it expressed at that time by the Republican philosoph Etienne Vacherot.
No, democracy requires more: public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of violence, training, statement, economic and social spirit, legal practice.
The crisis in Europe, where we are, is an economic crisis, but it is also a very and most political and democracy crisis.
The change of the Greek Fair-Falsch-Referendum had in this regard doublely covered characters: once the need for a powerful return of the policy, on the other hand, but also those of the anxious feeling of their inadvertence, their inadvertence.
This ambivalence should be considered overwhelmed.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic fight today have been displaced, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, do not live in the right direction.
We have nothing to win to deal with the success of the internal referencedum, which has been organized in dependance of the needs and in a fair set.
A appearance to the European single manager or a shock with related eyes in the empty of nationalism: a great choice for the citizens!
No, we want to have a hacke, but a collective task, from full law, clarified and strongly, a choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - there is no longer anywhere to end the record - because there is only one crisis, and it is dominated in Europe.
It is all Europe, which is the dictate of the markets and rating agencies, which leads to his earnest power and its non-solidarity.
It's all Europe that has been encouraged at international level.
It is concerned about sovereignty transfers in Europe - it is all Europe that lost his sovereignty, and so each of the nations with him.
The urgency is to give the government to the leadership of the European project.
Because it is the totality of whether the Europeans reduce their debts, free from the markets and a future by investing.
The expansion from the crisis has made decisions at the European level, which can not be liked without total democracy, without safely bringing us to destruction.
After this proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists had been struggled for a long time, everyone today has the European Economic Rule.
I agree.
But without political integration and a stronger democracy, such as they propose citizens, would be a renewed tower and another sackgase.
We must take a new stage of European construction.
In order to leave the Republic in France, the fact that the Republic was to create the Republicns.
The revolution of the interests alone could not provide sufficiently here.
This is still valid.
We need to form a better integrated Europe at the economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a politically politically democratic Europe, a truly European sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Incontact" cards will be generally used
The World Meet for Chipcards opens its tour on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in optimistic position.
The 2011 Eurosmart had to end with an increase in the 11% global sales of microprocessorchips (EC cards, SIM cards), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most attractive segment is the uncontact technology that allows payments in public transports or shares of purchase by making the map a read device.
In addition to the one year ago, 320 million solds should be sold to the world 460 million uncontact cards this year!
Its market share should be further increased in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent more than 10% of the global Chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe wins with regard to the uncontact payment on land after the long time of the Asian-Pacific region.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals are accepted.
In France, the begins are more important: only 400,000 without contact cards were distributed.
However, consumer markets make a smooth.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2,5 million contactable Pass MasterCards this year.
In order to overcome high speed, the banks need to pay their customers with these cards.
"Third large French financial institutions have committed themselves to join their customers in the future systematically bank cards belonging to an uncontact chip", states Gérard Nebouy, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
Bank test payment by phone
However, this is only a first step on the way to pay the future: the mobile phone.
A disappearing percentage of devices is equipped with the NFC technology required to implement these transactions (Near Field Communication).
"They are done in a ban."
"After they should at least learn a real global development in the next year."
"We recall in 2012 with the sale of 80 to 120 million world units," said Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the initiative.
The Agriculture Credit has announced last night the start of a test cycle in Caen, which will expire from December to June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees should be equipped with a capsule that allows uncontact payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And last night the General Society had prepared the marketing of a offer which allows its customers to contact free payment via phone.
Terrorist frontier is understood from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is threatened to the relationships between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram Sect.
The long-term relationship between the terrorism group al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Section Boko Haram seem to be confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerije Vice-Au-Minister Abdelkarded Messahel himself confirmed that Algier had achieved consciousness.
"The way to go with both organizations and the relationships of secret services showed clear cooperation", he explained without further details.
Paris seems to make a similar analysis.
The investigations on the launch of two French in the Niger in the last January have promoted snippets at day.
Antoine de Léocor and Vincent Delory, accompanied in a restaurant in Niamey of the Aqmi leaders, should be killed at the same time as several of their departments in a operation carried out by the French special units.
French and Nigerian investigators want to find several phone chips that belonged to terrorists.
Terrorist acid
The analysis of the calls carried out leads to several partners in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI) the investigators, especially the numbers of two interlocutors: a number leads to a Nigerian who long-term seats in Mayduguri, a city in the north of Nigeria, which was holding Boko Haram's vige; the other leads to a man who is close to the Aqmi and the Seats.
"This is a progress, however, you must expect clearly more investment before you can speak from an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"But it's thoughtable."
"Their years have been known that the sects of financial and intellectual support of Authen and that they are increasingly active," the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo decreased.
In these last months, these "subsidy services" were always more attractive in their course, as well as the discussions and the operational modes of Boko Harem, which now showed the addition of self-moderns and the use of always more complex spring substances, which carry the same document as those used by Aqmi.
The International Community, to start at Washington, has since this time experiencing pressure on Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have considered the grouping in fact a long time on the Community of illuminates, which should not be given a particular attention.
Speed Success
The boko Haram founded in Mayduguri in 2002 in the environment of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Joseph - which is so much like "the Western Education is a damage" - follows the creation of a Islamic emirates in the northern Nigerian Islamic.
In this unmidest region, the concentration has rapidly achieved success.
It policys and calls for strict compliance with the charia, while its activists in the fight against the ungodly central government.
Attivists have first churches, bars and authorities in the viewer.
2009, the aktivists of Boko Haram were particularly active with their strengthened attacks against the Commissioners.
However, the reaction of Abuja is as commonly separated.
The army turns the city, 800 dead.
The Mohammed Joseph taken in prison is killed in prison.
As a result, the sects will be radicular and leave their high-burgs in the north.
Last Christmas she was known to an attack in Jos, who asked 80 people to live, soon to another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is declared the debt of a self-assault insured police headquarter in Abuja - the first of his type.
In August, the United Nations local seat has a priority international goal.
The education of a terrorism axis in Africa, which leads to Somalia from Mauretany to Nigeria, has been threatened by all security experts since it was.
While the Aqmi Mali and the Niger have been operating the Somaliaers of al-Shabaab in Kenia, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé was warned and prepared to report all the instructions.'
The world's council of the Republican Presidency candidates
Among Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry reappraises in Simplicitization and Inconsistence about China, Iraq and Israel's assistance.
Can a criticized America have a complex world with simply to say: can you lead to an idea?
If you listen to the Republican Presidency candidates so, the electioners could almost be impressed.
Since some days, the Middle Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry and their co-advisors have been reaffirmed again, and their statements on the Authen policy, traditionally republical strict.
About China, Iran and Israel's help - often not understood - slogans.
The name of the "Grand Old Party" in the middle of the course threatened the Chineses to quote the WTO and to respect the "producing manipulation" to be the subject in a United States that is cut by reducing all industrial sectors to Asia on the most largest.
It's funny when this is to impliciate the introduction of a trade war, he said.
John Huntsman, former messangers in China under Obama and the only candidate who seemed to have a extraordinary vision of the Authen policy, has disrupted the air about his emotions.
He had called to a handful but constructive conversation interchange with Peking (e.g. the current standing of Obamas).
But Huntsman will not be heared because he is shocking in the depths of the opinions.
Reagan's Eben Image
Romney had also promised military strikes against Iran, if the sanctions were to stop the nuclear programme.
"If I'd be chosen, I'll command Iran's maintenance," he was sweet.
"When Obama re-selected, they get the bomb."
At the same time, he promised Israel's strengthened military assistance and claimed Obama to remain guilty of this partner against commitments.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second plated candidate, provides an enormous knowledge of awareness to look.
Soon he called on to give the Chinese military threat to contract because Peking's attempt to develop a nuclear weapons' - and it seemed to allow the fact that China is already in the possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
The Technical Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military swords against Iran, urges him to be ready to take the American Army in Mexico against drug cards.
The retreat understood by Obama 2009 on torture against murmal terrorists was also encouraged by Cain, Perry and the candidation Michele Bachmann.
It's far away from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, one of the authen political weights.
The present presidency counterparts, Reagan also had simple ideas and also wins the cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and water had to be given in his wine, which was the subject of antiterror.
They take the right to the lack of his native conversation with Iran, the special decline of his "Jungs" from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which also introduced him the call of weakness.
However, this appeal is not very unreasonable.
The population is higher than the positive balance of the national security of Obama, which has been cut off by bin Laden.
Since Iraq, it is in the face of military interventions that lead to smiling.
And Obama is more surprised by arguing that America should be rebuilt in economically to spend his leading position to a new life.
North Stream, New Tower to Russian Gas in Europe
The North Stream Gasfer Guide, which runs on the east side of the East Sea and connects the Western Europe directly to Russia, was set into operation.
It should provide gas for equivalent to 30 million households.
The Russian Gasprom Gazprom wanted to act on this event with glance and Gloria.
Over 500 loaded guests, including four state and government heads, have the last Sunday at the East Sea Coast under the Orchester Railway and the involvement of the new gas supply North Stream, which is directly connected to Russia and Germany under the sea level.
The German Officer Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medwedew, French Prime Minister Francois Filon, and his official Mark Rutte from the Netherlands, symbolically turned into the tax of the Ventil, which transports the Russian gas into the Western European network.
With the new gas management, 27.5 billion additional Russian gass are to be delivered to the Sankt Petersburg area with Mecklenburg pools in Western Europe.
A second strip that allows a total delivery of 55 billion cubikmeters of gas, the equivalent of the total consumption of French, is to be completed at the end of 2012.
And you can already touch the eventivity of the construction of a third leadership on single lines.
For Gazprom, the right-time and point-to-point completion of this huge building is a victory.
The project was strongly struggled in Poland and the Baltic States.
Indeed, the North Stream Pipeline will allow direct gas delivery to Germany, with the avoidance of any transactions by third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on landway.
For this reason, these two countries lose a few of their powers: it will now be more difficult to exercise pressure on Russia by threatening the access to Western European markets.
Warschau, which was the most strongest involved in the debate, was not back to compare the North Stream Pipeline with a "new German-Soviet Pact" in connection with the university between Hitler and Stalin in 1939.
This means that the topic is politically sensitive.
Western Europe has gained a higher supply security through the promotion of this Russian project.
However, this is about the cost of reintegration of European energy, since the project has struck a break between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has been finished in a few years to implement its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, western countries that demonstrate strong gas consumption and their gas conditions to neighbour.
"This gas management is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way", confirmed François Fillon in the involvement of gas supply by showing how important gas contracts are also from political and economic sides.
All this declares the width laugh of the many gasprom managers represented in Lubmin in regard to gas supply.
The construction of this gas supply is also an extraordinary technology.
The underwater drive consists of a steel with a betonumation which it is intended to protect before ships cancers.
She's staying on the sea ground, in about 200 meters depth.
In its construction, the second world war had to be evacuated from mining fields.
"Ewa hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed." Jens Müller, speaker of the North Stream Society, accompanied.
Furthermore, strengthened measures for the protection of the Fauna and Flora were to be taken.
The drive is a long shoe of metal, hard like 242 eggs that is cut over all the length: nor by ventile, nor maintenance stations.
The Swedish projects had been provided before the Coast of Swedish, but the project responsiblees have taken a distance because the Swedish were poorly concerned to see a Russian State society as a permanent way to seize its costs.
"In the case of a havary, we shoot the gas through less than one minute," spent Jens Müller.
In the case of a skin, the gas that is located in the gas direction is deleted into the air.
However, this case is considered by the buildings only little likely, as Swiss has been estimated to be a ability of a lock per 100,000 years.
The public supervision of gases is ensured by a underwater robber which is controlled by a marine ship, as well as by a device circulated within the gas direction.
It has the form of a cigarre, mixing a metro of diameter, is introduced in the inside of the brake direction and continues to be moved through the gas pressure.
After three full days of the continued movement through the drive at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides exact information on possible deformations of the metal at its arrival.
The gas management was designed to operate for 50 years without having to be subjected to the smallest reparatory.
The gas circle is completely guaranteed by pressure.
This includes 200 bars at the access, 100 bars at the entrance site.
Five companies have joined their forces to carry out this project.
However, the management remains in the hand of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the share.
Furthermore, the German companies E. ON and BASF are attached to 15.5%, as well as the Netherlands gas and the French company group GDF Suez (e.g. to 9%).
These five companies have established a company community called North Stream, which has been employed with the construction and operation of the gas management.
She has her sit in Switzerland, where tax is particularly favorable.
Gazprom has prevented the whole capacity of gas transport, such as the extending twenty-year contract.
"Gazprom will be paid for the total capacity, even as the real transporting gas quantity is deleted," specified Jens Müller.
The financing of the gas management construction was 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The whole work costs should be at 7.4 billion euros for both primary guidelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment sum was 240 million.
The minority shareholders, however, are aware of recovering their funds, as the gas prom is only the risk of detention.
The gas guide is accompanied to a sand, with a kitchen controlled coast strike at Lubmin from the East Sea.
The 4.5 meters high Ventiles form the gas emission speeds.
Sensors Mete pressure, temperature and other identifications of the incompatible gas before it is transferred to the German gas guide.
Since Tuesday, this terminal is delivered with a million cubic meters of Russian gas per hour.
In full capacity, this would be 3 million cubits per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a market note book.
A Italian company called into life for about fifty years ago, Moleskine now wants to provide a new style to write.
It has a flair of abenteuer to be made with the writing in the appearance.
The Moleskine's notes book is easily recognisable, with its black, rectangular inband, his gummiband, the egg color pages, as it gets over time.
The Moleskine Notice book, however, has emerged in 1997.
The Italian company Mode, which has its seat in Milan, decided to bring a different design book on the market.
Maria Sebregondi, who was then expert of the company, is employed with the marketing of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an altered production technology, called Mole Skin (Maulwurfshut), which is called a treewollack, for example for shocking powders.
This type of notebook was very requested by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has left a old and almost forgotten object that took place in the 20th century as Ione preguardist artist", explained Mary Sebregondi, who is now more Marken responsibilities in mode.
Success will be involved.
Between 2006 and 2010, the sales increased by 26% and with a paragraph of 12,7 million pieces.
This is far away from the production of the first years where only 3.000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine occurs the Italian borders and is carried out in 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to provide a phantom picture of the buyer, as the notebook also engages students and experts.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitical, cultural and open-good customers.
The small, Italian company, which has been counting at 12 employees today, has more than 100 employees and has more than two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company leaves its notes in booking, on internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of the city centres, and understood to implement its identity.
"We are followed to the age of time and his new writing needs, although the e-mails are covered," Mary Sebregondi explained.
This cultural character is accompanied by the development of the Moleskine company: recently, the Marke launched an exhibition named "Detour (Umweg)" in the architects and artists of its own notes.
In August, the company also took a link to Leoparden patterns on the market on the film festival in Locarno.
Moleskine benefited from his success and this cultural age of time and understood to diversify its products: balls, terminal calendars, fills, computer holes... The brand covers the entire band width of articles.
Success that brings the Neider on the plan: In April 2006, Mode was purchased by the SG Capital Europe Fund, the Holy Syntegra Capital, and thus opened a new chapter in the history of the Moleskine company.
Why the unemployment rates remained on such high levels?
About 19% of the disabled persons are looking for a job.
Today the "15nd week of work for disabilities" begins.
In spite of a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled persons is still doubled as the average average value: 19% of the unemployment of the total population is 9%.
Intuitive?
"No, so Eric Blanchet emphasizes the Director-General of the Association Adapt, who directs the "What the work for Disabilities".
"The progress achieved within fifty years are significant."
"In time the unemployment rate was not doubled, but three times so high."
"There is still much to do."
However, it should be said that for disabled unemployment, many obstacles continue to continue before they get a job.
The elders are often known: 37% are older than 50 years (17% in average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them have no abstract and only 10,000 disabled students among the 2,3 million students with higher education.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very wide: 53% in persons with disabilities against 38% in total.
In short, there are so many criteria that struggle a renewed labour, and which are the "concerning of the problem", so Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, a association that has helped enterprises to purchase disadvantaged contractors in 1992.
So much to the sweet brems.
Keep the unused speaking, the spiritkeepings, which are certain, but slowly continued.
A study carried out in April by the IMS Interpreter for the Journal La City, which the questionned managers have "a weak knowledge level relating to the disabled person", which "transpresented" is "for persons in role, psychological or intellectual minority".
The result is that private enterprises with more than 20 employees have a wide way to achieve the goal of 6% retailed purchase which was set out in a 1987 law.
These last numbers, from 2008, refer to a quota of 2,6%.
"We are now at 3%", reports Peter Blanc, Director-General of Agefiph, the organization which is employed, to make contributions from companies who mislead this law.
The proof: The number of "paymenters" enterprises have also reduced the amount of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, and the payment rate of EUR 59.000 to 46.000 (and from 606 to 480 million).
"The law of 2005, which provides contributions to increases, creates a strong pressure on the companies, explained Peter Blanc."
"But this improvement also expresses a real knowledge, especially in the largest sectors."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the employees between 20 and 49 employees are undertaken, but 82% of employees with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What for a luck"
Before they were ready to offer the "Blue Services (20:45), Eden Hazard and George's Leekens did not eliminate their joy that they had brought their friendship game.
It would be too far to say that it had given a secret understanding between them, but the image speaks symbolic bands.
Site on the side of the Viewer Podium of the city of France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard had been able to smell well and please peace.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his attackers against Turkey, the Belgian national trainer had nothing regarding his person.
"I'm very satisfied with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to look forward," firms the shooting lens on his side.
What is the contrast between his display in club and national elf," it is a unit that justifys everything."
"In Lille, I am about the whole year that is not the case in Belgium."
"I'm time to go to the start."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, launched freeday against Romania in terms of the Matths against France, to finally frozen."
However, without leave the note of the "comfort".
The French Nationality has been fired since the age of seven years, and his overwhelming field trails took place between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This helps forced to strengthen the "unique" characters of this engagement.
Soviel in advance: "Mathieu (Debooky), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there."
"We've just walked through the way."
"Do they have to play, it means great luck."
Leekens read with goodness "Stolz".
"The Holiness, a Galamatch."
"Stolz" also turns - in its property as "Neighbouring" - to confirm that France" has become a very high level, and that is little more than one year after Knysna's trauma.
"The Laurent Blanc has done good work", he encouraged.
Although Belgium is lacking in the next European mastership, the technician looks very well to share the aircraft with the blue (the French national elf) ... and the direction of Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgian comes out, so he stressed.
"We are in planning a thing, the players are ambitioned, they are hungry."
"They will notify it at the previous games." The game is involved with France.
Portugal very confidence
The português office of Paul Bento, with great optimism, looks at the retreat against Bosnia (22:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the play, two men were missing the faculty.
"In the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy mansion and especially a happy country."
Paul Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no smallest flow of doubt that "La Selectciao", his national elf for which he is responsible for the European Meeting since September 2010, will be qualified for the 2012 Meeting.
In fact, Portugal means only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there's a mask to play, and to stop an enemy, that's Bosnian.
In view of the game (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the desires have not yet fallen.
Portugal dominated the party over a hour clearly, but the manage was not able to press the so important steel that had taken the pressure of her.
"This is a good result, however, that causes a certain risk, since we have not achieved a foreigner."
However, at home, in their slightly shocking city de la la Luz in Lisbon, the portugues are convinced to spend before a publishing, which should also be on the game, even if the party has been announced as "serely knapp", said the optimistic but clear Bento.
"We expected a very nice match, however, are perfectly convinced that the overhand can win", explained the português trainer of 42 years.
"We still have a 50% opportunity to be involved in the Europe Meeting 2012," however, the followers of Carlos Queiroz.
The unresolved decision on Friday in Bosnia forced the portuguese to achieve and win a gate.
An indecision can be sufficient to the bosniers who also need a gate.
"This is a good result, however, that gives a certain risk, since we have not achieved a foreigner," regrets Bento.
"We will be present against a manity that has high technical qualitys and has many individual qualitys," he added.
As already in Zenica, portugugies had planned to run the maximum pressure on the bosnier at the beginning to "no time to think."
A good idea, under the condition that it is implemented this time.
