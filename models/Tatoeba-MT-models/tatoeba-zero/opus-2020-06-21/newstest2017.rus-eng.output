Should it move in sanitary if there is no health problems?
Our expert is the principal doctor of Sanatoria Olga Godsh.
And if a healthy person is just out of work, should he go into the sanitary?
There's no need to be a santor-court relief for treatment, but also for prevention of diseases.
In terms of sanitation, humans may check the status of their body and receive the recommendation of the doctor how to live in order to avoid his health.
Such recommendations will not be removed.
"Currently turned out of work" is the important sign of organisms, and it should not be disappointed.
Standing stress, mental and physical reintegration may lead to depressions and symptoms of chronicness.
The stress is 90% of those coming.
It is mostly dedicated to people from large cities from 45 to 55 years of age.
So it's better not to make it difficult and to make yourself relaxed at time.
Studies show that 98 per cent of people are decreasing their biological age during sanatorium residues.
The modern sanctions propose a comfortable relaxation for the whole family.
So if you want to leave with your children, you don't have to leave with them.

Furthermore, in sanatories, the child club works with animators where children can visit game practices, different class masters.
Some sanatories have opened their doors even for the guests, provide the necessary conditions for the breakfast and provide experienced ring services.
The large winter, continuous flight, the sundays in the year (over 300) are a good condition for the round-season retreat of the Kaboutian Mineral Wade smokes.
And then the body needs relaxation not only in the summer.

Long-polytic snakes in the heat are carried out with a slipper so that the lower part of the steel (25-40 cm) liver on the ground is slowed by the heat of the water and the grain of the Zircon, which is 5-7 cm of the composite.
It is not difficult to extend the fruit of the cavich: store old letters, smell the hot water and integrated grain, swallow the fruit grain under the cup.
In order to protect the night colds, install the shooting box with the shooting material.
You'll keep open on the day of the plant, and close the sun after the end.

What indicates that Russia comes from the crisis?
Economists have seen the sign of Russia's exit from the most permanent recession in the last twenty-first years.
As noted by the requested Bloomberg Analytics Agency, the RFB demonstrates a positive dynamic - in the second quarter of GDP slowed to 0.8 per cent in the annual expression.
This indicator is minimum since the beginning of 2015.
According to the last data, Russian economy in the second quarter was decreased to 0.6 per cent.
The stabilisation of the situation has also recently been declared by the Centre and the Middle Eastern Development.
Previous growth.
According to the CIA experts, the recession in Russian economy remained in the past.
"The Russian Index evaluation states that recession remained behind and the advanced growth of economic growth," says the Russian Bank Bulletin "What's talking about trends".
The module assessment of GDP for the current quarter of regulators increased to 0.4 per cent, the fourth quarter is 0.5 per cent.
As noted by the representative of the Minoon Development, during the second quarter of GDP RF was stopped in the second quarter, 0.2 per cent.
In the second quarter of the seasonal cleaning rate of GDP was 0.2 per cent to the previous quarter.
However, during the quarter decline, it was 0.2 per cent in April, and in May and June the change of GDP was 0-0.15," quotes the representative of MED RIA of the News.
The delay of the Russian economy during the last five quarters shows that "his long."
Among other marketmarks that are marked on national economy, Bloomberg calls for an increase in electricity demand and iron transportation in business.
If adjustment to that year is high, it is understanding that the dynamic can be more than 1 per cent of electricity consumption in a further working day.
Add to this lower average year temperature in the first quarter.
The following argument is the growth of shipments, but it is difficult to get exact data, and 0.5 per cent of the half-year amount can also be explained,” explains Kirill Jacobonko from AROR BROCER.
Others, however, are more obvious signs of the stabilisation of the Russian economy.
For example, the reduction of price pressure.
The consumer price index was 7.2 per cent compared to 15.6 per cent in the same month.
Moreover, the last two weeks of Rosestat fixes deflation.
The prices in Russia have been decreased in the first five years.
If you look at the dynasm of the rubber, which has shown strong collapses at the beginning of the year, the results of August from the beginning of the year increased to 12 per cent.
It is also one of the signs of recovery for which indicators should be taken from the real economy sector,” emphasized Jacob.
In addition, from April to April, industrial production increases are observed.
In June, the rate increased by 1.7 per cent.
In January 2016, the slow rate of slow trafficking is from -32.8 per cent in May 2016 to -20.7 per cent in May.
The positive dynamic also demonstrates the situation in the labour market, where unemployment levels reduced to 5,4 per cent.
He was only in September 2015 (5.2%).
Despite the well-being situation in the labour market, the question of the real income of the population is to remain better.
In the annual expression, the indicator is decreased to 4.8 per cent.
This factor may cause economic recovery, since household costs have a small contribution to GDP.
Normally, their share is 50 per cent in the economy structure.
In addition to a low consumer activity, the Russian Bank's huge policy can also be called as a risk factor for economic growth.
The regulator keeps the rate of 10.5 per cent, which is not the most real sector.
It is also an inevitably high level of investment that maintains industrial capacity development.
However, in general, it can be suggested that the RF economy decline to -0.5 per cent against -3.7 per cent in 2015,” said the GC Forex Club Irina Rhova.
The naturalization process of sports launched recently in Russian football and excellently living in winter species in Olimpía in Soshia until it is active in summer sports.
If the Olympic Games in Rio for Russia are speaking for the former foreigner, most of the cases are the births of the former Soviet Union Republic.
In Rio de Janeiro, we can observe a relative process - a sufficient number of Russians speak under the flags of other States.
In each case, the change of citizenship is different.

The girl had no choice.
There she decided to go on the stages of her old sister -- to take a easy atletic.
Lisa has chosen six pieces with her sister.
Don't stop her in Russia, if it wouldn't be able to shoot with the throne, Elena Isnbaev.

Soon she had represented her country at the Olympic Games in London in 2012.

After two years before that, she decided to win the blonde meal of the Olympic Games.

It's probably all together and explains the peaceful situation in Moscow.
Are all engaged in the will of regional authorities?

Can Erdogan reject friendship with the EU and the United States?
The President of Turkey Rejep Tyip Erdogan issued the U.S. 67, offering a choice between Turkey and Fethullah Gulen, Islamic preacher accused to the organization of public transfer.
In this regard, he declared before his partners in Ankara.
Erdogan called for the Americans to reject the support of the “terrorist organization of the phetopulists”.
This is not the first statement from Turkey, in which the United States call for a change in their position.
Experts believe that Turkey's relations with the West continues to grow and may try to change the authority in the country.
"The years or later, America will choose between Turkey and the FETO " , a terrorist organization of fethurulists."
Like the organizing FETO changing, or the democratic Turkey.
She must do this choice," quotes the Anatolian Task Force of Training Erdogoan, who was in the midday night in Ankara.
The President of Turkey was typically, but he had already needed the United States to comply with the requirement that they had been addressed in the first time after the murder.
Remember, on 16 July, that the Turkish Army's high-employed representatives in Turkey had been tried to pursue the legitimate authority in the country, as well as to pursue the head of the State.
However, after the treatment of the population, the murder was sent, and his organizations and participants were arrested.
A total of 80,000 people were shocked under suspicious suspicious suspicious suspicion, in a series of other military teachers and scientists.
According to Reaper Erdogan, their employer had Fethulls Gulen, who lived in the United States State.
The Erdogans also allowed the interference and directly americans to be interfered.
The United States checked all the complaints in his address, refused to deliver Gulena and recommended to change the ton.
The last statement of the representatives of Gossip to this account was held at the time of Erdogan’s visit in San Petersburg at the last Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the President of Turkey, which is opposed to him and also submits the requirements to others of their western partners.
"Ankara stops to comply with its commitments under the migration agreement with the European Union if Brussels did not take the date of the cancellation of visa limits for Turkish citizens," said on 9 August, Minister of Turkey on the affairs of the EU Omer Chelico.
In his words, the introduction of Ankara changes in the anti-terrorism law, as the EU requires, will threaten Europe's own security.
Note that 1 August, the Vice-Chairperson Germany Zigmar Gabriel needed to stop the load of Europe’s promises to open the border for migrants to facilitate the visa regime from the EU.
His words were answered to the corresponding statement of the head of the MID Turchia Mevolta Chauschhol.
Another promulgation statement of Chauschlol made in the past, allowing Turkey to go out of NATO.
The Turkish MID head did not exclude that the country would consider the possibility of retirement from the alien if it was not expected to meet it.
The decision to enhance cooperation with Russia in the defence field is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries who cooperate with foreign States in the defence area - import missiles," said Chauschhol to the Anadolu Agency.
In his words, Turkey must now establish its own defence system based on its technologies and cooperate with other countries.
"Turkey has still tried to cooperate with NATO countries, but the results were not satisfied, and we were looking for others," said the Minister.
Experts believe that this is all about the serious differences of Turkey with the West and the transition of the country to the East.
The Chief of the International Political Expert Institute of Eugenia Minchenko believes that Reaga Erdogan is now leading to its game and cannot go to a huge conflict with the West.
He has very much linked to the West and to the point of business, and with the view of the military (Turkey is a member of NATO), so I think that Erdogan will try to balance with the western relationships.
Although, of course, the Americans would be better to see the full obedience of this post," Iaf.ru expert explained.
In his words, it is not excluded that after the statements of the Turkish leader (and the unpaymented compensation of the EU, on the demands of unvisual space with Europe and the extradition of Guinea from the United States) will be granted to it.
"The Regiment of Erdogan is confronted with the deterioration of relationships and with America, and with the European Union, which they will give it just on humanitarian matters, on the dictators of the country's management methods, and so further", believes Minchenko.
Head of the Centre of Political Informations Alexy Mushin allows the President of Turkey to change its views in Russia as it would be possible.
Eight months ago, Erdogan was a extremely serious position towards Russia, and in all ways, he searched for the well-being in the West.
At least a small time, the situation was changed to the contradiction.
Garanties that after some time the President of Turkey did not change its priorities again.
I think Erdogan's in the period of brilliant diplomacy.
He will try to get the maximum benefit for himself,” believe Moshin.
He believes that the main task for the President of Turkey is to maintain the political authority in the country today, and that the need for Russia and the partnerships with the Putín Volunteer to stop supporting the United States.
Turkey and the United States need to control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
The agreement with Turkey will therefore be achieved," is the expert.
Another point of view is the head of the Asian Centre and the Middle East Anna Glasov.
Now the relations between Turkey and the EU and the United States are sufficiently pressed, and it is in the first way related to the internal policy carried out by Erdogan.
I think that this crisis will be decreased, and in the context of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to reload policies as well as in the Middle East and in Russia.
Nevertheless, the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, states that they are willing to change their position on the whole issue of Syria, resolved with Israel, is an active political partnership with Iran,” explained AiF.ru Glozavu, which allows that the next step of Argentine be normalized with Egypt.
According to her, the policy now carried out by Erdogan is the return to the course of an external policy concept which follows Turkey before the Arab Revolutions.
"In that case, in the positions " no problem with neighbouring " Turkey began to develop its relationship with the Middle East and Asian region.
There have now been very lucky visits from President of Turkey in Russia and Africa.
Therefore, this external policy vector will develop and contribute to the strengthening of Turkey ' s positions in both regional and international airlines," is an expert.
Globe believes that the return of Turkey to the previous relations with the EU will be incredibly complicated, and now the question is whether the EU will begin to respond evilly to Turkey, which may be to the opening of borders for migrants and to create the same serious problems for Europe.
Advertising the youngest doctors: Inviting to new collective protests
The representatives of the young doctors requested the profession to authorize new collective protests in their controversy on the new working treaty.
The Committee of the British Medical Association (JDC) is intended to request its full advisory to support more collective protests since the beginning of September.
JDC said that the Ministers could not respond to the labour treaty.
The young doctors and medical students in July voted for the cancellation of the Labour Treaty agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58 per cent of its members who participated in the secret vote.
In a letter to the members published in Twitter on Friday night, President JDC Elen McKort said that the Government continued to “beat” about the problems that she said to have brought to the rejection of the working treaty.
She said: "In view of the circumstance, the JDC leader proclaimed for rejecting the proposed new working treaty in full, and called for official negotiations on all your matters."
In response to the silence of the Government of JDC, he has requested an official request to the Council for the external meeting of the BMA in order to adopt the unexpected programme for collective protests, starting from September early.
The controversial resulted that young doctors had participated in six income this year, including the first general profits in the history of the State Health Service.
The leader of the youngest doctors of BMA, Dr. Joan Malavan, left after voted on the cancellation of agreed conditions of the working treaty, recommended by the BMA.
He said to BMA members that the treatment was good that should be adopted during the meetings in the prevention of votes of 54.000 young doctors and medical students.
After voted by the Minister of Health, Jeremy Hunt said that this working treaty would be used for medical workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: "Aliens wicked"?
It was a jacket that finished the crisis.
The Russian leaders and Turkey met on Tuesday to make their hands and proclaim the official end of the eighth-year-old war and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomed his Turkish colleague in the shipping hall in San Petersburg, I have a sustained impression that Ankara wants to be more reconciliated.
It was the leader, yeah.
But Mr. Putin's smile looked awkward, and if he had removed warmly even according to his own detention standards.
Reaper Tyip Erdogan, in contrast to this, has often spoken about his "good friend" five times, according to one report.
I lost my account.
He also promised that the relationship with Russia would return not only to their credibility level, but even above.
On the next day, a newspaper described the action of Mr. Erdogoan as if nothing wrong would never happen.
I think his enthusiasm was back.
But the shock of Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader did not forget anything.
In fact, it was the first reason for the crisis that he mentioned in the entry comments: Turkey has destroyed the Russian destroyer on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction at this time was an instinct.
Mr. Putin was disappointed by a angry tired by accusing Ankara to shoot Moscow.
The tribulation was even more stronger than the predicted friend.
Resurrection of real trust will be difficult, probably not possible.
The Russian public view has also changed since November.
During the months, controlled media States have conducted an overwhelming, accurate invasion against Ankara.
It was immediately shown that the tourists should be considered guilty in all.
The most serious accused of the representatives of the Supreme Leader was that the family of Mr. Ergogan had been engaged in the illicit trade of oil from the Syrian region controlled by the Islamic State.
He denied this decisively.
But in San Petersburg, it was an official signal that was time to move forward.
At the end, the meeting was only because Mr. Putin received an apologic for President Adgogane.
Russia could pretend to win its species.
For Ankara, the declaration of transgression is clear.
First, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get, after he was almost declined from his stay in the last month when he tried to turn.
The terror attacks against Turkey were clearly shocked by it.
There is also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions shocked strongly — especially the prohibition of shock fleet, which generally brings millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number was almost 90 per cent.
With regard to Russia, the tourists and the chair company here, of course, feel comfortable when the fleet will finally be restored.
They put the end of the season on the Mediterranean.
And even this week, the public television predicted more decreased fruit and fruit than the Turkish import of agricultural products would be allowed again.
"Turists there, fellow guests back here," stated in the Wednesday newspaper.
But the visit also had a further political value for Moscow.
Ankara's badness in the West because it is considered a weak answer to the attempt to turn.
Add to this the long-term injury of the EU and the step of Mr. Putin, which is trying to use the weakness and to gradually destroy the Turkish connections with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, wins bonus balls with Ankara for calling for support of the elected authorities after the attempt of public transfer.
You mean, this is the date for Moscow, who has its own deeply depressed fear of the change of the regime.
So, the summit in this swimming park on the sea coast allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine that one analysis describes me as "the wicked": two countries who feel themselves rejected and degraded in the West are united by the forces.
However, despite public reconciliation, these two remains significant.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently been a peace-maker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite parties.
It may be said for himself that after almost three hours of the initial negotiations, when two Presidents gave the press conference, they did not even touch this topic.
The President of Turkey was incredibly avoided the answer to the question of their differences while Mr. Putin intended to focus on them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find the general language in Syria.
But after months of open enemy, and taking into account the full possibility of a disaster when the NATO member of Turkey has slaughtered the Russian reactor, it is clearly better that two leaders speak at least again.
The Kingdom Bank will disappear for customers outside Skotlands
Brad RBS must be recorded to the role of the bank office, according to the executive director of the bank.
The Kingdom Bank will disappear for customers outside the Skotlands.
Ross McEvan told BBC that the RBS Brand was linked to global bank ammunition.
Bank left them since he almost moved eight years ago and had to save him.
In that period, the burden strategy used RBS to protect other consumer credit burdens.
He was supported by millions of funds of Pansor International Assistance, from the Cub of six nations to the Champion of Wilbldon Andy Murrey.
But now it was decided that it would be appropriate to allow more national burdens to go to the first plan.
The Kingdom Bank will be used with the Skotlands customers, but it will not be started.
In England and Walse, all references to RBS, including the main office and the fund, will be changed to NatWest.
Brand Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller shippings for private persons who have more influence — Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. MacEvan was interviewed during the tour of customers and staff in Invernessshire.
He said BBC Skotland: "Brand RBS will finally become our investment burden and our staff, because we are now more to be the bank of burden."
As the bank itself became a global burden, RBS became a global burden.
I now say that we don't have global efforts, we have local efforts.
Each of these burdens will represent something different in its population groups, and our staff will work with customers under these burdens.
RBS had already stated that it would not be to continue its remarkable support of the six nations ' s Cube, and he encourages profiles of different burdens in the launching of sport.
"It's a suitable time for us to move the burning bank, as (we asked us) as we focus on the improvement of the customer bank?" said the Executive Director.
It would be very cynician three years ago if we would say that we're going to be a wonderful bank for customers and close all these burdens.
But with the work we've done, focusing on the needs of customers, not on our own, I think you're seeing a lot of changes.
We can return these burdens, so I think it's the right time.
Frankie Dectors reached 3000 winners in New York to Prist
The doctors are shumping shampany after the double in Newmarket brings it to 3000 wins
The Jacques Frankie Dettory won its 3000-year British victory in New York in Friday.
He came to this extraordinary note using his second winner night on his home trail - to the Priszia, trained by John Gosdan.
The 45-year-old Italian is a sixth shock that reached this extraordinary note in the shoes.
He should be following Sir Gordon Richards, Dougom Smith, Lester Piggot, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-class champion of the heavy David, who previously wins in Ghayyar, said, "This is something special."
I'm very excited because my family's here too.
I'm very glad that this happened in New York, so I've been here 30 years ago.
This isn't a great light event, not Royal Ascot, it's a normal Tuesday night of 20,000 people.
I'm free of business and very unprotected.
The doctors accept approximation when they bring the provision after the victory
Two yarns reached such a note in boxes with obstacles: the champion of Richard Johnson and the top of the 20-fold champion Sir Antony McKy, who had more than 4300 wins for the recursion carriage.
Lester Piggot, Nine Dedby winner, 4493 winners in the carriage
Franky is one of the best jokes in modern times and is unexpectedly that he reached the note that so few of them reached.
He's a style and strong, but it's his tactical shoes different from others in the wedding room.
He was a magnificent representative for scatchs, his enthusiasm and charism in the sports years.
I told Franky a few weeks ago to Eps, he would have brought 6000 winners if it wasn't just a shock of weekends and big shocks!
And if serious, Franky has brought winners in Britain a large part of the 30 years, which is good to see.
He's a powerful person that's good for the British scacks, but moreover, he's an incredible shock.
Franky Dectory replied this extraordinary note of the company's voluntary shock with the horse
From the finishing finish to the pleasant shoes, Frankie Dettore is a symbol of British shoes for two decades.
It was fleet and fall.
Many winners of large scannings, including his famous " Great Seed" in Ascot in 1996, also survived aviation catastrophus and lost disabled because of the end.
Three years ago, he first faced difficulties when he returned after the six-month discharge, but showed the great will to leave the skeptic calls and return to the form.
And maybe he did not end at any time — the doctors before said that he would continue to continue to participate in the conspiration at least until the age of 50.
Putin is a head of the Sergey Ivan
The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, unexpectedly released his head of the Sergey Ivana Administration.
Ivan was part of the confidence neighborhood of Putin for many years.
This 63-year-old was now appointed by the representative of the Environment and Transport matter.
The Declaration from Kremela claims that Putin " had decided to release Ivan from his duties of the head of the Russian president " but did not call the reason.
Mr. Ivanwa, Vice-President, since 2012, Anton Weino, was appointed.
Mr. Vino, 44, former diploma.
He finished the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (IMO) in Estonia Talline in 1972 and served in the U.S. Embassy.
Afterwards he was the head of the President's protocol of the Government and the Government's instrument, reports on the Web site of Kremell (Russian).
In the appointment, he said, "Thank you for your trust."
I think the most important task of the Administration is to support your activities as heads of States in order to develop legislation and control on how your instructions are implemented.
Putin reported a Russian telechannel on Friday that Ivan asked him to release it from this post and recommend Vino to replace it.
Does the Sounds Remember?
That's the step that turned Moscow back.
Sergei Ivana was one of the closest partners of Vulmier Putin and served as well as the Council Security Service, the CB.
He was one of the most powerful people in the country as head of the administration.
At the meeting with President Pututius, who had shown on public television, both men said that the head of the Administration had gone on their own desire.
However, despite the smile of the cameras, it was little to be convinced here — especially now, directly before the parliamentary elections.
So that's the unexpected consequences of any struggle for authority?
Not until anyone knows it.
However, the official statement is that a person who had ever acted as a potential President had immediately wanted to manage the Russian environmental policy was met with a great skepticism.
In the comments of Pauline, quoted on the website of Kremella, I said: "This is the truth, at the beginning of 2012, I requested you to trust me in this very complicated position, even the problem, for four years.
Well, I was the head of the President's 4 years and eight months.
Ivan entered the position in December 2011.
Before he worked as Vice-Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and the former member of the State Security Service of the CBB, as well as Mr. Putin.
At the end of the 1990s, when Putin was the head of the Federal Security Service (FBI), which had been changed by the CBB, Ivan was appointed by its Vice-Chairman.
When Putin arrived to the authority, he called Ivan, including five people whom he had more confidence.
Sometimes Ivan was considered to be the President of Russia after the second time of Putin, as the third time for Putin would oppose the Constitution.
However, this post took another close partner of Putin, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became the Prime Minister before returning to the presidency only three and half years later.
The star's "Send as a criminal" series Thomas Gibson is released after the dragon with the producer.
Gibson was part of the show breakfast in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce series, have announced its release in a joint declaration.
Gibson, who played the Special Agency Aaron Hotcher, was sorry on Thursday before he was declared that he was dismissed.
There was a creative difference in food and divorce in views.
I'm sorry that it happened," he said in his statement.
Detailed information about how Gibson's personal will be extracted from the show that is expected to follow the FBI agents' teams later, according to the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios statements.
The 54-year-old actor, who had played the main role in the Darma and Greece network, was in the show of the first season in 2005.
"I love "I'm as a criminal" and I contributed to my heart and soul in him for the last twelve years," said Gibson in his statement published on Friday.
I hoped to be present before the end, but that's not possible now.
I would just like to thank the scenarios, producers, actors, our great team, and, most importantly, the best worshipers of whom the show could only dream.
It is noted that the show returns to its 12th session on 28 September.
Note: Fishes were landed in the Banfa garden
A man from Banfa was helped to identify the fish that appeared in his garden in Banfe.

Quinsferry Crossing: The bridge is now connected to Fif
Draft at 1.35 billion feet must now be completed until 2017
Engineers connected the northern swimming pool and the Kinsferry Crossing Viraid, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fif.
It's the first of the four smuggles between the shoes of a half, which now goes to the finishing over all three shoes of the bridge.
The Fif's Bridge Section now is 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
There were 10,000 tons and 20,000 tonnes of beetons and 46 ten tens of the bridge.
The project for 1.35 billion feet must now be completed until 2017.
The Minister of Economy, China Brown, has visited the area today and was including the first who walked from the earth to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of Quinsferry Crossing.
We've all witnessed in engineering art in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of beetons were used only to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the shift between the vial and the bridge, it is a virtual operation using extremely accurate permissions for the collection.
In the total complexity of about 79 per cent of the whole bridge at the place now, for the last section, the beton shoes are reflected in Russia today, which means that it is totally ready to switch up on the bridge.
Michael Martin, director of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructor project, said, "The first smiling of each bridge project is always a significant season.
This exciting project represents the modern building art.
After installing the last section of the road floor and connecting it to the extensive Northern Pilote, we remained closed to the northern, or treated to the beach.
This was made by the shift of the northern approach to 700 miles south.
It was wide, and at the same time a very fine operation.
The massive because the visa of 222 meters long, weighs about 6000 tonnes and must be slowed up to a 3 per cent of the cycle.
It was popular because the permissions over which the team worked were small — just a few miles [3 millimeters] in each direction.
Happily, it's been very good.
Safety in Salive Moelfra: The three men were blessed to remain in the lives
Twelve men, "sweet to stay alive" after they leave from a fishing vessel in England.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station was at 13:20 on the British summer in Friday, after the team saw the occurrence in Salive Moelfra.
Three men from all the forces tried to reach the safe place while their ship continued to walk.
"We've seen their ships close to them and predicted the worst, " said the rule of Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Freely, when we went down to the water, the strong wind took him into the side of them," he added.
Two men were saved by a local fishing vessel, and the third man of 60 years of age was found a disabled and injured in the boat without a rescue.
All of them were taken up on the board of the beach rescue and put to the rescue station.
Johns said, "The three men elected in the water was glad that they lived and were completely harmful.
The ship engine had an accidental switch, but somehow he was shocked from a man who managed the ship when she was shocked.
Somebody cares of these guys today.
Pokemon Go, a decent holiday for health and happiness
To observe how the world changes.
The fact that adolescents and children do not go on the street to play, pretending to play their free time in the screen, was a complaint of many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go rejects people from wonderfulness and engages in some physical activity.
The time at the screen was markedly limited by television, then video graphics and recently smartphones.
It is so glad to see that technologies and activities on the street are not inter-excepting.
I, of course, mean the full involvement of Pokemon Go, an annexe based on the originally created video games in the 1990s (as a result of the generated series of multifilms, game cards and other responses).
As well as many other cultures, this has lost the relevance of a few years before the new game was available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
The start in other countries was then detained in connection with the mass reloading of the servers.
In the following days, Pokemon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In two words, Smartphone games are going to search for Pokemons that follow GPS and, being discovered, they may be 'food' (food on your phone) or 'Poymans'.
A generation played in the game, being younger, joined the full involvement, cutting out the looks for.
In the United States, the game has increased significantly the number of steps passed by a normal person daily.
Cardiograms, annex for Apple Watch, which follows 35,000 users, recently reported that in two days from the start of the game, the number of people, who were monitored every day, increased from 45 per cent to 53 per cent daily.
The company doesn't know who plays in Pokemon Go, it's just seeing the primary data of the level.
Many health campaigns that convinced people “in 30 minutes”, “shoot from wonder” and “speaking every day” have not found a call, because most of the health sentences are disappointed and expressed to people who seem unfortunate.
However, the importance of physics could not be assessed.
Those who are regularly trained reduce the opportunities of development in cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps adjusting weight, high arterial pressure, diabetes and long list of advantages, too long to bring here.
But Pokemon Go's worthy is that she puts people on the street to do what they love.
Thus, there are three basis for health: movement, fresh air, sunlight and joy.
Some people even bring new friends to their guests.
Of course, there are smells that are looking for what to be grateful.
Yeah, somebody can shoot on the door.
Well, what?
There's a break.
Despite the annexes for smartphones, such as Fitbit could and before follow our physical activity, they did not give us a matter of employment as this game was given.
The news will come, and the use will be decreased with time.
However, because of success, Pokemon has become more games that will combine applications and virtual reality with physical activity in a real world by helping many people to be more active, well-being and healthy.

Simon Bailz wins the gold of the absolute primary in the women's genius
Forget the pressure.
Forget the shoot.
Simone Bails is unlawful for all this.
Dynamic on the opposite shock.
It's a lie.
He's on the floor.
It's a great world.
And now, finally, the Olympic Champion.
The 19-year-old American hymnist attracted the title of the Champion on the absolute prevention, placed with the rest of the world to a convincing demonstration under the adjusted Olympic attention.
Her general ball 62.198 was sufficiently removed from the silver meal and companions by the Final Peterka team, Eli Raisman and the Russian Brons Melliha of Ali Mustafin.
Bylez from the United States speaks on the hymnistical blue during the finance of a women ' s absolute initiality for artistic geninatics in the 2016 Latvia Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Bylese became the fourth part of a American woman who wins the title of the absolute primary and the fifth, strengthening its reputation as the best of her generation and, perhaps, if there was.
She was shocked when she showed the final ball and her long trip to that moment.
The achievement of this results in the same leverage that is exclusively rare, such as Michael Felps, who highlighted their types of sports to new heights:
Byleth has been the last three years, housed in his form of sport, winning 15 measles of the world champion - including 10 gold - with such an exciting programs in their grace of labour and accuracy that Mary Lu Retton was the greatest genius that I ever saw.
One last test was expected in Brazil, not so much between the Baylz and the rest of the area, as many between it and the load of higher expectations.
Any less than returning to the house of your family in Spring, Texas, with the honour of gold meal, would be considered as an injustified expectation.
Simon Bailz from the United States, left and left, and Eli Raisman, after winning gold and silver, respectively in the finish of the identity woman ' s absolute premium on artistics in the Late Olympic Games in Rio-De-Janero, Brazil, fourth, August 2016, in Rio-De-Janero, Brazil.
Bylese paid the first gold on Thursday, which became a beautiful final scope for the private celebration of the National Collection Coordinator of Marta Caroli.
While Birds insisted that she had never observed in the future during his long path toward the top, it was not exactly true.
part of her voluntary training program, including its company, was established to the Latin American music, which would be just as a house on the street directly outside the Olympic Arren Rio.
It's not a match.
The girl, who was daughter of her grandmother and grandmother, who began to walk with a child and opened the mother of Amy Burman’s train during the visit to the hall where Burman was trainer, became forced.
She has not played any of the absolute initializations since the summer of 2013, the drought that should continue as long as the Bayles wants.
Despite the small advantages received by Mustafin by two turns, it was a world.
The giant and voluntary training, where Bailz protects the champion of the world, is located in the garden.
She returned from 15.433 to January and ended from 15.933 to field.
Raisman slowly shocked her until they were waiting for a financial account — a clean formality — and the lips appeared around a white and blue white snake for the beauty of the Bayles, when the idea that she had ever recorded in the album for extraction was implemented.
Raisman's statement was a small place for the four years ago when she shared the third place, but lost the Mustafian burn on the Tay-Break.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, which the Americans called the grandchildren, was a great advance.
She sent pools after her voluntary training, a return that sometimes seemed to be in question.
With regard to the Bayles, the 19-year-old twin has now been completely new:
Police: 3 victims of a series of murderers were shot during the hearing of music in the car
Two women and 12-year-old girls who died during the most deceased attack in the first series of murderers of Phynicos during the last decade sit in the car, talked and heard music when they were shot, according to the police reports published on Thursday.
Angela Roshel Layner, Stefani R. Elis and the daughter of Elise, Malia, were shot on 12 June when their car was equipped on the past.
The crimer has made about eight shots from the gun, standing with the passenger car, after which on another vehicle, is reported in the report.
The police claims that the three murder is not the result of the rape, since the drought has not received $2,900 of the adult victims or $2,900.
The representative of the police of Finicas, Sersan Jonathan Howard, said that the shooting was instructed by researchers to check whether he had not been linked to four previous attacks.
The total of seven people were killed and two other were blessed by nine attacks in two majorly Latin American regions within four months.
"This happens in the live of the area before the house," said Howard KPHO, the CBS branch, in the beginning of this month.
The suspected, as they believe, has been used by several vehicles, including the low Nissan end of the 1990s, the black BMW and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The followers refused to reveal evidence that the attacks were linked to the same murderer.
Elise, 33, was hospitalized with wounds and later ended.
Layner, 31 years old, and her daughter, Elis, Malia, died in place.
The Witnesses told the police that there was nothing uncomfortable that they sit in a parking car listening to music.
The authorities also publish the police report on the shooting, which was intended to be empty for half an hour before the third murder, and which, as they believe, was the case of a serious murderer.
The followers found a smoke and shooted a snake from the sit and the shoes of the motor reset.
Mother of a six-year-old child with microcephaly: "It's better."
As most of the children of six, Edmund Pixivat loves drinks, games, and of course her mother.
Unlike the majority of his overseers, Edmud's microcephary is the result of a genetic violation that his mother Elizabeth Pixvito had not known during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was: I can’t do that.
I can't do that.
I didn't sign it.
What isn't true, surely you're signing it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent said that Edmund may never know them and that he couldn't even survive.
Some doctors even invited to place it in a specialized treatment institution.
“ My first answer was, ‘I didn't think people do this yet, ’ explained Pixvito.
Edmund's walking through the shooting.
Edward wasn't sit and drunk until he did three, and he's not saying yet.
But he's slowly walking some stages.
He's walking with bilateral help and shooting on the bicycle.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and sisters.
Elizabeth shows the jacket that Edmund's planned for "Good, get me.
"We're teaching him to the wheat language," said Pixivato CBS News.
But not just a common language of wheat — she says that Edmund has developed his own legs.
Microcephaly may result in a number of different circumstances: genetics, such as Edmud, infections during pregnancy of virus such as core and Zica.
Symptoms and prognosis may be significantly different.
It's too early to talk about how it will be said about those who have been infiltrated by the Virus.
Pixically remembers the emotional losses because of the undetermined future.
I've always said what's going on?
What's going on?
And she doesn't know yet.
I really didn't ask for prognosis for the whole life, because I'm not waiting for someone really can tell me.
But Pixvito has a pleasant advice for the mother of the children with infant defects because of Zeca.
It's better.
You know everything will be better for you.
You'll love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, swimming servants of the cause of salvation work in Louisiana, Mississippi State
The powerful rain and wide rain in Louisiano had the Governor to declare the emergency situation in Friday, while even more aircrafts are expected to fall in the state by Saturday.
Many rivers in the south-east of Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi were out of the beaches and threatened to a wide range of aircraft after the extreme number of boats, reported the National Meteorological Service.
Gouvernant John Bell Edvards said that government officials are in a constant contact with local authorities and have already been given to the suffering income.
Mike Stille, representative of the Office of National Security and Preparation for emergency situations, stated that transport requests were made for high water, ships and ships.
Style said that only the Taddipaho came for tens of thousands of skins.
The danger of inducation remains in force before the Sabbath most of the south of Louisiana.
The meteodienst said in the statement that additional 3 to 5 seconds could be shocked on the area.
In the south of Alabame, the Defense in waiting for the invasion was active until Friday, as the rain continued to go to the Mobile area.
Rio Komit, close to Baton-Ruje and Amyt, close to Dean Springs, both in Louisiana, had to set up a prediction for the recursion of the switch level in the past weeks.
The synoptic Alek Crautman said that both rivers could shoot many houses in resident areas near Baton-Roja.
He also said that the induction of the Assencen coming was threatened because these rivers will slowly shoot into the Morpas Lake.
Rica Tikfo, the southern border of the Mississippi State in Liberia (Lucian State), reached the most registered levels at 9 p.m. on Friday morning.
Saviors have still cut people from Amyt and Wilkinson in the south-west of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his passing were among the saved early in Friday at Gloster.
Hansford, 62 years old, says that the waters of Bever-Cric, which are usually in more than 400 feet from his home, were fast up to night.
He said that another passenger, who lives close to him, warned him.
"We washed up, and the water continued to begin," Hansford said.
She reached my pool level.
His wife said Hansford was the biggest shooting she saw for 48 years that she lived here.
Hansford said he and all his members were disabilities, and he's the only one who can smile.
Hansford said that the savings officers had saved all three by means of the army loading and put them to the fire station in Gloster where they were hiding on Friday.
Krautman says that the introduction of the "beast is distributed" as the rain continues, noting that the responsibilities consider the evacuation order.
Krautman says that one observer around Livingston reported the fall of 13.75 dg rain from half night to Friday.
Krautman said that the flight was transferred by raining aircrafts from the middle.
The strong rain and swimming streets have brought work to the saving of people from the homes of Tandipahoa and the abolition of jobs in five school districts, declared the authority.
WWL, CBS officer, reports that Tanjipaho had reported about 200 houses.
The people were evacuated in two churches, but they are both shocked now.
The Chairman of Robbie Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven home animals in high water.
The hosts were opened in Amyt and Hammond City to accept those who were evacuated.
"They will have the opportunity to go home when the water starts back," he said.
In the town of Hammond, nearly two decades of streets were closed from high levels of water, and the fisheries were available to the people to hope that they would be removed from houses and undertakings.
"The last large invasion we had was in March," said the city manager Leycy Landrum.
This is on the way to become a similar event.
In the Mississippi district of Harrison, Leader of the Emergency Service Rupert Lays reported that the rainy was continuing to go to the Mexican Valley.
In his words, several houses were registered as buried on Thursday, but no one was registered in Friday.
Kate Thowson, Chef of Shopper Value Foods in Amyt, lives in this area 40 years.
"I saw the water in the places where I never saw her before," said Tawson, "and she's still walking on the ground."
Mahage Brown, 6, "Received Boats" remains in the lives after the bomb in Filadelphia
The police reports that a 6-year-old boy was shot in the Filadelphia, registering the second shooting in the city that week.
Grandma and her grandmother identified him for the CBS Filadelphia as Mahage Brown.
Her grandmother and her grandmother say that Brown received a number of firearms, including his legs, feet, hands and animals, but he was in awareness when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He was very enough, his little body was deleted by guns," said his grandfather Delors Melendez station.
I can't believe it.
The child is in a critical state of hospital and has survived several operations.
The family said that the station was expected that he would change.
He had to go to the first class to the local primary school.

One of the 29-year-old men is critical; other two victims were registered in a stability state, according to the CBS of the Philadelphia.
The station reports that the child was shooting at the front of the machine near the 29-year-old age.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police is investigating whether some of the prisoner men could be shooters.
The followers reported to the CBS of the Philadelphia that it seems to be a shock between several armed people.
The shields from half-automatic weapons inscribed by different poly-automatic exposures have made place of action.
It seems to have been a permanent battle.
There were strikes on the street, both sides of the throat.
The police station, Philadelphia Antony Dinardy, reported that there were several armed fighters, and they were actively involved in the shooting."
Many houses and machines in this area were also entered.
No arrests were held, and the police, according to the report, has trained video monitoring cameras.
Another six-year-old child, a girl, was inflicted in the hands of the Sunday, playing before her house in the West Oak Lane area.
She's resurrected, and the police's still looking for a suspect.
Why We need Simon, Gabe and Larry?
That's what I call a woman's Olimpine Collection for the Gymnastics of this year and for a number of reasons.
First, I was on every Latin Olympice since 1984, and the United States never were so homely.
And second: In this collection, there are three giants: Simon Bailz, Gaby Duoking and Larren Ernandes, who have already inspired so many white girls.
The collection, added by Eli Raisman, is a Jewish, and Madison Coshan, who is Catholic, makes all pride.
This collection looks like America finally.
This also strengthened the black and Latin American women’s presence on the top of the sport.
For the past four years, a women's giant number one was an African.
In the past year, Simon and Gaby were No1 and No2.
It's powerful.
At the past, the Olympic Gabi Duggol was unexpectedly expected by the Olympic Champion, and the America welcomed.
The world could now be an unbelievable witness of the three-class Championship of the World Simone Bayles, Dwuck and Larry Ernandes, who are unexpected, but yet virtuous genital training.
Simon became the fourth American race winning gold in women’s individual absolute primacy.
And a colleague on the assembly, Eli Ryan, paid gold.
We become witnesses of this kind of sport, but it doesn't look like this in the hymnastic sections throughout the country.
Simon, Gabe and Larry all have chosen the same way as Eli and Madison to form the Olimpiade Collection.
They're the "final fifth" because the next Olimpiade Collection on Gymnastics will have only four gymnastics in the team, and that's the last year of Marta Caroli's training.
But, in fact, the geninatic is a road sport, and the gymnastics are trained first in private gymnastic clubs supported by parents who pay the value of education, learning, travelling, forms, contributions to the rebuilding, guest payment of services (for trainers and their families) and the list continues.
Most of these gymnastic clubs are located in rich reward areas that may support this business.
These clubs are where the hymnists receive everything from their training, and this is a precious and long-term responsibility for the jinnist families.
Amy Burman, trainer Simone Bails, and Maggie Hanni, trainer Lory Ernandes, both trained their sports from the time they adopted for hymnastics.
We need to create more awareness on price and access to the communitys of the unexpected number of young girls inspired by Simona, Gabe and Larry.
I found my genius fund 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and disappointed hymnistical employment in Harlem for more than 15,000 city youths (in the main, black and Latin Americans) and have studied national and international champions.
In September, we will extend to Detroit (my family town) to provide a high quality genius of young people who will have the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Ginnastics develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as sustainability to enduring work, disciplinary and sustainability for mind.
This is a positive impact on good health, success in school and work throughout the life.
That is inspiration for thousands of girls to be giant, and that's beautiful.
Sporting is so important, especially for girls.
That's a great time now.
Thank you, Simon, Ellie, Larry, Gabby and Madison for this serious demonstration of the Genetic Force in the winning of command oil and for the motivation of so many different girls to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
The young doctors received a declaration of further profits after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The Ministers hoped to conclude the changes agreed to the amended treaty with the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 young doctors who participated in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt launched plans to introduce the treaty, said that the NHS was a "near land" and any delay of the delay would cause the damage to staff and patients.
The first young doctors have been transferred to a new treaty, which includes changes in work at night and weekly work to improve service at an emergency time.
Dr. Elen McCott, Chairman of the Committee of Youth Dr. BMA, said last night in the statement: "The young doctors still have severe concerns on the proposed treaty, in particular that he asks for the risk of working force and that it cannot apply to all doctors fairly."
Only eight weeks before the first physician group was transferred to the new contract, we need progress and time.
The attempt to authorize the negotiations was to take action and sometimes a full peace by the Government.
And in spite of the promise of Jeremy Hunt in the last month that his door is always open.
" The Jords of Hunt must act now, encourage and react to the fears of the youngest doctors.
If he doesn't do so, the young doctors are inevitable that they are willing to organize the afterwards.
The last article at the end of April led to a delay of about 13,000 planned operations and 100,000 nurses received, while nurses and advisers were imposed to replace the doctors in the pickage line.
The Ministers hoped to conclude the changes agreed to a changed treaty with the leaders of the British Medical Association.
The WMA wants to make a better payment for 54,000 young doctors under the treaty.
Daniel Mortimer, Director General NHS Employers, called the youngest doctors not to continue to be skilled.
Mortimer said: "Ambassadors are reaching little or nothing, but are pressured to work at the front of the teams and services, and cause concerns, physical pain and disorders to patients, sediments and their families."
Over the past two months, we talked to the Committee of Teenagers, together with the Department of Health and others, positively responding to their fears relating to the role of hospitals and corporate information policy.
The workers hoped that the continuing support on other important topics, such as staff distribution, flexibility, additional education for those returning to the career, the value of education, mutual recognition of the training plan, academic departure and gender differences in medical payment, had been aware of the serious workers, the Health of England and the Department of Health to meet the conditions achieved in the WMA in November, February and May.
Preparation for 2 pounds a day may reduce the threat of heart attack
Thousands of patients with heart attack will be used by 2 pounds per day after the authorities recommended to give it more and more than a long time.
The anti-reverse preparation of the ticgrer reduces the risk of recurrence for persons with heart diseases.
The preparation has already been designated for 12 months after a heart attack, a reduction in the risk of an insult or a new invasion.
The NICE National Health Service recommended that people give it for four years to continue to eliminate the risk of heart-related problems.
However, now the NICE National Health Service recommended that people give it for four years to continue to eliminate the risk of heart-related problems.
A heart attack has occurred with about 140.000 people in England annually, and four of them have another attack or insult.
The heart attacks and insults have resulted in the capture of grain materials in the shoes of artry and the preparation of a shock.
If the smell is cut into part, it may be a cause of the torment that blocks the access of blood to the heart and a heart attack.
And if the thromboe moves, he can move through the blood flow and lock blood to the brain, calling insults.
Persons who have already occurred are more risked to obtain another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold by Brilica, reduces the risk that makes the transit less credible.
The NICE instruction project, published today, recommends that people give 90 grams of ticgrer for 12 months, then 60 grams with aspirin two times a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, Head of the Nice Medical Technology Assessment Centre, said: "In spite of the effective methods of secondary prevention, some four people already have a heart attack, a further heart attack or anxiety, often with destructive consequences."
Repeat fears may have a significant negative impact on the quality of human life.
There is evidence that a ticroller, in combination with aspirin effect, has been under the risk of follow-up of heart attacks and insults to people who have already begun a heart attack.
We are glad to have the opportunity to increase the treatment options available to many thousands of people who are ready to use it.
As information on the effectiveness and safety of the ticgrellar — especially the risk of blood — has been limited for three years, the instruction project does not recommend the treatment of the deadline.
The CPC ownership culture allows to promote the performance of the vote accounts in the Islamic regions
Mrs. Tauer-Hamlets Luthfur Rahman was dismissed from posts in the past year because of corruption, with a complete report of the Government
Political adjustment culture has been closed to the eye that has been cut into a general spectrum of the votes in the Islamic communities, on information from the devastating report of the Government, which has been born today.
The former member of the Office of Ministers, Sir Eric Piklas, is inflicted with the criticism of the police, the election observers and the administration of the cities for ignorance of the violations of the elections because of " extreme feeling about racial and religion".
The former secretariat of local communities, now the anti-corruption king, reported that the fear of elections in religious snake was so strong that the police had to be allowed to put borders beyond the borders of the election places to protect the fearful electioners.
He proposes that the electioners take a personal provision to prove who they are when they vote.
At this time, the electors should only specify their name and address.
The report is even proposed to put the smells on the fingers of people when they set up their browsees in order to eliminate some two times.
The best protection should be provided to the observers, said Sir Eric.
It calls for a larger access to the documents of the local council and decisions adopted by informal committees or working groups.
“It is not only to protect the electoral fashion but also to protect the local government from the more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes with her,” he said.
The report was ordered to Duning Strategy, due to the vote in Tauer Hamlets in East London.
In the past year, a special court on election issues decided that Mr. Luftur Rahman had to be dismissed from posts regarding the long list of corruption and illicit activities.
The Court found that Rahman had “ciniciously expressed” the religious feelings of his Muslim community and urged them to silence their critics by accusing them in racism and Islamics.
Rahman, as he said, "he said his campaign, based on the obligation of the believers to vote for him."
To 300 votes were questioned or were the results of the person's vote, representing someone else.
Sir Eric said that they were a witness of torment throughout the country.
He expressed special concerns about mourning with the e-mail vote, in which senior members of the Muslim community, as they reported, had pressure on people to vote for their elected candidate.
Mr. Eric, on the photo, made several recommendations on the cleaning of the voting system, including the requirement to bring personality certification to prove who you are.
In his report, " a number of communities of ethnic minorities, in particular women and youths, have presented evidence of pressure to vulnerable members, in particular for women and youths, to vote for the voluntary of older people, especially in the communities of Pakistan and Bangladesh.
"The fear that... public institutions have closed their eyes to such a behavior because of the excessive feeling of "political adjustment" regarding ethnical property and religion."
Sir Eric gave 50 recommendations on the cleaning of the system, including the elimination of political activists from the work of postbooks to vote in order to stop the “collection of votes”.
The report also calls on the post-registered checks at the registration to prevent the use of the election list for immigration and privacy.
The option is considered to require the voters to proclaim a person's personality before the vote.
Use deceased smells on the fingers of people when they leave their burns to prevent someone to vote two times.
Systemic checks of nationality to ensure that they have the right to vote.
Introduction of a three-year-old vote on applications.
Delete the political participants and activists from work with full votes and convergences with e-mail vote.
To give the police authority to establish the borders around the election places.
Amend the Law to facilitate the proclamation of the accused persons in fear in accordance with the Act of 1983.
To make an illicit photograph on elections.
Exemption for English only to be used for elections (except Wells).
Strengthening education to ensure that the staff allows voters to go to the building.
Sir Eric is angryly attacked by the city police, claiming that it was "repectually" that no criminal accusions had been sentenced after the Tauer Hamlets case.
"The Sud that considers the elections has dismissed Luthfuur Rahman and his long list of corruptions and illicit action," he reported.
He was recognised for the lack of reasonable doubt — a criminal standard of evidence — on a number of basis.
He also criticizes the unsolved "checks for the balls " of the electoral registration of the city Administrations.
Sir Eric said: "The first appointment of the court in Tauer-Hamelets was a sign of trial.
Our nation has the honourable inheritance as the mother of the parliamentary elections, and however, the proliferation of electoral fraud and the decline of certain bodies are threatening this good reputation.
Cate's bicycle analysis and other twice advisors of the Olimpiade in Rio
The Olympics of 2016 in Rio in the past week, with the mood of the French bicycle Paullin Franco-Prévo, which, as it occurred, seemed to be like a gergogy of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old member of the Olympic Games is not the only sporting channel that struggle for gold this year, which can be honored by its own famous dubble, at least according to the social communications.

Guest and ship: Member of the United States Travel team Brady Allison, the left, compared to Leonardo DiCaproo since he was a child
In addition to the bicycle of Kate, many online people tried to show how a certain trail could be the closest of Leonardo DiCaporo’s superstar.
The member of the US Training team Brady Ellyson became a uragan in Twitter, after his images appeared to be a scary look like the Wall Street star from Wall Street.
And in fact, the channel learned about the lack of sociality and admitted that he heard that he looked like Leo since he was a child.
"I'm not personally seeing a great part, may be exceptional to the face," said Brady Huffington Post.
"It's an appreciative guy, so I think it's a compromise."
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 will, indefinitely, indicate more in this year: a spectacular comparison between the British player Greeme Deserford and the popular actor Nila Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnastic Alia Mustafin, with its great expressive eyes, is the exact copy of the Cuban and American Pearl Gloria Estefan.
And in South Africa, Cameron Van der Burga was compared to the star of Hora Matthew Morrison for many years.
Passing to an unexpected one: this user believes Nathan is a "sporting version" of the "Nachala" actor.
Another long-term comparison was between the tennisist Raphalem Nadar and the actor Josh Harnett, who could be able to admire the likely heavy brown and smells.
The silver mealist from Russia, Eury Ethimous, can not only be shocked with sweet hair and light hair as the actor Annalin McCord, as Nathan Adrian from the United States team, like a sportive version of Joseph Gorgon Lewit.

Created theory: According to this user, there may be a reason to be found on the basis of the external nature of the pair
One Twitter user recently called on a website to generate its relief that "the island of the Internet thinks that Hoppe Solo and Jennifer Carter are actually identical".
In fact, the star of the U.S. football and the actor Dexter have incredibly similar forms of face and eye.
Other popular comparisons included Kerry Walsh Jennings and her smile, close to the identical smile of Lora Liny, and the winning gold meal of Gabe Duggog, which can be able to swear a beautiful wide smell that seems to be a sweet smiling smiling of the "Hear's Success" star Gabriel Yunion.
The commenter for the CBC is sorry for the Chinese pool "more as a pornography."
Analysis of Bayron McDonald's fourth place at the end of 14-year-old Iy Yanjahn on the Women ' s free style 4h200m in the medium of CBC to the direct transmission of the Olimpiade
The Canadian CBC advertising company was condemned to apologize after one of its comments said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimming powder was slaughtered as a sweet.
Commenter Bairon McDonald thought that his microphone was disabled when he began to express his own view at the end of the financial woman's east of 4 to 200 meters of free style.
It could be heard as McDonald, who joined the CBC's comments to "speak it with a color," said, "China 14-year-old swimming meat, baby."
A lot of sweet, old as a shock, died as a sweet.
Thank you for it.
The Chinese powder, Ai Yanhan, 14 years old, slowed the second stage of the staff at 1:57.79 to 1.61 seconds slower than the Canadian Taylor Rack, allowed Canadians to remove the displacement from China.
The Canadian switch reacted rapidly on the network after the tone and the use of expressions were shocked
Emmit McFarleyn tweeted: "As the CBC Dictator just said that the 14-year-old kidnapper died as a pornography?"
This idiot didn't understand that they were still in the eternal."
About Ai Younghan from China in the end of a woman's eastfeat, 4h200 m to the free style said, "Thet is a small 14-year-old Chinese kid, was a meat, baby."
The criticism of Twitter immediately disrupted Bayron McDonald, which many called for him to be allowed.
Twitter users did not stop when they heard how uncomfortable Bairon McDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradiz wrote: #ByronMacDonald.
You're representing CBC and Canada and doing us like a racist cup. #disgusted.
Shortly after that, Scott Russel, who gave the CBC transfer, declared directly as McDonald's comments, said: 'We have requested for forgiveness that the comments on the swimming explanation were in the Ethiopian'.
It was an unexpected word. We're sorry that it happened.
The UNHCR concluded that more than 90 persons were excused to respond to this statement
The commenter Scott Russell had to apologize for the person of McDonald
CBC then copied and sent an excuse to more than 90 other Twitter users who wanted to comment on McDonald's comments
The televisory was also urged to apologize and publish the statement.
We are sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to leave the eterne.
Last night, we were operating to apologize for our slaughter in direct eternity and our signators in the société.
By clarity, the comments of the Bayron refered to the explanation of the powder, not to it as to the personality.
And yet it was an inadequate and unexpected choice of words, and Bairon regrets what he said.
On Thursday, McDonald accused of a direct eternity and tried to clarify his comments, claiming that he did not think that his words were terroristized as an attack on personality.
"I would like to use a moment to apologize for the comments I made last night after the woman's stage," he said to the Olympic Games on CBC.
'I've spoken about the shooting, not about it personally.'
"I think it wasn't understood by no respect, and I'm very sorry."
The purchaser of Primark has depressed a woman who had uncertainly illustrated the lower whites through the shop
The buyer didn't know where to take care of some woman to illustrate the tragic shops through Primark.
Anything worse, she illustrated how she looked at them, put them up and put it back to the field.
She continued to search and finally died four couples of lower whites in the Bowerie Place Trade Center in Fallston.
The Primark Trade Center of Bouverie Place in Falkstone, where women were examples of tricotative triangles before they return to the field
The mother of the two children, Jenny Davidson, who was at the time in the shop, said that after the example of the underlying white, the woman "covered and left out of the shop and didn't buy anything."
She said, "They couldn't believe in what they saw."
Between the trade hall, she took a pair of torchs with the shoes, removed their own shoes and shoes and snakes.
"It wasn't trying to find some hot place to do that -- she was just standing there, angry."
"There were all up when she took the strike again, and they apparently didn't like her because she put them back to the field."
She did the same with three other couples before finally decided that there was nothing to do with her, again and out.
"It doesn't seem to be careful for her who looked for her, or that she thought about a man who would, finally, buy those bodies she illustrated."
A 33-year-old Jenny Davidson said, "It is the contrary to think that someone would take home the body that somebody else had nodding, and they weren't seen."
The event occurred on Thursday.
Davidson adds, "I'm going to conclude that the staff, in the entire visibility, tried to remove these objects from the sale, after she went out, and so better."
"I wouldn't want to come home with a new couple of women's bodys and find out that the other woman's jobs and cut them out, and they weren't disappointed."
The representative Primar reported: "Primark knows what happened in our shop in Falloston on Tuesday 9 August."
All items on which it is said were extracted from the sales.
How to protect yourself from a gun by using a magic claw
The surrounding world is dangerous, but it's a video from Dailymail.com may help you make it a little more secure for you.
We talked to Ron Mizrachi, a master of the Crown-Magic Federation in New York to find out how to address armed players in close distance.
If you go to your front or behind, this video will show you how to shoot his player with his weapons.
If you go back, according to Mizrachi, the first thing you need to do is to turn back so that you have seen the attacker and 'free the fire line'.
Then you will smell a weapon between your skin and your shoe before shooting them into the face of a free ball.
Then it should be rolled into the shock, and until the shock is shooted from the pain, you shoot the gun out of his hand, shoot it into the face of the skin and go back, keep the weapon set on it.
For a weapon that is right before, the way to do it is like - get your body out of the fire line, slowly shoot the gun and shoot it so that the wicked one could not shoot.
At the same time, move the weight to the gun and shoot the shooting shooter in the shooting, then turn out the gun out of his bag, before you get back and shoot it.
Sounds complicated?
Look at a video to see what the Mizrachi is doing.
But remember that the most safe out of any robbery -- if you don't have a magic magic, it's to give your own.
For a traveller, Jan Ritt conducts his language on the most ruining places of Europe
The British traveller took its immune system and a routine reflexe of serious testing, shocking some of the most delicate and refreshing places in Europe.
The reliable and author of the Yan Rait, 51 of Saphholk, conducted a euro banknote language, the Chirca Pickadili, the button of the university on the train and the Russian public phone to prove its immune system.
Before shooting each object, he used ulminometers to show us and what he uses.
However, the experiment, which should be a film called "The Training of the Lisbourg of the Internal Shile", gave some wonderful results.
The mouse is to remove the train button using thousands of others, but actually there are worse bacteria in coconut cancer.
During the whole journey in Europe, Ryan talked to doctors and physicians about increased bacteria and his own health.
Happily, nothing of the slaughter brought him more than a bad shooting.
Reyt was known by tests on the permanence of his kitchen, traveling to peace and eating strange and surprising things.
From the public slopes to the kitchen button, this task was uncertainly tested by its immune system.
In the movie he was cut, he said, "I was perfectly worried about my health, and I sweared a lot of different things in the mouth of the earth, eating wheat and clean water."
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only one to which he refused is a russian public toilet.
His test mask showed the meaning of a luminemeter that exceeds 4000 units.
For comparison, only the slighted hands must be within 60.
But there was a Russian public toilet that he refused to shoot, after his люminometer's significance was more than 4000 units, while the extinct hands showed less than 60.
The Valio and the Finnish Manufacturer of Milk Products have deleted a film on a traveller named " Legendation of the Lisune Internal Shile " which demonstrates the number of bacteria in different places, such as in the toilet
In the movie he said, "It's close to one of the worst things I've kicked in the toilet."
There's nothing more damn than that!
I'm not going to smell anything, because it's awesome.
The "Reducing of the Lissunan Internal Shile" was cut together with the Finnish Milk Manufacturer Valio.
The company provided Rait Valio Gefilus, which contains oxygen bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, to help accelerate the growth of human bacteria and develop immune systems.
The Old Vice-President Valio on Buy, Sounds and New Categories said: 'We really wanted to propose a new consumer.
What would be interesting to see, and at the same time it could explain the benefit of the biotechnicians.
We had a brain shop that finished the idea "I'm calling Yannus."
They claim that the interests in the guest are a global manifestation
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to place them in a large context: good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of the pocket health and how it related to the immune system.
The increased interest in the health of the pocket is a global exhibition, and through this documental film, we have been able to provide consumers more information about this in an interesting form.
I also think that the film shows that we have a good feeling of humor!
Tom Hakalla, who was a film register, added: "I would say that I would have lost respect for Yan, if he would have covered some things I requested, for example, a russian kitchen shown in the film."
Of course, some things were easier and some were very cruel.
I'm glad some of these pieces have been able to sleep on the floor.
During the 2015 survey of Valio, 84 per cent of the respondents had linked oxygen bacteria exclusively with the good condition of heat and skin, and 58 per cent said that they used at least sometimes, products containing supplemented oxygen bacteria.
The family of the Huligans destroyed Saltash, a municipal house of Cornool, a landmarked exile
The families of the Huligan left their municipal house with a loss of $50,000, after they were displaced for the fear of their neighbouring neighbors.
Tana Skelldon and her partner, Shana Trebilkock, have been released from their object of non-motiveness in Saltash, Cornusol, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forced to be displaced from an unmovable object, shocked housing and building cooperation officials have found this object of inmobility in the condition required to repair.
The walls were left with snakes, the seeds were hidden, the shock was shocked on the floor and the walls were spaned.
The family is now overlooked and, as a result, lives in the private apartment
Donna McEve, a population in Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid not to save him.
She said, 'It was a absolute cosmart for people here, and I don't think that people should live like that.
There are many things that need to be shocked because this object of immobility may probably be known as a very good aspect of Cornell.
The family uses a stupid glory, and their name is used by a stupid glory.
A couple of three sons who lived in an unmovable system from time, and the police reports that the rule of the family has included dragons on the street with bathsbol baths, the intimidating people in the neighbouring regions, drug use, drug traffic, excessive crys, disputes and ruination.
Sceldon, 47, whose name was at the Arendi Treaty, received the order for the anti-social behavior in June.
In several home rooms, which could be covered, there was an old museum
The case in the house in which drugs were sold was extinct
Neighbors say they saw a dragon on the street and called the police regularly.
Cornwall Housing was forced to get out of her home and her partner on that week, after they were granted a extended period for 11 weeks for voluntary departure.
The expulsion was welcomed by the neighbors who said their lives were converted to the top of hell.
One reported, "They didn't worry."
We lived next to them 20 years, and that was always bad.
Number of times when we saw the police here, it's unbelievable.
That morning we couldn't sleep.
We've been up, because it was so calm here - we didn't have to do this!
Now when they're finally gone, it's gonna be beautiful.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Headquarter of Cornwall Housing, said that the family had not been able to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house of 20 years, with the police, and regularly calls for the police
Musor and old games were displaced below the growing part of the municipal house
He added: ' This is a shock that the awarder could not take any responsibility for her and her family, since the exit is always the last method of action that Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very complicated case, since the behavior was limited, and their actions should have been terrible for her observing neighbors.
I appreciate all my team, police and members of the community of Devona and Cornell, who have spent the slaughter to give us information.
I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbors and send a signal that the associational behavior will not be allowed.
Physpatrick reported that all three sons lived in the house in different times, but he said that they were all a little more than 20.
Gray matrix remained on the floor in one of the houses after the exile
Division workers will now be cut off the shoes of the house.
In 2014, the police has established a house search and has found more than 70 g concords, as well as the weight of relevant property and $1700.
Sceldon was disappointed after she was recognized guilty in the ownership of class B for delivery.
She declared that the money passed for her son, Lee Scheldon, who died in a car disaster in 2013.
After their homeless, there are evidence that Tanya and her partner are now living in Plymouth.
Many of the house rooms were spaned over the entire surface.
The police says they're gonna try to shoot ardenators that are not subject to the location rules
Angela Crow, from the police of Devona and Cornell, stated that this issue had sent a clear warning to other allegators that continue to violate the rule.
'This is a message for those who feel that they may be able to carry themselves without a accused accused, and for those who do so,' she said.
Crime and anti-social behavior will never permit the police of Devon and Cornell, which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal came to fear when a low-level military aircraft was not cut off the beach
In the city of Abea, in Portugal, the tourists who loved to smile on the sun, feared their lives
A vehicle P-3C Orion of the military forces of Portugal was incredibly low
Military forces reported that he had performed a train flight but stressed the lack of risks for security.
This is the moment when the fearful tourists start to be packed, while the low age aircraft was shocked over the overall shock.
A military aircraft is seen in dramatic cars, which is not at the distance of swimming pools from the beach in Awairo, northern Portugal.
The smells shocked on the feet when they became understood by the smile of a flight motors, but there is no possibility to see what moves to their side through the shock.
The Inspector occurred last night near the city of Avyer in Costa New.
Daniel Fernandish, one of the restrainers who publish a video of shocking shoot in social networks, said, "He passed lowly two times, and it was a moment when he showed that he was shocking."
Noah Arroja added, "I've been serving and swearing, it was a feeling that the aircraft was going to fall on me."
Tourists on the Avenue beach were terriblely scared when the aircraft was shown from the tsunami and flyed at an emergency low height
Portugal's military and aircraft today stated that the pilot of P-3C Orion had performed a train flight in order to discover fishing courts in the beach and was required to be low, as it was the only way to check them.
Pilot said that the aircraft was a little lower than normally because of the inadequate visibility of the fire from the nearby war forests, but the military forces insisted that no one was undermined to be dangerous.
In these years, forest fires have damaged the material part of Portugal, as well as four people lived on the Madeira Island.
Portugal's military and aircraft statements today made that the pilot had to fly so lowly in the circumstances — a slight thunder and help from forest fires that deteriorate the visibility of the visibility
A train flight was carried out and the pilot was mandated to find fishing ships within the task
The Hassp system is required for more years, but most of the coffees and restaurants of Petersburg have not yet been entered.
The tests are more active and the business threatens to 1 million rules.
The Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points System (HACCP, Russian HASP option) has been more than a year - risk analysis and critical control points - the application of the producers and transporters and the company in Russia as a member of the Taliban Union.
In February 2015, Russia's business overseeing the standards in Petersburg started.
But until the responsibilities are written, they are only for specific violations of the regulation (see " Documents Preferences " ...).
The incompletion of the regulations is generally in the company of 6000,000 rules for the first violation and 1 million rules for the second.
AASS as a system that takes into account the risks of food and preventing products, was planned in the United States in the 1960s.
Then it's the shock of food security for astronoms.
Now the system is used for all food companies, not only in the United States, but also in Canada and Europe.
Since February 2015, HASP operates on the Territory of the TS.
4 years of the development and introduction of the business system (HASSP testing occurred in 2011).
However, the company itself, and the employees recognize that most companies have not even heard of this standard.
We, unfortunately, had long been sure that the standards relate only to food production, not to restaurants, have explained the head of the Elena Ceretarian Joint Council.
Now, they're all trying to turn back.
The expected time for the renewal of the carters in Turkey, the end of August, began in September.
However, they will not call for a smooth question, as their targetaudit - the family with children - is already ready to school, notes experts.
The Alliance of the Tourist Agency last night sent a letter to the Government, requesting the cards now.
" For many Russian tourists, the collection of quality and access to marine distance is unreasonable, since the Crossland and the Greatest Republic of Location objects have already been covered to the end of September," notes the authors and stress that the opening of clater transports in August is not significantly affected by Russian marine products.
As noted in the Northwest Regional Office of the Russian Tourism Union (RST), if the Russian and Turkey aircraft is soon agreed, the renewing of carter ships in Turkey can be expected for a month.
A certain understanding when the chairs are renewed until no, this depends mainly on the aircraft authorities.
Technically, aircrafts can fly in September, even August, if tourists operate with the aircraft competing with the necessary boards,” said Paul Romanians, Vice-Director of Communications and International Projects of the North-West Regional Office.
In his words, the possible renewment of the carders is a good news, but is not too affected by market power, because the main purchasers of the card towers - the family with children - have already returned from a distance and are ready to go to school or to carry out a vacation in other countries.
In the bark season, travellers and pairs are mainly purchased.
Charles programs can be counted on those who have the opportunity to relax", says Paul the Romans.
"Turkey has the opportunity to join many tourists, if it now gives very budgetary proposals - 50 to 60 miles, because there are people who are targeted to wait for very delicate tours," says Valeria Central, Director-General of the Optio-Travel.
In other cases, it should not be precisely planned to calculate on the heat, the main mass of travels has already been planned.
Paul also believes that, since there is a regular demand in Turkey, the carders will also be displaced, but the glass is not expected.
"To Turkey the launch of cards now is the replication of the next season," said Paul the Romanians.
"Clarifying cards in Turkey is a positive news for the next season", according to Valeria Rubzv.
The Tax Code provides the release of the NDFL legislation to compensation payments within the limits of the approved rules relating to the reimbursement of damage caused by injury or other health damages.
Exemption of employees employed with harmful working conditions, the milk of the standards set out is s. 222 TF RF.
The standards and conditions of expenditure are set by the Russian Minowsome Development order of 16.02.2009 No. 45n.
According to this document, the free sales of milk or other equivalent food products are produced to employees in the day of effective employment with harmful working conditions at the workplace of harmful production factors.
In accordance with the rules laid down in the letter, the Russian Federation concluded that, on the basis of Abs. 2 p. 3 p. 217, the RRC is released from the conditions of the NFL income as the value of the milk issued to workers in the day of actual employment in harmony working conditions, in accordance with the Norwegia and the conditions approved by the Ministerial Development order of Russia of 16.02.2009, No. 45.
Moscow Gastroybank remained without the CIA license.
On Thursday, 12 August 2016, the Russian Central Bank resigned the licence for banking operations in the organisation of the International Community Bank, registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, the AAC HASSTREBANK has conducted a high-level credit policy related to the allocation of money in low-quality assets.
Adequate evaluation of the risks taken by the supervisory body and the proper reflection of the value of the bank assets has resulted in the credit organization to implement bank prevention measures.
Furthermore, the credit organization was involved in the conduct of suspicious transactions.
The bank designates a temporary Administration before the appointment of the competitive manager or the license.
The fulfilment of credit organization executives in accordance with federal laws is suspended.
AAAC GASTREBANK is part of the investment insurance system.
We recall that insurance payment of bank insurance payments, including individual entrepreneurs, in accordance with the Federal Act No. 177-FZ "The insurance of physical contributions to the Russian Federation" is estimated in 100% of the remaining resources, but not more than 1.4 million rubbers in combination with one income.
Payments, based on the contribution insurance Agency, have not been started later 26 August 2016.
According to the reports, the ACB's largest assets for 1 August 2016 was 335 places in the banking system of RF.
A London school, joined to IGIL, died in Syria
Cadez Sultan, one of the three British schools who left London last year to join the IHIL, reportedly, died in Syria.
The lawyer Tasnim Acunday said that her family had learned about her death in Rack, Syria, just a few weeks ago.
It was supposed to have died from a Russian aircraft in Rakqa, a grouping in the country, as reported by ITV News on Friday.
Susan was 17 years old, and, according to her family, she died as a time when he planned to leave a divorced country of war and return to England.
"It may only be hoped that the only advantage of this is, as the overwhelming and the meeting of others, that is the risks of traveling to the military action area - to kill people ever the same choice," said Acundi.
In February 2015, Sultan and two other school schools from East London were a village in Turkey and then on bus to Syrian border.
The family of Susana said that she married the IHL fighter in Syria and became a widow in a few months.
Rid claims that Clinton remains faithful to Harland as a candidate to the Supreme Court in the case of election
The leader of the Democratics in Senate Harry Rid says he is convinced that the democratic candidate to President Hillary Clinton will be appointed to the judge Mercy Harland in the Supreme Court if it is elected as President.
The Republic of the United States blocked the approval of Harland, and as President Barak Obama appointed it in March.
The Director of the Group of the majority in the Senate, Mitch McConnel, states that the next President will choose the person who can replace the last judge of the Supreme Court of Antonina Skyly.
Rid declared at the level conference on Thursday that he predicted that Clinton would choose "in some way of confidence".
The representative Rid later said he didn't talk to Clinton about whether she would move Harry, and just built proposals.
He honored Harland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to "have a ship" with a new choice.
Harland is the principal court of the Appeal Court of the United States on the district of Colombia.
Rid declared that the Republicans who blocked the name of Harland were the "fellowships" and "persons" of the Republic of Candidate to the President of Donald Trump.
He said that Tramp wasn't coming to the office.
Treats states that erotic calendars for women, both for men
The Journal of Treats cooperates with the photo of David Balmer to issue in the calendar for 2017, inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
But instead, they are intended to find the next generation of fuel models for their calendar for 2017 with the museums covered.
The President of Treats Steve Shaw told us this year that his magazine with a large number of research models is different from the old Playboy, because "Playboy is for men".
I'm doing it for women.
Obviously, he thinks that the calendar is also.
"We need to return to the demonstration of an eternal and classic spectacle where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the woman's body," said Shaw in the calendar press.
Women want to be part of the project because it is a beautiful art.
Models can provide online photos or personally on open casts in Los Angeles and New York.
Moscows will spend the memory of unrelated internet magics.
In Moscow, there is a plan to make a memory that tells us not to be a victim of the Internet magic.
This was reported in the Russian U.S.A., writes M24.
It is reported that state specialists are preparing a memory that helps citizens to select the Internet magic properly and to recognise possible fraudulent schemes.
The concept of this brochure provides several sections.
These will be general information and the legislative framework, the rules of delivery of goods, the protection of their legal rights.
The Annex will be given recommendations on the correctness of the claim and so further", stated in Russian supervision.
The memory is being done at the present moment.
It will then be placed on the Moscow Rosk Surveillance website, and it is also planned to release the print version and delete the mocks.
The Middle East published a statement called the name of the second suspected organization of divergence in Krue.
Persons were detained from the number of Ukrainian and Russian citizens who have assisted in the preparation of terrorist acts.

"All they give thanks to them," says the message.
Previously, the inhabitants of the European Union Pana, who was detained in suspicion for the organization of terrorists in Cromau, recognized its guilty for the investigation.
The FASS is overcoming Google for 438 million rules.
The Federal Antimonopolitical Service of Russia (FAS) appointed an administrative cost of 438 million rubbers to Google Corporation.

Wednesty suspects 16 Russian shops.
The New Book's Network was shocked for the sale of the book "50 days before my self-slaughter."
The New Booking Network is extracted for the sale of the Stace Cramer book 50 days before my self-smoking, reports the Moscow News Agency.
As reported in the Russian Summit, uncertainly the amount of trap, the book may be considered as "producing or motivating children and adolescents towards the socidian behavior".
The Late district Court reaffirmed the violation of the requirements for dissemination among children of information product and decided to appoint punishment as a trace with 49 printing products arrested by the Russian supervisory management.
The source in the New Book confirmed that it was the statement of Stace Cramer.
In March this year, it was reported that Moscow's largest book books were checked on the existing book "50 days before my self-smoking."
In Moscow, it's going to be remembering Ernst unknown.
In Moscow, there will be a memory of Ernst's Unknown sculptor, reports TASS.
The activities will be held in the Central Literature House on August 15.
Unfortunately, they will not all be able to apologize with the unknown in the United States.
It was therefore decided to establish this evening for those who want to remember it on the land of the country,” stated in the press office of the Russian Jewish convention.
It was noted that this was important for the ancestor of Anna Graham and his friends throughout the world.
Tonight, close friends of the Unknown Unknown, including the Poet Eutuccinko, Artist Boris Mesherer, President of GMII, are invited. Pushn Irina Antonova, director of Mark Roseski, as well as the Minister of culture of Russia Vladimir Minnesota, the head of the cultural department of Moscow Alexander Kibwa, Vice-Moscow Leonid Petchers.
It was previously reported that Ernst's unknown plan to conduct panicides in New York, preferably until 14 August.
The final consumer was guilty: Who really purchases the plastics?
The only men in the middle of the mid-year loves guilty.
And until you have dismissed the section of comments by cruel distortions under the non-Mediter of the Middle East, the approval is out of the actual data.
YouGov said that so many discussions on the rebuilding of the plastics are not a bleeding among the generation of twenty-year-olds who want to come up with a new material object, but not only for medium-year-old years.
Those who have recently purchased a virtue album (c) are likely at a age of 45 to 54, according to the data.
Moreover, those belonging to the age group of 18-24 are less perceived.
This is also not just a act of collection of favorites - it has an emotive importance: more purchasers have condemned a number of more likelihoods (56 per cent against 53 per cent) and pleased for unity (69 per cent against 66 per cent).
But is the results of youGov faithful?
If this blog was a television news report, the camera would follow me until I was going to the center of the Soho street, in the modest heart of the coast and a bunch of sweet before the stop, composing the hands and saying something smiling, "Yes, let's see."
Yeah, let's see.
While the heart of Soho was slowly slowly disappointed — hotels, coffee, paperchase shops have now been designed to build buildings when independent salers have been employed — a number of musical shops with fantastical specialists have remained.
I would like to ask the camera to stop the next scene, in which I am close to different people in some of these shops and try to evaluate their age and the emotion by monitoring.
Grazgo Stuart, 55 years of age I went from Sister Ray, two young women, three men in the mid-year-old years, to Reckless Records, eight men, a woman likely a 20-year-old age, in London, to take a meeting, and walk in shops to take a few hours.
He's a collectioner, can I ask?
"I think so," he says.
I have about 3000 or 4000 plates.
These plates above (he sent me by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), they go to lines on the walls of his guest.
His reason for buying such a large number of albums and symptoms should be paid from his dischargeed income: he can now buy the plasts that he could not allow himself when they were only out and buy the items he sold when he was young and medium.
"My more of the things I'm buying is the end of the 60s, the beginning of the 70s, the things that came when I was 11 or 12 things that I probably was too young to buy," he said.
He agrees that those who purchase the plastics are most likely the introvers who love their own company, adding: "I'm not smoking, I don't drink much too much.
It's my lack.
Wees, 25 years working at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers whom he meets are corresponding to the YouGov profile.
However, he noted the new concern of people who had been under the impact of the media, those who heard back and felt the responsibility of saving their old plasts.
Judging on the discussions I had, people were released from their collection, usually in 1998 or 1999.
The customers who have ever sold their fault to purchase dishes, they are now sell their dish compacts to purchase their platforms," he says.
This may explain the blue among the persons of recovery of a certain age.
What about the emotional importance of placing?
A few seconds in the shop, such as Phonica, are sufficiently conducted to understand that the placing shops offer a comfortable society of people with similar views.
According to Weather, some of the senior customers, in particular, are disrupted by the unfair payment system.
Some guilty members may feel angry from the digital world and prefer to be removed in the permanent convergences for the plastics, objects that have the memories of the immature youth.
"I think it may sometimes be filled with whiteness or material things as their kind of calm," says Weather.
Because I'm the collector, I have it, and I think there's a lot of people too.
It's a simple way to take your head.
"We're as their social workers!" said a colleague from the platinum wall.
The ICM survey showed that nearly 50 per cent of those who purchased a virtue album in the last month did not listen to it.
The survey also found that 41 per cent of the player they have never used, while 7 per cent of those who purchase guilty, there is no placing player.
At this stage of the news report, I would likely have been a serious delicate, cutting the board with the Boshanova assemblers.
"Trofe" aspect of recovery is what Johnny noted 42 years of age working in Sounds of the universe (counting: three men in mid-year-old years).
"Another one came recently and said, "I don't have a platform player, but I want to buy a radiohead plate so we can put it to our own place," he said.
It's not a big percentage, but it's certainly happening.
It's a more typical, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a platinum player."
It's more young people older than twenty years of age that are just aware of it.
Fopp, who has now launched almost the entire stage of the vine, is much more diversity when I'm coming.
There are couples for 70, tourists who are photod, adolescents and women in the mid-year-old.
Although the atmosphere is less innocent than in the above shops, the last Sint and Sexy Pop Wild Beast, and not a jazzle inauguration, is cut through the columns -- it is a good view of the diversity in its customers.
No one looks particularly unique, but the painful psychological trauma is difficult to establish 30 seconds close to someone.
Eleanor, 27 years old, went to Fopp for a few minutes, considering different placings that have been sold.
She looks like goods, not money.
It does not pay much, as she says, so it is not a very suitable option.
That's pretty good.
Listen to music on a computer or another device -- simply, but the beauty was-- -- it's loading into the dreams with a smile that is completed by love.
I don't know how to explain it is really uncomfortable.
My last stopping is the shop that, as he says, helped the new generation of lovers to come, it's the people's modests.
As I create the illusion that I'm looking at gymnastics, I'm looking at the group of young girls, every minute to gather around the Polaroid camera, before my father and his daughter start to discuss the purchase of Crosley player.
The left is the wall with the plates of Adele, Jephth Bacli, Amy Weinhouse and Flytud Meek: the modern style and classics required platforms for any medium collection.
Nobody looks — perhaps because they are just a shooting, some places are so high on the wall, that wouldn’t be able to touch them.
It's a real artistic guilt.
However, given that any attention to these objects may mean more money to the industry and send several other customers to the Soho deep at any time, almost not to be complained.
It's not surprising that the skin of people with more likely than most of them have more time and money than most of them is the skin that loses most of the money of the raw materials, such as the guilty.
But until my conclusions show that the results of YouGov are accurate, at least in Soho platforms, they do not exclude the existence of a large number of collective women and lovers that are in reality, in placing shops and online forums.
These people probably work in school or offices.
But they are obviously not taking place on the morning, walking on the shops of plastics at Bervick-Stritt, slowing the plasts and avoiding the views of an unpleasant 30-year false leader, which depends on the shoes of a medium-year-old man.

The French Court rejects the proposal to purchase the shops in the Jungly refugee camp
The French Court rejected the proposal of the Kyle’s authorities to put ten single shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees live.
In the court hearing this week, the authorities of Cale expressed that the State should be able to make a total complexity of 72 single shops where people are sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, propose to switch or sell a tea for 50 cents (40r) or a few euros in an independent restaurant.
The Prefecturer Cale expressed that these places should be made because they are a parallular economy that does not pay taxes, and because they have a fire and sanitary risk.
The civilian groups told the court that the purchase and the restaurants are vitally necessary, claiming that free observances proposed for the government association and other groups have not provided sufficient quantity of food for growing numbers in the camp.
They expressed that single shops and restaurants often provide blood and free food for those who need it.
The Court of Leil decided that it was not a legal basis to escape people rulered by 72 single shops but claimed that the problem of Kale's prefecture was completely understood.
Judge Jean-Francois Mollah said that bacalies, coffees and restaurants have played a great role than simply the use of people who " live in extreme shock conditions".
He said that spaces have provided peaceful meetings of refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that were threatened by the report was a child cafe of the Jean-Lee Book at the camp which does not work for benefits and offer 200 dinners a day, in English and French, and in consultations on rescue for hundreds of vulnerable adolescents without contact in the camp.
More than 170.000 people were signed by petition to protect the coffee of children.
The letter sent to Guardian stated that it would be "a disaster for those children, some of whom are not older than eight years".
Two well - scheduled institutions, the assistance to the Beemenians and L’Auberge des Migrants in Friday, estimated that the number of Jungly camps growed and exceeded 90,000 people — the most higher than the whole history — after a slight increase in new arrivers during the year.

Britain is stopped in the region-7 January after the master-class Fiji allows them to take gold
The impressive series of Great Britain in Regby-7 was slowly stopped at the final obstacle of Fiji team in the finishing night when they were fully disrolled 43-7 in the Deodor Stadium in Rio.
Fiji gave the master-class for the ownership of the moon, the strike, the support of the game, the fleet of lines and the cruel force to win gold — their first olimpholic meal of any color.
The opinion was not too poor in the form of silver, the third in Britain, and they could be proud of their efforts in the first Olympic tourist in Regby-7, which tried to win New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The disease of Boks, 7-5 in half-five in the same day, could be returned to the end.
But no matter what, Fiji has winned as far as it couldn't be a team of 15 persons.
This may be some comfort for the United Kingdom — but it is probably not — that at least one British man will spend tomorrow on a gold meal: the main trainer Fiji - Ben Ryan, an ex-English chief from William.
It was a few trips to Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game on Adelaide Sevens.
They've lost the whole one here.
These shocks will cause pain, but the progress is slightly.
Fiji began greatly, because of the pursuit, the attempt to shoot the Great Britain to shoot the meat.
It was like to touch the colony of the cars for the Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and the Championship of the World Section went up to 5-0 when Ocea Coleissa was born in the edge.
There were four minutes at the time of Jerry Tuvai adds another tachun on the right floor, which was implemented.
12-0 and Greece was shocked up.
The magnificent trial of Mitchell's overwhelming man, Leon Nakarabrah, was to forget the third, but it was just Fiji.
At the seventh minute, Jas Veremálua made Tachdaun in the right edge, and Britain played 17-0.
Nakarabaya added another after renewing, and in the hour there were still more minutes... in the first half.
Ravo was then interrupted through some other great attempts to overcome the Great Britain and the storm to obtain a sight.
Implementation led to 29-0 in the pass.
It looked like Fiji had been born for the game in Regby-7, while Greece still has a resin.
What's there likely to be.
The Great Britain made mass replacements at half of the game, and they sweared a physician... at all four minutes, that the standards of the first half were good until Joshua Tuiswa passed after a few sluggling physic interactions.
Dan Norton accepted the attempt for the United Kingdom, made a tank in the left angle so that it was 36-7, but a long time-by-floor game was on the way of South Sea, whose skin fans were swinging fleets and danced on the courts.
It was not possible to rejoice the full joy of the Fiji approach.
Mother Willem has shooted a physician tower that did not need to be adjusted, another attempt in the last seconds.
The slogan was shocked, the physics were shocked, and the United Kingdom sloped into gas, completely convinced.
On the same day, Fiji wins Japan from 20 to 5 in its half-five, and the United Kingdom was a little in South Africa in a pressed half-first of one attempt — the difference in Britain.
Kyle Brown puts Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton helps some great work of the leg to shoot the line and shoot the balls in the second half.
The last attempt to overcome from Marcus Watson, the 15th part of the team of England, Entony, was safeguarded by the winning, and, finally, the silver meal.
Helen Glover and Hiser Stanning are inspired to win in the Greece combating cancer train
There's no more worried gold on these games, and that's something about it.
From the first move to the last, 220 heavy submissions in historic history, Helen Glover and Hizer Stanning found that their gold moment at the Lagoa Station was more important.
Though they were the themes of two weights, there were three voices in this ship, the echo of Robin Williams was always until they tried to the second subparty of the Olympic gold in women, the first woman in the British sport analysis that reached that height.
Their overcome was absolute, the 39th unbelievable statement, again unprecedented.
What we're seeing is that two sweet sports that are covered on the surface of the lebedies are not fully reflecting the nature of the triumph.
For each Greek batalon's gold, prepared hands that contribute slowly to the victory, which are important, and no hands that were more important than the trainer, which 30 months ago, when he had placed a cancer diagnose, did not know whether he lives before seeing that day.
As he said, it was a dangerous case.
I've got a smooth puzzler cancer, which is one of the things they can operate, and they've done it.
If they're not doing this, he's going all over there.
This could be a very bad situation.
She's a little changed your species in the future.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
It was glad that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, maintaining a minimum graphic, if it could be a correct expression in such circumstances.
I needed payment, so I had to run quickly.
It was smiling.
I was in the hospital and driving at the office — 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet per hour, although they said a few steps.
That's how it starts.
The beach itself is a trip, but it makes it a little more.
The next mom after the winning of their first thoughts were Williams, who held the nervous morning, speaking more than normally in trying to overcome their own concerns.
Stanning, captain of the Artillerian Service in Afghanistan, said, "I've been an emotive disappearing this week, maybe it's a little sweet, but that's so important."
It only confirms how much this means for me, how much Helen and I worked, and Robin also.
These were fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we would be no one, so thank him very much, he's the best trainer in the world.
I couldn't ask for a best partner to train or a better train.
Helen Glover and Hiser Stanning haven't lost any hole for five years.
The couple has a pressing rhythm that their competitors never could match.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the New Zealand and Denmark teams began approaching, Stanning and Glover had too much in stock.
We were strong in the phase.
Helen said, "Let in the process, stay in the process."
Now it's very important to do it.
We had a good time, and at the same time we didn't try to do something awesome.
We weren't waiting for the fever today, we've just waited for a good grey, out and win this gorge that we did.
A couple needs a year to decide on their future.
The Globe must be married in the next month, in her own television scanner, by Steve Bakshell.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say that it's my last hole.
That would mean too much pressure.
We needed some six months in London to realize that I became the Olympic Champion.
It was so new, and I was so pressed.
I need some four minutes here.
I wonder myself so better," she said.

It is proposed to not allow the company where 25 per cent and more foreigners, and the claims in which the capital will not be at least 25 per cent of the guest participation.

According to two of the FZ draft articles, as already written by "augmentation" on 2 August, the company whose beneficiary (25 per cent of the amounts and above) may not have a double citizenship.
The Government is able to introduce such limitations, since the Suha Log regards the emergency of the federal value (more than 50 tons of gold).
In the Minoprofeders, the project was confirmed that the "consistence of restrictions for foreign companies" but refused to comment on the details to the Government ' s allocation.
In December 2015, the officer of the shopping captain issued the Irish area, said in Minorred, and later reaffirmed the Governor of the Sergey Lewchenko region, noting that it was addressed to his former Sergeem Eroceanko, "the former investment contract with the Russian projects".
Those who met the restrictions for foreigners have not been declared.

At the pension market, the UK Finance Pension Administrator launched the process of association of four sub-controlled NGOs.
As a result, "Gazfond Pension Coppers" will be created by a number of NFF collected by about 373 billion rubs.
On the launch of a combination procedure of four pension funds, "KIT Finance", "Promford", "Search" and "Gazfond Pension Collections" last night, reported the owner of 100 per cent of the CHIT Finance Administrator of Pension.
"The reorganization is carried out in accordance with the CBI in compliance with the requirements of non-profit conditions of existing treaties", states the company.
The combination is carried out on the Gazfond Pension Coppers.
As notes the generator of the NFF Olega Bylishsky, the combination of funds allows a number of tasks: the enhancement of geographic presence, the concentration of development resources, the reduction of costs, the trend of the best practices of each of the funds and the optimalization of corporate management.
In his words, the oriental term of the consolidation is the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the combination of NGOs, "Gazfond Pensioon Coppers" will become the larger player on the POP market.
According to the data on 31 March, the payment of unit funds exceeded 373 billion rubbers.
As reported on the funds, the beneficiaries of their owners - " CIT Finance of the Pension Administrator " are currently Anatole Gavrienco (65 per cent of subcontrolled OOs) and Gazfond (35 per cent).
However, the association of the group has launched a lot of competitors later.
Yes, the under-controlled O1-NFN-Body-Downed-Government Stalfond was still in the beginning of the current year.
This Joint NGO is currently joining the Uralssib Funds and the Russian Standard.
"Introduction in a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary to solve structural tasks", notes the "Bood-in-law" Nyloy Sydors.
The active work on the consolidation of funds from April is also in the Safmar Pension Group - NPF "European", "Reformation and Science" and "Regionfont" must be included in the Safmar NGO until the end of this year.
In 2017, the GNF is joined to them.
"Inclusion of the funds will effectively enhance risk control, operational processes and expenditure", noted in the Safmar Pension Group.
The CIT Finance Administrator of Pension may be suspended by several reasons to indicate experts.
Before the last time, NGOs could not purchase more than 40 per cent of the infrastructure expenditure in which the group was actively located.
After amendments to the CB in March this year on a number of employees, relevant requirements of the regulator, there are no more restrictions.
The director of the Financial Institutes' Rating Group of ACRA Jury Nogin, if necessary, can buy one large player.
A number of NFF leaders from the AT-15 assets have also been called the separation of the scope of influence and, as a result, the carriage allocations in a single fund that should be agreed to the owners of the group.
Last night Anatolius Gavrilenko was not allowed to comment.
The request for "Gasfond" was not answered.
Although the consolidation of the funds is a job and unexpected event, this decision will be justified in a long-term distance.
As notes the director of the Consulting Company Sergey Okolisno, the Pension Collections Gazphones are less flows, the union allows to stabilize the basis of other group funds.
In this way, there will be a more successful experience in the ICF Finance and Promotor Fund in the construction of OPS-based sales, as well as in the use of more modern PP.
The requirements of the CBC to processes and careers of NGOs are continuously growing, so to duplicate the infrastructure for four funds in the single investment policy are not targeted, as the director of the expert RA expert, Paul Mitrofan.
" The effects of duplicating functions are unilaterally resolved by possible unit costs", notes Mr. Mitrofan.
The costs for the combination of the four funds of Sergey Okolosne are estimated by 30-50 million rubbers.
" The results of the four funds of such size are about 400 million rubbers per year, with a medium-term budget really reduced by two", said Mr. Osolous.
In the Russian procate, Pete and his Dragon were the best dinsic film.
Great species of New Zealand, a sweet dragon, a slippering history and a song in the canter style are sufficient to believe again in the oldest magic, says Elena CRAVcinon.
The scared little was a dragon that became a human child and a swimming boy and a loyal friend.
Pete calls her friend Elliot, who is honoured by a snake of the book, plays with him in a box and slept in a film.
Six years later, his growing and on-spot link does not differ from the other industrial forest stores of Maurice.
In this way, Pita finds a blossom hero Grace (Blace Dallas Howard), while the Brigade of Gavin (Carl Urban), her husband, agressively fled the forest.
Now she must not only believe in the existence of the Dragon but also help him saving him.
Pete is a rapid course to "be a man" in the environment of the ideal Americans who have a cowboys, a moral code in the heart and smile more brilliant than any advertising.
No person looks out and does not work too terrible that the slaughter actually begins to hate or fear him.
Even Gavin, who was locked by a typical people of his sub-sized forests, is far away to the unreasonable abuse.
The shocked dragon was also uncomfortable, with a good bouldog, aviation shock and ability to become invisible.
Dragon is awesome, smiling, even smiling, and, happily, he doesn't want to smile at all times, so it is usefully different from all known cinematographic dragons.
The visual image of Elliot and his manner maintain such a high stage of emotional involvement that at the most pressing moments, not only smaller, but also adults begin to smell in three hands.
Awesome good and young Oux Figur in the role of Pete, who disappears between a family and a real friend.
And Robert Reedford urges a canonic grandmother who would like to have literally every child.
How did the director David Laurie have been able to remove a fantastically forgotten disappearing disastrous film in 'Dracon Pita' in 1977, mediated from the noise to the end of the hospital and recalled only by a mix of animation and game movie, and to make it the most soulful movie of this summer?
Not like a miracle helped.
In his picture of Laurie from the original, in fact, only two things were taken: the slaughter of Pita and the dragon.
The music numbers and the majority of strange shocks have remained on the board.
In this good statement, people of the Bambie, the Indonesians, and many other beautiful children's hearts are read.
The Disney Studio continues to enhance the gallery of high quality rings in the 21st century.
Of course, "Pit and Dragon" is not so shocking as "the book of Jungle" and there's no artistic abuse in which Kate Blanchet had been in the role of the mache in the new Golden.
But this movie, however, has successfully helped to believe in wonder and good in the best dynamic traditions.
On the other hand, the keys from the magnificent store of Dyskin's register Louri will be obtained for the artistic movie adaptation of Peter Pane's history.
The David Lawre and the scriptor Toby Haelbrooks developed in a new ambitious project on the unbelieving boy at James Barry's single speech.
The journalist of RBK Alexandra Sokoloa shall proclaim a new accused
The journalists of RBK Alexander Sokolov, who was accused of the organization of extremist structure, said that the prosecution had not been counted in the matter of their defendant.
That the prosecutor had made such a presentation, we learned from the investigators last night.
We were planned to participate in the judiciary on the limitation of knowledge with criminal matters, but the meeting was not held, and the investigators reported to us the prosecutor's prosecution."
She told the prosecutor that the investigator had indicated that the qualification of cases and gathered materials was inadequate.
The investigators now have to remove the spaces in the proof base and pronounce the new accused to Alexander Sokolo.
The other article of the Criminal Code (OHCH) remains the same, but with other evidence and new evidence, Mrs Dynz declares.
As he reported, Alexander Sokolo was arrested on 29 July 2015.
In June the current year reported that the results were excluded from the accused of the RBK journalist on the "Review of the political situation on the side of instability" and "respect of the authorities illegally".
Aleksandr Zilbert, a counterparty in the Olympic village, investigated the Russian College, eated in a local table and even tested WADA.
It seems that life isn't going to die in seconds.
Even night.
The latest ages have been completed after the sports required a half-twelve hours to return to the Olympic village.
Furthermore, there are seats and displaces from the village, since some attractors have completed their statements and leaves Brazil, and only some of them come here.
Well, at 7:30 o'clock one of the temporary tests has been covered by all the Olympic delegations.
In these congregations, we are generally discussing some operational matters, reporting the leader of the sporting delegation of Russian Jord Casiks team. - Despite the fact that our houses, considering our sculpture, have taken it in exploitation by one of the first and have demonstrated all the checkers, even some of the cases.
That's with a heavy water problem, so I'm sorry, with cyclings.
We've been fighting for cleanness for a long time.
First, nobody had to get away.
Then the clinics arrived, but they're just swearing some substance on the ground, yes.
They've got, see if some innovations are innovative.
Mol, you can't touch them humanly.
We know these fields are a slight laminate!
In general, changes of the clining company have been made and now all of this has been done.
The Olympic village is the South Buto, a bed area covered by one side of the mountains, and the other inherent routine, the places of the water.
Well, for reliability, there's still a two-milion helmet swimming shoes around the slope of the machines.
All in the village can be placed to 17.000 persons in 3604 apartments located at 31 houses.
One of the 18th-state buildings has a large Russian flag - this house is completely dedicated to our collection.
In view of a small incentive, you can immediately determine what problems are to be for the most vulnerable team.
Two statements are declared on the slow registration: the printed "Place, don't leave a paper in the toilet!" and from the hand of the "Prime in the icon gift.
It's the same snake in the browsers.
Their funeral race is contrasting with the brochure: "Remember of Infectional Diseases to Rio de Janeiro", "Health in the oxidation, the fall of the foreign body in a respiratory way, the loss of conscience is the stages of heart-leading reaction", "Health, warm shock, shock and blood".
The text is in a generally deceived.
For instance, " the infinity is associated with a heavy and post-sequent outcome.
Nevertheless, the good outcome is not all.
It is certain that Russia's position is a nursing who is ready to provide a qualified assistance to the inhabitants of the home, including a delicate and sportive mass.
Instead of the nursing, our delegation's own headquarters.
The door is inspiring crystal: "As it's nothing we're winning!".
Well, of course, the verses:
All arguments are absolute burden!
They believe only those who fear.
Let us be less sweet, so that Russia will not go away, and it's not broken!
In order to increase the submission of the spirit, the declaration states: "Awesome brothers and sisters!
In the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and all the Russians, the spiritual care of the sports of the Olympic College of Russia performs the protoyer Andrey Wormirovic Alexandrev.
Put your prayers and other requirements on the phone...
Indeed, there is the Meditation Center and Religious Training for the representatives of all conventions in the village.
Well, the Russian is obtained in the privileged situation, they have their own hour.
With regard to the burning of the nineth stage at the fourth stage, I decided to spend on the leaflet recommended to use during the fire.
And in the darkness, the body was shocked on her.
As a whole, these were the workshops of the new clining company.
I believe, at any time, they have decided to slow up innovative genders directly on cold stages.
At the fourth stage, I was waiting for a meeting with a long - known Vitalia Fedrodwick Dudko, the trainer of our baths, bringing them to the olimphian gold 16 years ago to Sidney.
He and the student, the Champion of Europe of Yan Paul, agreed to show his rooms.
- We live on two, of course, sleeping is nearly standing, but it's not critical.
One to four, but it's very spacious.
Scoff, of course, isn't the shock of confidence, but something can be put.
"No, but you're touching, the tea have finished!" - he develops the tennisist of Svetlan Kuisco, who met me in the main table.
It is called, though, because it represents a space of 2,7 thousand km and is ready to take 50,000 visitors at the same time.
This is about 600,000 portions in the coast completely free.
The options of the menu are: "Luke from Brazil", "Cuchney of the World", "Asiatic Observers" and "Pice, Macronics".
The last option I've seen is the great popularity of our volunteers.
That's what we say, I haven't found any of the gigant restaurant units.
What are you kids?
It's good that I've got a Chinese shooting.
And the teacher.
But if you understand, we're still worse in the cortex.
There's something you can choose, despite an unexpected unity.
I personally chose a pair of pieces and sweet shoes in tomate soß.
Each wheel has a table with its name in three languages, English, French and português, as well as the value of the food and existence of allergens in it.
Well, it's all right. It's all right.
I don't even know why this is always in the McDonald's local.
The friends who are disabled can say the "Typling" sports from the restaurant are waiting for our best friends, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
They are subjected to a victorial ball, a winner whose football is obtained.
Let's go, you can say!
To obtain a gift, it is necessary to respond correctly, even if eight questions from ten.
There are questions about Russians!
But it didn't.
I mean, I'm in the patriotic explosion, naturally.
The second question has already been addressed: "If I have received a notice of the past control, should I immediately go to the end-control point?"
I stopped with the B option, "No, I've got one hour."
I've lost, so I've been careful.
I forgot the WDA weakness not to wait.
Indeed, you must be immediately.
Well, at the seventh stage, my situation was very critical.
I thought that if I'd be hard to observe the balanced dial because of my flesh graphic (and me, it's difficult, too!), I can use bioboats to get "complemented food substances to improve my productivity."
No, they're not allowed!
Exactly, the answer is formulated so that Category is not prohibited, but in a number of proposals are rejected.
This WADA plays injuryly!
What's the matter, Russia?
Get away somewhere behind Ethimous, Isnbaev and our whole team.
So I focused on the last force, and I wind an unfortunate football.
You know what you're saying, ours!
In a victory, I entered the Fitzing Center.
The trainer's count.
It's over 250.
It was surprising that no Russian sportor was found in this threat.
But maybe it's right?
Let those who do not play!
And here's one of our guy's sit down there.
In the way to the ocult.
Don't worry, not a shot.
In the polycline, as well as in the whole village where the pool is, the device is able to extracte preserveers.
To him a night, the enthusiasming call is: "Remember with the end."
Moreover, it is only to move a iron that remembers the hand of the door store, and the preserving made from the natural late Amazon, which is ready to get out of the device.
I took myself one in the memory.
It's not going to make the sports -- they've brought them 450 thousand.
As a time for celebration and celebration in the Olympic village, there is a total deployment centre.
In any case, it should be an identical table, recalled that the International Olympic Committee costs $3.25 million per day.
The center of the video graphics, the bill and the tennis tables, the solid football and the cookies, and some strange devices like video repository.
- I'm interested in the company in the form of a Ukrainian collection that actively uses dicovine games.
Of course, it could just say that you don't want to talk to someone in the form of a Russian collection, yes, all.
Here, somewhat strange circumstances in the eyes are saved from the men in the western blue.
It's the most playing kitchen.
In order to spend the whole village, looking at each corner, it needs not less than three hours.
But if you go, not traveling on electronic cars, you're opened and the house of the Canadian shop with income and chamber with a rebuilding bathroom, and a bicycle office, and a cheap, and a parking, and a color shop, and a shop with the products of daily consumption, and a mail with unique markets (that you can't even survive from Chinese fleeters), banks and offices, shops, and photos.
And later night, when you are asked, you're coming to the air of the olive tree, a variety of lenses in the memory of the abandoned world of friends and parents of the atlets.
And you'll be under the shopping of the machine, which is uncomfortablely smoking for the death of insects, to think about everlasting.
I mean, the Olimpiade movement.
There's no end in this village for a minute.
As long as the rest of the Russian world was breathing, the Australians were not ordered to have been sentenced to the American Dream Team, which the real pesticides went into the network.
A little person knows, the news that Inna Deligue wins gold in the XXXI Olimpian Games, I received the first.
Maybe I'm even the only mosaic who saw this happening - not to be considered to those who looked out that evening in Carioca.
This can be aware of only the real slaughter.
Imagine: The deep night of Moscow.
The neighbors down, as always to the night, are slept and starting unfortunately, but very much to smile each other.
And it's threatening to move the kitchen.
On the kitchen, cran is no time to go to the market and buy how he asked a new sandwich.
There was nothing in the television schedule, so it was just the control of the Matt channel, the "First" and any of the cases of Russia, although it was almost unreasonable.
Russia is the family of repeats, all the sports there's a reason for a record.
There are serials in direct ether translating.
Hope, of course, to Matt's whole night, a young man shouted in newspapers first about the great half-fill of Delivela, Shanaeva, then about the gorgeous battle for gold.
It would be logical to show.
But instead of that, the United States, Australia.
I can't say anything bad about this.
Australians were equivalent, the first half of their gains.
They were placed on the place of the guards from their own large Americans.
As a result, they have been lost, but, as now are, the Basketbol Olympic tourist will not be previous.
It's all right, but it's close to the battle with De France, and on the screen without changes.
In a easy panel, I'm starting to post the channels.
That's a feeling, the second time it's crazy.
All right, let's go back to the cable.
There's no thematic "Matchy" phenomenon.
Oh, my feelings, the battle will start.
Some sporting websites do not affect me.
The court Cerfing provides an unexpected but unexpected result.
The " Perv." website provides a direct technical transmission of all condenses that are in that time.
I click on a phenomenon, I get gold units.
The degree is very contractual, goes forward - and it is obviously starting a long time.
Italians are almost totally reacting.
We're at one point, until the end will hear more than two seconds.
De Franciska is shocked down to Derглаzov, and it declines, the time ends, the Italian shoes.
We're winning!
After a few seconds, the Olympic messenger reports about the fourth gold meal.
It's out, I'm the first one who saw it with my eyes.
Insensitive, faithful, affiliated.
The Muslim Musulman (DM) Tataristan ' s spirit is rejected by the use of Russian language in the swords.
Last night, the DOM bonded his masters to take five-year preaching only to Tatarese to put young tatars “to study their own language”.
The administration states that it does not harm the Muslim's right to other nationalities.
In some dreams, the Tatarian language is not understood by 60 per cent, among whose foreign students, migrants and their taxi.
The people are afraid that their preaching in the Tatarian "no goes to the whole hearing."
Last night, the DOM Tataristan decided to carry out fifth preaching in the dreams of the Republic only in the Tatarian language.
As the muffin of Tataristan Camille Samgirlin stated, this should be a stimulation for young tatars "to study their family language".
"To those who say it's hard, we're trying to organize the lessons of the Tatarian language completely free", said Mr. Samuellin.
He added that “decision has already entered into force” and today in all the dreams of preaching“ must be already in the Tatarian language. ”
He recalled that D.M. Tataristan published the school magazine with standard preaching in the Tatar language.
The names that are inadequately good say in Tatark, "that may prepare for it."
DOM Tataristan combines more than thousands of income in all the municipalities of the Republic.
According to the Muffatian, the five - year - old preaching areas are exclusively carried out in Tatar language.
At the same time, in Kazakhstan, a number of swords were previously used as Russian.
In particular, as the muffie stated, this was practiced in Burnav's sword, Zacabana and Eniler.
Nevertheless, Mr. Muhammedtin stressed that the leadership was the task of all students to possess both public languages independence on nationality.
"Don't matter what distress the Muslim-Netator can't be," emphasized Mr. Mohammed, explaining that the preaching itself "is not a binding part of the nams."
In this way, the namosis will continue to read on the Arab, the swords keep lessons and lessons in Russian language.
At the same time Rafik Muhammedishin said that there was no serious threat to extinction of Tatarian language from the sword.
In addition to Russian and Tatarian other languages, such as Zambic or Tajik, there are no use in the preaching in the Republic.
The decision of the DOM was actively supported in the Tatar World Congress Committee.
The executive head of the VCT Rinat Zakiros said, "The men are the important part of our national life."
It would be painful if the Tatarian language was gone.
He noted that the preaching of only the Tatarian language is “the desire of the same names”, but in the executive ICT, "that is right".
The names of the Russian preaching are ready to carry out the decision of DM but believe that the desire is difficult with the understanding of the priests.
The sword walks and the tatars and the Russians.
Many do not understand language.
They will, of course, be disappointed.
"It's supposed to be overlooked," says the Burnav's sword Farhat Mawletdin.
In his words, preach more closely in Russian language, because "Russian and schools, and in children, the radio is an ideal."
However, he believes that the sword will continue to learn and learn in Russian languages that are conducted in other days.
We trust in God.
And Allah will show out of this situation."
But about 60% of us don't know Tatarian language.
It's too sweethearts, taxi, and azerbaijans.
Many go to us foreign students: Africans, arabes.
"We have four years as we went to Russian language," said they.
He believes that in the Tatar language the preaching will "towards a closer circle and will not go to the whole hearing."
But we will submit to the full decision.
Only the results of the preaching work will be different.
But it's time to show.
"My, for example, will be easier because the Tatarian is my family," said Gabulla Galilein.

Anomy Snapchat Effect criticizes as a career in Asia
Snapchat claims that this filter is inspired, but some suspects say that it is racially free.
The Snapchat tool allows approximately 150 million users to change the reality and to play personally with ways that are limited to the absorption.
You can convert yourself into ananas, dogs, or persons, to make up the image of Roy Liechtenstein.
Lines are the strikes that cover instruments that make more than 30 million rejusted villages a day.
All mistakes are soon known.
Snapchat Lines were sent to a criticism in the past when they were accused of the application of the dark skin of the person or promoting the elected persons as the ideal of the beauty.
So when some users proposed a lympe that had given them spaced eyes, dentists and smells, some critics found that racist cards on Asians were "hellolits".
They questioned whether these recurrences were towards a more serious issue of the company related to diversity.
In the midst, communications and consequences of the reports in The Verge and Motherboard were distributed, and on the next day after Snapchat claimed that it had been removed.
The company proposed: Linse was designed as an anam, not as a career in Asians.
But experts who know racism not listened, Linza recalled the distressing stereotypes in action.
Others fully rejected the comparison with anae.
In the electronic letter Grace Sparapani, a corean American art student who was actively shared on the photos, said that the lince was "awesome and at least smooth."
She added that " was hard to face with the comparison of the side of the Asian career and the effects of the filter.
This shows that the filter is not just ironic, but in the top of a degradable iron.
Snapchat is not the only company through these cultural bridges.
The American culture seems to be involved in a struggle for diversity and inclusiveness, starting from corporate meetings to Hollywood and girls, which we all have.
And the great hearing of young people in Snapchat, who are raised more than their old generation, may mean that they are more likely to expect understanding.
When one of Snapchat's rings creates a painful image for the user, he said at the 25th-year-old Catty Jo, "the events are much more difficult to remain unremarked as it was before."
On Thursday, Ju, the product manager and engineer working at Medium decided to remove the accounting record in Snapchat and called others to do the same.
In the Medium article and in the phone interview, she said that racial oppositions were the cause of an inadequate diversity in Sneepte.
Jhu was predominantly discovered by a white company that was only a man and ended her article by the hashtego: #DeleteSnapchat.
Juu, who is the American origin of China, wrote: "If they have no sufficient number of non-white people in the State who could take such decisions, or work unbelievable people, they do not work as a position for which they can be safe and openly expressed."
Other investigators share the view of it, expressing unfortunateness that Snapchat did not respond to the majority of its questions.
The company does not publish information on the presentation of national minorities in its State, emphasising its status of the private company.
The fourth Snapchat refused to discuss the racial origin of his staff, but, according to the reliable person, the company recently started a publisher in order to concentrate in inadequate population areas and active attempts to integrate internal resources.
From his side, John said she will keep his accounting record in Snapchat closed, adding: "I'm interesting if they really need more users like us to say that that's not going."
The Military Guidelines reported on IICs and reports to the Committee of the Congress
The officials of the Central Force Commander of the United States have changed the information reports to submit a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the basis of the event on the place, reported the Committee of the Conference in the report issued on Thursday.
The interim report of the operational group established by the Presidency of the Palestinian Committee on Affairs of the VC, the Research Committee and the Subcommittee on Military Contributions has discovered "widespread disadvantaged " among the analysis of the central commanding service, which claims that the leaders have sent their evaluation of American action to win against the Islamic State.
The Central Commandment, known as Center, is the main military management in the city of Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
" The information documents identified by the Headquarter of the Centre had generally given a more optimistic image of the United States anti-terrorism action as confirmed by real data on the place of events, and were stablely more optimistic than the analysis provided by other special servants," said the report.
“What happened in Century, we are unacceptable: when the Supreme Leader is an unfaithful analysis, our military sufferings,” said the representative of the Kan Calvert, the Republic of California.
The leadership problems in the Centre are reached by the most higher organization.
Decimal reports have been discussed with details of the insufficient reports in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of the American Actions aimed at training armed Iraq ' s armed forces provided by the Headquarter.
Although it does not contain the final evidence that the Administration of Obama had ordered to fail the reports, he said that analyticals felt that the Headquarter had to present them more optimistic views on the threat of the Islamic State, also known as IHIL or ISIL.
"In the first half of 2015, many presss, statements and witnesses of the Central Commanding in the Congress were significantly optimistic than real events,” reported.
For example, the official of the Century stated that the large military attack aimed at Mosul return could already be started in April or May 2015.
Mosul, second in the largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
“After the investigation, it is known for a month,” said the Party's delegation of Mike Pompeo, the Republic of Canasas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the United States Headquarter Headquarters has distributed commanding information to reduce the threat of IHL in Iraq.
The Republicans had established a operational group when they learned that analysis expressed concern that the Islamic State reported had been phalised.
In the progress of the investigation reported on Thursday, more detailed data are followed.
The main inspector of the Ministry of Defence is the main inspector of the Centre of Inspectors that are not completed at this time.
The representatives of the Democratic Party in the Palestinian Representatives of the United States Congress have published their own data, agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republic of Operational Group.
“In 2014 and 2015, the Centre has established a excessive procedure for assessing the information evaluation of IHL and Iraq ' s troops,” states in the statement of the members of the Party of Adam B. Shif, the principal representative of the Democratic Party in the Committee.
This procedure, as Shifth said, "is inherited the outcome of the disclosure documents", harmed the moral status of analysis and "insufficiently reflects expenditure".
However, Shif and the Democratics claim that the White House had not found evidence that the Century House had tried to shoot the analysis of the Century to shoot their arrests under a "designed or political interpretation".
The preliminary results of the Congress investigation were submitted on Tuesday The Daily Beast.
In August last, the New York Times reported that there was an investigation of the main Inspector Pentagon opened after the complaints of Centko analysis.
Commissioner Patrick Evans, representative of Pentagon, said that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the report of the Assembly until the investigation of the main inspector continues.
But he said that “experts sometimes disappear in the views of the comprehensive data process, and the Services and the Ministry of Defence welcome the healthy dialogue on these important issues relating to national security”.
The results of the investigation are a question of whether the purposes of the American Bombering Bomber in Iraq and Syria are reached (which is now more representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
But last year, the statements are considered that President Obama may believe that the Central Commandment provides real evaluation of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other critical points.
The criticisms made by the Islamic State are repeating the disputes that were placed over ten years when the investigation analysis of Center Gregory Hucker wrote a research article in which it stated that the Administration of George Walker Bush, because of many protest analysts, had been supported by a small number of armed forces in Iraq and did not think that the invasion of 2003 would be followed.
Hucker also played a key role in the protest launched by the Islamic State.
Last year, according to the officers, the Hucker team concluded that, despite the public statements on return, the aircrafts on the oil firms belonging to the Islamic State did not cause a significant deterioration of the financial situation of the terrorist group because it built temporary oil to sell in the black market.
However, opening was not distributed outside the Central Command, as reported in the Times September.
The first commander of Centko, General Lloyd J. Ostin III, had been criticized last year after witnesses in Senate, which many deputy had regarded the extreme optimistic evaluation of war.
General Ostin went to the departure in April and was registered in the Hen Joseph L. in the Headquarter of the Headquarter.

Britain and the United States teams meet at Saturday at the last game of the first tour.
Both teams claim for the fourth finance, and the results of the game will determine who will take the first place in their six teams, and who is the second.
The winner will avoid meetings with a strong team from Holland, the leaders of another group, a little weather when the four-fill game is started.
However, the Saturday Game shows that the Americans here have struck their unexpected series, four years later after they took the last place among 12 London games.
Bam was in that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, first took a shock for meat, when she was 3 (ther older sisters played in the sport in Drexel) and joined a national collective in the age of 16, became her youngest player in history.
She missed the Olympiadu 2008 when she did not pass the finance tower.
Then, 2012, when it wasn't over her and her team partner.
The next year, Coig Parnham, was appointed as a trainer, and it started to change.
"Cultural change, psychological change, change in physical training," said Bam.
In London we had no productivity that is now.
We have completely changed our views.
On Thursday night, Bam opened a count in the first half of the flight game with a short distance.
India came to the game without a single victory in the tourist, but the team showed himself to the surprise of the wheel and maintained the amount of 1-0 to the end of the third period when Baham took the initiative in his hands.
She made a long passenger with a layer down the left side of the field, then spotted into the middle and sent a smooth to the door, so the Americans gave the advantage of 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez added a final hole in the midst of the fourth period.
The winning was the first in the tourner for the United States flights of Hanky Briggs, who passed on one hole in each of the first three winners.
She's in the shooting.
Like Bam.
"We are in a good situation right now," says Parnham, but it depends on the outcome of Saturday Game.
Without the Olympic Game, "Zen" basket games
Whereever you were, it's Olimpiade.
The events in Rio de Janeiro are inevitably and inevitable, this is a better combination of conspiration and efforts.
It's like the olympic fire, and there's the horrible fake that is transferred from the cheese to the giant to the triatlonist.
You can't enable TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the cafe and not to hear about Simone Bails, Cathy Ledecks or the shock between Michael Felix and Chad de Chloe.
And there's also Logan Duley.
Duley, who is the first part of the Olympic Games, could be among the famousitys shown in the tray-times of the sponsor and the reliable public roles, if he is a plumb, ginost, or even a fectalist.
But the 28-year-old Duley from the town of Lake Force in California is fighting for gold in the olympic coasts on the bathroom.
The Olympic fire does not observe all the events similarly.
Besides the center, in the dark, there are the types of sports that are not commonly recognized: a fire from a powder weapons, a shooting, a badminton, a shooting.
Brass will always be with us as long as his kingdom is.
But if I have been allowed to protect your personal apprentice, let me take your attention to the modest advertising of the bathroom.
Although bathrooms are an olimpy species since 2000, when they were dealing with games in Sidney, they received so little recognition that many of my requested people were not aware that they were really related to the olympic sports.
This may be regional inutility.
The United States wished and sent sports to decoration, they never winned meal in the shuttle, and their sports did not end up to 2012.
Chinese and Russians are generally shared in the courageous rewards, and Chinese and Canadian women are women.
Dun Dun from China and Rouzi McClenan from Canada will protect their London gold meal this year.
But the bathrooms have an autsyder sharm, in particular because they are better associated with the circle college than with the Olympic games.
I have to acknowledge that I'm not an expert, but just a landed enthusiast.
They really have a comic potential — a carcase of unfinished springs — but also the extraction of hymnastics and water tanks, two types of sports, which are mainly associated with themselves.
The word "batut" comes from the Spanish word "el trampoline", which means "trumpling for water."
The winning candidates are shocked on the guiant bathroom, flying at about 30 feet [30 feet] air, and the series of acrobatic tricks (turns, slows and salts) must be filled to the final landscape at feet.
They are assessed by the implementation, complexity and " time of flight " in accordance with the official Olympic Games.
30. Two sports from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will be confronted in Rio.
The most distributed olimpine course is first.
The applicants should go forward, faster, above and above in the golden flight, sometimes to the finish, and sometimes back and first, there by field.
They are not only trying to finish or older stone, but also to the television cameras, to another swimming ride: a world or olimpholic recurso.
This is a deep effort to strive, worthy, even fanaticly — and it is enough to make a swimming even the slaughter.
But I think it's a few of the games.
He's got a shock on the bathroom.
Batuist shipping up.
Move forward is not target.
He or she points out that it seems weak as a astronom, fly up, then down, then without efforts again up.
There is no competitive or difficulty in them, but there is no smell of finishing in all the programs, there is no long-term pieces, just a wonderful time disappearance and degradation.
It's the nearest oil type of sport.
Women's qualifications, and then the finish will go on Friday, transmission at Eastern European time; husbands in Saturday, also at the time.
NBC will translated the finance within the daily programme starting from 14:00 a.m. at both day.
A peaceful, beautiful moment is expected in the shape of Olimpiade.
And if the growth of consciousness can only be achieved by a male sports and objection, as stated in the Wall Street Journal, recently proposed men from the United States, Duly is only waiting for their new excited fans.
Generation protests in Ethiopia, the former United States Union
Year protesters in Ethiopia
Demons that require political change in Ethiopia faced a angry opposition by the Government.
The witnesses say that decades of protesters were deadly blessed during the police clamps.
Is Ethiopia really on the grain of shock?
In the past decade, she was one of the most stabil African countries, a strong Western Union with a rapid development economy.
But in the past months, the anti-governmental protesters have struck the country, distributing its territory more.
Only the last week, thousands of people have been on the street, requireing radical political changes.
The Government ' s response to human rights was cruel.
The witnesses claimed that the police officers had shooted tens of unarmed demonstrators.
Video records from the Protest place, which are intended to be deleted at the end of the last year or at the beginning of this year, show that the security officers kill young people with balls when they put their hands to the wall.
The United Nations High Office for Human Rights now calls for a careful investigation.
"It was always difficult to keep this country away, and it will continue to be more complicated," said Rashid Abdi, head of the African Rog project in the international research group.
Ethiopia is a second African country after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by Western.
American military and disclosure services closely cooperate with ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and almost no country in Africa has received such support.
Ethiopian economy is developed with impressive speed.
Her infrastructure has significantly improved, and there is even a new reward trip to Addis Abbe.
And her streets are normally quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia was a picture of democracy - human rights organizations always mention government repressions - the opposition on the territory of the State has been presumed by dissidents have actually been able to silence.
Many of them were slaughtered, sentenced in prison, murdered or disfellowshipped in the remote desert.
But that can change.
"If people are constantly spend and not left other options except to protest, the resurrection is up," said Seum Teshmae, university student in Central Ethiopia.
All youths protest.
The generation is protesting.
The complaints are many, starting from the earth-use, finished by the government's coalition.
After the widely critical elections in the past year, the Government and its unions have completely strengthened the opposition and now controlled 100 per cent of the Parliament.
At the same time, the tension around the border with Eritrea grows; the struggle for this undetermined, controversial border has led to hundreds of lives in June.
Analytics are afraid that separate groups who have been destroyed in the past few years, such as the Liberation Front or the National Liberation Fund of Obama, may try to use concerns and rearme.
A number of factors explain why painful feelings, a few years smiling in the depth of the soul, are now smiling.
First, it would seem to be completely unfair: smartphones.
Only in the past few years a large number of ethiopians have been able to share in social networks, since low smartphones have become common and internet services have been better.
Even when the Government closes access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often happens, especially during protests, many people still find the opportunity to share through the server proxy that hide where they are.
Many young ethiopians said that they were organized for protests.
Second, there are more solidarity between Ormo and Amhara, two major ethnic groups.
Ormoo and Amhara are not natural unions.
Over the centuries, Amhara, from the best Christian high-good areas of Ethiopia, has prospered in policies and business, Ormo, which many of them are Muslims and live in lower areas.
But that's also changed.
"We will act with a message under a single start," said Murau Gamech, leader of Ormo.
The main protesters went in Amhara and Ormo.
Many of the Amhara and Ormoto feel that Ethiopia is injustly dominating members of the Ethiopia Ethiopia, which consists of about 6 per cent of the population and controls military and discernment services, trade and policies.
The third reason for concern is the loss of Melles Zenaway.
Meles, former resident, complied with the responsibility of the Prime Minister of Ethiopia under 17 years of age, to death from unknown disease in 2012.
He was considered tactical, a person who could predict the danger.
Analytics argued that he had particularly recognized the first signs of injury and used investigators to obtain data and reduce antipersons.
“The current regime is not a good meaning,” said Abdi, analysis of conflict situations.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalney, appeared there and took place with Melissa.
Unlike Meles, a birth of the city of Tunisia in the northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam, Southern.
Analytics say he does not use confidence in the security services controlled by Youike.
Many are afraid that it will lead to more bloodprostitution.
The last time Etiopía had survived such concerns in 2005, after thousands of people protested against what analysis seemed to have been elected by the Government, and then resulted.
Many protesters were killed during the following repressions, although less than the last months were compared, and the concern period was relatively fast.
Development experts expressed appreciation to the leaders of Ethiopia for a dimensive development of infrastructure, such as a new trail trail and significant success in combating poverty.
But it is obvious that it did not stop the growth of internal inhumanity by the Government of Ethiopia.
And it takes a dangerous ethical form.
Last month, the protesters in Honduras, the city of Amhara attacked the companies belonging to Tunisia, and the Anti-Tagular Hasting in social networks became a comprehensive.
Analytics stated that protesters are the United States and other Western Unions in an unfair situation.
The American Government used Ethiopia as a base for unpilot fleet over neighbouring Somalia, although recently announced that the base was closed.
From one part, it is clear that western wants to support democracy, but he does not want to lose his union to the already unstable region.
"And it will be hard to go through this pressing Canada," said Abigail.
Donald Tramp explains his statement that IHIL was based on Obama, "Sarpam"
Donald J. Tramp tried to forget the last conflict covering his forecast stage on Friday, claiming that he was smiling when a few times in this week said that President Obama and Hilary Clinton were "building" of a terrorist group of the Islamic State.
It explained new questions regarding the opinion of the candidate on the President of the Republic of the Republic of America.
It also set his Vice-Chairpersons, who tried to protect him during the concern, in an uncomfortable situation, since they had to explain the expressions that he probably did not mean.
He expressed this proposal for the midnight, Tramp urged his approval on Friday, repeating in the interview that he really wanted to say that President and Clinton founded IHL.
But in the early morning in Twitter, the Tramp wrote that he was just shocked.
This post was a direct contrary to the approval made all day before Tramp claimed in several interviews that he was absolutely serious in his accused.
When the Radio Resident Hue Huitt tried to help Trampou mere explanation, remembering that Obama wants to destroy the IHIL, the candidate at the position of the President of the Republic of the Party did not use the opportunity.
The last scandal was discovered when Tramp tried to reorientate its campaign on the background of the rail reduction.
Tramp and Clinton were discussed with competitive issues about the economy in Michigan this week.
On Thramp again tried to return to this subject.
Once he went to Twitter, he warned that the Clinton plans would lead to increased tax, and said that she was sweet.
Tramp used the shrine as a correction.
At the end of July, after he struggled the global criticism, he almost expressed the idea that the Russians should cut the email of Clinton later explained his comments, saying, "I'm swear."
This approach allows the Trampou to go beyond the limits of the permitted in the political speech and his brothers to return in case of need.
"I think that's his way to test the communications that have a response among his worshipers, to look at how they work, and then to explain them in the other part, depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert on the analysis of the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's careful in his statements and knows that they are enough to be able to treat them differently.
Instead of shutting the expressions for a wide electorate, Tramp took more vulnerable ton in the last days, while its raying continues to fall.
The New NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Thursday, showed that Tramp enters Clinton with a large overflow in Northern Caroline, Virginia and Colorad and goes with her in Florida.
Although the Tramp is generally trying to forgive the producation of things that say, he often accuses its critics in wrong interpretation of his words and inconsistent of his humor feelings.
But as Trump was an object of higher attention in the last months of the presidency campaign, his sweet was put to his faithful unions in a bad situation: it should be publicly supported by what kind of statements it would have been.
Rudolf W. Juliani, former Mr. New York, who is one of the most famous Vice-Presidents of Trampa, has made severe efforts to protect the candidate to the interview given by the CNN on Friday.
"I think he said is an acceptable political comment," said Julian when he asked for the validity of the approval of Trampa that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
It is true that IGIL was almost an unknown small organization, and he called it an unprecedented threat, absolutely injustly, and that's why it happened, because he issued the army from Iraq.
The majority of the Mediterranean Republicans believed that the Obama Administration, in which Clinton was employed by the State Secretary, allowed IHL to disappear, since it was not grateful to control the situation in the Middle East.
Before the minute in Pennsylvania, the Tramp continued to attack the media in Twitter for the dismissing of each of his words and the prerequisition of him.
He was shocked about the "functions" television experts that try to think about him, and said, "He's weak!"
Some democratics expressed the judgments of Trampa as the most reaffirmed that it would not be paid to the Presidents.
Sometimes the extraordinary coffee returns to Greenpoint
The Verb coffee was a whispering shore that took only places in Williamsberg, where it wasn't Wi-Fi, but gave a good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, it was removed from her place with the vitrine at the Bedford Avenue.
The Soup Sheri Magazine, which took the Varb year 2014, is selling a mile in the cases.
Local people cryed to it as the last loss of the updated city.
"New York is always changed, I know, but I can't believe that CBGB's dead, the hotel Chalsey is destroyed, and the Varb is now a shopping."
But some New York is constantly changed, he's up-to-date.
The born coffee "Werb" was opened in November last year in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original place.
The new "Werbe" has Wi-Fi and takes credit cards, but some of them remained the same staff and the same simple atmosphere.
Cafe is still good.
Simon Rodriguez, an old staff of the old coffee, is the owner and the general manager at the new place.
He began working in Verbe in 2001 and was there until the end was.
When one of the customers suggested that it was a new place, he said that it would be joyful.
Rodriguez, 36 years old, left a lot in the previous view.
"Werb" works with the same bagel diploma and purchase the same model of coffee.
It has even been set out the old Varba.
But Rodriguez said he would also want to experimentate.
He proposed new observances.
The sandwich is presented in the menu, with bacon, eggs and skins, and is available in the existence of skins or smells.
There's a guard from the white quality.
The coffee doesn't get a drink anymore, but now they're preparing sweet sucks.
9 months later, Rodríguez said that he had focused on the unlike flow of old permanent clients.
"A few former customers have also paid prices from Williamsberg," he shared.
Rebecca Olivier was one of the recent resurrections.
Olivier, 34 years old, lived in Williamsberg and often visited Warb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she was still going there.
After the Verba closed, she said she stopped drinking coffee at some time.
"I understood the coffee and the atmosphere put me in the Warbe," she said.
Now she's drinking a coffee again, even though at that day she ordered a coffee purchased, another news.
Tom Cental, another old customer, was dedicated to visit Verb since 2003.
He was in front of the work and ordered the same.
"In the eighth minutes, every day, as at hours, I came, and for me prepared my bag with oil and all the beginnings," he said.
Rodriguez made what he wanted to experiencing and introduce new observances in the menu.
Centeral still makes a common order today, but once he changes something with bicon, eggs or bagels with all starts.
Rodriguez said he wasn't on the dinner that the winter had ever had a old place.
Moreover, the Soup Sheri owners suggested to make a special milk for "Werba" by using coffee coffee prepared as a cold ingringer.
"I think we may agree on their proposal," said Rodriguez.
The permanent inhabitants of Greenpoint of Poland also loved this coffee.
One of these new customers moved the menu into the Poland language, and Rodriguez said that he plans to find a place for him in the winter so that his new neighbors would feel desirable.
The new place has other benefits.
The local socket point is planned to differ on bottles and to sell coffee prepared in a cold way.
There is the possibility that the coffee joins its neighbor building.
For many customers, the new "Werb" includes their favorite observances in the menu.
Joseph Whitt was a permanent customer and told him he was killed by a pain when they closed.
When the coffee was opened to a new place, Whitt said that when I entered and commanded the coffee, he felt like he returned home.
"When long I wanted to feel this aroma," he admitted.
Depressive food of depression in "Plural Trapease"
In March 1933, after the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt dinner at the Olympic Office.
As a gurman, President Ruizelt loved the moderate observance of the Fifth Avenue, for example, foa game and the Mediterranean sweet.
His menu was more modest on that day: sweet eggs in tomate soße, card-filled powder and desel-pounding.
"This was an act of culinary solidarity with people suffering," said Jane Gigelman.
Her husband Andrew Cow added: "This was also the message to the Americans about how to ask them."
The couples living in Brooklin-Hites are food history specialists.
The last book of Cowa, "Lagu Po-China", was dedicated to the Chinese kitchen in America, and Gigelman told the history of life in the coal apartment in the lower East Side, through food in his book "The 97th House on the French garden".
The new joint work of the "Please Trapey", which will be published in the Sunday of Harper, is the history of American food in the Great Depression.
When they showed their own culinary solidarity, they met a dinner reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small shopping area in the Flatian Quartal, which works since 1929 in the Birdshaw.
Giggelman, 54, ordered a bleeding skin and a butterbow with oil shoes, and Cou, 57, took an indic, a cartone and a vegetable smell.
When the reporter ordered a milk route, the couple read the appropriate shipping point for the discussion of food at the Depression era.
"The roulets used a larger question," said Gingerman.
There was a swimming rule, a swimming rule, a bomb rule.
They were made from the main ingring and milk products that were enabled to increase the ingredient.
Imagine that you eat so much as you need for dinner.
Cou's been threatened.
"It's sure he was in a stone fat," he said.
In the years before the American table was represented by the Swedish table, especially in rural areas.
Women's groups were prepared for farmers, and the swimming swimming pig was offered at breakfast, dinner and dinner.
The Americans have sent food to the hungers of Europeans during the First World War, and the "Trape" describes how the country has seen soon that it was stopped to be a country of a nation.
"It was time when the food became a central and unfair topic for the Americans," said Cou, explaining why he and his wife decided to write it.
The new budget ratio was so simply: remarkable observances, such as routines and safes, became the main food products; the insurance is "a wonderful way to sweat", noted Gingerman, because the swimming smell could hide in a sweet soup.
The fresh fruit was replaced by more decreasing sugars.
The meat, which has been the former American food base for many years, has become an economicly distributed vegetable.
People were worried about strange shocks because energy and food values were more important than skin and even culinary.
In the study of the book includes receptives, Gigerman prepared the blood of that epoch: a smooth swallowed skin.
"This addition to the dinner table was not successful," said Cou.
Gielman added, "This was very strange."
The skin oil is not perfectly in the smell.
This was characterized for many household receipts.
As ever since, household specialists, including Louise Stanley, the Federal Officer of the Hospital Office, managed food addictions from 1923 to 1943.
The publication of receptives and articles in newspapers and magazines recommended women to become “budgetary representatives”, to take the calls and to convert the lost snacks of marbles in sight.
"Pluck Trapese" is the shock of favorite historic facts.
In particular, the reports of the Government ' s responses to the hunger citizens, such as the position of President Gerbert Gubert, in the spirit "the power of pigs".
It was publicly transferred to a simple farmer strike of the State of Ivoir at the time of his childhood, and he was eating as a million of people who had become.
"He liked the continental kitchen, for example, a fish with a sweet soup," said Cou.
He eats almost in a slippery table, smelling.
He was fantasticly disfellowshipped from reality.
The President Rutzell could make the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not recommended to give him a example of his own desire.
As says in the book, Eleanor Roosevelt launched a economy that was not perfectly interested in the shooting, and this resulted in the "not only use of the most unique food in Washington, but sometimes and the most reversely prepared".
Many of the culinary receipts of Depression were forgotten when the country was back to the feet.
Their heritage is our permanent focus on calories and food, says Gigelman, and how science has been used in the preparation of food.
The couples say that during the writing of the book, they have better understanded the nutrition of Zegelman’s mother — that she couldn’t eat, for example.
"It was seriously scared of an innocent relationship with food," said Cou.
Gielman recalls: "He's fully seen people."
It was one unfortunate case with profiles.
When the bathrooms in Eisenberg's past, they and Cou had a dezer that prepared the house: a dezer of the sweet pool that President Ruizell eat at dinner.
"This is called a museum of smellful," said Gigelman, adding that it was distributed to give modest brood receptors.
It was not only bleeding, soft, sofa, water, and sweat.
Everyone was loaded a lie in a lyrics, corns, and slippered substances.
It was amazing.
A couple of times requested additional additions.
He said to her wife, "The name of the Greek orbits would not be hindered here. "

Gilead companies will pay costs for law enforcement services during the controversy of the Hepatite C with the Markk company
The company of Gilead Sciences Inc has the right to repay the costs of law entitled to the case of the Hepatitis C manufacturer of the Merck & Co Inc, decided to the federal environmental court.
In June, the Gilead company was released from $200 million for the violation of two market company patents with regard to the drugs of Gilead, sales leaders, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the American Court found a number of violations from the market company, including injury and other non-ethical acts.

Clinton paid $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of the federal tax rates
Hillary Clinton has distributed its tax statements for 2015, which showed that the candidates from the President of the Democratic Party and her husband had $10.75 million income and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent in this year.
In 2015, Clinton received $1 million in the form of good-budgetary contributions, mainly, at the Clinton Fund, the former President, Bill Clinton, received about $5,3 million in the form of explanation soldiers, and the former State secretariat stated that there was $3 million from Simon & Schuster for its book of residence to the Department of State.
The Potential Vice-President Clinton, United States Senator Tym Keen from Virginia, together with his wife, Anna Holton, has made tax statements for 10 years.
In 2015, they paid the effective federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
“Hillery Clinton and Tim Keen continue to establish financial transparency standards,” said the advisor of the predicted stage of Clinton Jennifer Palmeier.
In full contradiction, Donald Tramp is hidden by details and violates his last promises to promote its tax declarations.
This is the general case for candidates to the President of the United States to publish their tax statements, although the law of them does not require it.
The New York businessman Trump and his lawyers called a check of the State Tax Service as a reason for his refusal to promote their tax statements.
In Twitter, the Adviser of the Pre-selection Statue of Clynton Yan Sams wrote that a candidate was declared by the Democratic Party.
In the Friday, the Special Adviser Michael Coan said CNN did not allow Trampo to leave them before the check is completed.
The Trempa Critics, including the candidate to the President of the Republic of the Republic of 2012, Miss Romney and other Republic of the Republic, said that he refused to demand questions about his status, his welfare contributions, his business operations and other links, including Russia.
Clinton was disappointed for this issue and the online video was issued on Thursday, which was the main place for the republicans who avoided Trampa to generate tax accountability.
On Thursday, she addressed this issue during the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what everyone did without exception of the candidate to the President for decades: to publish its tax statements," she said to be gathered.
The Political Journal reported that Tramp had not paid any or almost no tax in the 1990s, and New York Times' business advisor had quoted many lawyers on cash and boughters who believed that the case may still remain.
The federal tax rates became a object of conflict on the presidential elections.
Clinton supported the rules referred to by a billion investor Warren Baffitta, which would ensure that those receiving more than $1 million would pay tax rate as at least 30 per cent.
The Chairman Barak Obama also supported the proposal.
At the meeting with Clynton last week in Omaha, in the Nebraska State, Baffett, whose Conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based there, proposed to meet and exchange tax declarations.
Baffittet said he was also under the IRS check, and that Tramp was scared not tax collector, but electors.
The Clinton Previous headquarters has generated tax declarations until 2007.
Clintons who are now living in Chappaku, New York, have paid the average federal tax rate of about 32 per cent from 2007 to 2014 and the effective co-acquire tax rate of about 40.5 per cent.
The Clinton Declaration for 2015 showed that only 100 dollars of their revenue were paid.
Their main investment was an inadequate index fund, and the Clinton stated that the capital was $109,000.

Conservation of tyles and feverships increases the protection of dance shoes
The fighters in Tanzania use an untraditional way to prevent the slaughter in the pools of the people’s pools — they cast the preserves filled with a sweet chile.
The method was effective, and the organization of Honeyguide Foundation, which was headed over this idea a few years ago, together with the American Natural Protection Committee, has been able to promote it by training volunteers in northern Tanzania to use the non-weapon-weapon-related steps to protect their homes and visits without prejudice to animals.
Many of them used cops to protect themselves.
Thursday, the World Day of the Sloans, dedicated to the protection of animals.
"When we have developed a set of instruments ..., we look at the change in the relationship within these communities, because they are much more sure that they will not be able to put slopes into their fields without caused damages," said the executive director Honeyguide David Bell.
The first two steps are in the shift of the fake before the infringement of the slopes and the signals with the corner.
If it couldn't be distracted, they're shooted like that.
The sweet chile shocked with the boy is in the reserve, and the end is shut up, the physician is only outside.
When the storm is burned with a snake, a small snake swimming in the air is cut into the shock.
One dunning is usually enough to turn the slopes to the other side.
The main measure is a launching device that shoots Roman sheep in the air by making a heavy, light explosion.
Turkey has not yet returned 32 Turkish diplomates, who left the country after the attempt to overcome in July this year.
This was the chapter of the MID of Turkey Mevlut Chauschhol, in contact with local journalists.
At the first stage, we sent 208 career diplomates to continue to work in the center.
32 persons without objective reasons and explanations have not returned," said the head of the Turkish external government.
Remember, in July, the attempt of public turns occurred in Turkey.
The authorities of the country were officially declared that the detention of more than six thousand people had been detained, among them the military responsibilities of the higher and medium-sized band.
According to the MID of Turkey, 290 people died because of the temptation.
The Jewish recorder closely discovered the Berlin hotel for the removal of the Israeli phone code on the Arabs, reported the RT News channel
The French resident of the Jewish origin launched a scandal in the media, discovering that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin has no phone code in the list of Israelite, and the servants are referring to "procees" from the Arab clients.
Crow Lanzman, author of a documentary film on Holocaust Shoa, expressed his frustration by Kempinski Bristol in Berlin, wrote an open letter in the German FAZ media.
During its recent stay in the Lanzman hotel, Israel tried to find the phone codes provided by the hotel.
However, the country was not mentioned among States where the room could be called directly.
How could it happen that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of New Germany, Israel was excluded and eliminated?
Lanceman wrote.
The replacement of Kempinski Bristol provides the opportunity to take Israel through its own phone service centre.
In searching for a statement, the reviewer addressed the question to the housing administration.
The answer he received there, as Lanzman said, "shocked him."
Clark's hotel said that this measure was "decided by the Kempinski network leadership."
The result, standing at this stage, called a larger wrath of the register.
“The majority of our Arab guests, and they needed Israel's code to be removed,” said Lanzman, the hotel servant.
Israel's embassy in Germany Jacob Hadas-Handelsman was called a case of a terrible struggle, reports the Suddeutsche Journal.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's really a terrible shock.
What happened in Germany, and that is the maintenance of the hotel network.
I don't need to explain here.
We hope that the hotel will make the right conclusions", said the official.
It was a small resonance in the Internet; people called it scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski hotel was simply "going on the matter" in the prescribed Arab clients' requirements.
"It would be shocked," said in the other floor where it was indicated that the hotel situated on the glorious Kurfurstendamm Street is close to the synagogue.
The El Spiegel newspaper reported that the hotel itself was fast in place of any accused accused.
“There was no direct order to include Israel in a rapid list,” quotes the representative of the Kempinski newspaper of Suddeutsche Journal.
She adds that code is now added.
The police uses smoke gas and rain guns against protesting Brazilian students
The students gathered the police in the Brazil city San Paulo, on Thursday, when they gathered to protest against government reforms of public education.
The police used smoke gas and rain guns against protesters.
The insurance began when the police officers tried to shoot students, resulting in the use of rain guns and smoke gas.
A number of hundreds of students participated in the demonstration to express their concerns on plans.
In accordance with the proposals of the Governor of the State of San Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, almost 100 public schools will be closed, and 3000,000 students will be redistributed to shoot money.
Some protest participants could have been seen in writing on the walls of graphics against the temporary responsibilities of President Michael Theater.
The last protest took place only a few days after the protesters were on the street to support the distracted President, Dymo Ruseph, when Senator of the country proclaimed for its implant.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71 per cent, reports the RT Business port
The decrease of trade sanctions between Moscow and Teheran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the previous year, as the Russian Ambassador in Iran in Jagaryan.
As international sanctions against Iran have been denied, Russian companies have increased their interest in conducting business in the country, he said the ambassador.
Russian companies are re-linked with Iran, and new companies are ready to get market access.
Of course, the further enlargement of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,” said Jagaryan.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016 the trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 and was $856 million.
In particular, Russian export in Iran increased 91.5 per cent and was $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased 16 per cent, up to $158 million.
The increase in trade has been achieved through machinery, land transport and weapons,” said the police.
Jagara also predicts that Russia visits the record number of Iranian tourists in this year.
In the past year, the diplomatic representative of Russia in Iran issued about 350,000 Visa, mainly to tourists and citizens of Iran.
Furthermore, Iran first entered the number of tourists visiting Russia to the stream of 20 countries.
It can be said with confidence that the last year's record of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be killed,” said he.
At the same time, relatively a few Russians visit Iran, which hopes that the ambassador will change.
"I personally recommend to visit the city of Ishakan, Shiris and Iron, in which the memories of ancient Persian civilization are preserved in good condition," he said.
The State continues to shut up the hikes in the Defence and Industrial Complex.
The "Sistematic incompletion" of the Congress General Almaz Antioch, the "deliveration in the work" and the "reliable loss of confidence".
In the nearest three years, the NGO manager was appointed by Henry Benders.
Information on the disappointment occurred only on Thursday night and did not call a wide resonance in the media.
What could such silence be explained in the conditions of enlargement of the army?
Indeed, the RF leadership does not want to disseminate any hearing or negative provisions in the public environment.
This reaffirms that there are numerous problems in the Defence Industry Complex, and the State does not want to attach its higher attention to society.
The elimination of the disadvantages is, of course, the important events in the area.
"Almas" is the main company of the concert, which is specialized for the production of marine and ground-based machines (COD).
Actually, Almas has work on the establishment of the DRC and Morpheus Policy, which are planned to establish new roots, fruits, smiles and recreaters.
The founder of Russian Military, Dmitri Cornev, believes that the liberation of the projects is slowly slow.
This version is the most logical.
For example, the development of Morfea was still started in 2007, and the entry was prescribed in 2013.
The " Road" should be the main system of OMS on the new IMF ships.
For the information I receive, no tests have been made for a few years.
True as I can judge, there's no unique Almaza fault in this, said Cornev.
The expert is afraid that the delay of the exploitation input may also occur with the CVC.
Experience-building work on the project has not yet been completed, but the first complexs should be in the army during 2016.
In the Minoboron, “the work is planned and all will be completed in the deadlines”, although the State has recognized the existing problems with the development of P-500 in 2014.
It is very difficult to assess the professional quality of Nestradov, guided by Almazuma since 2011.
The Cornee stated that project switchs may be both the cause of freeship.
It believes that in recent years it was extremely difficult to get information on internal processes in the COP and undertakings plans.
He received long-term orders for tens of billions of rubbers, and large money, as he knows, loves the silence.
In general, the director of defence companies are from posts on their own desire, by the treaty of the parties or for another work.
In that case, the distortion occurred publicly, or not received a resonance.
This emphasizes the fact that Almaza's leader may have been a structural structural and resisted to the above-based "residents".
In all cases, the State is not intended to peace with such a manner.
The shareholders will defeat those who prefer to combat the Minoboron installations and do not carry out the tasks set.
At the same time, the RF leadership is trying to order for the slaughtered managers (the maquination of the Star).
A higher attention to the sector ' s problem is the President.
Vladimir Putin calls on the Military Industry Commission and regularly holds meetings dedicated to the overweapon.
Cleml protects a number of COP Administrators, trying to have a loyal composition of directors, which will carry out the above discharge.
This is a far indefinite policy, but it has disrupted corruption and the absence of normal competitiveness in NAP other instruments.
The situation in the defence, of course, is not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical situation encourages Kriml as soon as possible in order of armed forces.
In parallel with the "smuggling" of RF managers, RF leadership takes successful steps to enhance the professionalism of Russian forces.
The army's headquarters acquired a new quality with the seat of the Minister of Defence of Sergei Shagua.
It is the impression that the President has taken on the weapons of the famous speaker "Peace is ready to war".
During the cold war, the USSR military force and the nuclear party reached in the 1970s have brought to the conclusion of the Helsinki Covenant, which strengthened the Moscow influence area on the continent.
In all lacks of bipolar system, she worked fully effectively.
The absence of war on the European continent and about the stability situation in the Middle East.
The trafficking of “venders” in the cold war has resulted in the strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of terrorists in Europe and the United States in the civilized world, I hope there was no peaceful cloud.
Despite the general disaster, we refuse to speak to Russia at the same level.
In such situations, the only fleet and army of our country remains.
Increased military power allows Moscow to remain more effective for the national interests and to enter into the new parts of the world policy.
The Skotlandian Calum Skinner spends on the finish line, resulting in the shipping gold of the British
Scotland, Calum Skinner, was a triumph in a man's shipping team at Rio last night, resulting in which the command triumph was protected from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old borner of Glasgo was the most powerful of his cousin, Sir Chris Hoy, who had made his own, and the young man was honoured in his history to get the winner of the Favorite team from New Zealand.
Britain declared the right to an unexpected victory four years ago, wining when he declared the right to the five of its six Olympic gold meals.
And they repeated the trick, after the six of their modestly finished at the Mart World Championship in London, despite the end of the carriage since then.
The question between Peking and London was replaced by a specialist of James Staff.
They did the same time when Hindes appeared.
The entry of Hoya also created a whiteness that Kean Emmadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Scinner was a man who was holding the British trains, seeing the capacity in Skotland, which was now implemented.
Hindes, Kenny, a champion from Hoy four years ago, and Scinner set the Olimpiade Resource in Qualification, but the standards were overlooked in New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio wins the duel for gold.
Hindes was exactly behind his circle, but Kenny shocked the team forward, and Scinner supported.
The change of the strategy was a major part of the reform where Hindez went to a greater transfer to Kenny and, in particular, to Skinner keep the time.
He looked at his place as an invitated BBC expert and captured the view of Scenner, Kenny and Hindes when they entered the beach.
23-year Scinner from Glasgo said, "This is a fast comparison."
I'm here to make everything possible and make my own name.
We set the Olimpiade Record in the Final and win the Championians of the world.
That was incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After the triumph in London in 2012, with Kenney and Hoy, Hindez decreased the trail after the unexpected age.
He later refused to comment, and there was no way to appeal from the Great Britain competitions.
There was no question at this time in the greatest victory.
He said, "I felt like in London, with all the themes of the UK to the court."
We've all met the team in the last three months.
We have played in many of the world's names that the oil was just awesome.
This is one event, one gold medal for the country who wins seven of 10 named hole in Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of progress made in the past five months, the wheel is waiting for five successful days.
The form shown by Kenny is not under the possibility to imagine how he repeats the Goy's ship, winning three oil meals in one game.
It would be possible to see how Kenny, who was just 12 years old, was also born on 23 March (this seems to be the sacred date in the British sport, which is also the day of the birth of Steve Redgreeve, Mofarha and Roger Bannister), has been given its account to six gold meals and one silver.
That would be like Hoya.
The next time Kenny is in the snake that begins today and spends for three days.
28-year-old from Bolton said, "I just like that now.
The teams are always the best.
You're coming to win your friends.
A little one to win one if honestly.
He said, "If he wins more two gold meal, he must get the market."
It was the only day of the meal playing, but it was the following good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clensey, Steven Burk and Own Dull are qualified for the fastest 4-kilometer command.
They financed at 3:51,943.
The world refund established for the winning of gold in London in 2012 is 3.5.659.
The first round and final (10:42) are held today, on the second day of the event where Wiggins will be exactly in the centre of attention.
He had a debate with the Commissioners last night referred to a qualified train when the officials needed to measure his weight.
The relevant women ' s event, which will be renewed and completed tomorrow, Laura Trettot, Joanna Roysel Shand, Elinor Barker and Kate Archibald, showed at 4:13.260.
The Great Britain command was relying on the powerful bicycle team to acquire the average period of the Olympic Games and pay a number of meals.
After the real exceptional demonstrations of full overcome in Beijing and London, the expectations were slow in a progressive preparation for Rio.
The second plan was the drama, not the last time of the head of Shane Satton's technical office in April, because of the accused of sexism and detection, and the exits of large figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, on the basis of the first weekend, however, it seems that the legendary now of Britain's glory to reach the top at the right time, perhaps again.
Construction of a portal metal firm threatened by the distortion of electrical contracts
The growing portal aluminium in Victoria, as well as the workplaces of hundreds of workers, are threatened by the fact that the electricity company that uses the company, according to one of the owners of the company, will be planned to switch the contracts: it is planned that all delivery contracts will be deleted.
This step is the result of the decision adopted by the Government of Victory that it would not extend subsidies granted to support the functioning of the company.
The fixed subsidy for 20 years expires in November.
To 2.000 workplaces may be threatened by the Alcoa company in Portugal.
The total of 2.000 workplaces, directly and indirectly, can be found in the risk zone as a result of any closure.
Additional space effects may also be, as the metalurgy plant requires about 10 per cent of the electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed a metal firm in Point Henry, which led to the closure of electricity in Englese last year.
Portugal metal firm Alcoa loses money and risks closing.
These actions have resulted in the consideration of the future industry that has been continued for a few years, as a result of the strong positions of the Australian dollar, and later, because of the prices for the production of the company.
The AGL company, who enjoys a large electricity plant with its Loy Yang A electricity station in Latvia Valli, reported that the other three owners would also take steps to deal with the treaty.
The control share of the company belongs to a joint short-term company of Alcoa and Alumina, and the Chinese CITIC and the Japanese company Marubini Corp are smaller.
"The AGL committees expect that the Português will continue to work, namely, that the physical electricity demand from the metal firm will not stop," said she.
According to the AGL company, the contracts mentioned are such as the 'hered contracts' which should be entered into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month disappearance period, so they actually ended in 2017.
"In line, the AGL company still expects that these contracts will bring their income in the financial year 2017", said the electricity company.
There was no potential impact on the arrival of the AGL company from 2018 to the financial year at this time, there was limited predictions on a strong market of fees for optical electricity prices.
The AGL company stated that the amount of contracts had already been reduced in its account of $187 million in terms of “continued distortion”.
According to the company Alcoa, the decision to deal with contracts "not affect Alcoa's ability to manage metallurgical firm or to provide electricity to the metalurgical industry".
The American company stated that, in 2010, Loy Yang's company had a twenty-year contract that had to enter into force in November this year, but she still should explain why it had delayed the contract.
Analytics were concerned about the possible closure of the portal metal industry in Victoria as well as of the Tomago firm, close to Newcastle, because of the unfortunate economic situation in the area.
As a result of analysis previously in this week, AGL, Steven Mickelsen, AGL, said that Portugal uses about 600 megabats annually and Tomago was about 900 megabats.
If both of these companies go from the market, there will be a significant reduction in the market demand [electronics].
For us, it will be bad for the manufacturer,” he said.
Not only a reality-shale star to Kardashian, Kendal on the box of the September Vogue
Kendal Jenner, 20 years of age, model and fourth daughter, Kardachian-Denner, the mother-manager of Chris, appeared at a fellow September of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendal, who was the victim of the Estee Lauder burden and defixed the news in Milan, Paris and New York, reported the news in his shop in Instagram on Thursday.
"I was in the room together with my favorite people, I looked at this box and smelled," wrote Kendal.
The news about the shop was awesome (or just in the spirit of the Corporation of the Cardashian Society?), prepared by the reality-video, in which the entire family of Kardachian-Denner (deboshist Rob and Katelin, also joined with him the most loved grandmother of the Show Bisness, producer of the Cardashian Family), forgetted the appearance of the sisters on the board, and at the end of the classical tour: they planned the evening of the South Coast.
This is the standard surrounding line of almost all the episodes of children's television shows dedicated to birthdays (Sicrip: "You thought we forgot you?", with the honestity of a multiple crystal from the 8th morning, but Chris had to be necessary that this glory could be achieved as well as other girls.
Because with this episode dedicated to the September Vogue, we, indeed, entered in the new era of the Cardashian show.
Let the old sister Kendal Kim goes on the board of Vogue before (he came to her with her husband Cannie West in April 2014), but the September magazine box was the one to be achieved by herself.
The September is the most sales of Vogue for year.
It is likely to be a gift from a model magazine that has a large number of advertisers (as reported by the Fashionista port, 615 pages of the last year of the 832-strategy edition).
The news about a star on his board is expected to be so depressed that in the past two years the pictures of the magazine were covered to an official anonymous.
The previous women slaughtered at the board include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In the past few years, it is obviously that there were more "renocentances that work models" than "models that are famous".
The "Oscar" premium and the face of Dior Gernifer Laurens was presented at the board in 2013, after year after the honor of Lady Gague.
But even in the poor case, if Jenner, whose magazine describes the model of his generation, is in the first category, it is in a bad company.
These are not the parents of famous people, the reality-show stars or modern children who know how to make a good video in Snapchat (who Gerner falls in all these categories).
These are truly talentous women who are in the industry of disappearance.
For Beyonse, the last year's chamber, this year, was one of the most lucky carriages in relation to the Lemonade album.
Of course, it's not all happy for the success of Jenner.
The situation of Gerner in the world of mode, as her last star of television reality show, had always been shocked.
In June, one of the first models of Victoria's Secret Stefany Seamor discovered Jenner and her colleague, Jilly Hadd, called them "the moment".
These settings have again been cut after Jener's news on Vogue's box.
But it doesn't mean to strive to disappointment.
Kendal Jenner's headquarters of the Vogue.
It is a supermodal in all the meanings of that word.
She's defiant for Mark Jacobs.
She's gonna sell you a tonic krom from Estee Lauder.
She, so and all her sisters, sell your photos to you in the same applications available for pay signature.
She sells his own photos of the daughters of Sindy Crawford of the LOVE magazine.
And in a free time, may still be seen with her sister Cortney and her children, she participates in the television reality.
Public legal centres reject 1600,000 people per year
Each year, more than 1600,000 of the least protected populations refuse to serve in public legal centres, since this sector is prepared to make the effect that further financing for and so on-going opportunities.
In Quinsland, three of the five people, the main, old, immigrants, unprotected works, victims of violence, persons who have no possibility to combat unfair ownership, and so further, have already been rejected by trying to obtain free legal assistance and representatives.
The public legal services that are already under the possibilities are ready to reduce further.
Since June next year, these legal centres should lose even 30 per cent of federal funding.
The Director of the General Legal Centres of Queensland James Farrell said that, in accordance with the recent records of the National Laws Association, thousands of people have been rejected each year.
Farrell said that if a federal government decision was not cancelled, the situation would only be worried.
" The legal centres of Quinsland continue to receive inadequate financing, which means that thousands of people are rejected in their vital lively important services, " he said.
Persons from violence, persons with uncontrolled and debt debts, families who have divorced unlawful work - all of them have legal problems, and this report shows that they cannot receive assistance that they need.
The Federal Government is funded by 30 per cent since June 2017, which means that thousands of defended people of Quinsland will be obliged to address complex legal issues without assistance.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Senator Quinsland George Brandis immediately to reverse these reductions in the financing so that people can receive the necessary assistance when they face legal problems.
In the past year, the Government has undertaken its commitment to fund free legal assistance to the average country indicator.
It is now time to focus on the needs of public legal centres and communities, their customers, and the Government of Palestinian is time to put on this important work.

Britain should be sent into the necessary ring of the olympic spirit and extending Hittro
Heatro will also provide rebuilding and prosperity not only in our planning populations and in the whole of London but also in the whole country.
As I think, this was the great advantage of Hitro, as it was with London in 2012, where we made all the efforts to make our people and regions benefit from the game.
The Olympic Games benefited greatly for Strategy and Eastern.
And we will do this again, creating the possibilities for local people and the company close to Hittro.
Only for our poor population points, we will create 100,000 new shops, 400,000 new jobs and put the end of young unemployment around the airport.
As was before London 2012, those who think that Hittro's challenge is too expansive.
They told me that Britain will never be ready to the Olimpiade games, and that we are in a difficult situation in the world aren.
Sceptics were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong with Hittro.
There are always obstacles to survive, but Hetro responds to any question raised on it.
Like the Olympic Game of Hitro is a infrastructure project for most, not only for a circle.
Advancement is the possibility to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion feet of economic growth, with the ability and employment of both the airport and the whole United Kingdom.
We have a nice team in Hitro, which introduced the 11 billion infrastructure investment schedule at time and within the budget, from T5, the best terminal chosen for five years of airport, to T2, built in the middle of the two most busy flights in the world.
Now they are ready to ensure the third aircraft field, confirmed by 16 billion of feet of private investment.
The Olympic Games in London in 2012 was a great success for Britain, and I am sure that Hittro will also be expanded.
It was time for us to send the Olympic Spirit into the necessary ring and to expand Hytro, to ensure our commercial future and to create a heritage of qualities and employment that Britain could be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton is Chairman of the Hetro Council and the former Trade Attache of the Conference
Adblock Plus, Facebook plays in a "meek" on the issue of advertising
For companies who pay money on the Internet Regulations, attempting to purchase programs for public locking is a game in a "cash-cook", as one of the company who creates such a programing assurance.
On Thursday, literally after a couple of days after Facebook announced that the advertising blocks will be blocked on its website, Adblock Plus published a record in the blog that users could update their filters in the program to lock the advertising into the social network again.
On Thursday, the Facebook issued that the website's exact version changes the switch around its advertising to make the advertising blockers more difficult to recognise what parts of the page are.
But Adblock now states that he can get a new code.
In its publication, the representative of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "the kind of counter-related fight between the public blockers community with an open source code and those who try to spend it continues since the discovering of the advertising blockings" and that Facebook may submit its own decision in the nearby time.
The fact that the largest social network has entered into the world is clearly recognized how great the problem has become the blocking of the advertising for the industry.
About 200 million people have been using advertising blocks in the world, according to the last year study of Pagefair and Adobe; almost four times more than those who used this program in 2013.
In view of 1,3 billion daily active users who are on the Facebook via mobile devices, the mobile advertising is now 84 per cent of the Facebook income from the advertising.
However, the company is intended for advertising publishers on the current version, as mobile publishers are inefficient in mobile Facebook applications for social network and Instagram, as the representative is.
However, the advertising in this version represents a sufficient article to make Facebook a valuable stage of investment.
On Thursday, Facebook also announced that its "regulated preference" tool would be updated in order to provide more control over how the advertising has been argued.
On Friday Facebook stated that Adblock's new filters were worried, as they will also block some unregulated content on the website.
"This will not be a positive experience for people, and we plan to solve this problem," said the representative of the Facebook in an official letter.
Advertising blocks are a cruel tool, so we focused on the creation of such instruments, such as Declaration preferences, in order to deliver management into people.
Women moved to Switzerland's Autostrate to the episode of apparent self-assault
The victim stood on the street in the middle of the night.
The police calls upon witnesses after the woman moved several vehicles to the road early on Thursday morning to a clear suicide attempt.
The university occurred at A1 next to the sea in the Canton For immediately after midnight in Thursday.
The woman slowed on the road in the dark night and shooted several vehicles, reported to the police in a statement.
A number of vehicles, including a car, were assaulted by the Switzerlandn woman in the age of 49.
She died at the place.
Some drivers have already been investigated, but some have not yet been established, reporting the police that calls them and someone else who was a witness to the event.
A criminal case was sentenced, a "logical" step in such a situation, declared a lawyer Jill Hoffstetter Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it should be cleared if some of the driving drivers will be proclaimed.
Could it be possible to avoid a shock?
That's what the prosecutor should determine,” said Hoffstettter.
Two other similar cases in the past five years are allowed to suggest that drivers will not be recognized responsiblely.
In each case, both of the people who go to the dark street were condemned that the automobilists could not wait for an accidental meeting with a swimming trail in the middle of the night.
Last year, the officer was sentenced to the cause of the death of uncertainty, after she attacked and killed a man who was on the A1 at Pairn at the night in August 2014.
22-year-old victim of drink and lost consciousness on the road, heard the court.
The Court found that a police woman, who answered the extreme appeal, managed the vehicle by a reasonable way, and that the existence of a man on the road was " perfectly exclusive and unpredicted situation", said the judge.

Venezia may have ever been known according to the evaluation of the new NASA climate model.
Scientists from the Soviet Space Research Institute have developed a model for the study of Vienna, using tools and algorithms like climateologists.
The model was designed to determine whether Vienna could, with its hot surface and the atmosphere of carbon gas, ever existing conditions such as the earth.
The scientists predicted that the small speed of Vienna’s return was explained by its fleshly atmosphere.
However, the last model states that Vienna may probably have a decreased atmosphere like the earth, and still slowly turn.
The model also examined the fuel of Vienna's early.
On the planet, it is likely that there were more surprising regions than the Earth, but there was once sufficient water and enough geographical change in order to create conditions for life and to prevent rapid elimination.
Rane Vener also benefited the sun, which was 30 per cent of the skin.
“ According to the GISS models, the slow return of Venice submits it to the daily side of the sun for almost two months for a month,” explained the report of an scientist from GISS Anthony Del Henio.
This reduces the surface of the planet and produces rain that creates a soft slee that acts as a zone that protects the surface of the planet from the substantial part of the sunwarming.
The results are the medium climate temperatures that, as a surprisely, at a few degrees more cold than in our day on Earth.
The model shows the history of Vienna, similar to the development that previously predicted planet researchers.
In spite of some years, though Vienna may have been quoted, it has affected too large jaw and ultraviolet removal during a few billion years.
Her oceans have been dismissed, and its water pair was survived by ultraviolet extraction.
When her hydrocarbon fled, it remained only a fleshly atmosphere from carbon gas with a mortal park effect, namely, Venear, which we know today.
Researchers have shared the results of their new climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters magazine.
Patrick Roy leaves the train team of Avalanche
Patrick Roy left the train and the vice-President of the Colorado Avalanche on Friday, referring to the lack of influence during the decision-making process.
The Executive Vice-President/Corporal Commander Joe Sack confirmed the news and noted that the club will start searching for a new train immediately.
"But over the past three years, I have performed my responsibility for the main training and the Chairman of the Colarado Avalanche with energy, stress and determination," said Roy in the statement of 50 years.
During the summer, I had long and deeply thought about how I could improve the team to bring her the necessary depth and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this goal, the vision of training and the vice-President of the Hooky activities must perfectly correspond to the vision of the organization.
He must also have the right to vote when decisions affecting the work of the team.
These conditions are not implemented at this time.
Sake, who took Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," said Sack.
We appreciate everything he did for our organization, and we want him to be successful in the future.
Roy became the prize of Jack Adams Award as the best liga trainer during his first season with the Avanche team in 2013-2014.
He brought a club to 112 views and wins in Central Division, but Colombia was disrupted by Minnesota in the first round of the Offs and lost the stage of Off in the last two years.
The Avanche team announced assessment of 39-39-4 at the 2015-2016 session, and at five points from the Wild team in the fighting of the second lounge journey to participate in the Western Conference.
Roy wins four Stanley Cub, two from Montreal Canadiens and Abalanche.
North Sea ocean neighbors renew negotiations and installations of reserve
Workshops on the payment of oilers in the North Sea are suspended, and all the parts of the debate start to the new negotiations, reported to the leading representatives of the parties.
The winners against the oil company Wood Group were cooperatively organized on platforms in the North Sea, which were conducted by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and Unions and RMT may confirm that we agreed to restore the negotiations to resolve existing disputes," says the joint statement.
We will hold a few meetings on the full day over the next few weeks, starting from the beginning of the next week to consider a quiet view.
Professionals reported that their recent action, which, as they say, was the first than 25 years of age, was addressed against potential reductions of 30 per cent.
In this year, Wood Group has reduced the rates paid by contract officers working in the North Sea to about 9 per cent because of negative market pressure.
Decreased rates from the company had been reduced in 2014 after 10 per cent of contract officers.
According to the company, additional reductions will be given to it, it is necessary to overcome the market fall.
She has decreased thousands of people and announced plans to stop oiling in countries to 10, as it rationalizes its activities as a result of the UK energy company.
Energy companies are pressured by the low prices of oil: the economic situation was worse because of the decision to enter from the European Union adopted in June by the United Kingdom.
The Skotland Parliament, David Anderson, met with professional leaders in this week to discuss one of the largest working conflicts in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea said that it was vitally necessary for the regional economy.
"In the North Sea, yeah and throughout the country, we need a economy that would work for most, not only for some," he said in the statement.
Mining $1.4 billion for new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, with the average value of approximately $7 billion for the past five years.
Kepler measures the speed of the slope of the slope of the Plaid
The last mission of the Space Telescope Kepler helped astronoms to collect the most complete directory of the slope of the sleeves in the collection of Praids.
New data helps the astronoms to understand why the stars are turned into different speeds, as well as the return periods are focused on the development of the planet.
"We hope that comparing our results to other star collections, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass, its age and even the history of its sun system," reported in the press of Louis Ribal, a Scientist of the Inflation Centre and analysis at the California Technology Institute.
The copy of the Plaid is 445 light years from the Earth.
Many of the stars in the sculpture are now only reached by strokes, which were born about 125 million years ago.
They're angry so fast as they're never going to.
In their skin speeds, these adult stars select large numbers of star winds.
The winds switch around the magnetic stars, these winds are shocking on the stars.
At the age of the stars, the speed of the shift begins to slow.
Kepler measures the speed of turning each star, over the time between the appearance of the known five stars — such as sunfire.
The new directory of turn speeds suggests that more massive stars are slower than less massive stars.
Ribal compares the stars to the dancers: larger pirates make slower than smaller.
"In the "plaid" we observe that those who turn slowly are usually more massive, while those who are slower are usually relative to very slow stars," said Ribal.
Since the copy of the Plyad is close, it serves the perfect space lab to compare the properties of the star with the speed of turn.
"Plajada's summer copy provides a shipping point for theoretical models of return of the stars as well as the elderly," said Ribal.
We still want to know how and why the stars slow the speed of their shift and spend on their "thinks" snakes like that.
Ribal and her colleagues have detailed their last analysis of Plyed returning into three new articles that will soon be published in the Astronomy Journal.
A study related to the group of detainees in the Ukrainian divergencies conducts two states, writes "Commercant".
The ECB will collect evidence of the privacy of detainees to prepare diversity in Kruemou.
As previously reported, the gratitude of the people of the Ukrainian city of Energydar Eugène Panu agreed to cooperate with the consequences.
In his words, he considered the Titan's chimpanzees in Armenia, the petroleum in Fiodozoia, the Governing Party Translation, the Gas Guide, and one of the military aeroports.
The law enforcement believes that it is not possible to keep away from all differentiators.
This was, in particular, a basis for arresting suspected in the Kiev Paradise, notes the publication.
The main training of Russia's football collection was Stannigranda Cherchez
At the plenary meeting of the Russian football Union, a decision was taken to appoint the headquarter of the Russian assembled football station at Stanislaw Cherchesus.
The contract will be calculated for two years - before the end of the MC-2018.
On 11 August, the RFS execution was appointed to the headquarter of Russia ' s collective football train at Stannizol Cherchesois.
This is a well-known footballist, who was previously played in the Moscow Spartake on the position of the urtar, as well as a trainer with a solid experience of such Russian teams such as Spartack, "Jimjuina-Sochi", "Terek", "Amcar", "Dinamo" and "Legie", which became a winner of national primary and cubits of the country.
It is reported that the contract with Cherchez will be signed in the nearest time and was divided for two years.
Hence, he was responsibilities to prepare a assembly for the 2018 World Championship.
It is known that in his training stage, Miroslav Romanzako, Hintaras Stauche, Vladimir Parks.
There are information that the total training stage is 2.5 billion euro per year.
According to the media, the RFS leadership provided the Cherchem's goal to prove that Russia was collected to half-final and obtain meal.
As the trainer himself stated, he considers the creation of a competitive environment in the team and would give the footballists the opportunity to prove himself.
Also, in the words of Cherchez, he was glad that the choice was on him.
The first shop under the leadership of Cherchez, Russia, will take 31 August in Antarctica, will be a partnership with the Turkey team.
Remember, Leonid Slunchy, who was the main trainer of the Russian football board, was joined with him in the CSC club.
He declared his department after the official statement of the Russian national team in Euro-2016 in France.
He was responsible for the bad result of the collection.
Namibia was a long-term fight against the Apartheid, with the desire between Angola and South Africa.
However, after the decrease of South Africa's independence in 1990, this country, with populations of 2,4 million, has achieved huge success, especially in the past few years.
The main reason for Namibia ' s success is that the Government highlights education.
While people in developing countries have been acknowledged as an outstanding primary and medium-sized education, many poor countries in medium and even primary schools require training.
Furthermore, Governments are often advised to introduce educational payment for costs.
However, there is free education in Namibia in primary schools.
Furthermore, since 2015, the average education has become free.
The authorities of the country are also actively working in other important areas.
Malaria ' s destruction efforts have reduced in the past 10 years of annual disease 97 per cent.
In contrast to the international trend of inequality, Namibia is reduced.
In comparison with the 1993 indicator of Jini, the standard income distribution inequalities, was 15 paragraphs.
Then, 23 years ago, this indicator was one of the highest in the world.
The poverty level has reduced from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (not less than $1.90 per day) has also reduced from almost 53 per cent to less than 23 per cent.
Namibia also has the highest raying of the freedom of words in Africa, according to the "Reporters without Border".
The country has significantly warned the United States and other rich States.
In addition, the country has a favourable raying, one of the highest in Africa, in the Index of Corruption, which is the Transparency International.
Even now, when the prices fall on the base, Namibia is able to keep the high level of growth.
At the same time, GDP debt ratio is about 25 per cent, which is less than 1/3 levels of debt in the United States and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
The unemployed level, at least traditional assessment methods, remains sufficiently high - almost 28 per cent.
And as well as other countries in the region, the high level of HIV/AIDS is in Namibia - almost 17 per cent of the population are incerted.
According to the evaluation of the World Bank, Namibia relates to a number of countries with the income above the average, but the authorities argued that their State is actually a developing country.
Indeed, it is unlikely to face some difficulties faced by low-developed economies.
The State must develop a very large and devastating country with a small population.
In the lands of the deserts, isolated tribes of countermembers, which should be integrated in the modern society without the loss of their identity.
Integration of people who had been on the peripheral of the world economy for the fourth century ago is an unfair challenge for any country.
For Namibia, it is more complicated: as any other country in the world is, it affects the consequences of climate change.
Nevertheless, Namibia did not think to leave the hands, the country decided to face the problems.
Shortly after the deterioration of the independence, the creation of a diversified economy and a collected society was taken.
It is notably that competitive political fractions have gathered together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides valuable medical services not only of its own citizens but also of its neighbourhood.
About 15-20 per cent of medical institutions in the northern Namibia citizens.
No one in Namibia speaks of the construction of a wall that would separate the country from the poor and corrupted neighbors.
The Namibiates understood that neighbors did not choose, and therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate with deficit water resources, to participate in regional medical projects, to promote investment and exchange students.
Furthermore, the Government of Namibia had justified that rich natural resources could easily be disfellowshipped by helping poor people.
The authorities understood that the income from Namibia’s natural riches must be contributed to infrastructure and production power.
They also recognize that it would be indirectly not to try to obtain the maximum arrival from the sale of countries and to revitalize investment laws and contracts to ensure that it is.
Transparency has a crucial importance for this process, therefore the strong support of the Government ' s freedom of words is so important.
As the head of the Hague Gangeb State noted, the media often speaks about what he did not like.
But after fighting for freedom from apartment in South Africa, Namibia should protect the freedoms received, says the President.
Not all the key resources of Namibia are exhausted.
Some, such as fishing, are related to renewed, and the Government has made all efforts to maintain and strengthen them.
Another million foreign tourists are visiting the country every year.
Namibia shows that even those countries that begin with serious deficiencies - racism, colonial structure, inequality and low development - may be a way towards general prosperity.
Its achievement benefits from international recognition and imitation.
Many have heard about the Warna Gold, the ancient gold objects created by humans (4600 to 4200 years before our era).
I believe that this was the most wide archaeological sensation of the 1970s: in Bolgaria, when the Varnean non-cropole, there was a fantastical number of gold artifacts, more than three thousand over the total weight of 6 kilograms.
Only one detention known as "power No 43" was extracted by 990 gold objects with a general weight of 1,5 kg.
However, the official status of the ancient world's gold could soon be moved to an unexpected busin found by archaeologists in July this year.
Another time in Bulgaria is a predominant population known as Tel U.N.C.
Unlike Varna, the port city, Tel U.N.C. was displaced from the sea, around the village of the Pazardjik area.
Bushine is a golden pool that turns back to the corner.
Yavor Boyajiev, the leader of the Discovery in Tel U.S.A., died 4600 years before our era and said that she was the older of Warna gold at least 200 years old.
The Barna's crew, remembering, is dated about the same period, 4600 - 4200 gg before our era.
Technology that allows the data of metal with unforeseen accuracy is currently not available.
How does it be sure that gold is older?
Obviously, Professor Boyajiv knows more than reported by the Reuters Agency: "I'm absolutely sure that the Gold of the University of Warne's older gold."
This is an outstanding point of importance: this is a cruel object, but it is enough to take a similar place in history.
In the interview Reuters Boyajiv reported that scientists analyze the composition of metals in the nearest time, as well as more and more carefully studied the archaeological plastic where gold artifact was found.
This helps to date the browse with the maximum accuracy possible.
There are also many explanations.
Tel, U.N.C., is a famous place, even if you haven't heard about it.
At present, Tel U.N.C. is considered the former "reward" of Europe.
Tel was founded by the posts of people migrated in Europe from Anatolia (Current Turkey) in the seven thousands of years before our era.
During the following centuries, the region has developed burningly the processing of metals, from the improvement of the first metal ability to establish a full-quality industry.
The main history of the archeological community is a particular name: the Balkano-Carpath Metalurg province.
In the five millennium before our era around the metal processing centres, the population of the urban type began.
Now they are called the ancient cities of Europe.
Of them, maybe the oldest ones of them, because there were 4900 artists found here before our era.
I would call Tel U.N.C. prototype of the modern city, although it is very old, even compared to Mesopotamia.
“ This is the place of the old Shumer for thousands of years,” said Boyajie, with a general acceptable view that the urban culture has been born in the south of Mesopotamia, the modern Iraq.
There appeared the first city in an accurate understanding of this word.
The scanners of Tel, University, have been carried out since 1976.
At that time, archaeologists have discovered almost 12 hectares, which is about third of the population’s preference.
The rest of a strong wall was found, which has ever reached three meters high.
From houses and masters, however, archeologists clearly distinguish the streets, the public buildings, the counterparty, the business center and the living areas.
The Tel U.N.C. frequently calls "Their city": tens of bird figs were found here.
All birds are pictured in a calm state, so that they were not decorative objects, but an object of local culture.
The "this city" was destroyed about 4100 years before our era, perhaps by Indian tribes coming from the northeastern.
There were no cities, horses and weapons.
The three meters of strong walls have not stopped them.
Archaeologists have found the apparent signs of a cruel fight: the remains of older, women and children were found within the houses with the injuries of warfare.
New events and new facts appear to be made annually, changed withdrawals of ancient humanity history.
The Bolgar Archaeologists are often talking about not individual cultures, but on the "persistent" first civilization of Europe in Balkans.
The powerful stimulation for this civilization has become the Varna zone, which has recently been found in 1972.
It is logically that the Varna's gold blowing should be predicted, something like a crochet gold boss created in Tel Youncite.
In Porsche, models 911 Targa were artificially covered
Officially stated that the preparation of 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is carried out by manual agency specialists working with series machines.
For example, the "retro-look" is a particular color of Etna Blue, which was developed in 1960 for the Porsche 356B model, which has even been designed in this color.
In addition, Targa received a company white graph on the boards and special RS Spyder 20-way wheel disks, and some of the details of the white-zole metal formatting.
The retro-third interest is noted less than: it is, in large account, different from the gamma-formation series, new cresses with expanded electrically-regulations diameters and separate black-notified shoes with the logotype of the unit.
Furthermore, when purchasing a special version, each buyer will receive a shopping gift for the car and a rich distributed album with photos of the production process.
The powerful installation of Porsche Exclusive specialists has not been toughing: the strike of characterists is fully in line with the series.
It is a six-cylinder engine with a careful amount of 3.0 m, developing 420 ms and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version 911 Targa 4S can be speeded up to 100 km/h per 4 seconds.
Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be issued by a limited quote, but no amount or value of each specific sportor is not reported.
Facebook and advertising blocks have launched the "weapon Go"
The recent inclusion of the Facebook technologie that prevented the hiding of advertising on social pages has been promoted by decision-makers to block the advertising to respond.
In AdBlock Plus, Facebook plans to do so soon as possible.
So AdBlock Plus projected its new technology that may have remained effectively long.
The social representatives noted that, trying to infringe the new "unblood" public, the decision by AdBlock Plus, together with commercial statements, also blocked many common mails from friends or pages.
In Facebook, AdBlock Plus was regretted and promised to solve the problem soon.
As the source of the source among the social developers of TechCrunch, a code that makes AdBlock Plus free on the Facebook decktop will be ready for the next hour.
So, socialists and blocks have divided their kind of " weapons go" by trying to play one another, the other party has become the users who have lost the interesting records of friends or the advertising there where they were unacceptable to see it.
The ethical aspects of the public blocking have recently caused a tragic conflict.
In Murmansk, the violencer is in front of the court's evening Murmansk.
His case has already been investigated in the next Committee of the Russian Federation on the Morman area.
The accused of 54-year-old man is a serious effect of sexual violence.
The results were that, at the end of November 2015, Paul’s street area in Murmansk had acted sexually with regard to violence against 20-year-old girls.
The sanction of this article provides maximum punishment for the punishment of freedom for six years.
Dongfeng will bring to Russia Crossvan Fengguang 370 and Picap Rich New website On page www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a resident of the popularity in China of a car class that constitutes the mine and the crewzer.
Another Russian premier, is Picap Rich New.
Many western companies of the Moscow International Autoshop this year have decided to ignore, so the white exhibition halls of Crocus Expo will be filled with the Chinese companies.
In particular, a powerful front will be the Dongfeng Motor Corporation, which has great species of Russian market and intended to offer a number of interesting news to our automotors.
One of them will become a shock Dongfeng Fengguang 370, sold in China at the price of 55.900 yen (or not less than 550.000 rubs on the current course).
The Russian value is not lighting, but the question of the allocations in our country is until it is in the stage of the debate.
In China, on the other hand, Fengguang 370 was intended to reach the 11th place in the list of most sales minerals, although it was a large road education of (175 mm) and a protected platform on the lower perimeter of the cup can be added to crystals.
Crossvan is built on the front-industry platform of the Fangguang 360, at the 370th round base of the same 2725 mm, but the bones are longer (4565 mm against 4510 mm), the design of more slightly than the richer.
The salon was stolen by tree planning, but the large vertical sensor screen showed on Tesla's central console was only on the early exhibitions of the crowd, and the sale of machines with music was simply.
Five of the seven positions are easily composed, shaping a low load area of 1650 mm, the maximum amount of a swimming bag to 1500 m.
Fengguang 370 engine prescribes a total of 1,5 litre binary atmosphere at 115 l.s. from the 5th mechanical transfer box.
The dynamic quality of the machine manufacturer is modestly estimated, so it promises the pleasant budget of the owner at the level 6,7 m/100 km.
Picap Rich New is a well-known Russian Nissan NP300 Navara for the previous generation, but with a slightly Chinese designer.
Despite the morally swimming construction, this model is still used by a stable demand in the Chinese consumer as a reliable and unreasonable "slaughter cattle".
At the east price, Rich New believes that the Russians are interested, because the modern Japanese picaps became incredibly precious.
Rich New is attributed to two machines for choice: benzine 2,4 l (137 ls) or career 2,5 l (116 l).
The transmission box is only a mechanic, the driving is behind the rail, but there are modifications and the strictly connected to the preceding.
The new Flagman Sedan A9 will be at the Stind Dongfeng and his Russian first representative of the Chinese company has been anonymous in June.
Mine-profit snakes on the Chinese market are increasing, one of the latest news - Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
Today, the Russian Dongfeng line is two models: the S30 Sedan and the H30 Cross.
In this year, 696 vehicles were performed by the Chinese company in our country.
Transport tax advertisements stop posting via the website www.zr.ru
The tax inspection has changed the list of notifications on equipment taxes.
All Russian automobile officials were inclined to the unchanged years of schedule: a year and summer they receive as a quote for transport tax payment for the past year.
However, in this year, many of them are not expected.
The tax inspection has changed the order of notification of the citizens.
Those who are registered in the Public Payment Office on the official website of the nalog.ru, the advertisement will come in electronic way.
In the inspection, such Russians were automatically shocked by online users and cut them out of a standard "bomber" list.
The newness consists of all vehicle owners and non-motiveness.
All remaining letters will continue to be received.
The possibility of return to the old scheme is, however, also of the owners of the website accounts.
For that reason, they must visit the tax office and write a statement in August.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and better.
The notification appears to the "Plural Office" immediately after the preparation, while the letter is going to go a few days and may always lose.
In addition, the number of Internet users of tax inspections was over 18 million people, which allows the State to seek seriously to shoot shoot.
On the other hand, the modest news on the website of inspections is clearly not enough to inform citizens of changed standards.
Some could have registered in a regular chain to obtain a single service and forgot it for a long time.
Those people are not expected to learn from e-mail and, however, will be in the category of non-employers with all exempted consequences.
Access to the Life Payment Office is performed in three ways: through a accounting port gosuslugi.ru, using electronic signs or logisms and passwords specified in the registry map.
The last is available in any tax inspection office (unless there is a place for accounting).
Remember that the transport tax must be paid up to 1 December in the present year.
The shipment of notifications started in July.
The Mercedes-Benz-G-class, which is aimed at achievement of a very high deal, is something in itself.
But the controversial concept did not cut up G-Power company masters, which were taken for the modifying of the sport version Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power is known by its BMW cars, but no human masters are foreign.
Really, why would G 63-571-force aircraft with a aerodynamic tank and swimming up to 5,4 cm?
The shocked "muscles" of a shocked "gelic", the master used by the advantages that opened a 5.5-litro-shore swimming snake.
And this is the dinamical dynasm of the twenty-century, and the flight of the flight is a 5,3 cm.
However, the speed of average speed must be significantly better.
The speed flow affects: if the standard G 63 is not slowly 210 km/h, the tube-shooting switch with deactivated electronic " shock" can be survived 250 km/h.
Except other wheel disks, Urricane RR 305/35 ZR 23 are almost unfavourable outside the vehicle.
The Luce Office of Mercedes-Maybach has anonymized a spectacular conceptual shopping of 6 m, which will be presented within the Concours of Eleanty in Pubble Bich.
Mercedes-Benz company will competite with BMW I and will move its electric models under a single trade market.
In the nearest years, at least four environmental news is expected.
