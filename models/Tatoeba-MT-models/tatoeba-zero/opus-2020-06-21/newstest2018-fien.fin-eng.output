Camille Auer wanted to correct his sex, diagnosis, and now he makes an art of the subject - "The man should have the right to his own body."
Decades of patients reports from the shooting project room gallery.
Each of them reads Cam's name.
The papers tell a multiannual history of how foreign people have written up their comments from Auer and this identity.
They have decided who he is for him.
"I would like to tell a person about my history of treatment to ensure that the violence of the process should be visible," says Auer.
He's referring to the sexual correction process.
It is often a sustainable study period with physicians, psychiatrists, physicians and physicians.
The process is starting in the diagnosing studies performed in Tampere and Helsinki.
The process was started four years ago.
He had already used through the Internet to place strogens and, however, was very long in his own correction process.
He tried to be a woman, but, according to the Finnish law, a person must be passed through the correction process so that sex may be corrected legally.
Translation, or transsequent transsequently establishment of the sex (563/2002), imposes transsome people to package, so that the right sex is obtained, for example, in the population recruitment and on the pass.
Clearly, each sexually correction requires psychiatric diagnostics and a proof increased deficiency.
People have the right to decide on their own body.
"This situation is unfortunate and harmful to human rights," says Auer.
Translai has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The United Nations Human Rights Council has given eight comments, and the European Court of Human Rights has a predecision to bind the parts of the European Convention on Human Rights to comply with the self-determination rights.
The Finnish previous government has prepared law on the amendment of the Minister of Social and Health to the leadership of Susanne Huovise.
The Vasilies and the Basis Sumaty came to the government.
Now, the change of law is back in the depth.
This is about internal political disputes that do not even associate this law.
"The issue does not want to raise it on the table, because the government has a difference in the change of law," says the director of the Finnish Director Frank Johansson.
The front part of the display is controlled by two large installations.
One of them consists of the packaging and use of Auer’s medicines.
In patients reports, each event can read, for example, from Auer’s psicological transpolie of the University of Tampere’s university.
Psycology met Cam to Auer twice and wrote the report that should be defined by Auer’s right treatment and help.
The reality of the investigation seems to be seen as a sharp.
The consideration of the investigation itself appears in a manner of limited conditionality and personality is highlighted.
Auer hasn't recognized himself about these descriptions.
"I was smiling to hear that I was diagnosed as a mental illness," Auer says.
Another more confusion was when Auer was not granted to sexual correction.
According to the treatment personnel, his power was not sufficient to initiate the process.
He was forbidden by his own identity.
Then, 11 February 2015, Auer walked out to meet and shooted a transpoli's waiting television in the shock.
Later, from that television, the art theme was named Monument for the Excluded, where Auer reflects his experience of power and use.
"I'm awesome that every person defined as a woman can enhance its strike, but the removal of the rain requires diagnosis," says Auer.
Your body is not your own, if you try to be other than the amount of your generation defined in the birth.
Unfortunately, the experience of the sun is not the only quality.
The sexual correction process is for many more serious reasons than because of clean medical operations.
They will meet ten people who have to be found in their own existence and have the right to go on their sex work.
"I'm awesome that people who are helping and helping in need are being treated so that they don't have enough their power", says Auer.
Many of the processes have psychological symptoms: depression, disorder, possible relief tests.
In these substances, treatment may not be initiated.
"The prevention of treatment and assistance may eat humans to the worst situation than it was before the process started," Auer says.
The own exhibition of the Sun also treats pain and thoughts of self-mortality.
Auer's exhibition text writes: "I have had self-respective thoughts throughout my age and it's what people are usually hard to smell."
The masensis has been treated in medicines and when Auer began to use hormones, the condition was easy.
He was finally able to say the knowledge that had been already in the child and the teenage.
The reason why the wide shoes did not feel suitable to their own body, and why the skin of the meats came to be slept instead of the equivalent skin.
The main thing to Auer was that he was close to people who see him.
It's a basic need to find out.
"It's got to be based on such a lot by talking, smoking, using the voice and movement," he says.
Today, Auer has experienced the future, and she is a woman.
However, at the beginning of the process, nearly hundreds of comments could have caused a lot of damage.
It's mostly worried when nearby wrong-doers.
"They should know and they know who I am, but don't agree or can't enter it," he continues.
However, all transisms do not want physical changes.
They do not suffer from physicians, such as body or parts of their body can cause pain and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and long study process can not be officially confirmed by their own sex.
"These studies have no medical grounds," Auer says.
And it's true.
For example, in the Danish Parliament adopted in June 2014 a new procedure for recognition of the judicial sex.
The new legislation is based on self-determination rights in respect of the sex of the courts.
The full-year-old applicant makes a new request for a new personality, telling it his experience of being another sex.
After a period of consideration, the applicant confirms his application in writing and the Ministry shall give the applicant a new personal recognition.
This self-determination right is also required in Finland and is also grateful for the exhibition of the Auer.
It has not been an artist's trial of therapy, but the exhibition is a political and artistic workshop.
I want to believe that art has still a weight and that it can make political changes during the time that political men have forgotten human rights.
Camille Auer's exhibition Antiphallic Dick 4.-28.7.2017 in the project idea accumulation in Room.
The National Rights Organization gave a passenger warning to Missouri
The African national NAACP citizens' rights launched has given Missouria a travel warning because they have disregarded practices and racist attacks there.
"Assing information on the NAACCP shall enter into force 28.8.2017, and it is called for African travellers, visitors and local visitors to take particular attention and to respect the extreme care when travelling in the State where a number of events based on the race has recently occurred."
In Missour, the Law has made it difficult to export discrimination cases, and in addition, the implementation of the State law is relatively reduced. According to the NAACP, these aspects caused the delivery of travel warning.
"The human citizens' rights are blessed.
They are stopped on the basis of the skin color, and they are shocked or killed,” the NAACP President Rod Chapel reported to the Kansas City Star magazine.
"We haven't heard about a lot of cases in the same short time."
Missouri is the first warning of the United States of the United States.
The system mentioned, for example, the racist comments submitted against African students at the Missour University and from Tennessee to the death of a 28-year-old black Tory Sanders.
Sanders died in the situations that were before this year, and he was driving through the state when his car ended the fuel, and the police arrested him, although he wasn't accused of a crime.
The travel information also refers to the Minister of Justice of Missour to which the police stops 75 per cent of the black driver is probably more likely than the white.
"The purpose of the information is to encourage people to be careful and warned by their tradition, friends and working partners to what is possible in Missour," said Chapel.
"It must be prepared, for example, by taking money for payment of taxes or by telling the parents that they intend to travel through the State."
According to the FBI, hundreds of vineyards were recorded in Missour in 2015, or more than sixty-year US States.
Travel warning is also a response to the new Missour Act, which is difficult to strive to struggle enterprises with the right to submit and working relations with discrimination.
The ACLU organization, which guarantees the fundamental rights of civil rights, recently provided travel warnings in Texas and Arizona after accepting immigration laws which are able to arrest the police of immigration agreements.
In general, travel warnings are published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other states, but recently, citizens organizations have been published as a response to certain laws and development plans in the United States.

The additional rate of EUR 130,000 in this week was increased when Helsinki reported that the results of the payment development of the company leaders were reported.
The Finnish Description news from Vauramo's Additional Letter in February.
Finnair reported that it would be delayed by additional items in 2013.
The State has lined out that the additional items are not used for payment.
The government belongs to Finnary over half.
According to the company, the decision is on line with the principle decision on the ownership of the last year.
Packages accepted talks immediately
Another time ago it seemed that the relationship between the United States and Russia is on the way to fridge.
The President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who met with the G20 industry meeting in Hampur, showed the future report.
That's why the tunnel has remained significantly.
In the last week of the United States Congress and in the midweek of Trump, the new economic locations signed were fully reacted in Russia.
Another answer has been heard by the Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedevi, which states that the compulsory law signed by Trump means "complete trade war".
Although Russian reactions would only be referred to as a strict and overwhelming political restriction, the clergy between the United States and Russia is the fact that the election of Trump is a short month after the election of Trump.
In the United States, there was no simplicity of the packaging law on Russia, Iran and North Korea.
Indeed, the Congress adopted a considerable harmonization of the law, but the adoption of the law to the President was significantly more difficult.
Trump also criticizes its signing of the Law "the lack of significance".
Mr President Trump had been particularly reasonable for the race of the Russians, although the adoption of the restricted law had to be opposed.
As well known in the United States, the Russian investigation is used as far as possible for the presidential chairs as for the Russian contacts of the Trump campaign.
The clergy between the United States and Russia is true after a short month of torment.
When the White House's staff has changed to the strange and different scandale translations have been made to update, it seems to be clear that the foreign policy is not to do in the course of the President of the United States, but to the President.
This is not hopeful in any of the names.
If Russia's relationship is a chemical in the United States, it is also the same as the European Union.
In addition to economic packaging, your security situation in the Union's nuclear zone was also encouraging the relationships expressed in the Eastern Sea.
The EU has apparently shown the situation of Ukraine in its Russian relations and requested the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has remained in its Russian policy at least one of the main parts of the ones, the interests of the Member States are particularly different.
The economic packages, such as Finland, have been real strict.
The effects of the United States shipping law are still doubtful.
The EU has feared that the packages will be difficult for many European enterprises.
Finnish effects may, for example, feel in the North Stream 2-based gas project as well as in the possible Fenno-Fenno force project.
The disappearance in Europe has caused the abandonation of fleet outside, for example, to the United States economy of an important liquid gas ng.
Trade packages are a way in the world policy to demonstrate a bad way.
However, economic responsibilities must be a well-specific and careful person.
On the other hand, it is easy to handle more than benefits.
There's nothing sacred?
Trump in the white house is now in the Star of Freedom
The lack of stocks is a certain sign of the revolution.
Americans know the same as others: the Iraqi people slaughtered together with the American soldiers of Saddam Hussein at the opening of Firdon in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the main ideas of Trump's administration, knew well what had been done in a pleasant statement with the CNN channel Jim Acost. The liberty for the attack of Millers was the subject of a word attack, which raises the President's proposal to reduce significantly the legal immigration.
Miller, you don't really appreciate yourself.
If he would have done so, he would have obtained the magnificent bands of the organizers of the Risk and the exciting of the Freedom.
His attack was the point of a snack and especially that in 1903 Emma Lazarus was added to his feet from the shock of 17 years after the preparation of the patent.
This is what Miller said, "I don't want to go to his history, but the Liberty Pats is the symbol of the world's lighting American freedom.
Runo was later added, and it does not belong to the original Liberty Passage."
Miller wasn't wrong with you, but it's not just the story, as he himself said.
Only the words concerning Lazarus, the only quality in which the State is not just calling immigrants but the poorest ones": "Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled mass yearning to breathe free, / The wretched rejection of your theme shore."
Runo's more time than ever.
Miller did not have a literature criteria, and he clearly made that "the poorests" are not welcome to the United States of Trump.
The importance of freedom is part of a broader political and cultural aspect of the importance of the United States.
Lazarus’s friends were camping after his death in order to be shocked in their feet, and they knew that the work was strongly political.
Patsa was the purpose of expressing contacts with the French and American Republic in classic comparison, women’s body of freedom.
Lazarus changed its significance: the nashihamm in his wheel is no longer abstract, but it has a voice.
And it gives himself a new name: a fleet mother.
The interruption of the ruin was a nervous feministic struggle and a devastating attack against the American nationality.
Lazarus changed the significance of the throat, and the right has already wanted to change it back to the original.
Rush Limbaugh, a designer who can now be considered as a sign of Trump, said in 2010 that nobody would be called, but it is a pre-new conservator who brings the United States to the world's darkness: "Lady Liberty's standing out.
He's bringing the freedom from the United States to another world.
It doesn't look like a way to the United States."
That's pretty, Limbaugh was in the right part.
The significance of freedom depends on the entire view.
Lazarus saw it as the poor and shocked, but the hopeless immigrants on the side of the ship were on a long and trial journey.
He saw the protection and the better life of people.
His freedom rejoices by giving hope and hope to welcome.
And Miller and Trump aren't going to want any case.
They do not seem to be the way, but smiling the angles of hair, their only source of power.
Surrounding MM competitive 2017: Neil Black overcome the skotlanian members of the skotlanian team
Illidh Doyle remembers the time when only two scotts reached the Ison-British team
The resulting director of the Britannic Sport Agency, Neil Black, said that 16 scotic members participating in the world's majorities are "reforcing".
On Thursday, in London, the MM competitors of general sport have been selected for skotlane sports.
Black says that "I'm going to happen" in Scotland, which the general sport in Ison-Brittan has to be learned.
"This is healthy, and we're gonna continue to investigate it so long that we understand what the question is," says Black.
"I discussed with representatives of the Scotia Sport Institute, and they believed that it was involved in the operation of the institution.
Skotland's general sport Union reiterates that it is involved in the activities of the Agreement,
and the United States of the United Kingdom believes that it has their activities.
And the normal ruder believes that he must have something to do with this.
But there's something that's very wonderful, then what it causes."
Many skot Sports competite in London in their reality, Laura Mur and Andrew Butchart, who competites with Sir Mo Farah at 50,000 meters. Illidh Doyle was chosen as the capital of the country.
"Elidh is unrequisite.
His captain's speech was unbelievable," Black says.
"Organists have been removed from the opportunity of proudly achievement and strongly motivated independence on where they live and practice.
I've said Ilidh had true feeling and intoxicating the sport."
Illidh Doyle is a golden massacre of the United Nations community at 400 meters away, and these are his fifth worldwide competition. He thinks that it is "incomprehensible," that the world group has 16 skots.
The previous spectrum was seven years from 1983 to 2015.
The Middle East drinker Laura Mur has been drinking for five years in Ison-Brittan and two European specimens.
He's competitive in London at 1,500 metres and 5000 meters.
Chris O'Hare walks in London at 1,500 meters. It also supports him with the eye: a man has a great time of winning in the MM-carsines of Ison-Brittanians and Anniversary Games.
Doyle recalls his first world mastership, where the only skoke to the country was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the world is saying that there are so many scotts that are really competitive with their finances and metalls.
"The access is, however, great honor, but more specifically it is because the members of the country's groups have voted to the Captain," says Doyle.
"I'm certainly very proud of all the skots that have come to the country team.
It shows how long we've been.
They are able to come together as sports who competite for rewards.
Captain's talk?
I think it's all right.
I thought how happy we were when we had homes.
It is important to enjoy the support of the home membership and that we are again in the Olympic Stadiums.
I'll get another chance to competite there and I know that the air clouds will be unclean."
Prevention of reviewers in Facebook: Don't be set to the public office if you don't be critical
Our country knew what's bad publicity.
Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers immediately began to appreciate him from all possible homes of political principles always to his political principles.
I'm sure that the criticism was a doctor.
But he didn't quit his appreciationers.
"If the freedom of speech is removed, we will be able to lead as empty and silent as sheep to be shockable," said Washington in 1783.
That's what we also have to go to the head of Maryland to Larry Hogan, which should be learned from Washington.
Hogan's staff has removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and prevented them.
The United States Citizens' Rights Alliance has devastated Hogan's right this week ago.
His staff is not based on the challenges, and the relationship was also reduced in the network.
"What's the matter? It's just Facebook." Many comments.
But there's a meaning in this matter,
Especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is a surprising representative of the Democratic State.
He's got the second best observations of the 50-hour-leading.
Hogan isn't reacting to the warm.
He has been stablely conducted by the State and had strictly maintained the principles.
He has also used the Facebook as the main contact channel of its voters and published the image in the chemotherapy.
Therefore, preventing users on the Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The page of the Governor is public and official forum that its staff will maintain tax resources.
Amelia Chasse, a reporter of the Hogan, defended the office of the Secretary in his discussion with Washington Post, and he said that it was only about the comments of moderation.
However, it is too easy for comments to be tropical, swimming or hatred.
Washington Post discussed Hogan's Facebook users.
They proved to be a normal person who wanted to discuss with their chosen leaders; they were not trolls, for example, teachers, attempters and pastors.
They told them that their comments were respectful, appreciative and interesting.
The pastor read his comments in the Bible, and he wanted to give Hogan to the Catholic faith.
The questionnaire Lakshmi Sarma Ramani Maryland's Bowie was not enemy but asked about the winners.
"I was deceived by the committee that Hogan didn't have taken place for vine and other recent news", he wrote in the comments of Washington Post.
"I can't also accept that when more people comment on the same matter, they are immediately considered as a group organized and being set up as a large group of citizens concerned."
The Director's staff called comments "concentrations to attack, and someone else could call them to promote important issues.
It is easy to control in the Facebook period by preventing or removeing critical comments.
Before the old man, he had to send the staff to collect and smoke a newspaper that had been published in critical statements, or to arrest and shut up the publishers.
However, it is really the same matter, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first public officer who was accused of defeating the Facebook and other social media channels.
The president Trump's Twitter users have seen him in the right.
The first important decision was given in Virginia last week.
According to the Court of Justice of Alexander James C. Cacheris, the Government of Loudoun was the first additional of the United States Constitution by preventing a voter in Facebook.
And the United States Citizens Rights Association was discussing the use of the Kentucky Republic-General Matt Bevin and Twitter.
This shouldn't be hard.
During Washington, the evil post payments had similar effects as today on the Internet.
The number of newspapers from 1776 to 1800, and the unnamed writers moved to Washington.
I've already been trolls at that time.
The names of the letters Juricola, Valerius, Belizeriaus and Portius were written in the newspapers where they called Washington’s decisions.
The President's office was referred to in Jay's agreement, namely, between the United States and the United States of Cooperation, Trade and Sea Trade Agreement, which is reported on documents of George Washington's network project.
However, he did not silence his appreciatives.
Freedom of the Word, freedom of opinion and freedom of discussion are fundamental to our people.
The real leadership means accepting this fact.
Sounds of birds are the reason to stop right now.
The samples have come from about ten places, and also net notifications from the couple, three.
Not one of them has come from the South and Varsinais Summit, but then individuals from Haapaved and Sieneja, specialist Marja Isomursu Evir.
Vierpeipot died for tricommonosis.
It causes scientist named Trichomonas gallinae.
It has previously been known to skins, and especially to the skin.
However, in the centuries of the 2000s, the diseases also began to be observed of pelipoleans.
In 2009, it was a very honourable one.
Thus tricomonis was caused by the Finnish cyclopean cycling, after which the species had been shocked down.
The diseases have now been, but not at least in a shockful, Helsinki University’s Natural Center Museum (Luomus) tells the museum Juha Honkala.
There are fears that the previous epidemics of inhibitors will be renewed, unless they do something.
What we need to do now is a very simple thing that can do every one: stop selling birds immediately.
Add the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes his benefits from home-basing with Renaissance Club
The former European Countries, Ronan Rafferty, hopes that his home-based benefits for the next three days when Renaissance Club in Eastern Lothian is organizing the 25th Skotlanian senior Open tour.
Rafferty, the Northern Lawrence, led the past year in Archerfield Links in the neighbourhood before the last round, but finally lost Paul Eales. Rafferty was pleased in the new place and operates a tour for the founder of the club and director of the officer Jerry Sarvad.
"I observed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and after this event, it will come to its glory." Rafferty says.
"It's all right.
Jerry has done a great job with this place.
He's a joyful shipment, and he's proud of his dose here.
Turnance is a great state of presentation in this field."
The English Eaux is the first time to defend magistrateness, although it has been triggered in its 32-year-old urgency as well as in European and European disadvantages.
"This feels really special for an opportunity," says the player in Southport.
"I'm not allowed to defend my victory of Extremadura Open, because the turn does not belong to the round this year.
It's great to come back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Remembers have come back in the last few years: the shift was wonderful to me and my wife Sharon.
It was a great time we will always remember."
Gary Orr returns to the real work on his ground, and he went to the rounds preceding 50 years ago.
This is his first event in Scotlandia since 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scotish Open tour.
"To play struggle is always the most common one," says Orr, who lives in Helensburg.
"You want to succeed but you're also feeling more pressure.
I enjoyed playing again and playing time strongly.
I'm satisfied with my game until now."
Third to follow the field of former Masters, Ian Woosnamin, and senior largest tourists Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
The tournate is six scotts: Orr and former captain Ryder Cup, Sam Torrance, and Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The car stopping is paying five pounds if there is only a driver, and ten pounds if you have at least two people in the car.
All the products are gifted to the UK Prostate Cancer Organization.
In the sample, the possible internal climate problems were identified.
In the sleeves of Pori prikate, the construction of the carriage company of the Communication Company has not been found at least one of the internal problems found, the pricket was reported in the tours.
The internal studies continue to be investigated.
The explanations began when a man stopped the health caused the care of his insurance because of the illness of the carpet.
According to Mika Holman, President-in-Office of the Forcessariat, there have not been any problems found in the health situation of other insurances.
It appeared that there was an individual status in this case, and other servants did not have healthy problems in that service.
Each report is severely addressed and we wanted to find out this matter basically.
There's no information at this time that we have nothing in the internal problem, Holma says.
In the precautional information, it is said that, because of the arrival of July, the arms had to be transferred to the goods, which is why the deterioration has been now increased.
The air has been able to affect the skin, Holma says.
Poverty and death in Indonesian golden country
Bardina Degei doesn't use it in the food plant.
Even when he's cut, he's just useful.
Degei lives in the bottle in Enarotal, the capital of the Pania, located in the Indonesian province of Papua. When he is preparing daily, he generally sets a battle – locally "no" – directly to come.
After an hour later, the battle returned to the cart to eat swimmingly, unclean hands.
There are no rooms in the house of Dege, and he is sit on a different farm where he generally handles his daily steps, such as the nearest swimming powder in the swimming pool in the swimming water.
The department of the age provides an unexpected snake in the room.
Degei is the four of his young husband's wife, and he has not been able to handle the games.
There's a general marriage here.
Labour may be dangerous: most of the villages are unemployed, and many drinks, and the soldiers must also be taken into account.
"No one's going to walk in the village after five nights," Degei says.
This is a rare decline in the tops of Papua, in the former Dutch movement, which was connected to Indonesia in 1969.
The Government of the Holland has opposed the local self-respect quickly translated its hate to the government of Jakarta, which is strictly maintained the region and prevented the access of foreign providers and human rights assistants.
In 2003, the province was officially shared to Papua and the West Papua, and the east part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
Anarotale is distant and trick. The path begins from half an hour to flight from the capital of Jayapur, Province, to Nabir, and continues to swim five hours in the car hill.
There's no public traffic here.
About 19,000 people in the town of the city have wooden trees, with a swimming snake of snakes.
Only rare Indonesians have come here, without talking about suppliers and foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, Papua Mee Pago’s descendants worshiped the god of Uga Tamee.
Another change has happened.
"We didn't have such clothes," Degei says. He means a color, frozen hands, darkness, and slight color.
"After we had just a newspaper as a guard."
Papua is the most poorest province of Indonesia, and 28 per cent of its populations live on the lower border of poverty, and children’s mortality and disorder are the highest of Asia.
But it's also the Indonesian golden country.
The pania is just a hundred miles away from the Pania of Grasberg, the largest and higher gold shop of New Jersey, which owns Freeport McMoran company in Phoenix in the United States.
In 2015, the cow was produced to Freeport $3.1 billion from the value of the money and the coat.
Furthermore, Papua has estimated 78 billion dollars of wood barriers.
However, these riches of Papua produce corruption, since they mean the shocking presence of the Indonesian armed army.
The New York Times announced in 2005 that Freeport paid the local military office and military military units for almost $20 million in 1998-2004. The individual officers were even paid to $15,000.
The requirements of a larger self-determination rights threaten this source of income, and they are striving towards mercy.
According to human rights activists, the Indonesian army has killed more than 5000,000 priests and rape, punished and arrested thousands after 1969.
According to the Asian Commission of Human Rights, the tribes of Papua’s families in the 1970s have been measured in the midst of the murder of the people.
Last year, Indonesia’s police arrested over 3 900 people in peaceful exhibitions.
In Brisbane Archive Society report, We Will Lose Everything from 2016, there are reports of the statements of the previous year, such as the cases without the court, the complaint – the rape and the electronic companies are specially recommended means – and the regulation of attacks towards peaceful impressions.
"The calculation of the number of news is difficult because cases are last week," says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian student of Human Rights Watch Organization.
The powder has been painted when Papua’s natural resources are shocked by changers from other Indonesians.
83 per cent of the province of 3,5 million people are Christians, but the population structure has changed when the Indonesian cities from Javan, Borneon, Sumatra and Sulawes can change the muslims to the region in the hope of the better income of the muslims.
Javaian warning feeds are sold in the grain-gaga-profit record.
The locals are hard to competite.
"News have started to sell shoes and sweats with torches more than local", says Abeth You, 24-year-old who is home from Pania and has changed in the capital city of Province.
"Time women lost their customers."
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo – his favorite Jokowi – authorized the lack of the injustices of Papua and human rights rape in 2014.
Papua consists of 29 regions, and this former forest wins a vote in 27 regions, including in Pania, traveling to the President of Jakarta.
But just a little has changed in Papua, and locals feel their arrival as a pleasant.
"We were smiling because we voted Jokowi in 2014 and we expected him to fill our hopes and restore justice," you say.
The panies were tested only two months after the Western officials of Jokow.
The 11 children were sing of Christmas singles from Enarotal in Enarotal 7.12.2014, when the darkness appeared to two Indonesian soldiers in motorcycles.
The scared kids told the soldiers that they should use driving lights.
One of the other soldiers had no comments, and a local pastor Yavedt Teba said that a man returned to the place with four soldiers.
According to the reports of victims and Witnesses, the soldiers slaughtered the children and struggled in the harvests.
So one of the wars shot the kids.
One of the 16-year-old children, Yulianus Jeimo, tried to smell as a result of the painful depression.
A couple of hours later, the building of the government’s visa ships close to the country was established, and on the next day the event began.
About thousands of priests, young men and women, and children, gathered a football toward the local police office and the military headquarter to require justice.
They were together with the forest gaps intended to celebrate, and they began to show the traditional waiting dance of the Popua Mee Pago - son of Pope, where they were danced in the ring and followed the bird single.
Some of the instincts began to struggle the police and military buildings.
When the tunnel of my clouds, the soldiers received an internal radiosystem order: "If human forces do a contrary to more than three times, shoot them dead." The information is based on the TIME magazine to see an official document that has not been published to local information tools.
Jeremiah Kayame, 56. The director of the region of Kego Koto, was shocking from the hands of the situation, and asked the people to be calmed and return to their homes.
Nobody wanted to listen.
“When I turned around, I was shooted on the left coast,” he told the TIME newspaper as a brilliant color in its landscaped trees.
We still don't know who shot him, but the crew came from the row of the soldiers.
"A number of shocks were shocked in the shock."
Alfius Youwi was shocked three times.
"I checked to him and assured that it was really she," told John to the TIME magazine. In the way of many Indonesians he used only the same name.
"That she was dead, I shouted him."
Pope Police Counsellor Yotje Mende told the employees that the police only "protected" the police position because it was an attack.
"We must defend when people are threatening to kill us," Padjo Sulistayo reported in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to the Human Rights Watch Organization, five young men were murdered, and many were blessed.
The information about the murder was held on Jakara on the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi felt a conversation in Jayapur in which he expressed his parts to the families of victims and promised that Papua’s violence would be defeated.
"I wish the case will be immediately investigated so that it will never happen anymore."
In October 2016, Vianto, Minister of Security, said that he would start the conclusions of human rights crimes outside the legal system.
However, she began to get back to his conversation immediately.
"The majority of the crimes has happened a long time ago,
In the 1990s and in the beginning of the 2000s.
The main thing is that we have decided to investigate crimes, but it is necessary for certain processes," he said.
In the TIME magazine in Jakarta 5.6.2017 Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said he didn't want to start findings in Papua.
"It's all going to be out in the court." He said.
The United Nations condemns Wiranto "criminality against humanity". Criminal crimes relate to more than thousands of human deaths in East Timor in the 1999 blood of self-respect.
The families of the victims in panii are inclined to defense.
"I have been discussed four times in the past three years, but things have not been advanced in any way," says John.
"I've already been angry about this."
He's still telling his life in fear, although it's been over years.
"I'm afraid," she says.
"I think the army's arresting me, I'm afraid we're gonna shoot me."
His brother Jacob confirms that the panians are not slow to discuss the event.
He says that the soldiers were worse to him when he helped to beat four victims.
"The soldiers are looking for me after the burning of the victims," he says.
The teams haven't finished.
In the meantime, Indonesian police shot villages in the Neighbourhood of Pania in Deiya.
One died and 17 was blessed between the leader of the villages and the construction company, which was started when the director refused to lose the hospital of a man and had also had children.
He was 24-year-old Ravianus Dow who had been shooted with water when he was shooting in a nearby fishing area.
The hatred villages would like to be addressed in the construction country in front of the company's office.
According to the police, villagers were struck by police who responded to warnings.
However, local police office, which moved by the Indonesian family police, opened a civilian team, where one villager was killed.
"We're in our fear. We're scared of cost," says Dominggu Badi, 29-year-old, who lives near the hospital and saw when he was injured to the treatment.
"I'm hiding at home two days."
The Deiya's Parliament has requested shoots to shoot police responsibilities and to remove the police unit from the region.
The Panama has always been the problem of the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development was feasible in the Middle Eastern, Moni, Dani and Damal homes of Papua, who live in the Middle Lakes.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), the rebellian army who defends the rights of the papians in harmony attacks and in the struggles of the Indonesian army.
Some of the OPM leaders are Pania, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to his rebellion by arresting and arresting thousands of people in Pania in the name "National Sovereignty Safety".
Some prisoners will never return.
Among the Papuaians, Pania is known as "smile, forgotten place".
Poverty eats unpleasantness.
There's only a little bit to sell in the predominant, and it's too expensive to locals,
It's like a bread.
People grow their own food: in general battles, and some of the fruits and leaflets.
There are women's work, and one woman may have four or five battle games.
The majority of the hundreds is to the family, and the ends are sold on the store.
10 battles are paying only 10 000 rupia (75 cents).
The differences in local and variable income have grown, and the number of changers have grown after opening new routes to the Nabire airport.
The jobs are little, and normally they go to local better trained and acquired changers.
Only a rare priest has a sufficient capital and a shared share in the company's competitiveness.
"The people don't want to stay in the village because there's no work and no money here," says President John Gobai, President of the Panya's home Council.
The disadvantaged Papua remains in the world with little attention.
Moreover, the restrictions on international newspapers are still strict.
Preceding this year, French suppliers Franck Escudue and Basille Longchamp were disfellowshipped by Papuel, although they had been granted a rare description freedom.
According to Phelim Kne, President of the Human Rights Watch Organization, Jokowi has not had the freedoms of warning, and he has not increased transparency and did not promote development by removing the limitations of the news.
"A new risks for provincies from the Indonesian provinces of Papua and West-Papua are: the extinction of the visa and the black list," Kine stated in its opinion.
The lack of the freedom of activity of the newspaper means that the Indonesian government only pressures the nearby Papua.
In March, six of the Pacific states — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Saars and Solomon Sacred – encouraged the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate the “breaks and wide crimes”, including the attack of Pania.
These States have also supported the freedom of Papua.
Arrmanatha Nasir, an Indonesian Foreign Minister, reaffirmed the accusions and reported to the employees in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still a democracy that has a freedom of newspaper, so the fact that the evidence of human rights offences would be difficult".
The locals want that the governments of the Foreign Governments are missing.
When the official delegation of Holland, the Chief of Human Rights Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapur, 4.5.2017, the locals dismissed silence and expressed their desire to freedom, reporting the permanent source of meeting.
In Indonesia, the Presidents have 2019, but the pausians say that they are probably not voted by Jokowia.
"Another means good, but there are people around him who have been cut off to Pania's shooting," says the President Gobai's home Council.
He wants Jokowin to know the situation of panians: they live under the lack of and unreasoned military power, in poverty, in practice, without health care and educational opportunities.
According to Goba, panians, like other papians, think Jokow's voice as "privileges", which must be paid back.
"They don't want money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and fears, the victims of the victims of Pania reacted again with comparison: they entered one of the victims against the country of the police and the army stations.
They know that they may never have the right, but at least they will not let the responsible ones forget their crimes.
"My family members were killed," Jacobus says in the press.
"What else can we do?"
Dereck Chisora shouted about the breakdown of the Robert Helena's renewal: "If you don't want to see."
Robert Helenius and Dereck Chissoran, a pregnant series of pregnants, were intended to take place in the Hartwall Area on May 27th.
However, the battle was defeated by commercial reasons.
Chisora is driving in the IFL TV conversation because of the flowing of the renewal to the hearts of Helenis.
My battle in Finland flocked, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell bands there.
Because he was my Finnish opposer.
Before his fans, you don't want to see him taking, because he's crazy, Chisora's kidding.
Helenaus and Chisora first met in the Hartwall Area in December 2011.
Helenaus wins the battle with the shooting point court.
The library of the renewal was shocked, and its promotor Nisse Sauerland told the night-Zanomin in May that the fight has been moved to the syxy.
There's no new part of the battle.
However, the corruption of Chisor is no longer harmful.
The fight would, of course, be held to eliminate any case in Chisor's disease.
Torstaina, three days prior to the battle period, I was raised in pain.
My tiny was on the explosion.
In the hospital, it was said that I had to smile, Chisora says.
The UK's telling it is now about 45% of the good.
It is not all about the interesting revision with Helenus, but the star is Dillia Whyte.
Chisora suffered for the death of him in December.
I came to repeat your government in Duba
In Duba's Sunday, the largest residential building in the world was able to run 337 meters from the higher 79-century building.
This was already another fireball within two years of the building, which is the name to be Torch.
The structure was empty, and no knowledge was blessed, and a lot of reasons was not considered immediately after the event.
"We were sleeping and we wake up the voice of the fire and the crystal of people.
We've been driving down the 50th decade, which took ten minutes, ” said Reuters.
According to the Dubane Saviation Authorities, the disappointment teams were shocked on four mornings at local time and left the building.
The government reported to those who left their homes to organize their mastership.
The meeting can reverse questions about the security of materials that are used outside high buildings in different parts of the world.
The Directorate-General of the Torch Building conducted an investigation after 2015, in which it found that the majority of the damages suffered from publicity and the disadvantaged disks used.
In the United Kingdom, the police believes that London Grenfell Tower was able to promote the rapid expansion of the pool in the fire in which 80 people died in June.
The Jeansuulair park site was stolen during the mopo night.
The Mopo was stolen from the Yoensuula Parking site between 21 and 5 p.m. and the average week.

In the United States more than 20% of aircraft passengers take the prohibited objects according to the vehicle, the questionnaire investigation
A flight survey shows that more than 20% of the passengers in the United States had been prohibited by information or without any information on the United States Transport Security Agency (TSA) control points. At least six per cent passengers had vehicles or other materials that they knew were not prohibited.
Only one percent reported that they had been wrongly carried out weapons, ammunitions or explosions.
I answered more than thousands of passengers, and it implemented Stratos Jet Charters State Company. The results also reveal that young passengers threaten other rules.
The TSA rules informally disrupted 19.7 per cent of passengers were representatives of the Y-school generation and less than 15 per cent of the age of X.
In general, the rules were crimed by bringing food and liquids to the airport.
More than three per cent of the farmed materials are informedly on the aircraft, and 2,2 per cent of women and 3,7 per cent of men reported that they were prohibited in the aircraft.
The question of travellers from different parts of the United States was that the company carried out wanted to figure out how many of them had been carried out in a harmful safeguard and how many of them had done so informally.
It is not surprising that most passengers also carry out secret transport resources likely to end up the security check — informally or without knowing.
But as a questionnaire states, the TSA's guidelines are especially complicated and incredible.
Travellers often don't know what liquids to take on the airport and how much.
As a result, it is not surprised that the largest part of the TSA’s back stocks are liquids.
Sometimes there was a power to think that the airport could not take books to the aircraft.
They can get home to flights, but not to international flights.
Scott Pruitt, Director of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, decided to reduce emissions in the period of Obama
Thus, after 15 Member States have dismissed the EPA Director of the EPA Environmental Protection Agency, the Pruitt has delayed the action of the decision to reduce the emissions caused by the Obama government period of smoking.
According to the PV, the change shows that the Agency of its leaders takes better into account the needs of decision-makers that respond to the environmental matters of States.
The Pruitt did not mention a sentence against his previous decision in the Court of Auditors.
Some States should begin to comply with the requirement of 2015 on the race of the earth from the beginning of 1.10.
In June, Pruitt reported that he would transfer decisions for the next year so that his Agency has more time to be made to the plan, because the Agency “does not want to miss local decisions or to defeat the economic growth”.
The Pruitt was a general accusal of the Oklahoma State, before President Donald Trump appointed him as the leader of the EPA, and the Pruits are known as a more strict of environmental rules.
After his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or reduce chemicality and fossil fuel decisions.
The recent change of mind in the middle-week is the last part of the Pruit plan to apply the provisions.
In the last month, the Court of Auditors of the Union in Washington adopted a decision which the Director of the EPA had overlooked its Governments in trying to delay the decision of the Obama government on oil and gas companies. The decision imposed the companys to monitor and reduce the methane years.
In the second weeks' opinion, the Pruitt stated that its full translation only confirms the cooperation of the EPA with the States in a complex process which aims to meet new requirements in accordance with the timetable.
"In the previous governments, EPA has often failed to comply with the deadlines, and then expected that the active groups and others strive the right to reach the temporary tables of the Agreement", said Pruitt.
"We don't believe that the regulation that is happening through the courts is seriously linked to terms.
We are also seriously addressed to the regulation on our activities and to our Finnish powers."
However, in the EPA's opinion, the Pruitt can continue to use "involve its powers to reduce the impact of decisions and other legal powers" to ensure that the provisions are "based and based on the best available information".
The Republics are conducting a broader change in my holding rules in the conferences.
The last month's legislative instrument aims to delay the action of decisions in 2015 at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted in the senate.
In this week of EPA, the general accuser Eric Schneiderman of the State of New York, who has led to the rule of law, said that the group will continue to press.
"The change of the EPA is the consequence of the winning of 6,7 million New Yorkians and more than 115 million Americans that are exacerbated in the Community," Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, there were meetings in California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and district of Colombia.
The earth’s title, for example, was reacted to the aircraft in cars, power institutions, oil-based emissions and the emissions of chemicals.
This can cause serious breathing rights to human groups who have been discovered, and it is also part of thousands of years before deaths.
The national health providers and environmental protectionists welcomed the surprising project change of Pruit.
"I'm worried about how much pressure was required to use health reasons to our breathing boy", says Lori Ann Burd Biological diversity.
"We have to fight against Trump's governance, as its ideological goal is to operate on the conditions of the poorers and the other groups in advance."
The Super-Agent Manufacturer comes from the manufacturer of the superautos, "It's happening in the Ferrari style."
It also intends to put the hybrid sports in the same way that it is trying to maintain its exclusive position.
This seems likely to happen, but it happens in Ferrari's style, the Vice-Chairman Sergio Margine said the plan in the middle-week of information.
The details of the new strategy will be shown next year when the Italian super-auditor presents its new five-year plan, Automotive News News.

Literoid phone discussions show the pressure of Trump to build the border wall
The literature of telephone discussions between the United States President Donald Trump and Mexico and the Australian leaders have been covered to Washington Post.
Trump invited President Enrique Peña Neoa at the telephone debate on 27 January 2017 to stop his public speech that he would not pay the proposed border wall.

Georgia blood finding: Aktivists will renew racist lynch in hope
Ford Mercury's car takes a population team in the small town of Monroe in Georgia and continues to travel to a small town of Moore's Ford.
There are four black drivers in the car, and a white driver, and four armed men spend the way before the car goes there.
Somebody's chief, a medium-year-old man takes a deep life from his sigaret and strikes through the winter.
The passengers are scared.
"Roger, no-u!" The man's awesome.
Get out of the car!
Sounds break silence when a young black man gets out of the front.
This awesome event is only a re-examination proposed by 22.7.2017.
However, the disorders of the insulin are the realities when the fresh air is shocked to the "Roger".
Since 2005, human rights organisations have returned to Moore's Ford to re-establish the events in 1946. Then Ku Klux Klan had two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
There's no one in charge of the murder.
"I'm awesome that no one has been arrested in these years - although the murderers live between us and many have to know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who helps re-related arrangements.
"It's the horrible power of history, but first, it's a strike that pressures our soul."
Brooks is a 71-year-old citizen rights activist and an ex-Georgian Congressor.
It also reminds the people of Monroe that wickedness has never been corrected.
"We want the guilty to come to the right, and we want that things will finally be taken to the decision, and we want to join the laugh and to accept, but mostly we want the right," says Brooks.
"We can't cut up and make agreement before we get the right."
The surgeon's mortality investigators guard the victim's victim's 27.7.1946 blood in Georgia.
According to the NBC news documents, more than 50 men were suspected of the shortcut from Monroe and its environmental circumstance.
But no one was accused of murder.
Although the accused persons have been free for decades, activists say that the reasons for lying have been in the whole time in local information: policy and sex.
In 1946, the neighbors of the Georgia State received the decision to vote on the first time in the presidency. The High Law adopted its decision in April, and the laws were held in spring.
According to the FBI, there was an interruption in which a black farmer Roger Malcom lacked white landscape Barnett Hester in the battle that apparently cooked Malcom's wife Dorothya.
Brooks reported that Hester had a relationship with Dorothy and that Dorothy was waiting for this child.
According to the FBI information, an effective white earthquake Loy Harrison was estimated by $6,7.1946 Malcom's $600, which had been released from prison.
In the home, Malcom and Dorothy were their chief Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The small team stopped their car before Moore's Ford was shocked.
"I saw Harris's status and ordered the murders." The FBI's estimated.
"I also indicate that between the State and the local authorities were secret, and the authorities were part of murders and lost evidence and have not discovered the personality of the Witnesses."
Brooks shows that it's better.
"It was a vocabulary murder," he says.
"They were murdered, because the blackmans were wanted to report to them that if they wanted to vote."
Cassandra Greene has controlled the refination of Georgia's blood injury for about ten years.
It is extremely realistic and imprisoning, and it is a descriptive of the race that many want to believe that they are already lost from the United States today.
It's hard to look, but it's still harder to see what Greene says.
"We don't want to talk about the slowness, because we should have met our dark sides," says the director.
"But I can't create a relationship with you if you don't hear me or you don't want to hear what I have been trying to experience."
The practices of this year began in June, and the first day, about 30 demonstrators — a ten - black and a couple of white ones — were gathered to listen to the slaughtered green.
Wade Marbaugh works as a Greene Aviation Chief.
He has presented the local leader of Ku Klux Klan for years, but the role is always as difficult and contrary.
"It's a bad condition, because I'm not myself," Marbaugh says.
"But it is important that the half of this story is being considered in order to never again."
On the other side of his dialogue, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester.
The story starts with Malcom shouting and my sweet Hester, and he's angry that Hester had a relationship with Dorothy.
"You didn't hear?" I said, "I got out of my mail."
Rascona is Hester.
Then you're gonna go to the shooting.
And then all (also all black showers) are smiling in a smile.
Greene smile more.
"What?" Rascona asks.
She's shocked.
"Have I been too excited in harm?" he asked.
"It's," Greene slows.
"I just don't believe that the whites were then using the word n-u."
"Yes," the other black shower confirms.
"It's a slang, you need to use the lower version."
The issue of the presentation is unpleasant, but the room has the power of a friend's body.
Everyone wants to succeed and not only because of the statement, but they want to respect the memory of their murderers.
It's starting from the start.
Now, Rascona's words are awesome.
Nobody's laughing.
The re-examination ends quickly and violently.
Strikes, shocks... and silence.
Another slaughtered woman stands next to the body and sing Billie Holiday Strange Fruit.
His voice is smelling every other word.
A few ten meters away from the twenty-five watchers shock their eyes with shoes and skins.
Of course, almost half of the level is black and white.
There is a couple that has come to see the presentation of the New York State, but most of them are local.
They have been trained by Brooks in the skins of the victims in Georgia’s painful coast.
The murders have changed the story to reality.
After the song, Greene calls the people's team to check the body.
Childs are able to look at the beauty and unmovable bodys and to smell each other.
"They aren't really dead," a little boy thinks like to remember himself.
A few minutes after Greene thanks the public.
The showers presented with the lyncans strike up their references and smell the cylinders.
Bradshaw likes Marbaugh, the local President of Ku Klux Klan.
Nick Rascona has two showers, and then he was shocked after a French presentation.
"I'm fine," she said, "I'm not gonna be comfortable.
"We know that you're not her.
You did this good reason."
Afterwards, the public and the showers are gathering together at night.
The white couple who arrived from the altar is discussing the presentation that he had just met with the black couple.
Denise Duplinsk is difficult to find words when he describes the knowledge of the presentation.
"I'm hard to listen to smell words and to look at the mad things that say and do people that look like you - just because they look like you," he says.
"I was the story to note that the slowness continues," he added. "It's just called arrests."
On the other side, Brooks recalls the development of citizen rights in the same table to hearers.
He's already talking about the planning of the next year.
"Re-examination is a powerful experience because it describes the fears we have experienced, but it is also a learning experience," says Brooks.
"The message is that this can happen again if we don't take it to our learning.
Those who do not know their history are condemned to repeat it."
Exploitation of growth in trade is deteriorate: the elimination of the "internal parts" is correctly regulated
Are you allowed to switch the blood legs already before the shooting?
And how much is it going to take the ananax out of the jungle?
Responsibility is strongly shared in the opinions: one is a quote of an extraordinary sweet, others do not want to pay for the weaknesses of those who do not use and who, however, go home to the ross.
The appearance is identified in the business.
For example, Helsing Ruoholahde's K-City Market is found in bad boxes, since many, for example, the newspapers were cut off.
The newspapers are carried out in the bio-residue.
According to the news published in the Talonomian, the young man is a wonderful trade.
But how much expensive parts of hate are removed before redning really regulating money?
How important is the smoke?
We tested how the price changes when the ananacy, the latva-arts, the sweet, the sweet list and the bloom list takes legs or puts off.
Case: EUR 2,10 paid to the price of a flower cup of EUR 1,80, when it deleted all the legs.
Analysis: EUR 2,30 per euros paying the total amount of an annual price of €1,95 at the time that I put it out of your floor.
Latvia's article: EUR 2,60 was 2,40, when a short position was cut off.
Refrigerators: Two necklace amounted to 75 centimeters.
Without the prices, it's been 60 cents.
Parsaschale: The mid-sized parcel estimated 1 euro and without 80 cents per cent.
Final result: If the newspapers and the pieces go to shoot, you will be able to swallow a few ten sentences in the best way.
As estimated in percentage, the price of skin was even 20%.
Thus, these purchases would have been a total of EUR 1.20!

Middle payment 5 300 euros, education that is going on - "free and free"
The quality of investment has been discussed in the past few years.
The recent reports of Helsinki reported Ritva, 68, to whom the bank movement investment rates were fully talking about investment products in sale.
In the beginning of the next year, the rules on investment investments and the sales of different investment products are limited.
This is based on the new financial market directive which will be started to apply from the beginning of the next year.
Actually, the evaluation of the participation of employees in investors and investment products is based on self-regulation.
The law has not been defined in the case of the partial requirements.
The financial sector (FA) itself recommends that investment workers perform their own APV1 or APV2 research.
Financial studys of the APV projects have been authorized to the Oy firm whose research group is assigned to the Financial Monitoring (Fiva), universities and experts of the sector.
Studies are widely updated 12-15, and their tests were designed by Aalto EE, or Aalto University Executive Education Oy, which offered the development services of the guideline.
In its online pages it is reported that, in general, both tents are "widespread in respect of requirements".
The study material includes 10-15 books and several other instructions and processes.
The Oy Markku Saviko reports that the rate of frequency of the tents is slowly slow to 70% of the evaluation.
The largest expenditure of the bank staff offers all investment services have been carried out by an APV1 or APV2 study, as they are valid in accordance with its own rules.
Then there are smaller bank movements without the name of which staff affects the implementation of the card surveys, Savika.
He said that such bank movements are "re-related."
According to Saviko, the APV1 study has performed 13 000 to 14 000 and recommended APV2 studies for more investments since 2000.
Some banking movements consider the interest in conducting the investigation.
In most of the other sectors, there are significantly more strict component requirements.
Savicco says that the recommendation of the financial sector requires the implementation of the APV studies, as it will be ensured at that time for the investment sector.
According to the statistics, the financial and investment costs are several thousands of euros in the average month.
The average rate of monthly salary work is around 5 300 euros.
In the mean month, men working in the workers have over 5 900 euros and more than 4 500 euros.
The most interested tens of euros will be a average of €8,100.
The majority's tens of men will be paid for more than 9 000 euros per month or more, the largest tens of women who are aware of $6,400 or more.
In accordance with the Investment Service Rules, investment income may only be granted to an operative company.
The employees and tasks have been established in self-regulation until this time.
According to Fiva, the review was received by individual cases where investment professional and skills were not sufficient on the basis of the advisor's activities.
In principle, the sales in investment products may also be operated, although professional and abilities are a heavy level.
The situation in this part has been fair and free.
In most of the other sectors, the Savicco states that there are significantly more substantial requirements.
According to Saviko, since the beginning of this year the new financial market Directive (MIFID II) will be obtained.
It requires that each enterprises respond that the staff offering investment services is sufficiently participating.
Financial supervisory is the amount of authority to be paid.
Fivan market supervisor Marko Hovi reports that one of the clearly amendments currently is the law on the part and experience of investors' sales and investment products.
According to the fact that new requirements relating to as well as to the personality of investment companies, as well as the enterprises who sell products for some company.
Hovi reports that the Government's statement given to the Ministry of State Safety has the power to take part and experience of Fiva.
What they are precisely, it will be decided during the coming spectrum of these visions.
The company must also continue to care for the necessary education and, where appropriate, monitoring and supplementary education.
All of this must be documented, and the company has the obligation to demonstrate that this has also been done.
In fact, it is clear that the company in the practice should, for example, card the personal action on the individual basis.
This will certainly be different demands, depending on investment or sales of products.
The new requirement is also to work with a more experienced person, if it is not sufficient to participate or experience.
So if the company pays a new employee that does not complete the criteria defined, the employer must work with a person who is fully fulfiling a certain time.
According to the fact that the rules of change are strict and concrete.
The legislation on the sale of investment products shall be decreased at the beginning of 2018.

I need to call the company and ask what is this question.

Yes, this is a seventh combined story that we are Finnish workers and these are finnish products, says M.
He believes that the company encourages the same Finnish fundamental values that support those who have seen the old unknown soldier.
And it's not the army culture that it's not a visit, it's not to be noticed.
Other partners of the unknown military photo are, for example, Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
For example, the markets have been produced by Hartwall, which are known as Rocca, Hitane and Coskela.

The new results of Swedish security applications were published
The newest results of the medical age of Swedish demanders have been published in Sweden, and the results of the tests carried out in the new evaluation method show that the tests are more than 80% of the age of more than 18 years, but all tests are not considered to be reliable.
Sweden's National Law Medical Medical Agency has initiated the test this year before.
The tests may be assessed by the age of the security applicant, and the new test was taken after the Swedish Migration Agency was estimated that it had not been able to determine the actual age of the applicants who claimed themselves.
At this time, the Migration Agency has performed 6 880 tests, and the Office has now published the results of 2 481 tests. The tests were tested between the Mediterranean and July end of 2017.
The tested 80 per cent, or the 2002 security applicant, was more than 18 years of age, and in addition, the Legal Medical Agency determined 25 that the test was "e.g. 18-year-old or older."
432 cases have been concluded to conclude that the security applicant is "until 18 years of age".
The test was only made in cases where the applicant was responsible for the age notified by the questionnaire.
The office of the Bureau of the Law Medical Medical Academy says that the results are harmonized with the results of the previous months.
"The slows are very harmonious, and the differences in the statistics of the last months are not discovered," he reported to The Local magazine.
Although a large number of applicants were defined for over 18 years, it is not necessarily mean that the applicants would have lied for their life.
In May, the Agency publiced the results of the 581 test and reported that 442 cases were "references for the investigation of 18 or older."
When Svenska Dagbladet investigated the same results, it appeared that 243 cases were openly told by the applicant to be fulfilled this year in 18 years.
The testing method for the age of physician evaluation is taken from ringgen images of wisdom and magnetic pictures from pollutants and then analyzes pictures of dent doctors and radiologs.
One of the suspects is the endocrinologist of the Carilyan Institute, Claude Marcus, which belongs to the evaluation of human biocapacity.
"I have had a reason to think about this, and I agree that the method used is not the right thing.
The definition of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we're certainly not able to determine the age, we should not make it possible," he said to Metro.
However, the Office of the Right Medical Medical Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "That risk may usually be said that the risk to determine the child is small.
The risk is the biggest situation in which it is to be tested precisely 18 years, then the risk is about 10%."

Western Virginia's Chairman changes defence
Western Virginia Democratic Primer Jim Justice announced in the evening that Trump changed its defence.

"Democratics have only 15 leaders and less states than ever before.

Coe exceeds Russia's "Overy" request for forgiveness from dopingscandale
However, the world's general sport Sebastian Coe overcome its open description of the appointment made by Russia for the dopingscandale, and he added that it was not yet time to stop the Russian Language of Participation.
The Russian general sporter Dmitri Shljaht said in the IAAF Congress that Russia's prohibition is appropriate and that he intends to combat the Doping periodically.
He said he was sorry for all the sports who were brought into competition.
In spite of his comments, the IAAF congress voted for the continuation of the ban. Russians were closed from November 2015 after the World Antidoping Agency in the WADA report to support the government from Doping in Russia.
"I think that his answer was very direct today, and it was a very open presentation," the President of the IAAF reported to the suppliers.
"All the Council and the Congress were satisfied that the Russian general sports Association welcomed the land through the difficult times and reported its work to reorganize all its activities."
Coe said it was "pleasant" also that Russia accepted the proposal for a prohibition.
"I think that we had the right day to build and progress have been done, but the Congress supports the recommendation of the Working Group that there is no right time to stop the Russian ban," said Coe.
"We have to do in the past months to normalize the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to hold clean sports differently from the corrupted system," he added.
Nine Russian sportors competite towards neutral sports at London on Monday's MM general sports. They have complied with the strict criteria of IAAF.
Rune Andersen, director of the IAAF Working Group, said on Monday that Russia must still comply with many requirements before it could be returned.

How the economic rules of the football affect Neymar's transfer to Paris
The provisions limited to the use of European footballs do not prevent Neymar's movement from Spain from Barcelona to France to Saint-German, which have a football transfer of players for all times.
The possible consequences of Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) are to decide the EUFA regulated by the European football, which can prevent the participation of the teams.
The EUFA has introduced the economic rules of the game in 2011, as they say, the PSG must be able to demonstrate that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without major losses.
It was paid to Barcelona EUR 222 million for the conclusion of the Brazilian Agreement, and Neymar’s annual currency is moved in ten million dollars next.
The transfer of Neymar to France is involved in many economic aspects.
PSG has no difficulties to pay Neymar's transfer and link him to its stars, as it follows the financing of a rich governant in Qatar oil.
Sisters can use large amounts to buy players, but they must be balanced with real sources of income so that transactions related to football are not missing.
The economic rules of the real game were designed as the EUFA president in 2007 on the initiative of the French Michel Platin.
As the former footballer of Platin, it was agreed that the achievement of success was deteriorated and caused serious problems if the banks or owners supported them.
In 2011, the economic priority of the game was moved from the speed of their losses.
The change means that Roman Abramovich’s first business model in Chelsea was significantly difficult. Abraham obtained a promising team, used large amounts to players and made a worldwide bridge.
The current third year-year evaluation period of the real game will continue until 2018. During that period the follow-ups can be made up to 30 million euros of loss.
Although Platin was obliged to leave the tasks of the EUFA by the scandale in 2015, his follower also wants to shoot the smooth use of the skins.
"The rules of the real game are still being used, and we are also applying them in the future," the economic rules of the game in EUFA, Andrea Traverso reported to the Associated Press News Office last week.
Although the PSG was outlined by the Neymar agreement by a simple reimbursement, it may be divided into the total of its new agreement to the holder.
Neymar has made a five-year agreement, so the transfer of EUR 44.4 million can be recorded after the following five years.
The first sanctions of the real game were distributed in 2014. The largest sanctions were imposed to the PSG and Abu Dhab to finance Manchester City.
The PSG has received the 60 million euros, which was reduced later to 20 million euros, and it was also intended to be limited to its 21 players instead of the regular 25 players instead of the 2014-2015 period.
The EUFA is checking the strikes that may try to turn its financial rules by increasing its income through companies related to owners.
If, for example, the Qatar company supports the PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be greater than the normal market level, EUFA does not be counted as a real result.
This happened when EUFA concluded in 2014 that the Qatar Tourism Authority support was overcome by PSG.
It was also shown that part of Neymar’s PSG could be funded by Qatar in 2022 football MM competitives.
However, the PSG and the Board have refused that Neymar would be to be sent by MMM competitors, and the EUFA would be very easy to reveal such a arrangement.
Because of the former sanctions of the PSG, the EUFA is most closely monitoring businesses with the rule of rules.
The sources from the statistics reported that the EUFA has not negotiated with the PSG transfer of Neymar.
Sends gave a discussion to the Associated Press Research Office, provided that their personality is not discovered because they have no ability to discuss the situation of PSG.
According to the latest public account decision, the PSG trade change in 2015-2016 was 542,4 million euros and the transfer of EUR 10 million.
No recent accounting decisions have yet been published.
PSG expects new sponsors to be reached by Neymar and increased sales of other products and pelips.
Assessing that its trade change increases at least 30% of the Neymar Agreement.
From the exit of the best player in the world, Spain clearly ruined liga tried to move Neymar, as it was claimed to be the households of the real game.
"This is a clear economic case of doping as well as for the follow-up and State," said the Spanish president Javier Tebas to the Spanish AS. He refered to the PSG's qatarian own.
Arsenal's manager Arsene Wenger is also worthy to finance the work of the foot-capalose.
"It is the consequence of self-employment which has changed the activity of the football environment in the last 15 years," Wenger said in the tour.
"All is possible after the State owns the football team.
It is very difficult to comply with the real game's economics. There are so many attractions related to the representative of the state."
Now it's urgent: Finnish MM sports trainer in Helsinki
Length Chief Arttu Pajulahde and third-party Christians as the trainer of Suren Ghazaryan is in Helsing, although he should prepare a general sport in London.
Christians may be competitive without the counsel of their trainer.
The shooting is condemned tomorrow in the swimming snake, and Mosque on Sunday in the three-million snake.
However, two trainer, the Belgian Ghazarian, have not received visions to Isoon-Brittan.
Ghazarya has tried to handle the results of the Great Britain.
The trainer has an invitation to organize MM groups as a document, but has not been valid to obtain a visa.
Is this the first symptoms of Brexit, or what, Director Jorma Kemphicle said.
He has always been able to handle the visions itself, but now there are some problems.
He's doing everything to get to the place.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finnish sportunion SUL for years.
That's not so great.
When someone looks at the stations, Arttu Pajulaht said to his trainer about the possibility of dismissing.
MM-metal for Finland requires miracles
The MM swimming swimming pool starts at London on Wednesday, on Sunday 13 August.
The surgery, the landscape and the residue are the species of which the Finnish sports divided into an enthusiasm from another year to the other, where it comes to success or not.
The success in the heart of the pink sportors is measured in metalls.
It's also other measurements.
A less attention to youth sportors remain the beautiful growth rates of the values of another, in which the experience is enabled to achieve the performance of the sportor to the level that adult MM-meters can be infected.
Now, in the Finnish small MM team, there are no young sportors, and not really conkarries.
MM-metal for Finland requires miracles.
Surely, the interest in the sport and surprisingness is that miracles can be shocked.
It spends sports on the side of the television swimming pool and swimming to follow the skins, although London's metalls are raised from the age of just a nighttime.
From the previous MM swimming swimming pool 2015, Finland received one prestige.
It took the artist Tero Pitkivuki.
The Ukrainians are waiting for the Middle East now, although others tell the results of him and other stakeholders’ last days, and the rest of the Pitchai in the last time.
In any of these kitchens, Pitquitoki remains a great deal in the history of Finnish sports.
Other Finnish sportors have access to the end-competition or their own precaution to the Finnish Sporters is sufficiently good.
The realistic metall chain for the coming years of the Finnish general sport gives a good success in the international values of young people today in the summer.
The dissemination of young donations and the financial support of its work is more important than maintaining the elite team of sports supporters.
Success is not at the time, but requires work of sports and patientness as well as sportors for years.
Finnish members also value international sportors and enjoy their unique performance.
Unfortunately, the shocks in London remain in the history of Usen Bolt and Mo Farah, and not because of the fear of terrorism or weakening attacks.
I'm a second bed in Copper's great air, "But it hurts."
In the second largest crowd in the United States, Enni Food is located in Colorado.
The Copper Mountain has come to the greatest air cup of Rukajerve.
Women's kids winned Jamie Anderson in the United States.
The smells collected 147 points in the competition.
He first tried to shoot the 1080 chair in the kitchen, and it was very close to success.
Good feeling, and the good fill is now, but it's hurting that the last hyppy hasn't been great.
Yes, I'm going to try this from this time in the chairs, the wind of prayer.
The big air of the skin in the air of the cowboy swimming powder for the species.
Viking Line's new little ship to get in Helsing.
Reservation company Viking's new FSTR swimming boat is a bad timetable.
The little boat had to go from Helsinki to Tallinna at 8:00.
The ship had eight countries on the start.
The ship came back in Helsinki.
At least twenty hours I've been waiting for the ship.
Now the car is a little moved, and at Helsinki’s sail, the official John Rebane, who was expected to reach the ship at the ship, told at 19:30.
Rebane thought that the new ship had come to a technical fault.
Rebane reported that the reserve company had introduced its access to the ship in its cars that were expected.
The Chief of Communication of Viking Christa Grönlund says to the IS that it was a technical fault.
It's got it in Helsinki's hour when it was corrected.
The ship is coming from Helsinki for a couple of hours.

Small surrounding: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
The story also deceives the 80s and the ganging days of the 80s and the 1990s (which was David Wain and Michael Showalter's magnificent The State sketch) to the MTV at the MTV and its own time – 2001, before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and other series of stars moved to the most important cases.
Cultural production it is both parodi and the description of a continuous memories we have spent in the Facebook period.
As a commercial product, it feels like it's already alive.
First Day of Camp works well, and not only because of its absurd drugs (which was told by H. Jon Benjamin as a shooting background).
It is the point of view that the medium-year-old displayers appear to be slightly slightly approached by full-ageness, and it highlights it makes it possible for a part of the slowness of the past.
Ten Years Later, where adults appear to be adults, is less sensitive, and its parody is more delicate: it is paradioid by the stores of the 1990s, such as the horrible picture of your hands that are skilled.
One of the specimens of the Apple Powerbook, the Inline Rolls and "Other round from 1991".
Many of the stories are the same as before.
Welcome Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but has not yet been reached over Katieta (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still kids.
And a crazy drunk is with Ronald Reagan, a criminal partner, George H. W. Bush (which is partly shown by Michael Ian Black).
Like always in these series, it's the best ones of the sides.
The special fun is to see the vinour Paul Rudd, who has an abattue under the piece, namely Matt Dillon's "soul patch" film Singles. Ruddin's showing Andy, the lady's king, starts to be a old age.
The moments of sweet smell may be shocked into this series as a recursive Seven Up! - until it gets the apparent decision: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years Later. On the last point, the friend team goes to the first day of the Wet Hot American Summer photo.
The Amazon Comrade Comrade Detective reiterates the second nostalgia: The Americans' spirit of the war, the Atomic Blonde photo and even the GLOW-series pressing the weather.
The comediate series have created Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, and it has managed Rhys Thomas. It has been a cryptical copy drama for the 1980s, where the Bukarest couple fights for the truth, athism and markism.
In the main parts of Gregoria and idealist Iosefin are seeing Florin Piersic Jr and Corneliu Ulici. Their dialogs have been dubborn English Channing Tatum and Joseph Gordon Levitts.
It's a great idea,
But there's nothing else.
There are some good visa smilings in the series (polices take time to look at the shock in the same way as the Americans see football).
There are a number of popular audio players, such as Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny. They have just a pleasant game.
However, Comrade detective remains too much in the follow-up of the socialist dramma of the pool – for example, the murderer behind the Reagan's namer, and therefore the series are often starting to feel true from the propaganda.
Six long sequences are too long, and no drugs of the series are sufficiently fast and not rich.
It could be a better phenomenon as a phenomenon, even when Gregor and Iosef are repeatedly walking in the United States majority, and there are always two fleshly men in the hamburger.
A message to the imagination of the community is that the culture of the western culture can make all consumer resources and snakes.
The imaginative Cyprus creatures were not wrong: we were struggling our own neighborhood and their history.
The cowboys Toni Tauru is coming on Sunday in Macao - in response to the former UFC manager
Ton Tauru wants to keep the battle possible.
Ton Tauru receives a very sweet shoe in Maca, because the Brazilian Leandro I was taking in the UFC organization last year.
Brazil also has the world’s black beach and the majority of the species.
I'm going to take myself against my older.
It's fun, Tauru's 32-year-old.
The cowboys had to rise in the island in the last Sunday.
The struggle was denied because of logistic problems, but three campaigns were held in the short-term table of China's self-administration area Macao.
Tauru hasn't previously set up the moon.
This was the first time when my battle was denied.
It was ridiculous because the preparation and my tree took a lot of time.
However, it is satisfied that there was a new time for the campaign.
Preparation for weekly week is not just an impact on preparation.
The movement isn't affected by the channel because it's not a week.
As long as you can go worse, if you're doing too much now.
Tauru is in a number of previous campaigns of opposers whose strength is possible.
This time, the situation is different.
Issaa is described as a typical Brazilian.
He's a very aggressive actor.
I'll tell her that he's going to be in the first shock on the head and try to take the shooting.
He won the world's magic, so he knows the pressure.
The previous battle of the copper has not planned according to the plans.
Kevin Belingo, the Philippines, stripped Tauru into the eye, and the winning left the Philippines.
I've never thought so much, especially in the possible way: he didn't have any part of it.
When I was leaving to shoot, he bought my eyes.
It really hurted it for a long time.
New motivation
Some of the volunteers will take one year, a part is slower.
For example, the future opposer Issa took the last time in September.
It's got three battles last year.
Now, there's a second campaign in the past year.
We've been pregnant.
I've been trained in the last few years, and I've been fine all the time.
But I've just taken it because of taking it.
When a 32-year-old hearing about the future, he decided to change the land for a minute.
I was in Espo in the tree, and I was rejoiced.
We got very good trees when there was one friend of Sweden.
The disappointment was a great help, since the cowboys would be able to spend on a physical campaign on Sunday.
I have been training the same opposers and conducting the position.
It's just 32-year-olds to take up.
I have to smell.
If it's a chance, I'm going to go to my own bag.
The lower shall not be freely given, as it is mostly consuming.
Macao has previously been shocked in China for Tauru.
It's the Chinese Las Vegas.
I think there's a great night before.
The UK Central Bank has a rate of 0.25 per cent
The British Central Bank is expected to indicate that it should be highlighted when economic growth has been unprecedented and inflation heavy has stopped speculations from highlighting.
The British Central Bank has warned that economic growth continues to be slow, and the bank moved emphasis because the results of the family are higher pressures.
The decision-makers of the Financial Policy Panel decided to have a rate of 6 to 2 per cent, which has been less encouraged by the economic growth in the past month.
In the fourth anniversary inflation, the bank was at 1,7 per cent of its growth in 2017 and the 2018 prophecy was 1.6 per cent, and also warned that the income of households was higher, since inflation is still expected to be raised nearly three percent.
However, the bank says that in the nearly years, emphasis is needed to smoke inflation by Brexit, and the bank also reported that the costs of the wage are to be highered on the financial market.
In addition, the members of the Board decided to abolish a part of the massive economic package, which was started to be implemented for the next year of the Brexit national vote.
The bank will stop the Term Funding Scheme programme in February 2018, although it is expected to provide a benefitous financing for banks to 15 million, or a total of 115 million.
The Bank's High Decision protocol states: "In the prediction of the financial policy, the long-term development of the GDP is continued in the coming period when the consumption rate of the reality rates of households is reduced."
In terms of rates, the bank reiterated that inflation is needed for the expectations of the market "speaking the financial policy".
The markets are now predicting the first increase in 2018 on the third and second in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that the possible emphasis are "faceful" and "relative".
In May, the bank predicted the growth of 1,9% in this year and the next year of 1,7%.
Now it was 1,8 per cent of its growth in 2018.
The bridge was heavy to the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
At $0.5 per cent and was $1.31, and the euro was slowed by 0.4 per cent and 1.11 per euro.
The decision should be highlighted at the extent after the expected less growth rates increased the increased expectations of higher higher rates, and the GDP increased 0.3 per cent in the second fourth and 0.2 per cent in the first fourth.
The bank expects that growth remains at 0.3 per cent in the third fourth, but a few years' ends.
The slight inflation vision has only given a little hope for slight inflation and young households suffering from the payment rates, and the bank says that the situation remains bad before it changes better.
The bank added that money policy could not "interfere" in the coming periods, but it expects that the payment development will be "required" at the end of the three-year predict period.
This will also strengthen the intense growth of British products as a result of a weak growth, and a part of the private consumption effects.
The decision was made annually after 0.25% of the rates were raised after the EU-National Resolution resulting in food.
The Bank estimates that the total effects of the decision are likely to be seen in prices and in the economy only four years later.
Before the decision-making of the Central Bank, the emphasis was started to continue to be more sounded when inflation of the pressure faced by the crystal households requires 0.5 per cent in July.
Inflation grew 2,6 per cent of June 2,9 per cent, but the bank said that it was expected and inflation was re-inflation in the near months.
According to the bank, the overwhelming of the objective of the two percent has resulted in a weak tree.
"When we take into account the last rate of swap rates, the competition on the household market would appear to be a crowd when creditors are looking for a lot of customers and want to stop yearly," says the director Andrew Montlake, President of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
"The markets seem specially good to those who have been completed the existing agreement, and the new agreements are more recommended, their impacts are low and also offered inconsistent options."
NHS is estimated to 10 000 cylinders of HIV
From the beginning of the session, patients may be determined "transferable" HIV-related medicine. In the highest right, the financing of the medicine in the public health care system (NHS) was decided.
The NHS reported that the examination treatment (PrEP) was estimated for about 100,000 people during the first third year of experience, and that the medicine to be taken has been reduced by about 86% of the major risk individuals.
The NHS agreed to finance the experience after the case of the case of the case of the last year of the Supreme Court, which said that NHS could be able to pay the PrEP, although it claims that the local authorities should finance it.
The English leader Simon Stevens called the decision "when new intervention", and the national AIDS organization described it "in an important moment".
Sexual Health Clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are the first to take an advertising experience that extends to other clinics in October.
Previous pre-related treatment (PrEP) is to be connected to HIV medicine that reduces the periodics.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV tests in risk groups.
Before taking contact with the medicine, it means that in the body there are sufficient medicines that prevent HIV.
A medication may be taken daily or two hours before sex.
The treatment group belongs to homogenes, biological men and transfusions, as well as people with HIV-positive partners who do not receive effective treatment.
Clinics choose the proposal for experience comply with the applicants of men, women and transfusions, as well as those who do not know their antiretroviral treatment with HIV-positive partners.
People who live in England and who have been reported to the general doctor may also request an experience in their local sexual health clinic.
The program pays 10 million pounds, and the English NHS signed this week with drugs after the international competitive competition.
The test is intended to evaluate the potential of the PrEP vehicle by compiling a wide range of clinical samples on its objection, taking and treating.
"This significant new intervention should be supplemented and effective for already existing multilateral and more effective ways to prevent HIV", says Stevens.
"There is one of the major achievements that has been achieved for over 30 years in the fighting of the majority of human health debates."
"This is an important moment in the fight against HIV," says the director of the National AIDS organization Deborah Gold.
"If the PrEP is treated correctly with those necessary and risk-related groups, because it may have a translational impact on the UK HIV epidemic.
From the beginning of the year, risk groups have been funded by the NHS experience of a medicine that they can use yourself without the need to consult with the partner, because there is a strong impact that will improve the lives of many people.
"It's been welcomed by the news."
“It is the important thing to ensure that the experience will be initiated rapidly in the whole country and no risk group remains outside,” says the Director of the Terrence Higgins Act, Ian Green.
"PrEP has been obtained in the community, and we can soon protect 100,000 people from HIV testing. "
"The launch of the PrEP trial has been welcomed by the event that has been struck over a few months because of the slowest government's government's health system," says the Minister Sharon Hodgson.
"We have evidence that the medicine may have a transparent impact on our work that we do to prevent HIV and stop this threatening disease.
The test helps us understand better the real benefits of the PrEP.
It is now important that the experience will be started as soon as possible in the whole country. This is how we can protect HIV highlights and get back to the nearest situation in which HIV spread has been able to stop. "
Life quality: interface and slight income solutions have been made from the small house of Earl's Court
The former banker Joanne Leigh was inaugurated to the smallest apartment located in the Knightsbridgen area in Erl's Court in 2014.
Remont's success tells me that Joanne has not yet shocked his camps and changed.
"Here I lived with my former man in Knightsbridge in the greatest place," says Joanne.
"I didn't have something like this in my price shop.
I came here in the accommodation, and I realized that the rooms were as high as in my silion.
I enjoyed immediately and made a offer on the same day."
After that, about 90 square rooms have experienced a complete form change.
It was a twoth in which the bedroom reached only from the kitchen. Joanne wanted to increase the condition of maintenance as well as the machine to ensure that the room height could be used.
"I wanted space, great times and much light.
They were my requirement," he says.
He rewarded the work of Erfan Azadin Notting Hill from the Duck & Shed Planning Office. Erfan was able to use nearly four meters of high rooms and to create a residence that would not only be remont and sell destination but not home.
It was not exactly sufficient to two substantive situations, so the challenge was to build a machine that could be able to stand.
The solution requires a thinking of Erfan.
"The swimming buildings are time complex.
The shops had to be organized on the top so that they did not need a cycling.
The structures had to be amended so that the height is just appropriate on them and under them."
Erphan was able to place the condition on the top two full rooms in a slightly detail.
The retrouvir is opened in a cochronic window on a smooth residence.
Sweet rooms, gold illnesses and Serge Mouille wintage lights create a synthetic style.
The use of games is the theatreality, the situation of feeling and light.
The swimming smells on both sides can be more effectively affected.
The game between the kitchen is like a window opening the view to another room.
The income of the skin slippers has a condition of conservation for Joanne's foods and washing materials.
Additional slightness is that the kitchen is hidden when it is not used.
The kitchens installed on the kitchen door do not have a new solution,
But in the kitchen, John's unique quality is that the doors will be shooted as the door of the automobile.
"It requires a bit of planning", says Erfan about the thermal swimming door of the MDF.
"It's been balanced, or it's slow when it slows very easily to its places."
After the deterioration and maintenance planning, Joanne received 16 additional squares, the second bedroom and a better basis solution.
"In the sale of the pinta area, or the value of the cognition, is resolved," says Erfan.
"In the basic case, the competitive interface is walking into the apartment and calculating the prices on the basis of the scale sector."
In the area of Joanna, the pinta area was added by using manufacturing materials that produce integrity in the state.
"Assistance is related to the materials of housing, and tunnezi is born in the apartment part of them," says Erfan.
"No one was shooted on the walls to electrical guides.
They're also important but not in the same way."
Joanna's apartment is an example of a good planning and additional instruments can make an exceptional wonder.
Then it can also be likely that the residence is not anymore wanting to change.

The lawyers didn't shoot the floor, but they walked out.
In the kitchen's food sold the Panya Suamsri-Pentti, between the supports of Panja.
He didn't even share the Finnish, nor the Finnish were still part of the tea.
Because the people didn't want to eat, Panja offered free lands.
That's how he taught donkeys to eat sharks with the snakes.
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, I know, I'm going to be there.

In June 1997 Panja opened the Lahda trade in its thauri fish.
There were two small tables, the customers may have been less than 20.
He taught us not only to eat the tharush, but also to sit next to the vent.
When the hunger and places are limited, you may not leave the place empty between yourself and your visit.
We met a little bit better, and we became friends.
Finally, I was sit in a shock with a word book learning from the Thaiki.
Two years went on the side of the trade management, but then the restaurant was to change because the self-profit powers that have been made were slower in the government.
The end of the trade manager is free of a new place.
There's a place.
Now, we can be seated again in our own table, just in the shortest time we had to ask for the visitors whether there is a place near.
Mother knows his customer.
They're telling him the people where they've been used and who they're seen.
He knows what to eat everybody.
He has seen how the life phases of customers change, and the food security changes.
He remembers what he's called with a man I came to eat my first chemistry.
He remembers me as skin and meat, and remembers what I was young.
It's glad to go to lunch a little more than others, sit on my own place to the door of the kitchen and change the belonging to the kitchen with Panja.
The food is not the most important thing we're getting from him.
He has taught sustainability and internationality a time of cyclicistics.
He's opened our mappings in addition to our thoughts and hearts.
Today, many are talking to him about the tea. Thank you for the expansion of the trip.
I like Panja.
Even though she's been hard, she's always friendly.
He's hard.
He's on the restaurant. He's in the hill and black.
Last week in the restaurant, two decades were celebrated.
We've got our customers as a shirt. We've got a shirt shirt.
Without alarms or attention, this important day went out of work.

The former President of Carlton's football, and Coin De Lutis, a counterparty developer, lives in the Tororak region only in three houses of his young brother Paul. The younger brother has led to a higher right between brothers and sisters to share the counter- and business economicity.
Paul has wanted to leave a family company from 2014, but a distance is being shocked.
Brothers and their mother, Anna, shared 38 shares with more than half billion dollars. The family began to purchase a single property when they bought the Collingwood Smith Street in 1973.
The family found the Westco Jeans trade, which extended 160 movements to rain.
Trade chain sold by $85 million in 1999.
The money was used for funds, and the family is now owned by the activities, the regions in Brunswick and Sorrent, and the households in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as the shopping centres of the former cities.
According to the covenant of the family even with the father, Colin owns about two third parts, and Paul is about a third part of the company. Paul pictures his father as "familiar power and centrality".
According to the documents of law, the share of property means that Colin owns the funds of about $316 million and Paul's value of about $176 million.
Paul isn't satisfied with the share of funds and money.
"I think Colin left the best firms in his proposal," Paul wrote in the first light certificate to the court in 2015.
The meeting was the first time on Thursday after a number of concerting companies.
The brothers now call on whoever controls the existing business, and Paul claims that Colin has closed him from the business.
Colin says that it doesn't like her place, but he accused Paul for some of the funds' malicious treatment.
Colin writes together on his first light testimony that he would like to be addressed in this matter.
"In accordance with our Italian traditions, the family is the most important to me," Colin states in its opinion.
The cost of meetings continues to grow. Favorite statements, emails and reports are hundreds of pages. The meeting is available in detail by Deliveten, Pitcher Partners and Charles Keck Cramer's best and most experienced advisors, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and his even-made husband Luigi were Italian migrants who found milk bars and retail sales at the end of the 1950s. At the beginning of the 1970s they buyed the market from Brunswick.
They were used insurance when purchasing the family from Collingwood, which Colin founded the first business of the family.
Colin tells his based trade "the last years of shipment, when Paul was still a child (only ten years old).
Anna De Lutis tells us that he and Luigi died in 2012 wanted to transfer the funds to their sons.
"Luigi often said that he would not want to end up the right of the brothers," Anna wrote in his statement.
Another two sons, Mark and Luke, are no longer together in the De Lutis Congress. Colin says that Mark had $10 million and 26 million of dollars left the company.
Paul says that Luke and Mark are "equipment of their economic conditions".
Colin had had a low profile, even though it is a member of the government and television of the former Australian football ligature and the best friend of Eddie McGuire, appeared in 2015.
Fairfax Media has contacted Colin and Paul De Lut and their lawyers on Wednesday.
Only Colin answered, and he told in a text message that it couldn't be able to comment on it because it was treated in justice.
“I'm so sad that my brother Paul has decided to deal with me with the right and to bring me into the court,” he wrote.
In the middle of 2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to accept his brother's requirements.
"Now our father wouldn't want to do this," Cole continued and told her hope that we would be able to solve.
On Monday, the hope looked like a shirt.
"We're going to be solved in the right in the next place," wrote Colin.
Trump's new Chief of Personals will be limited to the use of the President's media.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly's finally successful.
First.
According to the Politico Journal, the new Chief of the White House will restrict President Trump's media use and monitoring of news so that the boss would not be so often faced with such difficulties.
The employee Josh Dawsey reported:
"When the new Chief of the White House, John F. Kelly, meetings with a leadership on his first working day, he took a discussion on the key problem he would like to solve: he wants to restrict President Donald Trump's information session.
Kelly reported to the Employers of the White House that all information, as well as those heard in information situations, must be carried out through him, because the President makes better decisions when receiving good information."
Kelly's saying is a reasonable, but others have tried to limit the use of Trump's media and failure.
President Trump has a relationship with the television for decades, and as President, he still looks like much television.
"If the President's scientist Trump was nervous of the unlawful news, he supported that instruments of information were more balanced to do things," the Council of Trump reported to the Political Journal in February.
The Political Provider Tara Palmeri then wrote that "in the management of the use of Trump's Twitter is essential that his personal media virus belongs to the fluctuation of the body."
All right.
But it's funny to say that Trump's use of Twitter would never have been controlled.
Maybe these campaigns know something that we don't know — perhaps the Twitters of Trump without their efforts were still worse.
Maybe we're never gonna get to know what messages from Trump left without sending.
If his staff has even several times been able to prevent him from caused problems, their work has not been angry.
However, nobody has been able to hinder Trumpia’s smell.
The problem is partly due to the fact that we have competitive groups in the White House that try to start with Trump information that supports their views, and that information may be reliable – or then not.
In May, the Politics wrote that the advisers will give the President this information.
The employee Shane Goldmacher told us about a case:
"The current and old workers of the Trumpe say that he can smile on the newspapers where he appreciates - especially if they are told about the harmful periods of information, then he must be able to get to know what information is from.
This happened at the end of February, when a president was urgedly given a copy of the Net Prosecutor Charles C. Johnson's founder of the GotNews.com website, who was accused of the Chief of the Aviation Officer of Katie Walshi for a number of White House's information periods.
Johnson was permanently removed because of Twitter's suffering, and she had previously distributed false accusions and dismissed them later. He also did not submit concrete evidence.
In spite of this, Trump was starting to read about the personality of Walsh."
Goldmacher adds that then the Chief of Personals Reince Priebus and the White House Officer Rob Porter "shoulded to introduce the system of management of the documents lost to Trump."
And what was the result?
Kelly's trying the same three months later.
Maybe he become a more efficient leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive and his helper continues to work on his own matters.
These unchanged realities make Kelly's task very difficult.

It is very important for the collection of evidence that, as many locally possible, the police makes an advertising or criminal action of the police.
It helps form a comprehensive image on the situation towards legal processing."

The major Hammer reported that the number of demandors in the species is growing to the whole time.
The whole paralysis has grown and have developed a lot in recent years.
The differences are small, and there's a lot of new kids together.
I always thought if somebody's going to hold a black horse.
Everybody in the kit feels a different winner.
The large-Hamari lost his other feet in the motorcycle in 2009.
He was sweetly counted with friends until he was young, and an accident did not want to get to the ring.
That's the time I've been thinking of what my life would be without the accident.
But I've always been thinking that it's bad to do it.

The majority of Syrian refugees is not believed to return to their home permanently, unless the war ends and Iss from the land
A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees was identified in Jordan and Lebanon’s views and positions.
The Syrian refugees fleet in the Jordanian flights.
The majority of Syrian adolescents does not believe that they will return to their homes permanently.
They believe that the end of the Syrian war and the exit of the country are the most important matters that should happen so that they may return to their home.
Trump's administration does not see this change in the Syrian conflict.
The Burson-Marsteller's Communication Chamber identified the opinions and positions of young people in international investigation.
Burson Marstel has been investigating the opinions and positions of the Arab species in nine years.
This year, in the Avoice for Young Syrian Refugees, the views and positions of youth slaughterers in Jordan and Lebanon were found in the Avoice for Young Syrian Refugees.
In February 2017, over 400 years old from 18 to 24 years of age, half of the people were women and half men.
The pools were held in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of the young seculars do not believe to return to their home permanently in the future.
42% of the employees may be thought of return to their home and 4% have not been said.
The survey shows that the household of young people’s decisions affects mostly the war in Syria and the presence of Dad in the country.
Nearly half (47%) of the war is the most influenced factor of the permanent home salary, while again fourth thinking that Dad would have to go out of the country.
Only a ten-minute part of the majority is the factors of the decision to improve the economic situation or the exit of Bashar al-Assad from Syria.
Military actions do not solve conflicts
The Syrian youths asked what is the factor for the decision of the conflict.
The majority agrees that the end of the war is more important than President Bashar al-Assad.
The fourth term is that the President of Al-Assad is a stage towards the Peace Agreement.
Nearly half of these experiences are needed to stop the Syrian conflict now, both political and military solutions.
To solve the conflict only through military action, it does not believe just the right fourth.
The majority of the Syrian refugees is seen in the past year when the power of Dad is reassured.
According to the responders, the important battle of the Fathers, and normally against the terrorism is that the media would interfere to people information that Dad has nothing to do with Islamics.
Nearly one of them was a priority for military measures and for educational reform.
In the sense of the tens of reality, it should be important to create better salary for young people.
In response to the impact of the Trump administration in Syrian conflict, 66 per cent of the respondents believe that conflict is not changed during the Trump administration.
Nearly every fourth believes that the Syrian conflict is in the past of Trump.
The men are shared with two regards whether Russia and the participation of Iran have improved or increased conflict.
Monty Widenius shipping half of its codes to keep net in order - its development of your databases are using, for example, Wikipedia and Google
The MariaDB company will develop the database of the open source code of the "width growing world".
Codifier Michael "Monty" Widenise's final product does not pay any users to any users, and it can develop web via any other programs.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are the users of the Finnish database, but paying customers do not necessarily be them.
By the databases, the powerful databases remain in the order and fast available.
If you use Linkedin, Twitter or Booking.com, they use the MariaDB or MySQL database.
"All information that isn't in the image will come from the database, and images are linked there", explains Widenius.
Widenius, who works as the President of MariaDB's Technology, carries some half of its codes.
The man who does the beautiful hands is to be worried about the use of the Internet.
Widenius developed the most recommended world's source source database with the Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, the Sun Technology company purchased MySQL with a million of dollars, and a year later, the programmer of Oracle was shocked by the Sun by 7.4 billion.
When the Oracle trade occurred, a large part of MySQL developers reported their source.
"They didn't want to do work to Oracle, which didn't make sure MySQL's future." Widenius remembers.
He was already established in this stage, a company that began to develop MariaDB.
He didn't want his life work to die.
I paid a couple of best developers from Sun, and I assured that the continuity of the code will be secured by the same friends that were also exalted.
Since MySQL is the source database of the source code, MariaDB has been able to develop it on its own side.
I just had to change my name.
The legislation was established to ensure the freedom to monitor the development of the MariaDB Code.
"MySQL has not done these guarantees," Widenius notes.
Although many have heard about Widenia and MySQL's milliardry, the Finnish knows nothing about MariaDB.
"The last few years our growth has been about 50 percent in the year", says the President of the Employee Director of MariaDB, Kenneth Paqvalen.
MariaDB, who concentrated in growth, does not still win, and Paqvalé is a nine-passe company's signs.
In the same way, he declares that in the consumption period, MariaDB would be evaluated in front of 20 million euros.
Since the database is free, the company has developed its services around which business customers are willing to pay.
MariaDB also helps the changing databases, which may be more than a year, if the customer has been using the closed database.
MySQL changing the MariaDB is possible at the moment because they are versions of each other.
In other cases, the largest Spanish operator Telephonic and Kaakois Asian DBS are MariaDB customers.
The most favorable pillar services, such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Alababan Cloud, provides for their customers MariaDB.
In addition, MariaDB automatically expands new users in the distribution packages of Linux systems where MariaDB has long replaced MySQL.
Although we are a small company, we have contacts with the biggest pieces.
"Asians have larger teleoperators in the world, players, banks and even some of the central banks," the Paqvale list.
Data database markets are still undergoing waste databases such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP.
MySQL is also unrequisite for a page business compared to the traditionally closed database of the company.
Although the largest database companies have lost their market share in the past few years, MariaDB's switchs are still unexpected, although rapidly increased.
About 50 billion dollars on the database market, the databases of the open source code do not even exceed the billion.
However, the weight value of the open source cannot only be measured in money because the majority of the users do not pay any of these programs.
The research company Gartner predicts that in 2018, the companies have already developed more than 70 % of their internal applications to the open databases.
Furthermore, more than half of the old databases would then be changed to open or transition.
Employment companies do not receive new customers because the largest part is selected for the following open source code.
This has resulted in the fact that the license payments of commercial databases have been delayed to the pillars.
The companies want to do so much as previously with smaller customers," Widenius realized.
Since the change of the closed database is difficulty, most of the customers have been able to increase prices.
"I am a lot of customers to which the transition is really difficult because their old applications and others are closed on the database," Widenius says.
He still believes that the measure of customers is in full.
When the license payments are increased each year, the customer shall be transferred to the database of the open source code.
Price is 10-20% more than the previous, and service is better since the customer can easily change to another database.
In addition, many enterprises have large system changes when they move their operations to pillar services.
In addition, many changes the database program.
Lastly, MariaDB received EUR 25 million from the European Investment Bank from the EIB.
It was the largest growth financing ever granted to the Northern countries.
The company has about 115 employees worldwide and is intended to repay now.
One of the reasons for the financing of the EIB was the impact of MariaDB on public loan projects.
The company has customers of the public sector, for example, in Britain and Germany.
The public sector in Europe will pay billions of euros annually from databases.
"Another country wants to transfer the open source code to solutions and use taxes more effectively", says Paqvalen.
The widespread deteriorates how money in Finland is made to the closed health care systems when open systems are more slower and the conditioner is not one of the software company's funds.
Some say that the open source code is ideology, but I think it's the best way to make the code.
The Community helps and does what is not designed or can be done.
Widenius, 55 years old, belongs to another Finnish, Linux developer Linus Torvalds, who are the most known source sources.
Widenius helps other enterprises to develop operational business schemes on the open source code.
I still like 4-5 discussions in the world in various parts of this issue annually.
Italy considers its attitude to the salvation of civil organizations
Italy has warned citizens who saved their ships in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue to do so unless they are able to comply with new rules on their activities.
"If citizens organizations do not have a new action, it is difficult to see how they can continue their work," the Minister of Interior Marco Minniti said in the discussion of the same newspaper La Stampa.
The Minnite Warning came on a day after the Italian authorities slaughtered by the German Jugend Rettet assistant organization, and its men, in doubt, cooperating with human vehicles who had been employed to promote immigration.
Only a year ago the assisting organization refused to comment on the accused Ambrogio Cartosion's detainees.
"We are very regretting that we are not able to operate in the search and salvation area at this time," the organization reported in the social media in its opinion.
"We can evaluate the decisions just when we took all the necessary information and we can evaluate the situation."
The Italian authorities were careful since the beginning of October of the Jugend Rettet Organization.
The man doubtless was taken on a boat by voluntary refugees directly from human vessels who received the re-introduction of them.
One of these cases is claimed to be sold only a few miles away from the libyan beach. The information is clearly available on the document of the accused person whose information instruments are published in Italy.
The man doubts the threatened Italian coast station that controls the savings activities in the region.
According to the conduct of action, ships such as Iuvena must be joined by a Italian police that controls the activity.
Only three of the nine citizens organizations participating in research and salvation activities have been agreed to follow the activities: Save children and the Malta MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
which reported to the new regulations that it was unnecessary but acceptable because it does not cause “important changes or obstacles” of the Organization.
In the groups who refused to comply with the action, Nobel has been paid physicians without border organization.
In addition, the Minister stated that the number of transferers in Italy had been slowly calculated in the last week, as it was noted that the action to strengthen the Libyan Railway Service and to cooperate with local cities leaders would start producing results.
"In recent days the light has come to see in the tunnel," he said.
He realized that the plans are to continue the discussions with Libya's city leaders on projects of economic development and on measures to reduce the number of refugees in Europe.
The murderer suspected his murdered opening in the Enonics, the suspect found on the land... the case to the accused person.
The unimaginable crime happened in the Enonics Cuttas last December.
Police states that his 36-year-old man was suspected of murdering his 26-year-old skotlanian opening copy.
It's been told before that both of them were a shooting workers.
The police's been telling you that the suspect would have run with two dogs in the land after it.
The man was found to be cold from the ground, and he did not react when he took it.
There's a reason to get up in a few weeks.
The meeting is obtained in the Lap Lap's ruling rights for the period of August.
Robert Hardy, known about Harry Potter and all my friends, is dead.
The British observer Robert Hardy is dead for 91 years.
The spectator's death reported to this family as a tour.
In 1925, Hardy was born as a 24-year-old shower in the theatre.
During his long time, he also appeared in films and television.
Hardy is particularly reminded of the role of Major Cornelius Toffee in the Harry Potter pictures and its animal role, based on James Jeriot's book, of all the charming friends of my TV.
The recommended BBC series were described through all seven.
Michelle Carter was sentenced in prison of self-assaulted text messages.
The Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and half a year in prison for text messages and phones that she was seen as her excited boyfriend Conrad Roy's suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, takes 15 months in prison and five years in the case.
Carter was sentenced in June, and his boyfriend Conrad Roy made suicide 13.7.2014.
"My family has been ruined," my father said at the tors' meeting.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter's got a change in the court and was waiting for a complaint processed in freedom.
He threatened 20 years of court, but, according to his lawyers, Carter and Roy suffered from mental health problems.
Carter, who was buried in red shoes and a shirt color puzzle, listened to the courts in the crust in the sight of the shocked land.
"Hither was murdered with Conrad Roy," the accused said to the court.
"He decided to improve Conradie's life.
He didn't take the responsibility of doing it." The accused continued.
"He hasn't shown the ransom."
According to Carter's lawyer, the case was caused by the "excellent circumstances that Carter is deeply deep."
However, judge Lawrence Moniz agreed that Carter did not have an important impact on his work.
The guilt reads Conradi's mother's statement, Lynn Roy, where she told her: "I'm not late for a day, I'm not going to smile my loved son to die.
I want that he may be proud of me, and of how I have survived all of this, and I try to comfort his sister in this pain that we will always be slaughtered."
Conradia's sister Camdy Roy told the court that the thought of her "free" is that he will never see his brother's wedding and not be a daughter of his children.
"I lose a person who has been in my life every day since I was born, it's never heavy," Camdy said.
It seems to be a future case, since there is no law in the Massachusetts State, which indicates that self-assault would be a crime.
Carter was 17-year-old when Roy was found from the car to deteriorate death in 2014.
The meeting shouted the Kingdom attention when it appeared that Carter was in the text message encouraging his boyfriend to make self - murder.
“I don't know, how much it is, ” wrote Carter in many messages she sent to Roy two weeks before this death.
Just a few days before Roy's self-smooth Carter wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to start the generator, and you're free and happy."
The judge Moniz said that Carter was taking care of Roy's death, and the judge said that he wasn't able to benefit from the case by giving discussions.
The meeting has shared the opinions of experts.
It's just a rare defense of Carter. One of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30 who was sentenced to the murder of their British room partners in Italy in 2007, and he was released two years later.
Los Angeles Times published the Knox's description in which he states: "Miche Carter needs a delay and help, not a prisoner."
President of Naton: You interrupted Russia's worst war on the worst
The military alliance between Nato and Russia has been clearly degraded, commented by the Director-General of Naton at the tour of the Nato.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and his position in the Ukrainian conflict.
I think that Naton's relationship to Russia is now more difficult than ever after the end of the war, Stoltenberg said in the discussion of the CNN.
After the end of the war, we hoped that we could work closely with Russia.
However, the continuing insecurity of Naton relationship with Russia, particularly after the unlawfulness of Crime in 2014 and Russia, has been significantly deteriorated.
Nevertheless, Stoltenberg says that Nato is still bound to act so that the shocks will not be scratched in their head.
So long as we are strong and so long as we can predict, we can visit Russia's political dialogue in order to prevent the situation of traffic and the new cold war.
Before the comments of Stoltenberg, President Donald Trump, the U.S. President of the United States had even been able to show a dangerous weakness between the United States and Russians.
Trump invited the country to thank the bad congress that adopted the new Russian packages last week.
Audi makes changes because of the experience of car manufacturers in the 850 000 diesel engine

The Daimler reported the changes in its work in more than three million Mercede's motors to reduce diesel emissions.
No company talked about the return.
European car manufacturers have significantly marketed the use of cell vehicles in Europe and in the United States to achieve the goals of carbon dioxide emissions.
The thermomotor emissions are considered to be cancer and asthma caused.
The costs of installation of emissions neutralizing devices are increased, where the cars are difficult to cost competitively.
The German car manufacturers strictly carefully, and the partnership officer Angela Merkel has been accused of the posts and problems of large car companies.
The companies try to avoid the errors of the Volkswagen. Volkswagen installed cars of distortions that reduced emissions in the testing rules. In general, the emissions were larger.
several of the leaders of Volkswagen have been assaulted in the United States, but the leaders are investigated both sides of Atlanta.
In the past month, the former director of the Aud Motor Traffic Office was arrested in Germany.
Zacheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian, so it can be resigned to the United States for a possible court.
The authorities suspected that Audi had installed their cars in a system that could be able to swallow European emissions requirements, and that the cause was based on the appropriate investigation in the United States.
The Aud investigation can significantly decrease the position of the Volkswagen: the percentage of the manufacturer of shipping car winners is relatively large.
From the vote of Venezuela, it started a villing study, the fathers' opinions in the promulgation
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities is at least a million than the real voters.
This is an unfair opinion from the company who has no role in the results, President Tibisay Lucenan said to the donors.
Maduro guarantees the end of the crisis
Venezuela has been elected on Sunday by a sworn vote representative intended to change the Constitution of the country.
The opposition has criticized the vote strongly and organized the opinions against the change.
The opposition that is opposed to Maduro has cut off its own feelings so that they would be launched at the time of appointment.
According to the El Paz magazine, the national security teams began in the mid-week of the local time to take their desire to the parliamentation of the country.
The chicks are intended to ensure the security of appointment.
Air change threatens Provence Lavender
The Lavenant list has come to the symbol of the South-Lanska Provence region, but now it threatens climate change.
Lavenal has been reduced because of the inhibitry and the diseases, and researchers and farmers are trying to find out their problem.
"Lavenl is directly in the Provence region, since it has suffered the impact of the climate change over the past years, and in particular the numbers of sugars have been clearly reduced," says Eric Chaisse, expert of the CRIEPAM Institute of Agricultural Studies, who is located in Provence.
"This slows the lavender's lifetime.
Furthermore, the slightness has produced a lot of small cuttings in the region that spread microbacteria."
The taxes are hard.
Lavenal oil is shocking to tourists, and it is also very desired in the skin and cosmetic substance.
"Instead of smaller stars and largest flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are weakly developed or slowly or missed," Chaise says.
"In other words, the parts contained in Southern Oil are less less than."
The solution is made by enhancing the skin, cutting the density of the earth and smelling the vegetables by protecting the grain and water, and in addition, the swimming species of older sustainability are developed.
The killer's murder appears to growing threats in Mexico
Once a week, the report of Riodoce is generally gathered in a medium-week to discuss how the newspaper addresses the most important cases relating to organized crime, corrupted authorities and the endless drug war in the Singapore State.
Today, however, it is discussed on security because of the recent tragedy.
The employees have been encouraged to change their daily rutines.
Two test providers are discussing who is more safe: leave children home or take them into the provision that was done in 2009.
The security reporters have written three words: opposers, neutralists, alliances.
They are requested by the suppliers to each group. Proofs are not necessary, notices and knowledge are sufficient.
The tables are written on the names of drugs, politicians, entrepreneurs and suppliers who are suspected of the payment list of governments or drug cards.
The Poverty is unfair, and the more often the attacks are suppliers. According to the Protection Committee, at least 25 providers have been murdered after President Enrique Peña Nieto was held in December 2012. In the protection of the Member State, 589 attacks and threats, at least seven employees in the seven countries were killed.
The latest victim is Javier Valdez Cardenas, the founder, the supplier and the source of innovation.
"The big error is to live in Mexico and to be a provider," Valdez wrote together with many of its drug violence writings.
The publicity of the Riodez building spends on a magnificent picture in which Valdez looks at the medium. The image reads: "Just". The three types of suppliers Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez have been shocked on T-shirts that correct Valdez's faces. Valdez has sweet eye sights and good characters.
The assembly is considered at least two months after Valdez’s death, and the employees discuss their common trauma, pain, unsoundlessness, and persecution.
In 2010, the advocate office of the Union was established for the treatment of cases of suppliers, but, according to the Protection Committee, only two sentences have been raised.
The murders of the employees are only rarely subject to the right, as well as thousands of drug trafficking and organized crimes, only rarely ends to be treated.
The Riodox providers will continue to write violences in Sinala, although they are devastating and the situation is most dangerous.
Ibarra says that there is only a little benefit from the security meeting, because the killers are not in knowledge and there is no hope of justice.
"This meeting is said directly with a time-wheel," he says.
"We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know why it happened."
Valdez was removed from Riodoce, the capital of the state in Culiacan, morning 15.5.2017.
She was ageing in the red Toyotal only a couple of cards on the way when two men stopped him and packed out of the car and shot twelve shocks.
Ambassadors drive out of Valdez's car and shoot it on some way.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was left to smell his wife and two adult children.
The smells move rapidly and bond freely in the Kalifornican.
But Valdez's death is a shock.
Sinalo has been more bloody fighter in Mexico since Guzman was arrested last year and was disfellowshipped in the United States in January.
On the streets of the synagogue, some or several people die every day, and there are shooting double shooting shocks that are larger than many households.
In the Raniko State, only one card dominates hundreds and drug traffic routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was very well-known about the dangers of his work, Riodoce founder and leader, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez feels guilty that he couldn't protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes leaded to the murder of Valdez.
In February, Riodoce published Damaso Lopez's discussion, and leads to a competitive group that goes to war against Guzman's sons.
It could have been shocked by Guzman’s sons: as a gymnastic guest members of the newspapers have purchased each number immediately when the newspaper came to the sell points.
Another error was that Valdezia was not forced to go out of the country after the second publications of the same thing were being the subject of the attack.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and in the foreign countries, and his murder is considered a traductor of violence against employees.
She had learned so many of his friends and colleagues have no longer shared fear for him.
He was done a long round in Noroest when he decided to set up five colleagues with Riodoce in 2003. The quotes of the newspaper were sold at $50 at that time.
In Sinalogue, "I was impossible to make journalism without drug problems", says Bojorquez.
In the meantime, the newspaper began to feel courageous and honest.
The employees appreciated the possibility of publicly investigating journalisms without fear of sensual sensation, and readers strive in the newspapers about which nobody else was shocking about the publications.
After eight years of its creation, Riodoce wind her appreciation for the news of Mary Moors Cabot in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez was able to observe the history of the Mexican drug trade of the Protection Committee of International Public Freedom.
He was able to accept his fears openly.
"I want to continue my life," he said when he obtained the payment of the Protection Committee of Providers.
Drug trade is in Sinalo "life mode", Valdez said Rompevento TV's debate last October.
"The employee must take the task to be slaughtered against him, or appears to be stupid.
I don't want anyone to ask me where I was when the death was dwelled here, why didn't I tell you what was going on?"
Reodox’s staff is going to take Valdezia — a smile who slaughtered as a hundred workers. They think of a friend who has always received sweet and advice.
They trusted in his rutines.
He's always used when he's a panzer.
She went to the mission in the El Guayabo bar, and she was always on the same table.
Now they're wondering if the rutins were cut on his face.
The death of a colleague has also been able to consider how they can do better and remain spiritually.
"In case we treat their women and children and their clean business, their secret thanks to their drug trafficking.
They were left outside the shops," says Bojorquez.
In the best case, it would mean strong self-defence and self-protection,
I'm trusting in my own bonds.
If it feels that everything isn't in the face, you'll have to stay out.
The problem is, according to Andres Villareal, the issue is that "the effects can be struck, and so happened in Javier's case."
Old rules are no longer low in Sinalo, nor they are in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerre and other States with dangerous networks: shuttle secret transport systems, weak offices and corrupted authorities.
The environment of action continues to change.
A few days ago, the telephone body was not able to import in a room where Riodoz’s security education was held.
On the outside of the structure, two cops were forced to protect the tree from 40 degrees.
The Government of the State was intended to ensure the offices of Rhodox, situated in the Mediterranean building in the Kalifornican region.
Some providers reasoned whether these two police were only 50 percent of the team that the Governor of State did not have to be trusted.
There have been months later when the suppliers had been using drugs by dominating the mountain rural.
This week number of Riodoce's delivery was three-thirds after the end.
Narcotics Summer Julio Cesar Chavez's brother was killed in Sinalo.
The newspaper also intended to find out that the use of the government’s money was focused on the city of the headquarters.
In addition, together with the most important restaurants in Queliacan, only the accused persons were disappointed.
There was no official information on whom was defeated and how, so it was to be careful: all in the city knew that the restaurant was both for drugs and authorities for the recommendation of drugs.
The employee has found public documents that the restaurant was registered by the name of the policy of the institutional revolution Party (PR) which has been registered in Mexico at nearly one century.
In cases of publicity, it is quite denied by corruption.
Villareal requested the provider to write the best cases on the same place. Some of them "El Chapo" Guzman was able to run and avoid military racist.
Several months ago, readers would have known to have received a reliable information from the Valdez column.
"With before we knew what happened," says the 46-year-old Villareal, who has been able to handle her body structure, "El Flaco, Oakkin.
"These are all our sources of information. It's a bit."
Valdez’s work room has been changed to a store in which it is maintained injuries to the persecutors. Workers of the newspaper have received a new, unexpected task: they have been temporary activists on free news.
In the following morning, after a few villages, Ombudsman Miriam Ramirez took his meeting to the representative of the local defence office, which was reasonable for the murder of the new provider.
Salvador Adame died in the Western state of Michoacan three days after the murder of Valdez.
After the disappearing, a fuel body found based on the DNA tests of the authorities is Adame.
The employees have started protesting more and more in the whole country, and the texts "SOS Press" appear in the Mediterranean addresses.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington where he tries to obtain international support for the investigation of Valdez.
On the day of Valdez's murder, Ramirez met the Ombudsman of Sinalva and accused the authorities of stability and killing because they tell the truth.
He therefore has asked him to be transferred from the government of treating matters because he is concerned that it is not able to be objective.
Valdez had repeatedly demonstrated that the suppliers in Mexico have increased organized crime, the criminality allows the authorities and the interim society.
In his last book, the Drug Journalism Valdez writes that drugs are killing suppliers, but they are also killed by the order of political and security teams in the joint understanding of the criminality.
According to Article 19, over half of the attacks faced by the employees last year were the period of the police and the authorities.
"Where people are silenced by killing", Ramirez says.
Murh has an impact on it.
Nobody forgot the blogger Mary Elizabeth Macias to die in the northern Tamaulipan border six years ago.
His body had a message signed by Zetas-Katel: "I'm because of my writings."
He left his head next to his computer's keyboards and hearings.
Some newspapers have decided to stop their activities, such as the same El Nord newspaper in the northern Chihuahua border country of Miroslava Breach after the murder of the Morde.
Some of them continues to work, such as Nuevo Laredon El Manana, although his leader was killed in 2004.
In 2010 Diario de Ciudad Juarez published a message to the urinary article: "What do you want from us?"
Some providers have flew from their States or from the whole country.
The decision is difficult.
There's hard to find work on the ground, and the whole time you need to be safe.
Sometimes criminals are looking for the supplier's hands, such as apparently the photographer Ruben Espinos, who was murdered with four women in a residence in Mexico City in 2015 three months after her flying from Veracruz.
To those who continue to work every day are full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra — whose time had to be a strike — admits that the writing of drugs is scared.
"I'm a translator because Mexico's on the way to hell," he says.
Some time ago, Riodoce suppliers sat on Monday afternoon in front of the delivery at a footnote when the new number had been prepared.
In the shock of the Mazatlan slaughter between the Commonwealth and Safety Forces, 19 people died.
The war was frozen, as promised in the cartel messages found from the region.
The employees set up the news on the Riodoce Network on their smart cells.
The visit should be renewed on the next day.
The Syrians slopeed nearby... a new shooting attack.
Bojorquez shocked the guard police:
If they were scared, they were shocked it very well.
The Riodoce delivered the murderer of the magazine under this massive picture where a man appears to the whole Sinalo.
Bojorquez says that you can't even consider the end of the operation. "How can I stop the magazine when our practitioner asked to go to the street to do things still on the same day when Javier was killed?"
Hannu Man's Olympic Project started on the back of the powerful shooting.
In December 39, Hannu Mann’s celebrations were short, because the professionals began preparing for the Olympic period.

In the test, the sportor switchs with switchs with a switch that is growing speed for three minutes.
Each three-minute period is stopped for about ten seconds, and the tester takes the thickness of the sportor with the milk test.

Dinosaurus protected its enemy by the appointment
First, it looks like a horrible country.
Now, researchers have revealed the first research results of a canadian cowboys body that had so much maintained that experts call it a dinosaur of Mona Lises.
It was so well that the researchers could even determine that their finish skin was a red skin, and that was “equitable past.”
According to the Current Biology Journal, it is the most preserved dinosaur and the best representatives of their species in the world for all times.
The fossil found slowly is nodosaurus, which is 110-112 million years ago.
The researchers believe that this amazingly preserving fossil is really important to find out.
According to the National Geographic Journal, panoramic plants have typically remained fossil in the best times of all times.
It was found from the Suncor Millennium Head of the Northern Canada on 21.3.2011, and the founder was the name of Shawn Funk.
He was part of something that felt not a natural part of the surrounding ball, and decided to investigate his finding more accurately.
The fosil found from the callium was sent to the reign paleonological museum of Tyrrell.
There was a heavy crowd of 1100 kilos of the grain for six years.
A lot of job results are now visible.
"If you stop the eye, you may almost believe it was sleeping," says the scientist Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the king Museum of Tyrrell.
"The science remains in the history of Mona Lisana, one of the most beautiful and the best dinosaurs maintained.
In recent studies, the body eating dinosaur was likely an important threat to this grower, even though it was a panzer and remembered a walking panzer.
The red white panzer swallowed it from its lists, and also protected it from the head with a slighter and higher color, which continues to appear in many animals.
According to experts, it has been better able to defeat its environment and to defeat the enemy and larger dinosaurs.
110 million years old Nodosaurus increased in the titles in May, and it is now shown in the king paleontology museum of Tyrell.
The researchers gave the name to the Mark Mitchell Museum of Borealtop, according to Mark Mitchell. Mitchell belonged to the team who took over 70,000 hours to the dinosaurus.
Nodosaurus has remained so surprising that the teams of Mitchell and international researchers have been able to determine the pictures and forms of the body of the fingers and panzer.
They found that you still protect it in the animal world with a general coloring with a body more tighter and higher.
Nevertheless, it was surprising because Borealop has significantly greater than the current animals with corresponding coloring.
It can conclude that the meat eating dinosaurs obtained in the sense that evolution recommends being hidden instead of fighting.
Today’s animals, such as males, cepros, and armidiles, have the same color, which are significantly smaller and therefore more easyly, which indicates that nodosaurus was seriously threatened.
"Wow, strongly, the injury of pansaroid dinosaur tells how dangerous dinosaurs were the dinosaurs of association," brewn says.
The chemical analysis of the organic combinations of the nodosea protein shows that the skin was red.
Scientists continue to investigate nodosea, to make the conclusions of their life, and, otherwise, study the content of it to find out what it eats with their last food.
The researchers believe that when they died, it was thinking of the sea where it put it on the base of the sea.
At that time, Albert had the same warm as today in Florida, and the waters and the seas probably were much slower than now.
"This nodosur is really important because its finish key has been kept and has also remained in its third-party form," brewn says.
"Why it seems almost as in the early convergence period
It doesn't require a lot of thinking: if you break a little eyes, you can almost believe that it was sleeping."
Your association was the time of the dinosaurs of the earthquakes, the powerful two-offs, the time of the dinosaurs.
Though their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, or millions of years ago, Borealope, his magnificent futures have been able to list the list of this panoramated dinosaur.
Thus, for example, Acrocanthosaurus, about 11,5 meters of long six tons of monsters, was the front of the Tyransaurus rex.
The newest findings of Nodosaur’s researchers have been published in the Current Biology magazine, and they believe that Borealop has been cut off after the death of the sea and has changed otherwise.
It was found from the Suncor Millennium Head of the Northern Canada on 21.3.2011, and the founder was the name of Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it has remained the most panoramated dinosaurus in the world of skin and pantherine to the end.
The nodose was averagely five meters long and weighed even 1 300 kg.
The ships were two and a half meters of pigs.
The researchers believe that this panoramated plants passed through the current Western Canada until the one came to the open sea.
The panzer has remained small details later in the sea dark.
The fossilised remains have remained so well that the key is still remaining in the shooting disks of the push.
Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic magazine that this maintenance is "that rare as loneliness.
Whatever it looks more accurate, it feels more incredible.
There are still focalized skins in the mortal disks of the skin.
The right front is in the village, five upwards.
I can also calculate the filter of the foot base."
How did one activeist learn to answer the question: Who are the streets?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply angry 9.8.2014.
She had arrived a day ago in New York, home from St. Louis and sit in his airbnb bed in his telephone.
Then he noticed the message on the box:
"You've killed a 18-year-old young man, and his body's still on the street."
When he was awesome, she noted that nobody else had posted the same information to his feet. That's why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
At his time there were numerous re-views from the user @TheePharoah.
The user name is St. Louis's resident, who tweeted the reality of Michael Brown's death, and a white police was shot in the 18-year-old black Brown Ferguson State in Missour.
This user was also posted a picture from Brown’s living body on the street where it was left for four hours.
"This is unbelievable," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
When he returned to Twitter the same evening, there were people who were collecting Canfield Drive.
Users posted pictures of the police's closure and smiling people, as well as Brown's self-declared man in the villages: "The police of Ferguson killed my unarmed son!"
Ferrell follows a real-time video film in which the police standed in front of the sighter with the dog.
She also tells her a video where the other police shocked his shock and shouted, "I'll take you all... animals."
"This isn't normal," Ferrell remembers the facts.
"It wasn't the murder we've already done and could be typical.
Then I felt cold colors.
I was angry and crying."
He stood the return home for the next day.
The machine was counting at one night, and Ferrell was looking for his six-year-old daughter to trust his father and decided that they would go to Ferguson next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in nearly three years later, documentation has been done "Whose Streets?". It received his first night in film tests 11.8.2017.
The movie is a story of survival and mind, love and loss, and the strength and slightness of local people who went to the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell went to the wood of Ferguson and with her co-university slaughter with her daughter, they came to the again discussion about "We have lived in black and where we were". They talked about unreadless accounts before that morning.
"Remember, when I told you how black people have been struggled for the things they believe?" Ferrell remembers her daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy, and it's not true."
"I couldn't be with my daughter," Ferrell later said.
"The events of this day are... the greatness of the past events.
My daughter has the right to know it and to grow up.
He has to be prepared to active and organise, but he must also know the different figures and circumstances of the black life experience. And he must know what we need to do to free, to free our own.
Even though I was happy to protect her from a weird race, she is still the same as other black girls.
I feel that I would hurt him if I protect him from the reality."
They were their first stops in Ferguson, South Florant Road, which was a police officer, and they became an activist office when they were waiting for information about the case and finally learned that the police would not be blameful.
From there, Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local trial that made lunch packages.
They flew dinners to the puzzles and shared them to the puzzles.
Ferrell began at least a new way to be treated with activeism.
"My act changed completely after August 9,," she says. When he studied at the University of Missouri in St. Louis Ferrell was the President of the United States of Hospital Schools in the Middle East, and then he focused on food laws and health securities in black communities.
"I didn't have any experience on organizing.
There's only one thing that happened."
A few weeks later, Ferrell met the advisory address to Sabaah Folayan, a assistant of the document.
Folayan said he and the writer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar were "sharing to tell" what was happening.
Ferrelli's thinking was a little suspect, and he asked, "Do you really want to tell what's going on, or you want the story you can use for good?"
Inconsistently, the unreadless times were when the local community had appeared to people, mostly white people who wanted only to benefit from their difficulties and skinness.
"We heard that there was no common voice in the birth in Ferguson," Foussan said, "we wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already been connected to Damon Davis, who was known to be active in the couples of deadly injured prisons.
In addition to Davids, Ferrelli went to his project together with six other locals, and the description group followed the attack of Brown in the following years.
"This is not a document where someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we're talking," says Davis.
"I was most important to how local people are presented in the film because I was presented in the same way."
Folayan said that it was not focused on the experiences of Ferrelli, because it was wanted to show that in the people's movement "no matters of the charsmatic leader but of the community." Ferrell, however, became more open.
Thus, the documents are seeing a surprise private part of Ferrell’s life, such as love and marriage.
"I knew myself time to be slow," Ferrell smile when she told him how to see the movie first time.
"But I understood this work and the human description of blacks require a certain deterioration."
Moreover, the story of Ferrelli and re-engage in the middle of the Black Lives Matter's most largest role in the Black Lives Matter.
Once the police shot a black son, Trayvo Martin, was born in social media (#BlackLivesMatter) in 2012, and two of the three founders of the application were the same as the Queer identity.
"That often the leadership of Queer's women had the whole movement on the top," says Ferrell. "It's due to we're going to be fighting on many sides.
You're a slim Queer kids have been able to keep everything."
Folayan has the same opinion: "As it really surprising black women who have a lot of Queer-Needs."
However, he stressed that Ferrelli was not chosen in a document because of its Queer identifier.
"He's got the energy movement," Folayan says.
"But it isn't a shock that he was in the front, but the sweethearts live many things in the operation, and they have a lot in the game.
His energy is interrupted through the white cake."
The new description groups have left Ferguson for a long time, but the between the Community and the police are still crying.
Ferrell has more than two and half years of rest of the United States, and he was sentenced to support motors in the press.
His description of his home tours of social policy is short and slow, "Search up".
However, he continues to trust in a shock that he learned outside Ferguson's streets three years ago:
"Now our responsibility is to fight our freedom.
Our responsibility is to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We can lose our coffee only."
Successful uniformity: Artist created pictures of the DNA of Chelsea Manning
In New York, the Fridman gallery has been removed in the midst of the faces — white, black and rustic faces, which can be viewed more closely.
These 30 works are designed by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, based on the DNA images of Chelsea Manning and hair.
Manning sent samples from the Fort Leavenworth prison in which he executed his 35 years of sentence. Manning was condemned to be secretized for the WikiLeaks page.
Dewey-Hagborg was opened 2.8.2017.
It has two years of letter change between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines the work of technology, computer technology and art. Manning is transnatal and busy audience with the prison officer Barack Obama on the last third day.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzed the DNA of Manning and made 30 pictures based on its genetics. They are awesome, even if a little theoretical stimulation of the adjustability of DNA data, multiculturality and reasonal relations with the background of the tube and identity.
Chelsea Manning, born Bradley Edward, has openly reported to a woman that has already been murdered until 2013.
The sentence of Manning in prison was only one picture: a swimming, black, white swimming self, in which a swimming maning sits on the car driver's place.
The Dewey-Hagborg had a large recommendation in 2015 from the Stranger Visions project which he carried out in 2012.
He made pictures on the basis of criminal information, and he received DNA information, for example, from tuberculosis and smoke, and made pictures of what people were concerned could have shown.
Then the artist got e-mail from the Magazine magazine.
"They discussed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of the story," Dewey-Hagborg told the new show in information.
Manning's home wasn't allowed to visit, and he couldn't picture him in the prison, so the newspaper took contact with Chelsea and asked if he was interested in making a manning DNA picture.
The artist and his prison, on the other hand, became surprised by letter-free friends, and they wrote to each other for a couple of years.
They even did a Superpressed Images manuscript, which was imagined by Shoili Kanungo, which was described in the future where the President would have put the trial of Chelsea, and he would be able to look at the exhibition.
In fact, Obama shorted the sentence of Manning only a few days after a series of books, which was happy after seven years in the military prisoner.
It is also effective that the display will be opened right now when Donald Trump goes on his own war against informal years and transactional soldiers and finds new ways on Twitter to confirm the powerful two periods that he wanted to spend in this matter.
Dewey-Hagborg believes "the thing has its purpose."
At the wall of Galleria, the opinion of an artist and the great name of Manning, which is the heart of the family name I. In his opinion the artist requires the end of the "automatic division which has been based on sex, race, sexuality and culture".
At the lowest wall, the DNA period of Manning has been written on the long C, G and A books.
This 200 letters — or nucleotics, such as the scientific definition used by the artist — is part of the combination of Dewey-Hagborg wants to consider how similar we all are, at least from our biological.
"I hope my exhibition helping people to understand that we are the same values as we are, and that the genetics are very personal and open to the balls," Dewey-Hagborg says. The show also shows their Spurious Memories video from 2007.
"DNA's telling about unreadable stories, there's 30 before them."
The last work of the exhibition is in its own room: from the series of pages of Manning and Dewey-Hagborg.
There's Maning's smell of the prison like King Kong, with the hand of the megaphone.
"If they get you silent, they're winned," reads.
"Don't worry."
"The text is of the letter I received from Manning," the artist from Philadelphia tells.
"It's so affective that I still get cold colors."
Instead of being described in the series, Manning has not yet seen the display. When Manning comes to the place, he welcomed his own geometrics faces as well as a number of mental publishers in the midst of the display.
It is worthy, as all other in this display: for example, the DNA period of Manning is written in a slow height that is equal to its length (157.5 cm).
"The pools were before on the wall, but I wanted to bring them to the people's people feel." says Dewey-Hagborg.
"I wanted to describe the right of Chelsea's birth, which was also behind his release."

"We will take action in the next way of the decision in accordance with the WADA map" – the Prime Minister of Russia, Vitaly,
The Russian Deputy Minister Vitaly has not said that Russia immediately takes decisions under the WADA World Antidoping Office, which can be made back to the RUSDA's functionality of the Russian antidoping Agency.
"Another card has already been implemented, and RUSADA has been entitled to plan and test in cooperation with the UKAD of the British Anti-Downation Association.
The WDA card has been updated from these parts," said not as a tour.
The Deputy Minister has commented on the other part of the WADA card, which defines the conditions for the recovery of RUSDA's powers. The second part of the card was recently published on the website of the organization.
I don't think it's in no concern for Russia.
Everything has been reported, and it will be done.
The results are presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA for the next."
However, one of the guidelines requires that the Russian anti-doping authorities accept the results of the Canadian judge Richard McLaren's investigation. McLaren investigated the State's share in the doping of Russian sport.
But not said: "The importance is run because our antidoping system has granted a failure.
All measures have been implemented.
The national programs weren't, and we can't admit what wasn't existing."
In many words, Vitaly Smirnov, President of the Russian self-double public anti-double action, was the opinion.
On the same day, Smirnov agreed that the Russian antidoping body had problems. "We have said a number of reports that the report has an encouraging encouragement and rules.
We don't want to accept the report, but he adds.
WADA decided to stop the Doping Control in Russia in November 2015 when the dimension of the doping candale was discovered.
However, in June, it was authorised to plan and coordinate the test in the monitoring of international experts and UKAD.
In July, Olympic Chairman Olivier Nigli visited the headquarter of RUSADA in Moscow, where he said that the organization was "weight on the right way" to return officials.
British Organization skeptic on the lovely innovation of Finnish: "No proof"
The British Organization suspects the benefits of the Finnish mother packs.
In other words, BBC and Guardian reports that the Lullaby Trust organization, in the fight against handsome deaths, prohibits the use of his own mother-friendly in Britain.
The share of maternal packs to all pregnant women is started in Scotland this month.
The packaging is also shared in some regions in England.
According to Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that the maternal pack would reduce the risk of death.
The death of the skin means the unexpected death of the baby.
Lullaby Trust works as a expert of the British Health Authorities in the child's safe sleep room.
We no longer let our official presentations to them, since it would understand that we recommend this product, the organization has informed.
Finnish has one of the lowest children’s mortality in the world, only two thousand dead births.
According to Lullaby Trust, the Finnish good reading is the result of many different reasons, as well as the number of small teenergic diseases.
The present box for each family may be one of the factors.
However, it can't be sure that, Mr Lullaby Trust, the Chairman of the Francine Bates said.
We are concerned that maternal packs are marketed as products that reduce children's mortality and handsome deaths.
The maternity package is a Finnish discovery, and it has been provided freely to all mothers for 80 years in Finland.
The packaging contains various requirements, such as children's clothes.
This year, there's 53 products in the pack.
In fact, the packaging is a bad box where the child can be put to bed.
According to the Scotland government, its shared boxes are satisfied with all security standards.
Lullaby Trust said that there is no safety standard for bad bedrooms.
According to Lullaby Trust, the package may be the best option for sleep map time if you are not available with swimming or thickness.
The system recommends to use the pack only for day and stop the use of it at the stage when the child is able to turn.
The system also recommends to keep animals from the pack and to care that it may not be baptized or healed.
The smells of the japanic animal garden shocked again.
The Japanese animals' staff is looking for the darkness of the competitor.
The chairmanship has surprised the speed of the staff and has already been depressed in two weeks.
As a competitive, Shibuawa, located in the west of Japan, was shocked afternoon.
The safe cameras found that the snake was removed from the animal garden through the start.
It doesn't die immediately because it eats food around the animal garden, but we are very concerned, Yoshimi Yamane, who worked in the animal garden.
Carannut 35-year-old canna is a swimming, 55-kill and about a metro.
Yamane describes the carcase as quiet and sweet.
In opening time, the shoes can be freely walked in the area.
The animal garden has not been obtained from the skill.
The past shooting shooting was lost in the other week.
Yamane found a swimming road over 150 meters from the animal garden.
I noticed it on the way to the animal garden.
I stopped my car, and I asked my colleagues to help, I told Yamane.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These starts help your company to avoid Uber's errors
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of the employees in the startup company, but the questionnaires did not work.
Responses were often inadequate, inutilable or even false drivers.
Although he convinced that the question is unnamed, the part of the employees was unconscious of them.
"The results were not simply coherent and non-objective," Errett says. As Madison Reed's hair management company focuses on the network trade. The company has 75 employees.
Errett decided to take care of the external help.
The market has continued to be more new startup companies in the staff management, which helps other enterprises to see how they can workers.
They are developing and authorised by programs which can measure the commitment of employees, which can ask and address them to certain teams and groups, and provide unnome reporting services to the employees and, in some cases, to the more directly connected government.
"One health can be monitored by the applications such as Stravan and Fitbit, but where is Fitbit of the companies?" asks the founder of the Glint Startup in Redwood City and director Jim Barnett. Glint offers analytical programmes to measure the commitment of employees.
Errett has been using the Glinti program for three years, and he tells us about the thoughts and knowledge of his employees.
The program can make rapid questions and votes to certain teams, and it can also be a card that is seeing in one view where the employees are more satisfied and whose leaders have received the weakest ones.
Enterprises have understood that they must be monitored by the work culture so that they should not be next to Uberia.
Such disadvantages, such as a glint, are a detrimental ability to operate.
Administration, regulation and compliance of enterprises are a worldwide operation which can be the value of Let's Talk Payments website to increase more than 118.7 billion to 2020.
Convercent, located in the Colorado State in Denver, is the startup that helps companies to observe and prevent unnecessary use. Awareness towards the company has grown in this year when Uber is called a test.
Convercents have about 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It also made a covenant with Uber.
At the same time, Convercent gives companies the possibility to make detailed questions, to collect answers with confidence in reality, and to card the issues areas.
Furthermore, the employees may notify the non-exported use of the text message.
And if the leader has a cause for doubts, the complaints will go directly to the government of the company.
"A general opinion has been excluded by the authorities," says Convercent's founder and director Patrick Quinlan.
He recalls that if the company treats its employees badly or unfairly, the consequences may be calmed, although the authorities are not missing. The consumers may begin to break the company, and it may also lose the employees and become a challenge in the right.
Ruby Tuesday has more than 250,000 employees in 500 operations. The company has been using Convercent over a year, as it wants to ensure that the employees are aware of the principles and procedures and are easily connected to the main center.
It was previously noted that if the employer wanted to report the problem, he had to first figure out the phone number or email address that could be made to the headquarters of the notification, and then he had to make an official election and hope that it is taken seriously.
"It was often a terrible and unpleasant experience," says Ruby Tuesday's Legislative Director James Vitrano. He said that the complaints of employees were difficult to follow.
Previously, problems remained hidden in the other city or in the state of workers, and the problems such as discrimination, distress and unjust payments can be identified and handled more quickly.
"I am more comprehensive and more delicate about the reality of the employee," says Vitrano, who leads to the Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"We protect the courts relating to the working relations of our shareholders."
According to the Queenland, the companies began to address their ethical, values and employees' engagement more seriously after the accounting company Arthur Andersen was the consequence of the unfair operation in connection with the Enron-scandale.
As far as social media, enterprises understood that they couldn't be able to prevent their likapics of public finding.
"The hope was used as a strategic before the technology came to the control of the ethicals," says Quinlan.
Glint and Convercent provides its software as a service that is regularly speeded.
It is a business model and possibility accepted by capital operators, and Glint and Convercents are supported by capital shareholders.
Convercent collected $10 million in February from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital. It has collected the capital total of $47 million.
Glint received 10 million euros from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and has collected $60 million.
Investments are not surprised when taking into account the contacts between business, business culture and risk capital.
In many studies, employees expected more their jobs.
Good payments in the markets such as the hidden range, and interesting projects are just starting.
The employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they give their time to a useful company.
"If they join the company and feel that they are listening and that their work is rewarded, the employees will be more successful towards the success of the company, and that they know that they are listening and that their jobs are payable," says Nina McQueen, director of the linkedIn Company.
Investors will be produced when enterprises have succeeded and enterprises will be successful when the employees are connected.
The third part's analytical instruments are allowed to strengthen the commitment of employees, so it is not wonderful that they are interested in investors.
According to the experts of the job culture, information on the linking of employees is important;
But it is not useful if it does not take steps.
If the company requests its employee to return, it may be a sign of change.
And if the change is not sufficiently fast or nothing changes, the deterioration may reduce the commitment of employees.
"If you ask for four thousand proposals, you must be ready to visit four thousand discussions", says the Consultant Kotter International Director Russell Raath, director of the Employee, who has seen a lot of confidence for the collection of information.
"If the company does not take steps, the employees start to think whether they were heard
And if they're thinking about anything they're interesting.
If the company does not care for them, why should they take care of the company?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed is currently making staff issues for months and is able to address the problem as reported in Glint.
When Errett was assembled back to decision-making from disadvantaged employees of quality and communication, he was able to make changes to the teams and to organize communication education to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its employees better and hopes that deep understanding helps it improve the sustainability of persons in long-term operations that are known as the major channel of employees.
"If the company is not forced to create the culture of transparency, it loses employees," says Vitrano.
"If it loses workers, it will also lose customers.
And without customers there are no firms."
In Swedish, 20-year-old man doubts the encryption of his low-spot neighborhood, reports the news office TT.
A woman living in Göteborg had come home from the bed when she had noticed the window outside of his phone at the back of the phone on the shooting shooting.
The woman says I'm calling the camera to the house.
A woman who was swimming about the meeting was drinking into the other room to shoot up.
When a woman had arrived to check the situation, the phone was first shooted up, but soon he was counted into the window again.
A summary man of a 20-year-old age has admitted his pictures of the woman.
But he claimed that he was just a woman's face.
The video described with the phone was deleted, and the police didn't have been able to make it a proof.
In the hearings, a man has admitted the work, but he refused to blame his crime.
The man was founded by saying he loved his neighbors "as a fool."
The TT Agency states that a man is injured to the case.
Teachers require more flexibility in the negotiations
The payment development could not be lower than for example in export sectors, but the difference should be covered, said the President of the OAJ as a tour of Olympic.
The interim surgery of the public sector has highlighted the difference, he notes.
We do not have the possibility to make agreements that wouldn't likely be able to comply with the loans made in any way.
The contracts in the field of the chain are only born when the papers of the private sector have been signed and the higher rates are found.
Indeed, in January, the OAJ’s jobs have been agreed.
The percentage targets have not yet revealed.
It is also the President of the public-sector-based negotiations organization.
Increased: Lomara treatment increases the demands of employees
According to the OAJ, statistics and prophecies show a decreased deterioration of the payment force of the public sector when the private sector increases.
According to the fact that a periodic lomara processing is circumventioned by an extent to the extent.
Finnish should determine how many students can be a one teacher.
It also notes that the harmonization of the basic education should be ensured, since the differences in the best and weak ones are increasing in the whole time.
According to the system, the results of learning are decreased, and the differences between students and regions continue to grow.
Bruins players day my time when NCAA less daily practices together
On the other hand, some UCLA's football players have remained talking about the camp to the other set of new practice machines.
Some have been shocked with their peppers, and they're shooting from their shoes after the building of the first day.
Many time for them this negotiation support for a few minutes is a quarter of the mid-day.
Students at the Summer Summer Summer students will return to the home after three hours of practice to read to the final trials. The next morning they gathered half of the seventh legboard of water.
"Search for three days the punishment will come to these friends," the trainer Jim Mora says a little before the earth changes.
The school sport organization reduced the number of two daily practices together, and the change was to continue the number of players’ jobs, but it has led to their days – at least after the birthdays, when the last tests were held.
Therefore, the first three practices of UCLA began to be more than seven nights. The players already were difficult to find a place.
The restrainment of the slaughter records in the whole day means that the workshops are more prematurely, which began almost weeks ago than last year, and this is the first time that Mora continued through the sixth course of Westwood, when practices are considered at the same time with summer rates.
Railways are intended to hold 18 times before August 20, when you start preparing a precisely opening time: UCLA will meet the text A and M syliopy in September.
Mora says that he supports the NCAA rules change, although it made the timetables of players more closer.
"We really kill them a lot of three or four days, and it's very difficult," says Mora.
"But the players are ready to work, they're great friends.
I think that the situation will be easy when we get to shoot, and then we have more time.
UCLA closes the practices after the external headquarters. It is not easy when it is taken into account the direct view of the practitioner in the neighborhood area and Lusk Center, the level of the hotel that has already been bombed behind the landscape's protective network over flights.
Bruins players are intended to move to the hotel in the next weekend, but Mora admits that problems may be born for a period when rooms are available for external use.
"We have security arrangements." Mora says.
"There is that people can store the room and describe the practices for the video, which has not been limited to concern.
There's a lot of time on the video's descriptive.
But we have guards there and in the parking area.
We're gonna do our best.
I'm not gonna worry about my head about it.
We have a plan."
Freedom in Ruanda
The Central African Ruanda is organized on Wednesday afternoon by the President whose winners are already obvious.
Paul Kagame officially tried for the third time, but in practice, he has affected the lead of the earth since 1994.
Then the RPF captain stopped organized civil murder.
Kagame was the commander of RPF.
Kagame has been assessed, otherwise, of distorting opposition and restricting the word freedom.
He has also been accused of misunderstandings in poverty statistics.
At the third time, Kagame has been able to try because the Constitution Act was amended for two years.
However, in Ruanda, Kagame is also the leader of the age.
During Ruanda, social reforms have been made in Ruanda, and international investment has been forced.
Furthermore, Kagam has been a major role in the combination of the people's murder.
The success of Ruanda has been made by many Africans to ask whether liberal multilateral democracy is the right model for African countries.
However, Kagame has promised to increase the freedom of the people after the earth has been raised to his feet.
Now it's a good time to start.
Facebook fights false people by effectively checking facts
Facebook wants to send possible valuables to uncertain facts as well as to present results under the original article. The largest social network of the world has reported about this as a tour.
The company has published its website an opinion that it starts to use updated machines to identify false identification. The possibility of lies is sent to the checkers of facts and results will be published under the original article.
Facebook has been deemed to be the largest lie publishers, and many agreed that the liars have affected the result of the United States president in 2016.
The issue has been highlighted in a political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombarded in false voices before May and September, Germany, which prepared for the laws of the Presidency and the laws of September, supported the plan to cover social media networks, if they do not remove the enemy.
Torstaina Facebook announced in its various statements in Germany that the verification of facts is experienced in the United States, France, Holland and Germany.
"Many want to see what stories do not pass from independent investigators, and they also want more information to decide more about what they read and share," the Facebook newspaper's product head Sarah Su wrote in a company blog.
He adds that Facebook continues to test an action items related to Aiheese and makes other changes to its newspaper to reduce the lie.
Number of scripts: The story of a bond
Small Scotney's hill in Kent's crew today is known for Squeeze music videos and Margaret Thatcher's hiding place in the 1970s and 1980s.
But there is 700 years of angry history, which is now a shocking snake in the Bewl Square, which is the subject of the series of manuscripts written by Jamie Rhodes, the oldest moppious writer.
"I'm great to get to study the text written by a person over 300 years ago," Rhodes says evilly.
"I know a personal connection when I put a letter in my hand."
Rhodes' book, A Castle in England, tells the historys of the families in Scotney at the middle of the earliest time. Each story has been imagined by different artists, forgiving British series: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book based on Rhodes' Archives. In 2014, he showed Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories whose sources of innovation were the British National Library Documents. My project was sensitive.
"In my notice, in my letter of pockets, I had written a letter to the jakobite workers in the 2nd century," Rhodes says.
"It was his finger!
And the letters slaughtered from the skin, because then the light was used from the fire.
In three centuries later, the reader feels that he is on the place.
I love architects."
In the old documents, an encouraging writer lived nearly four months in the bridge with support of the National Trust Act and the English National Art Council, which seemed to be too good to be true.
He conducted days in studying the victorian "new" birds, architectes, artisans, and rare spectacles, such as shoes discovered in the walls, and centuries of balls in the shoe.
He rounded the old trails and the beaches and discussed the forest guards, the woods, and sometimes the book of imaging artists.
I'd like to say, "I'll take a whiskey and start to write."
The nearest history of Scotney is very unknown, because the shoes moved into the National Trust Act only to the last heritage, Elizabeth Hussey, died in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived in the place ten years later, the legislative staff was just going to start through the architecture. Rhodes describes that the architects had been held hundreds of years in the same way: bringing all the additional wheel.
The archive had letters, letters from the time and cards of the British imperium. "If you can imagine that the landmen are stupid," Rhodes says. "But this family had even struggled with one shock.
I came to think it wouldn't be already."
Some of the history of the book will be forwarded to the history of the English history, such as The Labourer. It tells us about a man who is soon joined after the preparation of the lion in the UK's home Chief in 1381.
“Nightly families of Kent and Sussex reported that there was a skin in 1380,” Rhodes says.
"In the same region, the chief of England began, and it came to be thinking that the captain could start from us.
Maybe these events are linked to each other?"
Other stories of the book relate to the history of the link — such as The Priest, the history of the priest, which Darrell’s family hided seven years during the English Religion.
The Smuggler again tells the secular driver Arthur Darrell's history of the 1700s. It is said to be slaughtered by filling the stones of the ark (which was observed for years after his castle was opened).
Darrells are the favorite family of Rhodes in Scotney.
Darrell's family men resolved their debt by marrying old women, and I see them grateful as friends who were part of the patriarch."
Now, Rhodes's going to get new letter tests.
He refers to two weeks in Finland by writing a series of books of Life in the beginning of the 1900 ’ s, which has only been rewarded to a ton.
Scotney's bridge has a special place in his heart.
"I've been painful to go from there," he says.
"I wouldn't have wanted to come back to this wicked ark."
You interrupted Russia's evilest war.
The military alliance between Nato and Russia has been clearly degraded, commented by the Director-General of Naton at the tour of the Nato.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and his position in the Ukrainian conflict.
I think that Naton's relationship to Russia is now more difficult than ever after the end of the war, Stoltenberg said in the discussion of the CNN.
After the end of the war, we hoped that we could work closely with Russia.
However, the continuing insecurity of Naton relationship with Russia, particularly after the unlawfulness of Crime in 2014 and Russia, has been significantly deteriorated.
Nevertheless, Stoltenberg says that Nato is still bound to act so that the shocks will not be scratched in their head.
So long as we are strong and so long as we can predict, we can visit Russia's political dialogue in order to prevent the situation of traffic and the new cold war.
Before the comments of Stoltenberg, President Donald Trump, the U.S. President of the United States had even been able to show a dangerous weakness between the United States and Russians.
Trump invited the country to thank the bad congress that adopted the new Russian packages last week.
Vladimir Klitshko stops - No revision against Anthony Joshua
The long-term pregnant series of worldwide master Vladimir Klitshko stops his car.
The Ukrainian Klitshko, 41, reported its decision on Tuesday morning.
Atlantic Olympics in 1996, Klitshko took a professional 69 times to win 64 negotiations.
He was managing different MMs in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitshko lost his back two last battles.
Tyson Fury found him in November 2015.
In April this year, Klitshko met Anthony Joshua in Wembley station and lost his battle after the struggle on 11th part.
Joshua and Klitshko were expected to meet a renewing negotiation in November in Las Vegas.
However, Klitshko did not find motives to fight.
I used for a few weeks to make a decision so that I got sufficiently slow to the Wembleyn negotiations, Klitshko told him when he was informed.
I got an amateur and professional investigator of everything I've seen, and now I want to start my second ring after the sport.
I couldn't have imagined that I had so long and unbelievable success.
I'm very grateful about this.
Look at Klitshko's foundation on the video.
Klitshko manager Bernd Bönte reported that the decision to stop was difficult to do with Klitshko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to stop if he has no enough motivation.
This is why it is urgently the right decision, and it stated.
Klitshko has been seen from 2009 with a US shower with Haide Panettier.
There is one child in Paris, a daughter of Kaya born in 2014.
Klitshko’s grandmother Vitali is also the former world master of pregnancy.
In 2008-12, the brothers dominated different MM chairs at the same time.
The Finnish regulator increases the conditions of "Export from Fields"
Minna Niccane's head has suffered conditions during the foreign disaster.
My Nicase had problems with circumstances.
Wine and coldness have been sent out of a woman's filling.
Even in London MM, there are insufficient circumstances.
I'm Niccane talking about the order.
The circumstances have been this sweet sweet head against Mina Nicca.
I wouldn't want to blame it, but it was unreasonable that I didn't even have a little bit of honour to move, Niccane said after Innsbruck's cup.
I've been competitive and practiced here here as many times and I have never experienced the same wine in this place, Niccanne told Pavo Nurm Game.
At this time, the stabilisation of the hypy was very difficult, even though in practice there were so insufficient tubes, Niccane founded in Kalev's kitchen.
That talked at the tour in London.
It's time that it's been difficult to get technology in the castle... whether it's a cold smell or something.
It's been cold and smooth, and it's taken out of the fila.
There is no reason to consume energy in bad circumstances.
He's got 455 of his government to MM.
There's 445 out there.
The situation is not the same for all in London.
It's gotta be a bitch and wait for a better sweet.
The goal is to overcome the early spring of 460.
Why don't you get any more trees to the outside?
It's not necessary.
Last Sunday, I was in Italy and Germany.
I got a smoke and a technological switch.
I'd probably have to do the same now.
The normalist has been engaged in the control, and the government has now been locked.
What would be a nice kid?
25 degrees heat.
It's just a little wind that comes until it's stable.
The former officer has tried the policy in General: "We have no shared resources now and not a lot of years."
In spite of the positive airlines of the economy, the Government of Juha Sipil must take the delay and causing the allocation of the State budget in the currency, warnings for ten years prepared by Erkki Virtane in the Ministry of State Safety.
He said there's no shared resources.
It was generally discussed in 2015 the life of Virta in the United Nations Middle Week.
It is just starting to build the budget for the next year.
Recently, the proposals of the policy, otherwise, on the expansion, the calculation of car taxes, and the support of the Virtanian electricity, have been able to call.
They are closely telling that the laws are close, because when ten per cent of the State budgets are financed with additional duties, we have no shared resources now and not for many years.
I've even been talking about the widespread, when you have to take it, Virtanen said to Yle.
The office stressed that all the debts have to be made for children.
The Office has a long experience on the preparation of the budgets of the State: he started in 1978 as the Ministry of State Safety, and then worked as the Assistant Head of the Budget and the Budgetary Chief.
Recently before he remains alive, he works as the Chief of the National Minister of Labour and Life.
The Bureau noted in the general debate that the economic growth of the three percent now predicted is probably temporary.
All prophecies estimate that this is a pic, from which the next year is coming to the alphabet, and Finland will wait for a percentage of the growth in ten years.
Washington changes permanent standards
President Donald Trump reported to the instruments that the remaining standards of Green Card are changed in the new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the amount of 50 000 legal immigrants in the year, clarify the requirements of temporary labour permits and limit family wages.
New rules have proposed the Republicans and the President supports them.
The legislation has to be discussed in two rooms in the Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, increases payments, and regulates billions of dollars of taxpayers by changeing the way the permanent residential funds are granted to other citizens of the country.
It also reduces heat immigration and replaces the current programme.
The new search process benefits applicants that are part of the English and can live themselves and who have our economy's benefits", Trump stated, according to the information tools.
Denmark's wife will not want to be buried with the Queen.
Prince Henrik doesn't want to be buried with Queen Margareth.
In the picture, Prince Henrik and Queen Margareet were described in April.
Danish Queen Margareta, 77, and this couple of prince Henrik, 83, does not shoot in the wheel, says the Dutch.
Traditionally, the ruling couples in Denmark have been entered into the same place.
The king's room has reported today that Prince Henrik did not want to be slaughtered to the Roskild Court Church, or she will be reported as a tour.
According to the BT magazine, this is why the prince’s inadequacy in his role in the king's family is not satisfied.
There's no secret that the princess had been unpleasant to his role and waste in the dance monarchy, Lene Belleby's head of communication in the newspaper.
The princess decided that he is not slaughtered to the ring of the Queen, is naturally a consequence of not being treated as a balanced party.
The Queen has been a long time to know about the hope of his partnership and understanding the decision.
A shock on the road: Auto had to be on the motor
Tom had an open copy and two little kids.
They didn't hurt in the accident, but they do not get the money assured if the other party was not targeted.
Turma took place at Vanta's Keimoport.
Archive picture of the Keha III construction area.
The Vanish Tommi tells his family who survived as a wonderful trade in car accidents.
Tommi, his opening partner Rina and two children of the couple, traveled to the direction of the Vanta Hermeenland motorway.
A long white car that had been driving in the village of the family, Tommi was talking about the swimming household of Hermeenland.
Without the traffic, the car would have come up with To もっと.
I turned the car at the same time, and it went out of the hand, Tomm tells me.
The family's car shocked a lot of speed.
Parents and backwards had two small children not hurted.
The second child is a little less than 3 years, the second is a year old.
It's apparently a good time when nothing happened to us.
No one's overwhelming didn't even pass away from us, even though there was a slight trail in your place.
The accident occurred at 17.20 p.m.
On the other hand, no one stopped with them, and the family called an emergency station.
They've got their own power out of the car.
The Ambulance and Saviation Office came to the place, and the time of the family was revised.
The car went to the breakfast.
Tomm tells her and the small income with the opener, and they got a lot of help to buy a car a couple of years ago.
Without the other car information, the family does not have the insurance of money.
Thus, the family hopes the viewer’s views about the car, which is because of the family’s life.
We need a car every day.
You know, it's hard to get your kids out and go working without it, Tommi says.
Tomm saw that the car was white, old car.
It probably was the end of the 1990s or the beginning of the 2000s.
He thinks the beginning of the car record number was SIG.
If the guilt isn't obtained, I don't know how we're going to be financially, today we're going to be counting every voice.
Tomm hopes that the events have been seen or something knowing about it are connected to the police.
The New Eastern Police Institute and the Mediterranean Salvation Institute are confirmed that they have had a mission on the last night.
Title and the case corrected at 21.15: Unlike at the beginning, another car was not received with Town, but was driving in the car of the family's car.
Lotta Jappis's comment about the relationships with humans in the way of drug - the own speaker is seeing what? Thursday and Sunday in the theatre
Lotta Jappin, who's from the coffee home, brings his initial exhibition to the theatre.
It is the music testing of the past human relations and the inadequate inadequacy.
The director Lotta Jappiss says that it remains a good idea.
We're going to be treated in the way we're drought.
You know, the emotions of your age aren't going to be worthy, she says.
The surrounding summer testing is carried out in a small budget and a large, young heart.
The name of the exhibition is to consider what humans will reveal themselves when they are known to the new humans.
Does he get some roles or close to another bag open?
Juoneton's presentation is to shock fact and fiction
The smuggling has been controlled and dramatised.
He also answers the light.
The report consists of the texts of the Working Group and there is no drink.
The manager believes that even though the presentation of the thoughts of youth, it speaks all of the age.
Indeed, it highlights that the Ombudsman does not directly tell his own or his own relationships with the working group.
Facts and physicians are shocked.
I'm sure that my own world's worthy is the explanation.
I don't think human relations would be bad, but not even that human relationship, especially a couple, would be a happy condition.
Many have learned from different parents.
Indeed, it believes that the Ombudsman will draw a timely picture of young adults living in Finland for a hundred years.
According to him, many have learned many of their relationships with their parents, whom many have disappeared.
At least it's that you're likeing to listen.
You don't have to stay in the relationship.
The presentation shows Minea Lång, Niklas Rautée and Otto Rocca.
The working group also belongs to the publisher Ella Snellman.
The music agreement is Jappies and Rocan.
Love to the teater in Couvol
Lotta Jappin, 26, studys as the theatre show leader in the art academic art.
It's two years behind and the other shooting.
The continuous inspiration of the theatre has started during the years of Kouvola.
The growth of musical cards has been assisted in the Couvola theatre and shown in the university layer in Helsing and last in the Linnateater in Turk.
You've started to be more interested in safeguarding.
His own sponsor took her last week in Helsinki's showing Narr's last week.
At about 45 minutes of sustainability in the future, at least in the Jamaican School City in Turkey, there is at least 45 minutes.
In the theatre 4.8 at 19:8 and 5.8 p.m. 14 and 19.
The Finnish Olympic Olympic driver took a warm year on the motocrosslessness of the moto.
The hard sporter in Finland has the same untenable natural strength as Janne Lahtela.
A hundred days of the year in the Kungrelaw, he was able to smile his dreams in the Olympics.
Haave took place in 2002, but it continues to be the government's business.
He was only an unfortunate practitioner, including a new species experienced.
There are no combinations on the earth that the chemical meat would not have experienced at least several times.
It's been exciting to practice.
I'll always find something new, Lahtela tells me.
Finally, one shock was to stop all the Law.
In 2014 Lahtela was an accident of motorocross.
As a result, his smell and both hands were cut off.
I didn't work anymore.
I've got the smells of my home year, Lahtela says.
The office had a bad luck.
He also admits that she could be a part of her mother.
You can feel like a smile.
You didn't get that line.
It's just as so hard that you don't make a sweet smell too much!
After the accident, the Latvia was a special situation.
His urgent life was stopped as in the wall.
The back was a long run to the Japanese freest team as the principal trainer.
The office immediately started in the fisheries after the end of 2006.
The first time after I was 15 years old, I had to be on my place.
I just didn't do anything, Lanthela tells me.
Even during the preparation, Lahtela often deceived its protectives in the beach and physician tests.
Very surprised, stopping was a good experience.
I was physically and mentally so disappointed that my own thoughts did not feel reasonable.
They didn't even have a type in a couple.
It's good to be there.
I liked it right, because I really had to be just once.
The compulsory stage is instructed by the Finnish Headquarter.
Without stopping, he's afraid that he'd be back to the end.
It's easier to find places that have passed a few than those who have been!
Without an accident, I wouldn't have found that I had to stay so much.
The office began as a trainer to the Finnish freestyle team about a year ago.
At the same time, he found a more safeer shock on the condition of the speeders.
Switch the motocross frisbeegolphin!
That's just going out of the baby right now.
In the worst, I had seven hours a day in the tent.
Although Lathel has always been a supernatural treeman, he did not require his trainers to be similar to him.
I'm not going to run all of them in the same way.
Our species cultures have the opportunity to be their own and the way to become the best world.
Freestile is a free style, and the mentality has always been satisfied with it, Lattel says.
Sex-robots will come and we have to be a reason to worry about it.
It's here: a report on the development of technology in the sex-robotic sector – just when you have started to feel that 2017 couldn't be more strange.
Yeah, it's just.
Sex-robots are a great thing now.
The corresponding Robotic Regulation (FRR) has published a silent report on the development of sexual robots in the following 5 to 10 years.
"We have to have a serious relationship to the generalization of sexual robots", says the legislation's fondator and robotic and effective professeur of the Christel Sharkey Sheffield University.
Customers can select a robot's color, the shape of the eyes and the type of the rings.
"Sexyrobotes are disappointed, but they are already sold, and we're going to see them more than that," Sharkey said in the public report.
Sexucles have developed as smooth robots that have the warmest feeling silicon age, as well as work-created designs that remember human use.
Users can also adjust robot's own preferences from the colour of the eyes to the form of nausea and the type and color of the rings.
It is also more concerned that robots have "privacy", which can women of Stepford show you the progress of your free leaders.
Sexucles have developed as robots with a silikon kid.
For example, RealBotix robots can adjust user's preferences, even if too much.
True Companion Roxxy Gold Robote has an exhibitional personality: Frigid Farrah is affected by the hot, Wild Wendy is a skilled and soon continues.
"Roxxxy Gold's personality is compliant to the personality of the user as perfect as possible", is reported on the websites of the company.
Actually, the robot likes the same thing as the user.
There are also various opinions:
It may be shocked, shocked, or "in the wind".
In the generalization of sex-robots, there are many concerning degrees, which replaces genuine human relations, but more dangerous is to reduce women and direct rape, for example, when the user is closer to a long and opposing robot.
True Companion compares the Roxxxy robot to the vibrator:
"There's a vibrator, why wouldn't a man have sex robots?"
However, sex robots are not only fetice or new sexual illness.
The generalization and development of them relates to some of our dark and deepest cultures: the equality of sex towards sex, which has one option in other groups.
Of course, most of the men do not get sex robots, and their recommendation is still marginal, although the FRR report report reported about their increased recommendation.
However, marginal appearances tell a lot of time about life.
And many are starting to be strange or harmful once the markets give it a license.
There is no doubt that sex-robots have come to the same time when women's rights are threatened in different parts of the world and the White House is a President who has disappointed women.
The Handmaid's Tale (Original) is not concerned about its powerful image language, for example, pictures of the shocked body and out of the eye.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but now it seems to be a surprising short trip.
Sex-robotics are trying to do so much like real women (measures of portraits) as technically possible.
Robotes developers want that their skin feels sick and movements follow as well as possible human movements.
But their "privacy" are far from reality.
Robotics can't get out of the relationship or situation.
They have no own desire and no history – nothing of selfishness refers to or perfectly empowered fantasies.
They're awesome servants.
Order.
Police suspect: Australia was planned for two terrorists, the Chief of Iss
The Chief of the Chief of Iss conducted a group of Australian officials, which is doubtless about the planned shipping to Etihad Airways' aircraft.
The man of my father's leadership was Sydney Morning Herald sent also a bomb to Sydney.
Unexpectedly, the bomb was intended to take on the aircraft on 15 July, but the company stopped before the safeguard.
The police doesn't tell me why the company stopped.
Another suspected terrorist plan was to build a tough colorless gas device and to put the device into the public place, for example on the public road.
Michael Phelan, assistant Commissioner of the Australian Federation, says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans that has ever been done in Australia.
Because of the unexpected terrorist plans, four men were arrested in the police Councils on Sunday.
One man has been able to be free, but he also continues.
Trump's good side?
You can get Mitt Romney to show a healthy organization.
Throughout the time of Trump, there has already been a decline in the time that the strong channel of voters has also disrupted the families.
At Christmas and Thanksgiving Day, the American newspapers were taught how Trumpi voted with the family.
We all want our clean information team.
The less attention has remained at Trump's ability to combine families.
I'm talking about this because my shock had a village this week in New York, and he's a snake of the left shoes in Chicago, who has already been shocked with the Republics for a long time.
He recalled that a common enemy could have a strong combination of effects.
Now, when Trump is in the White House, I'm all shocking, also a sister who supports the Republicans, whom he has argued about the politicals for decades, are equal and surprised at the same side.
It is a good thing in the day, but the more thought about it includes significant risks.
Trump has given a new power to the left, but his presidency is indeed possible to bring us all right to us.
When we talk about Trump and "normalising", we're talking about the horrible opportunity that one day we're not going to be worried about him.
In the long term, Trump has even more likely to normalize the right extraterrestrial Republicans, which, compared to Trump, have just a very reasonable effect.
Remember as a shocked version of Mitt Romney: dog on the car gate, 14% income tax (and his taxing has been seen). In comparison with the Trumpest, they affects very low crimes.
When Trump's long time is over, the next presidency of the Republics must be clear, and it feels soon a significant improvement.
When I was visiting, we took our kids to the Diskussion Caruselle, and it's the biggest coffee and the best part of the New York park that gets in New York three dollars without coffee.
The horses of the shoes are powerful, centrally shocks — shocking clouds and horrible beasts — are wicked, and the swimming music of the background is strange.
Many of New York's accommodations have been slowly shocked: the visible high buildings start to smile, the cities' cities will be too excited and the reality of the city does not respond to dreams.
And yet, 35 years later, I have been fully able to overcome that Swiss Cottage was not a Swiss cottage but a large business price in Northern London. Y Olde Swiss Cottage is actually the Swiss pub, but it is not counting.
Instead, the debate is still a wonderful animal — even though two years of age, one of the two and two quarters of women enjoyed it.
I would have given the smell complete pieces if someone had asked me to consider, but, unfortunately, no one came to ask.
Instead, I was requested this week in the goods office to evaluate "My payment trial" at one reference star before I set my credit cards to the counting law.
The same thing is in my home tours, but there is also a possibility to combine a 15% service money when I go to find me from the coffee.
This emphasizes the archiving effects and presss the customer servants to put their person into a game in a situation where it does not need it.
The seller of the carriage regretted me as an unfortunate experience when I was able to give my credit card to five stars.
Shefki Kuqi was shocked from the Interior, "It wasn't a leadership."
FC Inter today has released Shefki Kuq's post-advisory tasks from the training team.
Fabrizio Piccareta, which was previously operated as a supporter.
Another training group continues in the current tasks.
The Italian Piccaret has been a assistant in previously other parts of the English Sunderland.
In January, the 51-year-old group of Internal Training Piccare has been performed last year.
The FC Internal Government President Stefan Håkans regrets the event.
The change of the trainer is never easy or satisfied.
However, shefki Kuq had no longer been the confidence of the leadership, where other options were not now, Håkans commented on the follow-up information.
The Piccaretan Agreement is until the end of the time.
He is together with the other training group in charge for the tomorrow meeting with HIFK.
According to the reports of the night Zonomy, the team has destroyed the long tours.
Kuqi told the players that I follow the helpers of Piccare and John Allen have been moved into discrimination.
Kuqi and Piccareta took strongly together in the Intern fight against the PS Kemi last Sunday.
Linda Lampenus published a picture of youth in the 80s.
The Victor Linda Lampenus published in Instagram a youth picture.
The image has been added to several alarms that can result in the 16-year-old student of Siberius-Actema.
The lamp itself wonders how serious a young woman looks at the camera.
A long time ago, seriously, he's going to report.
If you don't see a picture, you can look at it.
The lamp has previously published photos of his past and spoke about painful subjects.
A year ago, he published in Instagram himself.
In the second picture, she's seen 20 years ago, and in the second, he's now owned as two children.
In the picture, the Lampenus covered its own growth as humans and refers to food disorders that he suffers as younger.
I'll meet you 20 years ago and today...
I still look as much as that 26-year-old girl, but it's the difference that I learned to keep myself and what I look like, Lampenus wrote.
On the text he had added in English a challenge of life, food disease, insecurity, self-confidence, self-consciousness, love for himself, 1996, 2016, ageing, girl, woman, ageing is wonderful.
The lamp has been openly talking about his eating phenomenon for the past years.
She was 14-year-old in the hospital because of her anorsis and ororology.
Soon afterward, he also sicked with a boom that finally revealed in 2006.
I'm going to make up a little silence.
In addition to the treatment and comparison, the lamp helped new love.
Oscar Pistorius was delivered from the prison because of the pigs of the hospital.
This is the second time Pistorus was sent from the prison to the hospital.
Last year, he received hospital treatment in the beaches of his injuries that he said that he was cut down in the shell.
Pistorism was sentenced by the murderer's original murder court.
He murdered in the early time of Steen Camp's friendday in 2013 by shooting several shoots through the door of WC in Pretoria.
Pistorus claimed that he was a girlfriend in the night that hided the WC.
The guilters have told their expectations to reprove, since they believe that Pistor’s six - year judgment is too slow.
The Government's authority is intended to register the highest right of South Africa, and the election may be treated as possible this year.
If a complaint is approved, the Court of Justice of Pistor may expire for 15 years.
The death penalty is not used in South Africa.
Two boards were arrested from unlawful park in Greece
Two unlawful boards were arrested in Greece, reported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in accordance with the BTV Canadian.
The police arrested a number of people who were promised to be camped in Sitonia on 1 August morning, and there were two stations.
They were still released on the same day, but the investigation of the case continues.
According to the Television Canadian BTV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs later reported its release of boarders.
The Greek authorities have decreased the rules on the explicit border zones and already granted to all those who are divided other than in the areas set out in the purposes.
The checks will be continued until the end of the time.
The Minister has reported that the right could be able to make a cup.

Red meat, milk products and sweats may swim the symptoms of the cut-off
The red meat and sweat may feel like the paintings of the breathing system.
However, your research claims to be decreased: the use of food containing meat and milk products may facilitate the symptoms of the symptoms.
The symptoms of spectacular symptoms are an unprecedented disease that suffered about 1,3 million people in the United States and 3000,000 people in the United States.
However, the researchers at Washington sylipsi found that the necessary amino acid of protein includes triptophana helped organisms to develop immune cells that confirm their integrity.
According to the director of the study, Marco Colonna, immune cells were protected and ensured that the disappearing microbits in the food do not go to the body.
Equitable cells in future cells that strengthen the ability to protect the body without prejudice to heavy fruits.
If the balance is too close to the flow, the consequences may be the symptoms of the symptoms.
In tests, it was observed that immune cells were confirmed with muscles with a certain bacteria liste.
This bacteria requires triptophana so that immune cells start. Tryptophana is one of the protein construction substances.
“We found contact between the development of cells that promote the bacteria of Lactobacillus reutter. Lactobacillus reuster is part of the normal microbiome of the facility", says Professor Colonna.
"What more in the museum's food election was triptophan, more they had such immune cells."
If the same function is in humans, the combination of the feeds in the bacteria of Lactobacillus reuter and strictly triptofania can strengthen the ability of the list and reduce the inflammation of the tuberculosis.
When investigating the strengthening immune cells, Luisa Cervantes-Brragan observed that, although one of the mouse groups had such cells, they were not the same with the mouse mouse muscles that were considered different from another group.
He suspected that the difference was linked to microbiology, or normal bacteria, seed and virus community.
When the museum’s DNA was investigated, six bakteries were observed in their mouses with immune cells but not in other mouses.
When the lactobacillus reuter bacteria was given to the steriil-created muscles of microbiology and not developed immune cells, they began to appear in immune cells.
The researchers wanted to find out how the bacteria affect the immune system, and they increased the lactobacillus reuter bacteria and moved small liquids – without bacteria — to different muscles of immune cells.
Immuno cells developed as a strengthening ability.
When active substance was cleaned from the liquid, it was demonstrated to the site of triptofhane substance change, known as indol-3-mato acid.
When researchers doubled the number of triptofaans in the museum nutrition, the number of cells confirmed was around 50%.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, humans have the same powerful cells as the mouse, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuter bacteria in our sweet channel.
Nevertheless, triptofaan’s site products can be found in the lactobacillus reuter cells to develop humans in the same way as in the mouse.
"We certainly want to promote the development of such cells because they are regulating the incentive in the interior corners," says Cervantes-Baragan.
"In combination of triptofaanous lactobacillus reuter bacteria can promote the generalization of them."
Jose Mourinho believed that Manchester United has received its "neron" lines with the Nemanja Maticin Agreement
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United had the "neron" agreement with Nemanja Matici, which was held in the mid-week battle in Manchester United.
From Chelsea on 40 million, Matic began to win 2 to 1 in Dublin, through the past battle before the EUFA Super Cup tournament against Real Madrid. He made an impact on the media player, like Paul Pogban and Andreas Perera.
However, Matic was not in the best, because he was not joining the Asian rounds before the beginning of the years. He did only 45 minutes in the field — according to Mourinho, it is a change before the beginning of the election.
"He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence and his way of thinking do him - he has the credible thoughtability of the football," Mourinho says.
"We will help him to be ready, better than later."
In addition to mathematics, Victor Lindelof and Rome Lukas were launching games in Aviva stadiums when Mourinho began to turn to the initial meeting for the beginning of the time.
Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants still three new players, even though the result has already done "good work" by obtaining three of his four priorities to set up his player.
"There are just four -- it must be thanks to you," he added.
"I'm more satisfied if I get all four, but they've done a great job."
The pilots ruined Germany for two years.
The Finnish airport team lost its fourth battle of MM-cars to Germany directly was 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
The routine of Germany's playing is high.
At the same time, their game was on each sector, but buto Kangasniemi told in the information.
In the first two of the Finnish, he had the opposite, but in the third, a German was clearly stronger.
Germany's leads to illness.
When we were played patiently and in some places enough aggressively, it was possible to shoot with, Kangasniemi said.
Finnish effectively was 14 points assembled by Pia Corhone.
On Sunday, the three battles were lost in Finland.
Reuters: The large group has already sent challenges to engage in the Russian situation of Trump Jr
In the United States, the large group has sent challenges to join the Donald Trump Jr and the Russian employer Natala Veselnska.
The large group, called for the whole of Robert Mueller, has already sent challenges with Donald Trump Jr and Kreml, a russman who is known to meet Natala Veselnitzska.
The news office Reuters, which has previously confirmed Wall Street Journal's exhibition on the invitation to a large complainant.
According to Reuters, the large group has sent challenges in joining Trump Jr and Kreml to the meeting of a known Veselnitska, which was organized between the United States Presidential Valerie in June 2016.
There were also Donald Trump Mr. Camping Chief Paul Manafort and his current advisor Jared Kushner of the White House.
According to the sources of Reuters, that the specialist, Robert Mueller, has called for a large complaint in Washington, means the intensification of Russian study.
Submits increased that Mueller wants to be investigated as a large candidate, which is trying to discourage Russia’s invasion to the United States Presidents and whether Trump's campaign or its neighbouring cooperation with Russia.
The large group will extend the rights of the Mueller to collect evidence, send challenges, and force people to test lightly.
The large number of general citizens are working behind closed doors.
The larger group is putting up the evidence found in the investigation of the accused person and decide whether it should increase the accusations in this case.

As a shower of the White House, thousands of dollars were estimated to taxers
The last decision of the White House is to fly the helicopter of the marine names to the Southern Sweden of the White House by an American production event to be paid to the taxpayers $24,000.
The Green White Sikorsky VH-3D helicopters used the name of Marine One when the President is in the ship, which was shocked in the event in 17.7.2017 in the White House of the United States.
President Donald Trump, Chairman Mike Pence and a group of officials of the White House were known for all 50 States.
In addition to the helikopter prepared in Connecticut, there was a shipping boat from Main, a shooting car from Wisconsin and a truck from Mississippi.
The Force Office of the White House was requested for the Helikopter's missional arrangement only 36 hours prior to the slope of the Southern Sweden, which appears in the document of the HMX-1 helicopterics.
"I just want to ensure that you are aware of the matter, because there is an exceptional event that receives much visibility", the Commander of the HMX-1 was written in the previous day in his email message, the commander of the marine flight.
The message was reported that helicopters would arrive to the Southern Sunday at 17.7 a.m. in the morning and began from three nights. Helikopter would be removed from the place just after the sleeve between the six and the nine night.
Furthermore, it was noted that if helicopter leaves from the White House would be relocaled, there would be another men who would be needed for the limitation of services.
The initial men were in helicopter during the time, and the security staff was at the Helikopter when it was in the country.
The TIME newspapers do not find out whether it was finally necessary for other men.
The Hatch Act of the United States prohibits the ownership of the State's workers in political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 informed whether the law of the event was wrong.
"There is why our questions were whether this Hatch Act was crimed, and we were told that it wasn't a crime," the commander wrote.
"Reclaims that you can participate," the assistant commander answered.
Made in America was an official event of the White House, so it was not part of Hatch Act law.
But the officials also have political lights.
At the time, the President spoke in the process of the Senate for his health care reform and for the more public regulations found.
The use of the Marine One helicopter and Air Force One is not a new appearance.
The Presidents shall use them in their lands,
But they're only uncomfortable for light photos.
Trump's action was awakened in February when Air Force One ruled the President's campaign in Melbourne, Florida. Trump has strongly criticized the use of his presidential airport on Twitter.
"The White House is very satisfied with the event of Made in America, which was presented by American employees' products from all 50 countries," stated the White House's director Lindsay Walters.
The HMX-1 units regularly do training institutions in the Washington region and operate in Southern Sweden by providing the President to the White House with a verification of the centimeters.
When Trump was at the G-20 Summit at the beginning of July in Germany, HMX-1 made 58 exhibitions to the White House.
According to a officer, the flights of Made in America were a monthly training quote of men.
On that day, there were 11 hours of helicopters on "not-presidents".
According to the white house, it has not been caused to the taxpayers other costs.
The investigator said that the company was not in combination with the Helikopter's presentation in the Southern Sea of the White House.
HMX-1 has no recording of flights related to the tasks of the President, and the accurate evaluation of the expenditure is difficult.
According to VH-3D Helikopter VH-3D, the Department of Democracy was $24,380.
According to HMX-1 documents, flights from Quantico from the Virginia State to the White House have been supported for a total of an hour.
According to the White House, helikopter use costs are clearly lower.
"Reducing the costs for taxpayers according to the reimbursement, it is unfair," says Walters.
"Assessed reimbursement includes personal, occupation and many other costs that are undertaken in annual finances."
According to the conclusion of the RAND investigation company in 2015, the costs of reimbursement are not included in staff, but are taken into account the fuel costs of the fuel, the preparation and the contract.
In some days, the former director of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of helikopter during the event.
"I think it's an American product,," Spicer said.
"I know that the Sicorsky and the Connecticut States are very proud of safeguarding national security and working through it, of course, hundreds of thousands of people or thousands of people.
And I think the majority of Americans are proud of helicopters and other defence drugs, which many Americans have worked very much before.
It's fullly interesting to import it out."
It's not sure if Trump was in helicopter during the event, but at least he shuted the car driver in the place.
In a white house, Trump shocked a newspaper on his Sikorsky ship.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President. "I have three of them."

The threat of certain tourists to the culture of the region
The authorities consider their limited number of tourists in Venice.
The local rape is particularly focused on the representation of tourists.
The Italian Ministry of Cultural Affairs calls it "eat and flee" as a tourist, which is only a few hours to be held in major groups.
Venice has been shocked on the tourists that have been made in the city.
There is a difficult movement on the streets and the great openings are so full of visitors that the people of Venice have no longer possible.
They have been forced to move from the historical center as they have come to hotels.
The New York Times and The Guardian about the introduction of the turism.
The authorities consider the limitations to the tariff.
They call the current appearances to be a bad tour - low quality tourism.
When you arrive in the big ristal, the time is given for two or three hours.
You will observe a frozen instruction from Piazzale from Rome to Rialton and to the Holy Marks Tower, and returned, describes the turism caused by the Italian Minister of Culture Dario Frances.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the operations of local, trade and jobs.
We have to keep this part of the identification of the cities.
The Holy Mark’s tor belongs to the most favorable visitors of the Venice historical centre.
At the top of the Torin, the Church of Saint Marks is located.
Local angry is also faced with the main part of the rider.
In the historical center of Venice, more than 500,000 lives in the local.
In 1951, populations were about 175.000.
In July, 20,000 Russians expressed their appreciation against masturism.
They say that their turismo has deteriorate their quality of life, destroying the environment and slowing the inhabitants.
It's about 20,000 inhabited every year.
If this continues, a few years later in Venice is not like tourists.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster, says in the order of Carlo Belframe.
It is difficult, since vessels bring Venice to its slightly needed income and create the need for work in various areas.
In addition to the limitation of the tariff, it has been decreased that the riders have passed far from the historic center.
Luciano Bortot, who lived in Russia, would certainly change the situation if the Russian administrative region, where it is located in Venice, will be more powerful to decide on his own matter, if it is completely autonomy.
The Russians are visiting about 20 to 30 million tourists each year.
You're going to shoot down?
In the motor, the mid-kilometers of the mid-mile

In the area, the motor switching work that shoots the transport is telling Savo's words.
Instead of a regular 120 kilometres of clock speed, the number of data is 50 kilometers (50 km) limiting speed.
However, even in the 50 km limit area, the traffic was advanced at the toursday in practice.
Scientists moved to the toursday on the side of the Silian River, or at the front of the golden wall.
I'll go well without such a care.
23-year-old drinkers have been able to see the letters of publicity.
Amalie Iuel has published beautiful pictures in the country of Grand Canyon.
The Denmark Amalie Iuel has risen in his home today as a recommended sporter in Norwegia, not at least because he disrupted in March 26, 26 years of old Norway’s vision in 400 meters by rounding the rating system at 51.81.
A month later, he improved 400 meters from Norwegia at 55.38.
Soon Iuel, who uses social media, was noted that personality and publicity have their walls.
Mans around the world, apparently, began to send pictures to Ieu their sex organism in the hope that the young drinker would interest them.
Iuel had to close the Snapchat account.
I got a lot of "true pictures" of an unknown person, so I had to change my account in private, Iuel told the VG magazine.
Iuel didn't want to have the VG's conversation clearly identified what pictures he had.
I'll be sure you can imagine, Iuel's nausea.
It's glad to get back after the journey, but I'll be well done without any other attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark 1994.
His mother is Danish, Dad, Danish Norwegian.
Iuele's family changed Norwegia's 2-year-old Amalia.
At Amalia, a 12-year-old family changed his father's work first in Namibia, then in Pakistan.
Then there were Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
Iuel lived four years as a University of Southern California at Los Angeles, which returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he changed Denmark citizenship into the Norway citizens.
In Norwegia, Iuel performs the three training of Leif Olav Alnesin, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Sletum.
In Norway there are more opener discussions than in the United States.
In the United States, trainers do not ask anything but just give us provisions.
In Norwegia, the trainer has much more time to be personally done with a sportor, Iuel said to VG.
Amalie Iuel is able to dominate the norms of 400 meters and 400 meters in the slope.
The footstepper Janne Kurve took the whole side of the horizontal board... now with the MM questions: "That's good when there's no one."
Now it's a nice count when nothing happened!
Janne Corpi, who has been read to the Finnish most successfully successfully, has come back to enjoy their loved species in this period.
There's been even the last summer on the horizontal floor.
The shock of the foothead was forced to the Corve operating table in January, and the feet did not want to be improved.
The hand had taken a part in the snake.
In the summer, I didn't know what I'm doing, if I'm going to continue or not.
Sponsoirs were on the way and many things opened, Corpi tells me.
But that's how it's said that it's a way to do it.
The sponsor continued the contract over two years, and the blood began to get back to the ring.
After that, it was easy.
I knew it last time I was going to be on the light.
I was that shit, yes, it's so fun again, we're still watering through a couple.
The body came to calculate the same time in September, but after a long slow shock, only an uncomfortable tree was a great thing.
You know, the skins Corpi just turned some of them.
It's not a problem.
The competitors were never the main aspect of the floor.
I'm never going to have a sweet count.
I think it's a shocking star for four years in a kitchen, and then you're in the late week.
I don't think about that, Corpi says.
Today, the Corpi is in the midst of the MM boxes held in Sierra Nevada in Spain.
Even though individual skins do not like him in a couple of swimming floors, he is always shocking.
According to the amendment, the evaluation of the skins organized by the International Counterparty has been increased over the past years, although part of the slaughterers also chose to hold the Norwegian X-Game at the same time.
Yes, these are important skins. The visibility is great.
In fact, I think the appreciation always depends on the conditions and the level of discussions.
The body is a former sporter in Sierra Nevada to the Finnish 12-century team.
Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkisennime, 17 years old, are Corpea 14 years old.
It's nice to follow the costs of younger friends.
I remember when I was in that stage that everything was new and that was so sick of all.
That's the new flow to yourself, the Corpi thought.
I'm still on the ring, but I don't know, it's a flow in friends!
Janne Corpi has also built another sport swimming swimming swimming pool.
Manager leader Pecca Korve's son has been shocked to the rail sport: the slaughter has its own raisins for which he makes tree programs.
When I'm over the whole time, I wasn't going to be in the lady.
But I'm looking at at at least every day's results and usually something out there is, Corpi says.
Radio and rail preparation, according to Corve, are a potential urgency plan when the slaughter flows during the decision.
I wasn't planning so long, but it's at least likely a option.
I'll try that a little like I'm studying it in the end of this lake.
I'm trying to remain nervous and develop a lot of time in the summer, maybe somewhere left.
If it's my coming professional, it's not difficult to start when it's already ready in the species.
The restaurants include also a dinner with Jaajo Linnonma for the reform of Elitloppet.
Two has been shocked with a ristal, which will lead to the end of May to Tukholma Elitloppet.
The Corps and Linnonland decided to rise in old traditions again.
The Risting has been a lot of trade, and the people have been excited.
Now we're already in that point that at least it's not going to be competitive.
A few months you're still in time, you're hoped to get the ship full, Corpi says in your joy.
Wayt's Holiday project to Kite has surprised all

Thanks to the general wonderful issue, the new management unit is sufficient to customers, since now, during the war, many private treatment codes could be a customer.
In the future, China has more questions to ask for alternatives, except for options, also for effective service.
All services are needed, and if you have options, the freedom of choice will also work better, Flink says.
Wait has purchased private care houses from China last year to the Canadian Vienna and Erica.
Trade increased in business operations, but it is obviously a five-year trade agreement.
Flink says that there is no need to move operations out of these situations.
Add to the subject today later.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of the McVitie's Bronn of Skotlane
The Professional Union is obtained by the leaders of the McVitie's manufacturer for a long-term commitment to the production of Glasgow.
According to the GMB Scotlane General Professional Association, the company has not reported its planning for the future of Tollcross.
Hobnobs and Rich Tea kitchens and other products are more than 500 employees.
McVitie's bridge's Pladis's company told his investment in the past five million pounds of the last year.
The company adds that the representatives of the Employees and the Professional Union would be "hereinaftered," if the action was being changed.
In the letter shown by the Director, GMB calls on the company “to ensure that modernisation of producers has not been given to the financing”.
Drew Duffy, the GMB Professional Association, is very concerned about the fact that the Chairman does not receive clear information on the needs of the Tollcross business plan and the future investment plans.
"The families are worked here from another generation, and the workforce has been strongly concentrated on the local community and the large cities of Glasgow, which is an important employee in the area of high unemployment and deficit income.
The east Glasgow needs to be successful McVitie's production, as well as the increased life costs and production costs."
According to the Pladis reporter, the director of the office had received a letter on the past day and the company answered directly to the letter, since it apprecies the continuous impact of the workers and professionals.
"We had a regular meeting with the employees and the GMB representatives in Tollcross two months ago, when we discussed a number of questions openly.
We have discussed with the employees, otherwise, that, in the way of other highly competitive and uncertain market companies, we will continue to evaluate all our business and operations in order to maintain our competitiveness."
According to the data question, the company has invested more than 5 million pounds in the production of Tollcross in recent years, in particular to its producers and to improve its operations.
"We are aware of the long history of Tollcross, and we will certainly tell the first employees and the representatives of the Professional Association if we are going to make changes in the action."
Have you warned PSG Barcelona from the movement of Neymar three years ago?
LaLiga may have an interest in Marco Verrato.
Paris Saint-German did not stop Neymar's target when it was paid to 189 million punishment agreements. But PSG was warned about the prespective movement of Barcelona three years ago?
The transmission of the sensation play has been long talking. The French Ligue 1 - football team is ready to break the world’s view of the transfers, which was less than half less smaller than it was born when Paul Pogba returned to the United States by the transfer of 89 million reds.
After the transfer, Neymar becomes a shooter in the world as well as a professional sporter, as the PSG offers him more than 5000,000 punks a week after the taxes.
Barcelona’s knowledge is being raised about the PSG function and the way Neymar has come close to the people. The prominent source reports that Neymar had been very concerned since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Have the President of the PSG warned this movement three years ago?
When Manchester City announced her interested in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned the best PSG players.
"I am not worried, for they know that if they strike our players, we will be their opposers, and we shall contact them with their players," said Al-Khelaiph.
"We communicate all the wheels.
But if they feel our players, they're going to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to be accused of this: it would express its interest in the PSG's central player Marco Verrato previously in the summer.
The PSG made clear that it would not allow Italian to go in any circumstances. It may be very important that Barcelona lose its star player because of this.
