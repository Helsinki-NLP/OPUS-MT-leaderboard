Barack Obama receives the nobel price as fourth President of the United States
The American President Barack Obama comes for 26 hours after Oslo (Norveia), to make the fourth President of the history the Nobel Prize.
He also receives the diploma and the medailles and a check of $1,4 million for its extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The chief of the White House comes tomorrow together with his wife Michelle in the Northwest Metropole and will be busy all the time.
First of all, the Nobel Institute is in place to visit, where he first meets the five members of the Committee, who selected him in October 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple then planned a meeting with the Norwegian king Harald V. and King Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reached its highlighting point with the ceremony, which obama takes the Prestige Price.
This is obtained as the fourth President of the United States, but only the third who takes the price directly to the office.
The White House has already advertised that Obama will be talking about the price of the Afghan war.
The President does not want to exempte this topic because he knows that he takes the price as a President that leads to two countries to the time of war.
The war efforts have been strengthened by the expulsion of other wars to Afghanistan some days ago, which has not been forgotten by any of its critics.
In the ceremony, Obama also received the Golmedaille, the diploma and the scene over ten million Swedish chrones (c. 24 million Czech chrones).
The money is intended to make good purposes, but he has not decided on a concrete caritative work.
The event programme will then present a banket with the President and his wife, which will also be attended by the Prime Minister and more than 250 guests.
Obama was very declined from the beginning of the price.
He, in particular, claimed that he felt that he did not get the price completely.
In addition, he repeated that it is not only the price for him, but also for all those who seek the same values as he.
Soon after the announcement, he pointed out that this is "related to act" for him.
Natural protectors are accused of pressing
The Leitmeritz-Polizei accused the President of the Citizens Association for Natural Protection Community Leitmeritz for pressure.
In several cases, he introduced professionals against some construction procedures last year, for the delay of his professionals, he requested money from the investors to his profits, said the Leitmeritz Police speaker, Alena Romova.
The President of the Directorate-National Protection Community Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in prison and it's threatening him to a prison penalty of up to three years.
The sorter molding containers in bruns do not rise good
In Praga, people can sort drinking packages, in the Southern Mediterranean places, they will be able to step up and trip the sorter molding containers.
And in brain?
There should be a few minutes to find the suitable tonnes.
I don't want to say that the disappearing in Brussels would never work.
But I am thinking if the Councils are inadequate to take care of this problem, even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Br√ºnn is situated in the city of Liga, not only because we are as citizens here in the sorting containers only in the papers, glass and materials, but especially through the number of muscle tons for such wastes.
Have they ever tried in the center, for example, to remove the PET flat in a collective cart?
This is also art, before all, it needs time and strong nerves.
The only place that I've found up to now is the shooting place towards the slaughter.
Mr President, I do not have to be hungry to our colleagues, but this is too little to me.
Unlike the disappearance in other parts, it is not a shock in other parts.
The whole series of my friends aren't likely to sort the disappearing.
Of fault.
It is too far to them.
I'm not surprised.
I've offered myself after the party to shoot a few glass and plastic flashes.
But on the Conicova Strasse, I haven't seen in vision color molecules.
Happily, I came to the right place to the road.
But the mould is almost over.
This is still the center of Brann, where the whole city is represented, isn't it?!
However, ecology and any kind of ecology probably allows the Brazilian socialists to fry.
You love the city to buy a eishockeyliga that makes us damage in the whole Republic, instead of buying more than a few mollusk tons and offering the sorting of other substances for a more cleaner breen.
I am glad I could also confirm my acceptance with official statistics after I searched for a while on the Internet.
According to the data of the ECO-COM society, Brussels is really the worst in the whole region of Southern Sea.
The Parubek Budget has deleted the money for pensions and hospital payments
After the link party has given the view of the Government to the farmers and officials more money, there is no more money for pensions, hospital payments and building parks in the budget.
But not even for State debt or international courts.
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, says that there will be more problems that will be at the government in the second half of the next year.
When social democrats and communists have implemented the increase in the maintenance of some groups, they calculate that the government pays the money for the ad hoc expenditure, age interests or hospital payment. "This is just a decrease of the problems in the future, mines", says Janota.
The creditors are closely payed higher interests, and the money must be refunded at once.
To select where to take the state cast is empty.
If the social services or costs for the State business are not shorter, taxes should be increased.
For all whom the left party has now given more money: the firewave, the teachers, the farmers.
And later for their children.
To save the pensions or the hospital payment whose account has lost 1,8 billion, people must not be afraid to get this money.
But to the price that the State has more debt - in the next year, in the state case, it will not only lose 163 billion, but far more.
Despite the efforts of the Minister Janota, the debt will grow so faster and the costs and interests together with them.
The State will need the compensation of money, and then it will no longer be sufficient to increase the multi-value tax, or to reduce the maternity payment, as the government has done in its counter-deficit package.
In the following year, five billion dollars are missing for the development of cars and trains.
This is overall the sections gained in the competition that can't be projected and eventually able to be able to make it possible.
At least obtain what is not free.
This means forgoing or setting up threety major construction works, which is also threatened by the European farm creature, warninging the speakers of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD suggested that it will solve the impact of money salmonically - it is the CEZ sharers in which the State owners of the Majority are, and then the money will be shooted into the transport funds.
The problem is that the height of the divident never is safe, and it is no matter an infinite source.
In the past year, from CEZ to the budget of 18 billion.
Every year, the dividents are payable to environmental deterioration, the pension account is filled with and this money will also serve as a reservation for the planned pension reform.
This trick also increases the actual budget deficit on the Nieveau of 5,7% of the GDP according to EU rules.
But this does not end the carnival of the conversions.
Nearly three billion were the budget for different deteriorations for victims of communism and of criminals or for the judiciary, even for the construction.
If the State is right without this money, it is not sure.
It's a good game.
If we lose an international court, we must pay it as well, Janota makes it clear.
The Minister must then defeat the money within or, worsely, the government budget reserves.
A few million are also lacking for the double-millionary project "State Case" which is intended to monitor on-line, for which the individual authorities pay the money.
The first step starts in January.
If the Financial Ministers do not find the money anywhere different, the project should be cut and in this case sanctions come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
Americans receive for the future with a phone where the user can convert one key between different operational systems by pressing the user.
The plans proposed are very promising.
It is enough to press only a key, and from Windows mobile will be within less than seconds in the Android shift.
This option is likely to present the American society VMware, which focuses on the development of the virtual software for the computer.
We allow you to execute two user profiles simultaneously on the phone.
You can switch between these, they can divid them into two home and work profiles.
Both works parallelly, Mrs. Krishnamurti declared VMware's company at the interview for the Magazine Computer world.
It was presented in November last year and introduced for the first time a few days ago.
The market will come in 2012.
The Virtualization of the Smart Phone is not a fiction.
VMware has successfully introduced the Smartphone test template with two operational systems.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM player, which delivered parallelly the systems mentioned in Windows Mobile and Android.
The development of the new technologie for mobile phones is in full way.
Now the VMware company works together with European and American operators at the smartphones virtualization and to customers, the devices should come within 2012.
Sneaklessness on the mountains counts the hotel owner
Sneeless pests are not only worried about the people of the Riesenberg.
The lack of snow also shocks people from ordering the ski residences in hotels and pensions.
This is why you can still receive free rooms in the Riesenberg for all winter terms. Christmas and Silvesters.
Our pages are often visited.
People go to the offers, set the prices, but there are fears of ordering binding.
And when they call us, they immediately ask whether our views will be on the snow or "Match", the operators of the information sport Spindl Info, Martin Jandura, will be held.
Who wants the Silvester residence in the spindel snake exactly according to his ideas, it should not be shocked with the order.
Who prefers the spring and where the quality of the stay is only the second place, he can try to wait for a few days.
The Spindel-Mahle hotel owner offers the silver day only week-day stays.
I think they're going to try to sell them for a while, but then they're also supposed to be shown, and they're coming in shorter times.
And then the free rooms will swim, Jandura estimated.
Free beds at all winter terms always offer the travel office in Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now, most of us are interested in Christmas nights that are not yet sold.
In our offer, about half of the place is still free.
Therefore, we have already prepared some more pricely Christmas staying for the last moment, the director of the travel office in Ingtours, Petr Schiffert.
The Silvesterday in Riesenberg can also offer the Frchlabi travel office, but there are less free places here.
Good paragraphs also find the first fourty days in February, the remaining winter terms are sold averagely.
In this year, the interest in winter housing is also negatively affected by the fact that there is no snake in skins.
People's waiting for snee.
No one wants to pass the year end into the mountains without darkness.
If the kids are disappeared within a week, the Christmas will also be sold, I mean, Schefert.
Currently rounded and something better than last year it is possible to use the hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snesskou.
We're about five percent better than in the previous year.
On Thursday and Christmas, we only have some free rooms.
There is a great interest in the Poland holidays in Janua, and in February the business will go well, informed the director of the best Pec Hotel, Karel Rada.
At 80% of the Silvester residences, the Hotel Omnia is also located at the Central Park in Janske Lazne.
Nevertheless, at Christmas in the latest hotel in Janske Lazne, the half of the beds is free.
We were surprising in this year of January, for which we have already been some 60% at time.
A little weaker in February, but at the moment when the snow comes, the interest of staying in the Riesen garden also increased, the director of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
At a larger neighborhood, the Riesenberg Hotel owners were waiting in this way.
On Thursday, it should be coaled and if it comes to snakes, it should be on the mountains snee.
But then Jiri Jakubsky was going to get a warmth again from the location of the Czech Water Office in Hradec Kingove.
U.S.: Repeat is Mother of the Claudia
It's almost funny with which educational work Barack Obama, the President, with his call of the flight, repeats the strategy of his stakeholders in the Afghan Frage of Afghan, which he himself held for the worst.
When he finally waited for his sixth Afganistan doctrin, it showed that he decreed the copy paper from the Bush-Irak scenario three years ago.
Not only that he uses the speech type "come in Iraq" in the text itself, even the name of the Bush declaration of January 2007, as the name of his own declaration: "New Previous way" to be used without smiling.
He himself has sent the Bush-Idee - fresh troop continent in Iraq, which has been set up by the civil war, three years ago, criticized as "unresponsive and in their follow-up Karastrophic decision".
The following months, however, showed that the only possible and very successful Bush strategy of military recommendations was that today there were no longer talks about Iraq.
The call Bush was not improved by this, because objectively he left his followers a much more grateful starting situation as it was expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will repeat.
In order to raise the troop continent, he again requested the militarys, especially the Supreme Commander of the Afghan Operation General Stanley McCristal, which even the subordination habits criticized the solar shoes in the White House.
He requested 40,000 soldiers to change the situation to improve.
The President slaughtered three months, but not a better idea, and so he has affected the General for 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe he pressed the submission for more 5,000, even if he originally calculated at least 10,000.
The highest problem at the entire Obama strategy is its projects to delay the armies from Afghan in 18 months, and to end this process within three years. The whole Obama doctrin gives more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the half-up will bring the same effect as the measures in Iraq.
In spite of the last few years, the Iraqi community has been relatively well structured, and its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation has been expressed by the contradiction - no one can be left and will not hold agreements.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces that are habitat to change their opinion every day.
The political institutions, even if they are formally founded correctly, remain only grain buildings behind which the patriarchal seed relations will continue to be shocked.
The coherence between the various ethnic groups is indefinitely complex, especially because of the incertitude of the relationships that continue to be complicated by Pakistan and Iran.
It is also very unrealistic to build a "trainable State", which is the minimumist goal of the entire operation.
Time Horisont of Obama Strategie Trained by its voluntaryism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghan has only been degraded and now it is on the border of the explosion.
That is why they believe that the small soldiers who have been broken in the war about the "Frehheimkehr" are a wonder here can only create a real romantic soul that can not be impressed by facts.
From the political view, the date set for the armed departure is purely inresponsive because the Taliban will take it as the indirect sense of the American rule.
The last NATO meeting showed that the voluntary of the European people to participate in the fights in Afghan is in neighborhood.
Europe's politicians can and do not want to explain their elections how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Indian Foreign country.
Another possible factor that can affect the situation is the development of the events in Iran.
If the situation continues to disappear, and the increased sanctions on Iran are not affected, the United States will have a very serious question whether the problem is not resolved with armies.
This question must be answered during the period in which America goes to Obama for the departure from Afghan.
But every solution is also a dramatic change in the Afghan situation.
The only conspicuous pool for Barack Obama is the fact that it remains to the presidential election for three years, and therefore remains enough to take it to another strategy if it would be a total deceptive.
The Manager of the Goldman Sachs Do not receive premiumboni anymore in bar
The leading leadership forces of the American Goldman Sachs bank in this year do not receive preliemenboni anymore in bar.
This has announced the company that reacts to the deep criticism of their reward practices.
A group of 30 picsmanagers is obtained instead of the money share that can only be sold in five years.
Furthermore, the shares may be deleted by the managers in the case when they are excessively risking.
Goldman Sachs, according to the Agent Reuters, is the piece of efforts to connect the prime Boni of Wall Street with a long-term performance.
I believe the Wall Street is conscious of the continuing direction in which she had to go, the former bankers of the JPMorgan society, Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in detail, he complemented.
Goldman Sachs became the goal of the criticism after she had paid nearly $17 billion for the first three quarters of this year.
The total height of the premenboni in the past of this year will probably exceed the current measure of $20 billion after the Agency Reuters.
The high premiumboni in the bank sector has become the highest political theme at the beginning of the financial crisis in a number of countries.
In the afternoon, the United Kingdom reported that it was intended to spend the boni of the bankers who exceed 25,5 pounds once with a tax of 50 percent.
Similar steps are also prepared for France.
In this year, women gained nobel prices in all specialities, except in physical.
Five recreational girls today have been in Stockholm from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI. Guests of this year's nobel prices in the special categories and literature.
Besides the four scientists, there were also Romanian writers, Herta M√ºller.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine has received two American biologists, Elizabeth Delta and Carol Greider, together with their Landsmann Jack Szostak for research in Chromoson.
The price for chemistry has received the Israeli Ada Jonath together with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishan and Thomas Steitz for the declaration of the Ribosom structure and function.
The last Laureatin resigned the Nobel Price for Economy, which received the American Elinor Ostrom and her countrymen Williamson for the analysis of the economic report.
The only special category in which no woman received a nobel price in this year was physical.
This price has been made today by the Scientist Charles Kao for research in the glass Fassern Area and George Smith, together with Willard Boyl for the CCD cipher, which is the basis of all digital gams, fax devices or astronomic television.
Each of these prices has the diploma to receive the Nobel Medal and certificate on the purchase of the currency price.
It belongs to ten million Swedish chrones in each category.
If there are several prices in each category, the money price will be divided under it.
Traditionally, the American President, Barak Obama, has received the most expected peace nobel price in Oslo today.
He has recognized in his words the contrary of his name because he is just at the beginning of his way, and also stands on the pit of the country that leads two wars in Iraq and Afghan.
However, in respect of his policy, he added that wars are needed in certain situations to combat world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota wants to return. Klaus invited him to the Burg.
President Vaclav Klaus welcomes the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, who thinks of his remaining in the Government, since he has not agreed with the implementation of the State budget for the next year in the form of which it was released by the Mediterranean Assembly at midnight.
It will be accepted that the budget and may also be the remaining of Janota in the cabinet will be the subjects of the freeday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the state deficit is too high, and the crisis of public finances continues to be strengthened.
On the meeting, the President informed Radim Ochvat.
About his other rests in his function Janota wants to negotiate on Monday with the Premier Jan Fisher.
After the budget, which is now subscribed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should have a deficit of 163 billion chronics.
However, on mid-day, the Link Party proposals on monetary reimbursement were agreed in Parliament and the money for state officials, increases the maintenance of social services and agricultural direct solutions.
The Government has stopped the proposals of social democracy to increase the budget deficit.
Among the left party on the one side and the Government, the Klaus and the law party, on the other hand, was a huge internal political strict, as the questionnaire of the further work of the fishermen officer, at which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party held in spring.
Criticalists pointed out that the budget, as adopted by the Parliament, was practically liquidated the package of spar measures which were implemented by the fishery government, and that, after their understanding, the State debt should be completed.
Claus, who is able to sign the State Budget Act, but must not have, today, at the debate with the employees, has denied the "excellent problem", the "insufficient deficit" of public finances for a long time.
His view is that there is no good solution today.
A improvement could only bring a strong government to build a greater consensus of the political parties.
The ODS President, Mirac Topolanek, pointed out that the budget is green, and the Government should decrease its existence.
The ODS Chairman, Peter Necas, said to the CTK that the concept of the officer's chabinet is apparently not working anymore with support for the CSSD, ODS and Green Party.
First fishermen mentioned similar words in the editor as "star expression".
The CSSD Chief Jiri Paroubek reacted to the topolanek level that the statedeficit was greenly that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year and over 200 billion chronics.
The CSSD estimated the approval of the State budget for the next year as success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans pointed out that the new Hollywood film "Invitus: The Unlawful" of the world shows much of the country, from which the fight and wins, despite some critics, the main role of a American player was placed.
The story tells us about sports, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The unsuccessful fighter against the racist apartance system in South Africa and its first black President Nelson Mandela, who is in his life history of the American Oscar students, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was requested by the twenty-year-old Mandela if he could present him in Eastwood film.
Another important role is Matt Damon.
I said to him, "When I'll play you, I have to meet you.
The twenty-year-old players who had received the price of his role in Eastwood Drama from the box "million dollars baby" already represented the leaders of the movement of the slavery, from which to the conclusion of the slave holder, a fixed US Chairman, as well as God in "Evan All Power", but only rare people who lived and for many people is so important as Mandela.
The former South African State man was in prison for its active activity in the end of the Apartment in the South African Republic for 27 years.
He was set free foot in 1990 and became President of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was exhibited with the Nobel price.
"Invitus" is the Latin word for "none" and at the same time it is the name of a mention of the English author William Ernest Henley, issued in 1875.
The request was how to talk to him.
The movie has a real depth, and Nelson Mandela has his forces with the capital of South African Rugbyteam, Francois Pienar, together with some of the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people still have been racial and economically shared.
He believes that he can make his people a few through the sport, so he decides to make some of the Rugby players, who are part of the world's foreigners.
Finally, the South African team grows to the World Cook of 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to bring Mandela's stories to the cinema inmigration.
He had no other goal to play this role so to approach this as closely as possible to reality, Freeman said.
The greatest challenge was self-conscious to speak as he.
The player said if he and the world politicians would be in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela, to eat with him at night and to be behind the cults.
The most important thing for him was to protect Mandela's hand.
I found that when I protect your hand, I'll overcome your energy, she's transferred, and I felt that I know what you're feeling, he said.
It's important for me to become another person.
Matt Damon represents the movie Fran√ßois Pienar, the captain of the national rugbyteam, where the white players were overwhelming.
The player said he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard rugby world.
It was a great surprise for him when he met a pioneer for the first time in his house.
I remember, when I cling to the Turkey that he opened and the first thing I told to Fran√ßois Pienar in my life was: "I see the film much greater."
Despite the apparent differences in the statue of the players in comparison with their real illustrators, he has received positive reviews under the leader of Eastwood "Invitus: Uncomfortable" and is also speaking of perspectives on a oscar.
The film criticist of the Blatte Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, put his review together in the following words: "This was very good story, very good executed film."
In film reviews on the web site rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent of positive reviews.
Light secret resolved by Norwegia: Russians have tested a rat
On Norway, a special light effect was to be observed as unknown origin.
The Russian Defence Minister has just established yesterday that, along the Norwegian borders, an inter-continental ballist rats was tested.
But the start was not successful, and the rats called "Bulava" that originally should be the pride of the Russian army will be slowly to the Alpspace of Russian Generality and the Prime, Vladimir Putin.
He also had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava has never been started or has been damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers you're already written about "Bulava" as about a "rat that doesn't fly".
A rat that doesn't fly, but light
This is the 13th trial, please at the normal beginning.
First, at the end of the flight, technical damages have occurred again on the rat.
The engine probably explosed in the third rake stage.
This time, "Bulava" started from the Atom-U-Boot Dmitri Donski, which went under the water of the white sea.
This rake type allows the exit from the U ship.
Therefore it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an uncertainly flight object was actually the damaged "bulava".
In addition, Norwegians have not doubted since the first time that it is a Russian rake.
However, the generality has maintained itself this time and said that it is not clearly possible to speak about a misconduct.
The first two stages of the rats did not fall out and from the accident was only the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged at the first stage.
Even if no test start was carried out without error, the defence defence ministerial leadership is only six of thirty of three to ten.
The success of almost fifty percentage of success is fulfilled by the generality with optimism and is continued to say that the "bolava" will run once without problems and even to ten hyper-scale atoms with a total weight of 1,15 tons.
The Legendary Fetisov has signed an annual agreement with the CSKA Moscow with 51 years of age
Legendary player Vjaceslav Fetisov has 51 years old in a professional eishockey game.
The former world master, Olympiaseger and Stanley Cup - Inhaber helps his team CSKA Moscow in the emergence, and probably already joins the KHL on Petersburg.
Fetisov, who completed his career with 40 years, in 1998, is the President of the CSKA at the time.
After Denis Kulkja has been blessed, we urgently need another player.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed that he will be supported by the team.
We just need to clarify some remaining features, quoted the AP the coach of the Moscow club of Sergej Nemcinov.
In the meantime, it is not clear whether the competitor of the famous Eishockey player is only a game.
I mean, fetisov is one of the ones that can raise the moral of other players has led to Nemcinov.
When Fetisov returns to the iron surface, he will be the oldest Russian professional eishockey game after AP.
In the NHL, the Legendary Stormer Gordoe Howes had a whole season for Hartford and was able to write 15 parts and 26 assistants.

Hyundai followed the workshops. All overtimes are deleted
The business management of the Nosovice automobile manufacturing Hyundai agreed with the workshop on the delay of all overtimes.
Because of the frequent overtimes, the workshop has announced the strike preparation at Monday.
This confirmed the speaker of the car manufacturer Hyundai, Petr Vanek.
However, the management of business will still take place with the employees in this week.
We should not describe our production plan, which is a principle, which has therefore been proposed voluntary overtimes on Saturday 19 December for the reason that two workshops would be worked, said Vanek.
The Sedmicka.cz website wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK workers that would work on Saturday.
The employees are also obtained in the afternoon for the Saturday Summit of 28 November.
Vanek decided to change the type of motivation of employees for the proposed overtimes.
Or they may pay the overtime charge or may take a substitute permit on 28 December and thus extend the Christmas feast, Vanek led to.
Furthermore, all workers of the Saturday Summit are paid the bicycle and breakfast.
In view of the fact that the overwhelming times of the most slowest and slowest points regarding the demands and complaints of workers who had established the production last week, the business carried out last day with immediate effects on the delay of all the remaining hours for the month of December.
The employees of the car manufacturer had been obliged to work almost every day after eight hours after more than 2 hours.
Under the signing of the Agreement, the strike preparation shall be reacted to the workshops.
Additional negotiations between the management of the car manufacture and the employees should be held on Friday.
In the midday, Petr Kuchar said that if they can sign some of the requests and a common document, they are willing to resume the strike preparation.
The situation in the car manufacture has been adjusted last week, at midnight, as about 400 employees spontaneously stricted for permanent overtimes.
They protested also against the bad payment conditions and skins.
However, the business management was deemed that the employees had to make the remaining hours to comply with the car delivery requirements.
The workshops also requested that the employees who had interrupted the production during the midday afternoon were not sanctions.
In the field of overtimes, workshops call for a minimum degree of over-time work.
Furthermore, in this year, they are requested to pay the payment of 5000 krones.
The Nosovice Car manufacture Hyundai is now employed by 2000 people.
The production of series was started in the company in November last year.
To this September, about 80,000 vehicles were produced here, which are currently manufacturing capacity for 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czechic discovery: a substance that also affects HIV virus
The team of Tschechian and German scientists tests new connections to link HIV virus to the expansion of organisms.
The main advantage of improved substance is that it also acts with the virus that are already resistant to medicines.
This decreases the fact that the connection to common viral reviewers does not act as strong as one of the medicinal products already existing.
AIDS can not yet be healed.
Patients may, however, extend life and prevent HIV-virals in the body.
Its adoption is accompanied by a whole range of side effects.
Incomplete underpression of the virus reducing has also resulted in the development of intense viruses to which no medicines are more effective.
The work of experts from three Academy Institutes of Sciences CR, Prague by the VSCHT (Chechische-technological High School) and the university in Heidelberg opens the way you can interact with the Virus resistance.
They have demonstrated that the substances mentioned as metalocarborone affected the iron substance responsible for HIV virus.
The metalocarbons are connections of Bor, water, carbon and cobalt.
These connections block the virus environment in different ways than all the medicines currently used, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, scientists have been prepared on new improved connections prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the Moleculum Armaechanism of their responsibilities to the virus.
Metalocarborons have a unique threedimensional structure: two different coffees that consist of bore, hydrocarbon and carbon atoms and are connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Home Tuck and Persistent Virus
HIV protease is an ironic substance of HIV-virus that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV protease virus disruption caused by HIV, it would not be a ripped virus part of infection.
When we disable HIV protease, we also deduce the increase in the virus in the body of the patient, the scientists explain the press report issued by the Institute for Organic Chemistry and Biochemia of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the Scientific Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe all the several connections in which two couples of coffee (see table) are connected by a short organic chat that then will be systematically changed.
something weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was tested in the reagen cell, including against their continuous (resistance) variables that were obtained by HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metalocarboron on the usual enzym variant is not so strong as in clinically used medicinal products, but it does not lose its effect on the force variables that are often unefficate.
The unique effect mechanism and its other properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low integrity and the possibility of further chemical accumulations, makes the metalocarbons interesting connections to further development of effective medicines against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, director of the Institute for Structural Biology of Organic Chemistry and Biochemia and the Institute for Molekular Genetics of the Academia of Sciences.
For the budget, ODS went to fishermen who wise
The President of the ODS, Miek Topolanek, called the approved budget for the next year as "green" and the Government of the Premier of Jan Fisher should submit its opinion according to its further existence.
The opinion of the ODS was called the President of the Minister.
It may be time for the analysis.
The Deputy ODS President, Peter Necas, said that the concept of the officer's chabinet, which supports the CSSD, ODS and green party, is obviously not more functioning.
According to Necas, the President must decide whether he intends to support the minority in Parliament if it is the fight against the increased deficit, or whether it is about his stay in the office with Parliament's links.
The incidence of the ODS and social democracy to the problem of public deficit is decreased by diameter, and it has noted Necas.
The Parliament adopted the Budget for the 2010 year midnight, but with Link Party change proposals over more than 12 billion chronics.
Parliament has increased the money for state officers, the maintenance of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government has thus maintained the proposals of social democracy to increase the budget deficit.
Czechlands should have a decrease of 163 billion chrones.
The ODS has left the room before the vote, so it is accepted to the government's desire, as the amended budget is only a less different of the budget provisory.
Introduction and senselessness
The Financial Minister, Eduard Janota, talked about his detriment and a sense of senselessness, whereas Primer Jan Fisher stated that the government still judges the current situation.
Necas has been convinced that if Janota was seriously threatened for the case, the amendment proposals would appear to be different.
According to the Czech TV, Janota was registered after the government's business in the first place.
So he said he was talking about his remaining in the office.
That is why it is his concern on the performance of the budget.
As fishermen are expressed for further fighting with the budget deficit so that, according to Necas, the Social Democracy Nominators (CSSD), who had implemented the changes in the budget, do nothing in the Government.
The first should also say that it will be returned if the Parliament continues to adopt deficit-related laws, for example those relating to hospital payments and pensions, or the new service law.
Topolanek: The minister appointed by ODS did not ruin
This is the first fishermen and the whole government.
The ODS ministers have not made a mistake, Topolanek highlighted in a text report from the United States.
It has noted that in some delegated ministers, people who are acknowledged to TOP 09, who were opposed to the budget.
Necas stressed that, if fishermen decided to reject the fight against the deficit deficit of public finances, "is it completely logically and correctly that he is based on the link mercy that is now in Parliament".
Then he cannot accept the support and tolerance of the citizens of democracy.
I didn't think about this, and if this is now, then I will take care of it, the Defence Minister Martin Bartak said the journalists in Parliament.
First fishermen went to Brussels afternoon at the European Council's meeting.
The ODS came back to the desire of the First
On the same occasion, Necas stressed that the ODS probably would vote on the amended budget in Parliament on the mid-day afternoon, if the Prime Minister would expressly ask the citizens' democracy to allow them to accept the budget.
We do not think that we are not small children, so he reacted to the question of the ODS in the political negotiation on the budget by absence of the participatory in the Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn't notice that my voice would miss.
Soon as I rejected the mandate, I knew that in the next months, in particular, it would go all positively, the topolianek itself reacted.
After the new driving plan of the CD (Tchechian rail rail) we shall take less trails for almost the same driving price.
The Czech Railway ends or restricts some less loaded speed and local trains from 13 December, however other connections are strengthened.
The total amount of transport is calculated from the validity date of the new driving scheme compared to today by two percent.
The most rates incl. base and customers are not changed.
several connection opportunities in the capital city are obtained, for example, by the inhabitants of the Ostrava area, which is placed on the railways for this route of the Pendolino type.
The speed is not going to Bratislava (Pressburg).
A few speed trails are also walking on the route Prague - Pisek - Budweis, basically reduced the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad.
The largest reduction plants the rail trains in the area of Hradec Kingove, totally around eight percent, at an increase in the plate and the environment.
Both night journeys will also be highlighted on the Track Prague - Tabor - Budweis and some days in the week will be reduced by the operation of some speed trails on the Track Prague - Pisek - Budweis.
The introduction of the new direct road from Milovice to Prague is the largest change, and the populations of Milovice in Lysa nad Labem must now grow.
It is the fifty-fifth movement route of the pre-spot system Esko, which is open by the electricity of Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The tele lines in the capital city will be finished in the target station Prague - Headquarters.
The CD introduces more connection lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the routes to Sumperk/Jesenik will be walking at two hours.

This year account for regional trains: increased by 200 million
The rapid routes are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, in total, the rail trains are covered to compensate the so-called liquidity loss in the next year four billion chrones, as in this year. The local routes are able to pay the burdens, they totally pay for it in the next year eight billion chrones, where the State switchs three billion.
In this year, the regional routes are 200 million Czechic chronics.
A ten-year contract for local routes and speed routes has been refined until now the contract has been completed only for one year.
The rail rail is the system, perhaps not to increase prices in the major majority of trains.
Changes are only available for adjusted network drives CD Net and eLiska favorite internet vessels.
For passengers without the customer card the CD price is increased from 450 krones to 600 krones.
The price eLiska will then be declined from the stage, until now he was for the travel between favorite district cities uniformly and costed 160 krones.

Million years today, in the south of the Philippians 75 people, including some of their basic teachers and their teachers.
This has indicated the AFP, which originally informed only over 65 exits.
All 17 guarded children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
To the exhibition, it came to the South Agusan Province.
About 19 billion years ago, the shoes were used as a living slaughter in the fleet before the police.
The local negotiations leaders are now striving to develop the rest of the crowd.

The history of South Africa relates to everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods comes in the American Kinos "Invitus: the Unlawful", which includes a part of the life history of the former President of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world's famous fighters against the Apartment has received Morgan Freeman, who has been elected by Mandela itself a few years ago.
The counterparty role of the Legendary South African Championships in Rugby, Francois Pienar, has received Matt Damon.
The cinema launch of the film is also called critics and publicity reactions.
Direct pressure on that. It's okay, it's okay. Let me see it.
He was named Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on July 18, 1918, in South African Mvez.
In 1988 he received the Sachar price, and then the Clerk and the Clerk are the nobel price.
The Presidents of the Republic of South Africa were elected in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are set in the film because it comes in a time in China, in which the preparations for the World Meeting are culminated in South Africa, but at the same time the media will cause world publicity with concerning news about the increased race hash and the discrimination of the inhabitants to be the black majority.
According to the News Agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa first are positive, although many preserves against the introduction of the main roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is yet proud of his own words on the new movie.
From this role I have been smiling for many years, and I have prepared it well.
A number of times, I met Nelson Mandela personally, so that, as you say, I could receive his energy, he took up the film premier in Los Angeles at the interview.
I think it's good if we can curse with this film to Mandela's personality and his message.
This is a history of South Africa, but it concerns every man, he added.
In Dr. Rugby Nationalal Teams
The film is based on the book model of the British writer John Carlin, which is freely translated in the role of the enemy ÃÅ: Nelson Mandela and the game which has joined the people, portraits the South African defenders of human rights within his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman is trying to join two groups of differently limited populations in the course of the film, and as Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also participates in his role in the South African National Rugbydress on the world coffee at the time of South Africa.
For the involvement of the race in the Dress, which is almost like a holy act in South Africa, Mandela had great ovations fourteen years ago, over all of the white public, and thus won the recognition of the white people.
The Rugbymeistership may be able to join the people again to a single people, leading to the Rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "shirt" in the National Team in 1995.
Whether the swimming situation in South Africa improves that will only be shown.
The white South Africans, however, are skeptic, such as in recent interviews for the Rugby-Fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to Britain.
The Mastership began on 11 June 2010.
In the Louny area, transformors burn for more than 10 million chrones
The burning took place in the Louny area on the morning at the Cep Society's transformer in the shield position at the Vyskov community.
During the fire, Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, took six units in accordance with the speaker of the district fire fight.
Originally, the fire wear wanted to break the transformers, but later she changed the view and now the fire will be removed with a mixed water and special solution.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer interface.
No one was injured, the havarie was threatened in accordance with the company speaker, Pavla Mandatova, the security operation of the management system.
The damage was estimated to several 10 million crons, and the damage will be more accurate than after burning.
The destroyed transformer must be replaced according to Mandatova by a new.
For over 10 years, Ceps society has not been similar, this kind of error is rare and complemented.
The electricity supply was not interrupted in accordance with the speaker of the CEZ Society for North Boomen, Sona Holingerova, and the operationality of households, authorities and companies was not influenced.
A.G. Ceps is operating only in the Czech area as a driver of the system, the electronic guidelines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renews, and develop 39 scaled platforms with 67 transformors, with electric energy to distribution systems and driving lines with a length of 4339 km.
Janzura has been sentenced to three leaders of the CSSD.
The owner of the University Agency, Radim Jancura, today, has been sentenced to three social-democratic leaders.
Radko Martinek from the pardubice district and the head of the district Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Janzura said that in a twenty-minute inteview in the radio journal.
The complaint is together with the efforts of the company to operate the regional movement in certain areas.
However, all regions have finally signed the long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three leaders attack us and say that we're taking the roses, so we've just submitted the offer about how it was agreed with them.
They stated that we are more cost than the Czechran rail, because we would know the prices of the Czechran rail trains that were closed last week.
So there's nothing else left to wear.
Because of this disruption of the University Agency, Janzura said to the radio journal.
At the same time, he pointed out that he had proved to have taken its steps in accordance with the European law.
We therefore make a complaint for the European Commission.
Hasek holds the raising of the punishment for further continuing the medial show of Jancura, which serves as a free advertising for his society as well as for his own person.
I‚Äôm certainly ready to defend my good name and the good call of my district, and I also ask for another leader.
I believe that this matter will also be clear that it is Jancura, who manipulated the public and used false and unreserved arguments in the case of regional intracommunautaire transport.
Janzura reported last week that he had invested several million chrones in the advertising that will be shown on the second step of the survey.
The radiojournal he said he's going to submit the campaign to Christmas, and he wants to continue after a new year.
He expressed that he would lead the campaign to corruption as such.
The campaign has led to Jancura after the operations of the regional rail transport with the Czechran rail rail stations and there were no records for the task of an updating up to 150 billion krones.
According to Vancura, this behaviour is legally and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of the road traffic in the area, Janzura said that it was already a deputy of the CSSD.
The only threat was if we didn't refuse to lose bus license.
He was a deputy of the CSSD, I know who it is, who I don't tell his name, said today Janzura to the radio journal.
Infringement against Pneumococks free and voluntary
Inflation against pneumococks changes the habitat from January.
She should be the first for the families free and voluntary.
But now votes are that the obligation to receive would be more effective.
culmine preparations for the introduction of free infringement against pneumococks.
The Arznee Initial Institute already sets the maximum prices of vaccines to pay the illness insurances.
The experts are also clear about the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Infringements free for August-Kinder
From January, children can be imprisoned freely against pneumocokes which were born on August 2 and later.
The condition is that they have not been receiving vaccination yet.
Those who have started the vaccination in the last year or previously, have also to pay further recurrence income.
The first dose should be given between 3 and 5 life month of the child.
Shortly ago, a fourth of the families were imposing their children against pneumococks.
The parents paid 1600 crons and more for a dose.
4 doses are required for the vaccination of the recent children.
In all, the experts estimate that the hospital insurance for vaccines is 300,000 to 450,000 krones per year.
But they are shocking in the treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
To now, the State has issued about 500,000 per year for all areas of children.
The obligation was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococks cause medications, but also severe infections, including brain infections and blood infections.
Infections of pneumocokine died in hospitals per year to 28 children age to 10 years of age.
In addition to Czech Republic, the obligation of children against Pneumococks was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will the vaccination be obliged?
At the same time, it is said that this infringement may be a future obligation.
From January it should be voluntary to pay and voluntary by the insurances.
This would be better acceptance, for example, mentioned the Chief of the Burger Association Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky.
His association has been long-term for the Pneumokoke invasion.
The experts at the international conference, in which our association was involved, had not been very satisfied to have voluntary vaccination.
That's not very ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy that it has been successful to perform at least this.
I think that's the way we have to go now, Kalovsky.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the infringement procedure against pneumocokes.
At this moment, we do not really think about this, said his speaker Vlastimil Seen.
The voluntary vaccine has their sides, reported the doctors.
The President of the Special Society of Practical Child Drugs, Hana Cabrnochova, provides that a voluntary vaccination has its parts.
If all children were imprisoned, then you might think about the reduction of the recurrence of "In a situation where the vaccine is so precious, we understand the political decision that this vaccine has been initiated voluntaryly", says Cabrnochova.
The experts expect that more than 80 per cent of the parents will allow their injuries towards Pneumococks from the next year.
The infringement against pneumococks is also detrimental that it is paid as the first area of hospital insurance and not by the State.
Insurances should expend the money for prevention so that they deploy for further treatment, purchase Cabrnochova.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines itself.
However, this is a concern for the practical child physicians relating to the purchase of vaccines.
After the original projects, the vaccines should be purchased by insurances and then the doctors receive them on the same way as other from the State to which they are exported.
Some Members, however, feared that the insurance would be ‚Äúthe money from the hospital insurance.‚Äù
Therefore, the doctors will buy the vaccines itself and have to wait until the insurances pay them.
According to estimates, individual practical doctors must invest 40,000 chrones per month, which is a significant amount.
This will not be easy, says Cabrnochova.
US Artist Son participated in "Musual Dealer Steel"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Fracetta was accused of stealing a shock of $20 million from the museum of his father.
According to the police of Pennsylvania, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was taken on invitation by 90 furnitures in his vehicle.
It was called, Frank Fracetta Junir and another man had used a bag in order to enter the museum in the Pocono Bergen.
The 81-year-old Frank Fracetta Senior is famous for his exhibition of qualities as Conan of the Barbar and Tarzan.
As the news agent Associated Press reported, the artist took place at the time of the incident in Florida.
AP was quoted by an unfamiliar police officer, who said that Frank Fracetta Junior could be motivated by a family error.
The Agency reported that, according to a police declaration, Fracetta Junior stated, he was appointed by his father, "that he should enter into the museum with all means to bring all the places into a place."
The Agency reported that Frank Fracetta was a senior to have a permission.
Labour defends state increases and tax increases
The Ministers have defended tax increases and expenditure reported in the previous report against the criticism of opposition, economy and workshops.
The conservatives said that Alistair Darling would have left an opportunity "overcome" to show that he was seriously referred to with the reduction of the deficit by cutting the decisions to the election.
The Task Force also constituted that it was low and medium-sized income on workers.
In its main proposals, a increase in social insurance is 0.5 per cent and a 1 per cent of the public loan decisions for 2011.
Social insurance
However, the workshops protested that the Niedriglon employees were punished for a recession which they did not cause and warned "problems".
The increase of social insurance - about 3 billion British pounds per year - has increased the private economy, which says that it is a tax on jobs, although the attention should be to the economic recovery.
The increase in those who are limited to more than 20,000 ¬£ per year is related to about 10 million employees.
SERPUNCE OF VORD ETATTERS
Increased social insurance to 0.5% from April 2011
In this year, the growth of the economy is more than 4.75% expected.
New 50% steel on bankier bonuss
1 per cent increased corporate tax for small companies
Taxes for electric vehicles and windturbines
Increased State pensions by 2,5 %
According to estimated estimates, someone with an annual income of 30,000 ¬£ per year will be poor and a person with 40,000 ¬£ per year will be poor to 190 ¬£ per year, while a person with 10,000 ¬£ annual income will be more richer for 110 ¬£.
The Ministers said that their objective of deficit-deficit-related decisions until 2013, but also said that 60% of the taxes of additional taxes would be reduced to 5% of the top drivers.
Minister of Finance Stephen Timms notes that the skisted tax increases and expenditure increases would be compared to the necessary measures "un troops on the warm stone".
"This are large numbers. They will bring us the deficit half and this is also necessary for the next four years," he shared the BBC.
Timms said he was convinced that the economy would return to growth until the end of the year.
Provisions of the Working Party on the future economic growth ‚Äì which affects the extent of new debt and the speed of deficit processing ‚Äì were investigated after the obligation to revise previous numbers.
He said in his opinion that the economy will probably be 4,75 % in this year - more than the decline of 3,5 %, which was predicted in April ‚Äì while the debt of 3 billion ¬£ would be higher than previously.
"Passed chance."
The conservatives, who wanted to start a new public campaign on Thursday to warn the "debt crisis" of Labour, said that the planned debt of 789 billion dollars over the next six years would be untenable.
They added that the Ministers had summoned to present a credible plan how they will return and "cynical" before difficult decisions after the election, the latter of June 2010 must take place.
"They haven't said anything about what they're going to do," the Chief Financial Minister Philip Hammond said. "They had their opportunity to do this, and they've left them out."
"The important announcements will be made only after the choice, whoeverever it wins."
Roger Bootle, Deloite
Labour ensures that schools, hospitals and police are safeguarded before future distortions, other than in the proposals of conservatives which see the deficit coverage more rapidly and better.
But the Liberal Democratics said that the money won by tax increase and expenditure will be used to cover the expenditure for the next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore claim that the plans are "building on sand".
The BBC's political editor, Nick Robinson, said that some at the time of announcements - such as the above inflation adjustment in some invalid in April ‚Äì would exempte the Smart Officer to the project of the vote, since the money could only be recovered in the next year.
Labour is striving to provide extra assistance when people need it as necessary and to re-examine the situation in September 2010.
"Hehler State."
Although the Ministers have not been informed more than 2011, the economists say that the pressure on public expenditure will only be in the mid-term way.
The recognised Tax Research Institute said that the numbers of the stakeholder would mean strong distractions in many areas, possibly in the fields of transport, higher education, science and defence.
"It's just lacking pain in later," said his chief Robert Chote.
"The important advertisements are made only after the choice, whoever has always winned," added Roger Bootle, Economic Adviser to the economic test company.
"This was only the high preab stat report, and the markets recognize it."
The FBI is investigating "Chines of US citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI investigates the arrest of five reported US citizens because of the suspect of extremist connections in Pakistan.
The men were arrested to a house in Sarhoda, in the East Pandschab Province, with the American message in Pakistan of BBC.
The FBI said it will be investigated whether they are the same men who were missed in Virginia, the last month.
The United States Foreign Minister said they also search for information on men.
Three of them should be Pakistanian settlement, one is Egyptian origin, and the other has a gemenical background.
"When they are American citizens, of course, we are very interested in the accused points that are made to them and under which circumstances they will be held," said Spreacher Ian Kelly.
The FBI speaker Katherine Schwi said that the authority was informed about the prisons and was linked to the families of the lost students.
"We work together with the Pakistanian authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay, if they are actually the lost students," she said.
The Pakistanian message in Washington reported that the men were arrested in a house that heard the only one of the students.
He said that the Indigenous police had already interested in the house and that has not yet been engaged in an appeal against the men arrested.
The news agent Reuters reported that it refused to comment on the prisons by the Minister of Foreign Affairs Hillary Clinton, but she said that the United States must "cooperate with Afghan and Pakistan soon to destroy the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students were reported as missing at the end of November by your families in North Virginia.
Amnesty condemns the "mislebbles" in Iran
According to a report of the Human Rights Organization Amnesty International, the human rights in Iran is still as bad as in the past 20 years.
The report is detailed by the regime as well as after the voted presidential election in June.
A man who was sent in the report, admitted that he was shocked and burned with cigarettes, and another said he was threatened by assault.
The Iranite recovered the previous criticism of his human rights balance.
Official offices said that such a criticism is politically motivated.
After the viewed election of President Mahmud Ahmadinedschad, thousands of people were arrested in Iran and killed twenty-five, which led to the largest road protections since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Dutch sentences received and lawyers said at least five people were sentenced to death.
The BBC Teheran Correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the beginning of the Protest of High Leaders, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the misuse statements and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak Strongstate.
But since then the authorities had no more tolerance for criticism, our co-responsibilities said.
"Falche's understanding."
Amnesty International quoted the report of the 26-year-old informative student Abraham Mehtari, who said he was accused of the "work with Facebook networks" and because of the protest against the results of election.
"He shocked me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with smokes under my eyes, in my neck, on the head, and they threatened me with the death and they reduced me."
After five days he subscribed a false consciousness and became, still blunt and half unconscious, left off on the street, shared Amnesty.
The chaired presidency candidate Mehdi Karrubi said that some demonstrates who were arrested after the election were tortured in the prison in August and other murdered.
The Iranian authorities lie the licensing provisions, but they gave them that misfortunes have occurred.
Amnesty also called the case of a former prisoner, who said that he had been held with 75 more than eight weeks in a container in a prison station in Karizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the court authorities had founded a committee that should investigate the distortions after the election and the reactions of the Government, but, so Amnesty, the mandates and the power of these bodies would not be clear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees would not be published.
The group said that in the last three weeks, at least 90 people were arrested to predict further demonstrations.
Skihang was established in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to convert a snake in Bristol to a west point.
The ski point of this park event was 16-professional ski and snowboarder who fighted for money prices.
On the spot of the hamp in Brandon-Hill Park, there was a short swimming song at the beginning of a 100 meter long hang.
The student John Hickman, who studied Medicine in the fourth year, said that there was a beautiful view of the chain of the chain, but it was also very sweet.
It's a great view with all the lighters of the city that lift down.
He added: "There are some of the best ski drivers and snowboarder of the country here - some right talents."
Prices have been paid for the best artists - or tricks carried out on the chain.
After the event on Thursday, the snow will leave the snake.

Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when the Swiss electioners have voted for a ban on the construction of minerals and the concerns about the advanced Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, a American Academic, has written a fonded and pleasant report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of the most declared enterprises of Europe ‚Äì and integrated.
Some readers will read this new book with admiration for the latest work of the author: "Why the French don't Like Headscarves" (2006) read, a elegant and decisive study of a fighting question that shared the country over a half years and worked, and its effects are still understood today.
Bowens' noise book offers a more comprehensive and culinary spectrum.
As a good anthropolog, he wants not only to know what the politicians and the media say about the Islam in France, but also what really happens in the area.
He has passed months in Moscow, schools and institutions, now offering the 5 to 6 million muslims in France, as Bowen calls "Islam Free spaces".
He is a good listener, he gives discussions between teachers and students on the questions which are mostly threatening them.
Should a moslim married in a mosque or a board house (or both)?
Should youth Muslims be taught about evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a nonmusical man?
Is it possible to use a marked bank system to get a hypotheque?
It is likely to be profound, and it is to say that it makes a daily life instead of the political dramas that are employing the media.
The author recognises a new generation of images, teachers and intellectuals, no one with a known name, perhaps except Tarik Ramadan, one of the Arab-Music Academics and Academics born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible to be a good moslim and, on the other hand, a good State citizen in a modern global society.
You don't have any arguments on your side.
The conservatives are mystical towards the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thoughters and activistas the Bowen are mostly unilateral with their salafi pieces ‚Äì the fellow believers of the puristic Sunnitic Islam, which are connected to Saudi Arabians ‚Äì today show a small but influentious presence among the Muslims of Europe.
Bowen is the view that Muslim values and French secularism could be agreed.
But an agreement requires a gift and a take on both sides.
He questions how many French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite, which is so vulnerable to the separation of the church and state) really binding the pluralism.
He states that Muslims may have learned more rare treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, which, on the other hand, had to make their historical compromise with the entire Republicanism.
He preferably recognises a "relief of value rabbits" as a growing pragmaticism.
Can the Islamic Islam be French? After reading this book, you're intended to say "Yes, but not yet."
The most comfortable view of the world
The arctist changes faster and dramatic than any other environmental region on earth.
The egg that they mark, slows with alarming speed and takes life with itself that can survive anywhere different.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have made themselves open water with diplomas, applicants and now authors in their language water.
Richard Ellis, a author and illustrator, signed in "Auf twin iron" (Original title: "On Thin Ice"), a natural history of the northern Icon of the Ice.
When he used in the complex history and policy of the Walking, he describes the long tradition of the arctic researchers who have proved themselves at the jagd on the iron barriers.
Admiral Nelson's engage with a iron barrier as a tapper of 14-year-old filnrich to the sea, which only struggled with his muscles, is certainly a legend, but others are true.

Ellis relates to the reports of other authors and historic authors, and often calls back to the threat that the jagers represent the survival of the species.
Although it is prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, it continues to create in Greece and Canada where the guests in helicopters and motor drivers are used for powerful storm weapons to shoot their shoots.
Ironically, in the waters in the north of these two jagdnations the iron remains the most longest.
In his new book "After the Ice" (Original title "After the Ice") Alun Anderson, an exhibitor of the Scientist "New Scientist", offers a clear and enormous description of the science of the Archites and a packing view of how the future can develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographs can correctly explain the speed of changes.
However, this is not a lack of declaration requests.
The pioneer journeys of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th century, and the beginning of the 20th century gave the confusion of the package for the first time.
The under-sea boats in the cold war are swimming grace in swimming.
A useful complement is satellite measurements and the large range of measons on iron mountains, but it will still be a lot of people that are shocking outside the hill.
Anderson looks into the unique, changing world of the flow system within the arctic iron, which is formed by salt water salts, which are pressed at the heating.
But, starting from the bar on the iron to the microscopical miracles in the iron, all of them are threatened if the summer is forgotten, which is calculated between 2013 and 2050 during the period.
"In a few months... we might be it."
Marine children were among the 6.000 who led the rings in Arlington
The Occupy Free De'Angelo Robinson traveled seven hours with the bus to put a single round on the grace of a soldier whom he had never taken.
For him and the other marine predators who took the journey of Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Friedhof in Arlington to smile, the day was a trick to the men and women whose footsteps were held.
In a few months, where we were always taken back, we could be, Robinson said about the soldiers.
If we were this, I would like someone to do the same for me, so I tried to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered together on Saturday morning to put the crowds on the veterane farms in several sections of the Arlington Friedton Court.
Morrill Worcester, owner of the Trauer Journalist Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded in 1992 this tradition when he and some others decided to decorate several hundreds of plants on the Friedhof in Arlington.
It is now a 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who are traveling these travels every year, keep in different cities along the way to events offered by people to the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also found a common organization, Wreaths Across America, which has also extended the event to other countries.
In this year, more than 16,000 volunteers were on the Arlington Friedhof, in areas at Pentagon, on the Fayetteville National Friedhof in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York, and on the memorandum for the United Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Foundation spended for the second time more than $150,000 for purchase and transport of the rings.
Charleen Hunt, 70 of West Minster, said that she took the journey to Arlington in memory of her husband, a dead professional soldier.
Although her husband isn't engaged in Arlington, Hunt said, it's her way to return something to the victims.
She said this is a small contribution to how we can support our soldiers.
It's like the visit of a family groom.
The volunteers were packed in the hot clothing in the area of warm clothing, and volunteers turned to the extensive race surfaces and hills of the Friedhof.
Volunteers had older farmers from World War I and Vietnam as a goal, as they were not often visited as new farmers, so the eventors.
The smiling was joyful, children played and pairs were in the hand, while they took the fresh shoes to the grey grain stones.
Each round bridge was dark green with a small red clothing confirmed on the top.
The Section 60, which is near and where mostly veteranes of the wars in Iraq and Afghan remained quiet.
The United Service Organizations depended on 1,000 dimensions to cut this section, but the deepest stimulation of the present wars complied with this area.
Ones openly wined, other prayers and families and friends faced themselves in the frightening air.
Some reads prescribed the names in stone, while others were adjusted to small black-spot cards that were shooted for those in the flat smell, whose stones were still not completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who smelled his son's breath.
She's 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the grain station of marine underground officer David Shane Spicer, who went to the battle in July.
Nobody should ever forget why we're free... my son payed for it, said she.
"If I'm not anymore, I want someone to remember him."
Customers of the US government of Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has sell an employee of the US government, the mobile telephones and notebook computers in the country, said the representative of the Foreign Minister on Saturday.
The employee who has not yet been identified is working for development alternatives Inc. with Sitz in Bethesda.
The society works on customer projects such as USAID, the US advisers for international development and the World Bank.
Consular Officers of the United States Interesting Association in Havanna try to get access to the prisoner arrested on 5 December.
The specific accused points have not yet been published, although the Cuban law has been sentenced to a Cuban State citizen or a foreign visitor for almost everything that may be sentenced under the accused of "prosecution".
All so-called contrarevolutional activities, including light protests and critical writings, are a risk of detention.
Government feminine graphics and complaints are considered a serious crime.
Kuba has a growing blogger community, which is identified by the popular reporter Yoani S√°nchez, describes the publishers how they and her husband of government advisors are persecuted and attacked.
S√°nchez has again requested an authorisation to leave the country to reverse prices, but this has always been rejected.
The establishment of an American contractor will probably increase the challenges between the communist government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama government, which had aimed at a "long" approach to improving the relationship with the island.
The message of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times.
The new US policy highlights that the United States will have a counterparty when the Cuban government takes concrete steps into this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition.
Mobiltelephones and notebooks are legal in Kuba, although they are new and employed products in a country where the average service of a government employee has $15 per month.
The Cuban government only allows the purchase of a mobile phone since this year, which will be used for the shipping of text messages, as a 15-minute phone talk would cost a daily salary.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in many hotels and there for foreign visitors and to some government agencies, such as universities.
Cubans who want to join are often to report their name to the Government.
To many websites, access is limited.
In Kuba, the celebration of a American party is rare.
The majority of the few US citizens in Cuba, who are in prison, sits for crimes such as drug smokes after guitars, said, Gloria Berbena, the press officer of the United States interested association in Havanna.
Berbena said she could not provide any further information on the arrest.
The arrest and the arrest are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legally in any other free society - the payment of free mobile phones - is a crime in Kuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the United States Section "Human Rights Watch", who recently produced a hard report on the freedom in Cuba with the title "New Castro, the same Cuba," a resonance on the office of Raul Castro as a leader of the country, which replaced the sister brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the accused would often be arrested, sentenced and arrested within one day.
He said that probably any solution would be politically and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the United States just at the time that both countries move towards dialogue for more.
Pakistani government deck plan to send men to Afghan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities discovered a suitable head of a conspiration which intended to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. Solutions, and said that they hoped that this case could help find an extensive network of terrorist applicants that looked at the Internet after radicalized young men.
Inspectors said she had been looking for an unexpected localist, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he completed it, because one of them had issued a comment on terrorist attacks on the YouTube video.
Safullah was after their arrival in Pakistan, the leaders of these men and tried to help them reach the distant region in Pakistan, which is the home of Al Kaida and his terrorist training station.
But a representative of Pakistan's secret service, who was informed about the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah could not convince the leaders of Al-Kaida that men are not part of a CIA conspiration on the immigration of the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held on days in the Eastern city of Sargodha, far away from the unreasonable mountains in the northeastern west, which became a terrorist refugee.
They were seen as part of a covered operation.
It was therefore rejected, said the government officer who wanted to remain anonym because of the sensibility of the matter.
The government official said that the men were not struggled and continued to get the right recommendations to get access to the Al-Kaida campers when they were arrested by the Pakistani criminal infringement authorities.
The case of the five men - who are still in Pakistan and are asked by the FBI - is underlined the crucial role of the applicants in identifying future terrorists and, perhaps, more importantly, the decision who is trusting.
Since the appeal of 11 September 2001, the US Secret Service has made a higher emergency to undertake human activity posts within Al Kaida.
The applicants of the organization act as a committee who do not leave those whose commitment to the Holy War is not sufficiently serious and such as the spirit.
The American Power Recruits are subject to a special test, said analyticals.
On the basis of their potential access to US targets and their propagan date, they will also be considered attractive for the group.
Evan Kohlmann, the highest analytics of the NEFA Foundation with Sit in the United States, said that terrorist groups have been much more careful in the past few years for their access, since the United States secret services have become experts of their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to cut some in these groups, which better way you could go than to follow the recruitment model, whose many have already been followed, said Kohlmann.
The model is now based more on the Internet.
Ten thousand demonstrators requested in Kopenhagen climate "Action"
Ten thousand demonstrators marked this place on Saturday through the streets and requested the enterprises in the Bella Congress Centre of Climate Commons.
Demonstrates said that 100,000 people had been connected to the event, although the police estimates were more than 25,000.
The event is relatively peaceful, although a handly massive massacred snake in the nearby some of the government buildings in the city.
On a day when few climate negotiations were held by the UNO, thousands of transparent activists with the city "No planet B" and one in Spanish, which explained "The Earth says "Genug".
Some stars concluded to the protest, for example, the Danish model, the photographer Helena Christiansen, who said that the travels to Peru, the birth country of her mother, you are aware of how devastating problems the country has been fighting because of the already devastating impact of climate change.
This is part of the movement reason why I have decided to participate in the great demonstration - to continue and call to the world leader, to bring a right, ambitious and binding agreement, said she.
It is not a light task, but it must now be done and there is no way that leads to it.
The police decided to arrive near to the Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 persons, mainly because they were masked or shocked.
According to the Danish law, these actions are prohibited in demonstrations.
According to a observer who did not want to be called because it is involved in climate negotiations, massive massed demonstrants in black clothing several muscles close to the Copenhagen main channel, where several ministers are located.
They stood them near the building, he said, and added that they started as light races, but then they were followed by "that large explosions".
In the inside of the Congress Centre, people gathered television screens to follow the demonstration throughout the afternoon.
But the Protest has not reached the consciousness of the main officials such as Su Wie, China's Chief Climates.
When he was asked if he thought that the demonstration had an constructive effect on the international consideration, he replied in English: "This is something I didn't know."
Then he went to Mandarin and said, "When the place of event is great, I can't hear what happens outside."
He realized that it would depend on the perspective of the individual whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the concentration of the broad public and various sectors on the subject of climate change, said he.
On the other hand, "I can also say that they destroy the negotiations or freedom of others."
Test data show a hard race club
The witnesses for the mathematics were welcome last week for the public schools in Washington D. C.
Although the Washington district is still far behind the schools of the country to bring maximum performance, the witnesses show that the neighbouring and eighth classs have made progress in the past two years more fast than Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
However, what has been included in the recent numbers of national evaluation of education force (National Assessment of Educational Progress - NAEP), the hard performance cluster between African and white students, both at a local and national level.
The average number of white neighbors from Washington D. C. increased in the last two years of 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), which increased only three points of 209 to 212.
The performance cluster actually increased from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the African eight class remained equal, and he discovered a statistically devastatable point from 245 to 244.
The average number of white students was not included in the data of the test, since the sample size was not enough.
The image over a six-year period is also not encouraged.
The club, which was white and black, 2003, trend when the first NAEP was taken in this district, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the number of points reached by both groups has grown in this stage of time, the difference with now 58 points is low.
Some educational representatives of the district last week expressed their concern that the results of the school officer Michelle A. Rhee and the Democratic Chief Adrian M. Fenty were predicted in most of the white students, as well as children who are already skilled.
This indicates that we have highlighted the overall evaluation through the treatment of those at the top end of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, head member of D.C. Voice, a common group that enters the equality of education in Washington D.C..
I do not pull for a spanne of two or three points, said the Democratic Washington Council member, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth class of the Eaton Grand School.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management system, said that the message of the test points is that the city's media schools need urgent attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs that I respect.
But what I'm afraid is that we do not apply closely the time and energy that we should use for our school.
Rhee said that the district must continue to find better ways to justify the needs of the students' career.
For example, some teachers are understood to use a new lesson plan, the Wilson Learning System, which aims at students in the top class of the primary school and media schools, which have not measured the fundamentalities of the read at the beginning of their schools and which significantly return to their same classrooms.
All-day mathematics, a school plan, which spends from the child garden to the sixth class games and living experiences, were placed under the former headquarter of school inspector Clifford Janey to Washington, and some of the NEP continues reported last week.
I mean, we must continue to work for the best steps to welcome the students under the note level, said Rhee.
Others say that the results of the NAEP highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system, and therefore can continue to provide additional money and resources for the deficiencies of schools that are necessary to reduce the clothing.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, Professor for Education at the University of California in Berkeley, which investigates the urban test results.
The conventional medication is to establish its resources and management reforms on schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C.
The goal could reflect political impacts that work against this important agenda item.
The weakness point is, of course, like other urban school inspectors, that they try to keep the white and black weight.
Our focus is to ensure that we create a great system of schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the cities, so that all families, independently of where they live, may be sure that their children can receive an excellent public education.
Janey, now school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements for the closure of the performance class consists of extending the traditional public school year in Washington at 180 days to competite with the Charter Schools.
You have to increase the school year near to 200 days to have the strength to change, Janey, who came with his teacher work last year to a agreement over 185 days per year, which he considers the "a milestone" on the way to increase the increase in the next treaty.
High school training for more people than future perspectives
The travel bus reached the Gettusburg College with a fascinated fifth.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, grows out and blinds a moment at the view of the white pillars, the stone fascinates and the smaragd green race.
Gracielas parents have not closed the high school in El Salvador.
Until short ago, Graciela was also hidden in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale never placed a foot on a college camps.
Their position and the other eight-classers of the group, where the education costs $38,690 per year, were more than the honourable visitors than the students in the future.
"Yes! I'll be soon here!" he called Graciela, who would like to study medically when the leader announced that they had now involved the building for natural sciences.
"What, really?" she remarked when she was reported the low professor relationship of the school.
The college in Pennsylvania was the 7th, which visited children on their three-day tour and now they have completely included the requested message: The question is not whether you go to the college.
The question is where.
On the other hand, there is a growing concern about the large number of Spanish immigrants who are born in the United States who are not engaged in high school or who are pregnant for adolescents, however, there are hundreds of thousands of whom the college training is required to get up in the middle level.
In truth, one of the five of these "widespread generations" from Spanish Americans depends on the college ‚Äì which is a great performance, since many of their immigrated parents, most of them from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without having completed the high school.
Their success stories are important to say researchers because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the workers of the country.
Those who investigate performance-based children say they often have a natural affiliation for school and an inhabited conduct to their success.
Many of them also have parents who put their children high goals and find ways to compensate their lack of confidence with American schools.
But consultation programmes also play a major role by helping Graciela and millions of children to come to college, especially if these efforts continue to continue over a longer period.
If you consider income weak children whose parents do not have experiences and skills to help them through the path search, then a single measure will not solve the problem at any time, said Patricia G√°ndara, researcher at the University of California in Davids, the Spanish American students.
We need to think about providing a supporting network from the school to the high school for these children.
The federal program, which had financed Gracielas College Tour, is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - a Gang high-scale - and provides more than 300 million dollars per year for local school systems to start college preparation programs that start when income-free students are in the middle school and continue to go until they have completed the high school.
According to the United States Education Department, the program has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, from which more than 60% have been colleagues.
Iraqi Oil Ministry concludes negotiations with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite the concerns of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has enabled greater oil society to rebuild its damaged infrastructure at Saturday.
The 10 agreements with foreign oil companies close to the Iraqi Oil Ministry are prepared to play an important role in renewing the Iraqi oil industry, which has been enabled by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American enterprises could only benefit from two of the 10 increased fields.
Seven American enterprises had paid for the participation to the second auction that began on Friday.
The only company that has issued a order has taken the currency.
Two American enterprises could have been able to conclude the enhanced fields in June.
The reported representatives of the United States oil mortality in the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
After six years of war, the Iraqi has opened its tower and instead of the United States undertakings the way, Ruba Husari, the employer of Iraq Oil Forum, a online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns that were still understood by mass coordinated bombs on Tuesday and the political instability through the disappearing of the United States oil corporations probably have stopped it, so analysts said to get stronger involved in Iraq, which had the third largest world's world's world's world's world's world's world's moral reserves.
In some cases, US companies were notified because competitors, especially Chinese and other Stately controlled energy companies, have significantly lower payment costs and have more risks because they do not need to give accountability to the shareholders.
Exxon-Mobile and Western Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that could conclude contracts with the Ministry.
More US enterprises, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who are closely related to the Iraqi Oil Ministry and standed up with the technical Council in recent years.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main actors at two of this weekend contracts.
The State China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and was able to go home with larger packages to contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the speaker of the oil minister, Assam Jihad, that China is on the way to become one of the greatest world economy and a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can meet its shareholders and comply with its obligations against Iraq.
For the prescribed undertakings, the orders compared to the cost of the Barrel oil, which was prepared to pay the Ministry to increase the escape of each field over the current level.
Top Planner of Al Kaida apparently killed in Pakistan
In a clear US rake attack from the Pakistani border to Afghanistan this week, a top-up plan on Al Kaida should be killed, and reported representatives of the United States terrorism combating on Friday.
This would be, if it would be confirmed, the second murder attack on a high responsibility for the terrorism organization in this early.
Say al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who should be killed according to the U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities in the region by a number of rats who met their vehicle next to the city Miran Shah in the province of North-Waziristan.
National authorities reported that the smokes were disfellowshipped by a drug type used by the CIA in the unlawful stage of Pakistan.
They went to a white vehicle in direction of the Afghan border, when the car was taken, said a member of a Pakistani civilian secret service from Miran Shah per phone.
Local defences that were suspected to belong to the militarys, crossed to the place and quickly took everything else from the "completely destroyed bodys".
The local authorities couldn't confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the US terrorism combated were incerted evidence that Somalia belonged to the dead.
Somalia was described as the leader of Al Kaida's military planners, which led the operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspirations throughout the world, noted a leading official who wanted to remain anonym, and took the heavy character of American air attacks on Pakistani grounds.
If we accept its central role as given, this will also include the planning of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Kaida and implemented them in operational plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second American authorities said that Somalia had been slowly surrounded in the Al-Kaida Heerarchie and had better links to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, said the second officials, but this is no less than the danger he represented for us and our associates.
If his death was confirmed, Somalia would be the second leader of Al Kaida or Taliban who was killed since September when a similar attack was killed by Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a military group in the stage area and three other topactives.
The time of the attacks by the CIA has fallen from a average of six operations per month according to a collection of the Long War Journal, one of the sites supported by a common organization.
The decline can be based on improved tactics of the terrorism groups, which have taken steps to reduce their angry and killed violently in the suspect, reported the page.
Leader of UN Senders to Kabul will be returned
The leader of UNO in Afghan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would be returned from his office in March, with a stormic office, which would be completed by hearings on broad corruption in the Afghan presidential election supported by the United Nations.
The ice turns after the Obama government decided to send more than 30,000 US solid data to Afghanistan.
The United Nations Sendment said he supported the increase in the troops, but he also expressed his concerns that the US Headplan for Military Departure, which was intended to start in 18 months, could allow other NATO governments to defeat their forces.
We need to accelerate the construction of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, Ide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also encouraging the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian helpers to assist Afghanistans in political conversion.
He said that the increase in the military side must be increased on the civil side.
Eyede said he was not insured by his office, but only one agreement on his family in March 2008 to remain in Kabul only two years.
He said he wanted the notification to the UNO.
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now continues to make it time for a replacement.
What I said is that he's better starting to find a follower, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the start of my transactioners and my arrival.
According to UN department, Ban began to search for a replacement.
The UN Deputy said that he had led the Swedish-Italian Staff of Mistura before the United Nations mission in Bagdad and the French Jean-Marie Gu√©henno, who had led before UN peace operations.
The situation in Afghan was tested after his former vice-president, Peter W. Galbraith, sent him in September to predict President Hamid Karzai in the country's election and pronounced massive election.
Hede rejected all charges, but he also said that the accused of Galbraith was slaughtered - "the mission has unfortunately added damage, because it has already been a large measure of skepsis regarding international infringement in the election."
He said he recommended the appointment of a leading civil representative to coordinate the aid measures of the American forces in Afghanistan.
He also stressed that the United Nations leadership allows its followers to set up more staff from the United States and other Western countries that are employed for the Afghan mission, and said that this would strengthen their trust in it that their money would be used correctly.
He expressed his concern about the limitation of his forces in Afghan and said that the overall United Nations settings schemes have undertaken its opportunities to bring people able to do it.
The United Nations rules are so trained that I have been since May, so he said he could set a person.
This is catastrophic, and it must not continue.
US Defence Minister Gates: Iran must receive additional sanctions
Minister of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world forces will soon be "additional sanctions" on Iran because he did not participate in discussions on its nuclear plans.
Gates spoke during a seven-day journey through the war areas in Afghanistan and in Iraq to a group of about 300 US Soldier data in North Iraq and played the perspective of a military race against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran there are no good opportunities to choose, he said, as a response to the question of a soldier to the probability of such development.
" One of the things I'm on the soul is, if we have learned something from Iraq in the past six years, which is the war's inevitableness."
The Obama Government considers a sanction package which aims at the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates announced that some sanctions could also relate to the average Iranians.
He said that a package of positive and negative incentives is necessary, "to convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected with nuclear weapons", because "his people will suffer unnecessary" among the sanctions.
On Friday, in an opinion by the speaker of the White House, Robert Gibbs, the American Government, urged the European Spiritists in warning that Iran must receive a "credible" consequence if it does not comply with its nuclear programme the demands of the UN Security Council and its Atom Monitoring Organization, the International Atomic Energy Authority.
Iran continues to emphasize that the knowledge of nuclear technology should only be winned for peaceful purposes.
In the meeting in Geneva on 1 October, the Irani said that he would restore the discussions on the restriction of his nuclear programme and refusal to a significant part of his stock file to an uranium-related exchange for urgent nuclear fuel for his medical research reactor.
The US government has pressed this type of agreement to build confidence between the two parties and win time for negotiations.
However, since this time, Iran seems to have left the negotiations on the provisional agreement, in part, to say experts, because the Iranian leadership is unnecessary if they should be bound to the United States.
The fact that Iran has simply laid down the international community on some proposals that they had already agreed at the beginning of October, has clearly said that the international Community, including Russians and Chineses, has collected a way in which they never had been connected with important additional sanctions for Iran.
President Obama has set the 31th decade as a time for Iran to respond to these proposals before he continued to follow other options, including the Minister of Foreign Affairs Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "printing sanctions".
In an opinion issued in New York, the Iranian Delegation condemned the United Nations, which they "unfinished and unfunded arrests" of some members of the Security Council to the Iranian Atom activity and said they were willing to continue to continue the meetings with the United States and five other world forces "to achieve a suitable long-term solution".
Gates, who had to return to Washington last Friday, met the Irak Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before he fled to the oil curdic region in Iraq with soldiers in Kirkuk and Kyrdian authorities in Iraq.
The wages between the courts and the Arab majority in Iraq are still high, particularly in respect of borders, property rights and because of the distribution of public revenues.
Gates stripped both sides to shine the potential of conflict to prevent the delay of the US plans to slow the American troop force until the end of August 115,000 to 50,000.
Gates also tried to destroy the curdic concerns about the previous armed disappearance. The U.S. Delegated Gates, who was sent to Masud Barzani, President of the curdious regional government, said: "We will receive your security, your welfare and your autonomie within an unified Iraqi.
We won't leave you."
A course change in older China
Wang Weijia and her husband were rounded by propaganda platetings, who claimed to them that "The mother of the earth is sweet to maintain further children" and "A child more means a grabe."
These lessons have learned so well that as government officials in Shanghai, who began by the low gear rate and the elderly population in this summer, soon began to change the course and encourage young couples to have more than a child, their response was directly and finally: "If no case."
We've already invested all our time and energy in a child.
For a second child, there's nothing else, Wang, 31, a personal leader with a 8-month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the One Child Policy in China, which has produced two generations of notoricly dictic, distracted individuals who are called "picture Caiser" in the country, is a country's crisis.
The average grain rate is at 1,8 children per pair compared to 6 at the time that this policy has been in force, the UNO is able to deal with.
Department for Population Questions, while the number of population groups of 60 years and older in 2020 of 16.7 per cent of the population to 31.1 per cent of the population is expected to increase the global average of about 20 per cent.
The inequivalence is stronger in rich coast cities with a formed population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and elderly were almost 22% of the reported Shanghais, while the birth rate has been placed under a child per pair.
Xie Lingli, Head of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, said that couples in the productionable age of children have to be obtained "to help, the relationship of the older population and the lack of the future."
Shanghai will soon be "as old - but not as rich - like the industrial countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A slowly dispatch
In the Constitution of the country in 1978, China must be the restraint available by the dominant communist party to this day.
Marriages, who are against this policy, must receive a huge currency of money - up to their three-fold annual content in some regions - and with discrimination to their workplace.
Chinese State representatives have stated that the critical invoice of natural resources could have been avoided, whereas human rights infringements condemned in the implementation of the policy.
In rural regions, some of the employees who have already had a child have a duty to get away.
In addition, many couples had allowed sex-selective departures to have resulted in an unanimously high relationship between men and women.
In recent years, government representatives have slowly declined their position towards the One Child Policy.
They have allowed more exceptions of the rules, including urban populations, ethnic minorities and cases where both husband and wife have been single children, and 2007 has been reduced the sound of many hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute for Population Research of the University of Peking, said that the governments even have discussed radical changes, for example, to allow couples of two children in which a single partner is children.
Shanghai was initiated in July to the first Chinese city, a aggressive campaign for the promotion of more gentlemen.
Plakats who taught the families only to have a child were almost replaced by directives that describe detailedly who ask for a second child and how to request the approval.
The city management has sent city officers and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and move information papers under the doors.
It also requests to provide psicological and financial advice for those who have more than a child.
The reaction was not just encouraged, said family planning representatives.
Understanding reaction
Although officers from a small rural town in the foreign areas of Shanghai said that an incentive is to recognise the requests of pairs, which would like a second child after the campaign, but not reporting changes.
With a number of 115,000 people in the municipality, Huanan, as for example, only four to five requests per month.
Shanghai's desperate officials say that the number of people expected for 2010 in the city, despite the campaign, will still be at about 165,000 -- something higher than 2009, but less than 2008.
Feng Juing, Leader of the Family Planning Committee of the Shanghai Community Caolu, said that financial considerations probably are the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to give their first ones the best, said she.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that is also legally permitted.
But they have, as many Chineses, only a low illness and life insurance of the government.
Without a social network, they say that this decision would be inresponsive.
People in the western evaluate the one child policy fairly as human rights question, said Yang, a constructive engineer whose woman is pregnant in the seventh month.
Yes, we're gonna have the opportunity to have more than a child.
But the problem is not simply in a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their teeth.
Wang, the Personal Chief, said she wants only a child because she was also a single child. "We were the center of the family and we lived that everyone was careful about us.
We do not want to care for others and do not really want to do this."
Chen Sheian, a 42-year-old boy who heard a translation company, said it's unbefore.
For parents from the media state with double carriage, by which the grain rates are cut, he said that it turns out to be successful and that is necessary to be selfish.
The 20-39-year age group was to see their parents fighting during the early days of Chinese capitalism, and they wouldn't want to live in no way for themselves, said he.
A single child, he said, puts huge requirements to the time of parents.
One mother must leave her social life at least for two years.
Then there's a room question -- "There's got to build its apartment" -- and the life planning -- "When the child's 9 months old, you've already got a life course for the best schools."
Most of his friends are ready to try this one, said Chen, but not two times.
Our generation is the first who has reached a higher standard of life, he said.
We don't want to bring too many victims.
UNO Group develops Plan for Emission Reducing
The climate conference supported by the UNO -- which until now has been expressed by wild possen and mutual accusions -- has re-established a priority on Friday with the publication of a document, which is a decrease of the greenhouse gas for the next 40 years, while industrializations in the nearby future have to decrease the greatest expenditure.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the rule of greenhouse gas, has shown both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But he has been considered more important progress in a negotiation that is timely, since the next week more than 100 sponsor politicians from all the world in Kopenhagen will be accepted.
The text, which has been formulated by a own UN working group, is the amount of money that rich countries should give to the poor countries so that this short-term and long-term warming can improve the global warming.
It also provides a palette of options for key issues, including industrial and large weak countries, to limit their CO2 emissions and to the higher limit value of the global temperature increase that the political decision-makers would bring.
The process will provide a great flexibility, so John Coequiy, the leader of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has designed the sixth document, has set up a 180 pages of negotiation in order to put it on the central point, which has called the leading UNO climate protection partner Yvo de Boer as "the whole".
It shows the fundamental risk of a possible agreement, in which industrial activities together with their emissions up to 2020 by 25 to 45 per cent, compared to the border values of 1990, while the increased developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent in the same period.
Countless, countries could reduce emissions to 2050 to 50 to 95 per cent.
The European Community has also provided the meetings on Friday by safeguarding the next three years to prepare 3,6 billion US dollars a year to support countries to adapt the impact of the climate change - from the master of overcome and drunk until the prevention of driving.
The Friday, however, took the same burned fireworks that had determined the conversation in the last week.
The American Climate Special Officer Todd Stern rejected formulations that are binding the emissions of motor gas emissions for industrial countries, compared with voluntary reductions for larger levels, calling for, if not to be financed by industrial operations.
This train announced that the Obama government runs a worse line with China as representatives of the Bush government never once two years ago.
The United States will not sign agreements without taking up larger level countries and take steps, so the stars who also claimed that the text was not enough to ensure that the declines could also be confirmed from outside.
Star gave his opinion an hour after the statement of the Chinese Vice-Minister He Yafei, who said that it would not be financially helped by the leading American climate partners or to eat "the conspiration" or to "excellently inresponsive" by him that he said at the beginning of the week that the United States would not be financially helped to manage global warming.
The future economic marking of large world forces is on the game, both within the industry and between industry and weak countries have been broken lines.
The present fight is equal to the salvation of individual economys, as well as the salvation of the planet, while China and the United States defend themselves because of their respective commitments, while the more poorer countries say that the two more influentious countries would ignore the scientific need to take more valuable measures.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the great forces should fight for whom should bring the costs for the burden of the gas gas expense, since even those countries concerned have been overlooked to continue aggressively to the countries with a very high gas deal for their dealings.
This is a very clear game, which will develop a new economic priority, so Ulate, also as regional climate change advisors for Conservation International in Mexico and the Mediterranean.
Some of the countries, which have been the most strongest impact of climate change, agreed that they would continue to fight a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants said that the discussions would be in the best case towards a political agreement.
The alliance of the small islands with 43 members has presented a draft contract on Friday morning early.
Artur Runge-Metzor, who is leading to international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the openness of the small islands "exercises political pressure on the whole political process," partly because they are connected now and call for measures from the weak countries such as China and India.
The discussions are a new urgency when the delegates focused on the fact that most of the open issues should still be declared before the government leaders arrived.
High Representatives, such as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Vice-Minister, discovered their flights and slowed by the gangs of the Bella-Center to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences in order to abandon Claims, which are negotiated during the next week.
The pure scale of the congregation - 13,000 people are in the Congress centre every day and out of a night-releasing  aktivists organized on the countries that are sweet and sell their views, and contract projects will be made on hand instead of e-mail -- is already a challenge.
Intensity is just up: almost all important ministers are here and from midnight will be 60 government leaders in Kopenhagen.
We come to Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President for the Global Policy of the Organization Conservation International.
The weight comes.
Britain first 225 km/h fast train defines the feeling of monday new
On Monday 5: 13, a slightly shock will shoot the darkness to announce a train that represents a revolution in the transport in Britain.
The first high speed drive in the country will be reached at his bridge from Ashfort, Kent, to London to St. Pancras 225 km/h and return 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, then Lady Kelly Holmes will be sent to the border of the first Javelin-Pendler Service from London.
He hopes that the new service of the United Kingdom will finally be connected to a international, more rapid, reliable trails and connected to the largest areas of the Middle East, North and Scotia in London.
The unnecessary province could be living pending cities, the workways would be radially reduced, and the change of aircraft and rail vehicles would reduce the national carbon emissions and the stage on the road.
In the theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billion British pounds that are required for the construction of a new national ski network, which could still be able to swallow the breath in the British high speed.
High Speed 2 (HS2), a company founded in January which the Government will present a guideline study, will be presented by Lord Adonis, according to the Times, on 30 December.
This provides a detailed round card of the next stage planned high speed network.
The new trail line which London is to connect with the West Midlands will lead to a play space of five meters to urban areas and to places where the impacts are surrounded to the environment.
The plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final line.
HS2 also intends to create three options for a high speed network that leads to a larger, northeastern.
Lord Adonis will react in the spring.
The proposed option is a Y-food line where a single high speed line would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would be shared in or near Birmingham and a distance would lead to the west of the Peninsuit to Manchester and Skotland and another in the direction of Northern countries to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle on Tyne.
A single line would lead to Skotland.
"It seems to be the best functioning option," said a rail insider.
After the completion, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would reduce at 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first piece that would not be opened before 2025 would allow travellers to return the London-Birmingham trails in 49 minutes, compared with today something over an hour.
The designs made the way to walk with a speed of 400 km/h and the British Skinne Network would be the fastest European.
The first trail was planned so that 400 meters long trips could be reached with a maximum capacity of 1.100 people.
Up to 18 trains could be operated on the route London-Birmingham per hour.
This would again mean that it would be necessary for a final station in London to be completed at 20,000 travelers per hour.
In view of space restrictions in the capital city, a existing station will be developed to submit the high speed network.
Bahn experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will be informed whether this plan should be continued or not, but the long-term public consultation and planning measures means that a final decision will be taken only after the Parliament's election.
But even when it moves the roots, the switch network must be built in sections.
The journeys should first be changed from the high speed lines to existing swimming trails in the north of Birmingham, which would continue to be over three hours.
This applies as a decisive switch point to ensure a change from the flight to the rail, a direct measure for the shift revolution.
Tax numbers come to hypotheque for 75,000 pounds of a conservative
Alan Duncan, the leader of the Conservatives, has taken into account the tax payer per year for the costs of a parentary, which he reads in his household in his election circle.
The prison speaker of the party who was degraded by David Cameron because he decreased that under-house members had to live "for master ratios" has increased its hypotheke at about 75,000 pounds of pounds to allow a iron wood manufacture to build its second house in Rutland.
He urged the taxpayer to take into account the additional interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The responsibilities of the underhouse have been approved at that time and were not investigated by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a review of the expenditure of the sub-house members. Last night Duncan said that the applications could not be "unless more clean or more comprehensive".
Duncan, one of the richest sub-commercies, has a double house in a village in its election circle Rutland and Melton.
A price of almost a million pounds (1,1 million euros).
The earthquake includes kitchen, housing and exhibition room, but the fees office, a sub-home control station, agreed that Duncan needs more place.
Last year he built a winter garden that is called "Orangerie" in the plans.
Neighbors describe him as a "gloss house for Entertainment".
Duncan was also not requested in a recent study of its previous hypothetical contracts by the Committee on Standards and Privileges to take a position to increased monetary inclusion.
The Committee has released him last month after investigating its expenditure from the breakdown of the rules.
Duncan has brought the safety for a hypotheke over 271.406 pounds (300,000 euros) from his London house to his election quarter, which he had purchased 1991, one year before his election to the Member of Parliament.
This week published documents show that Duncan was refunded to about 1,400 pounds per month as hypothekenzine until March last year.
In April, there were more than 1,800 pounds of euros (2,000 euros) per month.
The interest rate of Duncans RBS-Hypothek has not changed during this time, which closely suggested that the overall increase in the financing of the financing of $75,000 (85,000 euros).
The normal RBS symptoms grew from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, where it is still there.
The latest documents published in the subcommittee show that Duncan continued its right to 1.250 pounds (1.400 euros per month) in May.
In September, Duncan lost his posts as an opposition leader of the undercome, after a undercover reporter filmed him after the expenditure channel said that the member of the parliament would live "more reasons".
"The most important thing is if you work for the State that you have to live from major reasons and how to treat S***e."
He said: "I have issued my money for my gardens, and I have made a lie to a disappearing little part, measuring what is heard.
And I could require the whole sum, but I don't do it."
The Member of Parliament, a Millennium from his previous career as a oil-growing chairman, was the first time in May that he had asked thousands of pounds for his garden before he explained that this could be considered as a "extensive demand".
A activeist was a prostitute in Duncans race a loch in the form of a pound mark, after being known to invited 4.000 pounds to 4.500 euros over three years.
When he was asked last night about the increased hypotheke, Duncan said, "This was approved by the fees office, as well as following from Legg to increase the value."
He added: "There is no debate on the explanations and instruments or a prohibition of the rules or similarities.
Everything is perfectly overviewable and strictly moves within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn't be cleaner and more clear."

The cases of geographic and history are, according to Chatel, strengthened from the school reform of Lyceen.
The National Education Minister Luke Chatel explained in an interview that appeared in the Sunday Journal of the Sunday, that the cases of geography and history are strengthened from the school reform of Lyceen, even if they are not binding in the terminal (12th school year).
"The students of the First School (11 school year) now have all four weeks and the same program", confirms Mr Chatel.
For the Minister, "muss will be surprising this grain," because according to him, "the scientific profile is no longer scientific profile", but a concentration "the best student".
"The economic, social and literary profile (ES and L) must not be a subprofile of the science", he continued to state: "I have not yet heard many historical and intellectuals, which had not been called on the lack of the geographical education in the terminal on technical Lyceen."

They also conduct practices during the year in M2 and then taught a year before the students as a teacher in practice.
He continued to say, "If you all add to the practice offered before the performance test, you reach more than 300 hours that you have passed before the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
Finally, the Minister declared that he wanted to offer the "individual law on education" - a case which does not exist in the public education.
He reaffirmed that he wanted to complete the school card until 2012.
15 minutes for climate at the "Ecole Normal Suerte"
Fifty minutes to speak about the use of the Copenhagen summit: this is the challenge to spend Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change", on Saturday, at the Ecole Normale Suite in the Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As a journalist of the AFP identified, the Nobel Prize Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Earst" conferences in which experts applies to the public at fiveteen minutes with funded contributions.
You want to do something to reach the people and feel more to learn in them, Edouard Hannezo explained, 22 years and one of the organizations today at the border of the conference. The name of this event is back to the name that students have given the fish in the base of the school.
"Besides the experts were selected for the twenty participants, even after their charisma," he expressed.
"In climate warming you can speak long, but the nuclear goals can also be displayed in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, whose only 50 people were free with the help of folie.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he stressed in the hope that the listeners would like to take out that "the Conference of Copenhagen is based on a absolutely serious scientific docter".
The videos rounded by these conferences will be found online from 15 December on the side of the school.

Payment income : Wounded prison warrant, actions planned
Criminal Officers have called on a general day of action on Friday to reach the premiums and overtimes whose payment has been deleted from budget funds until January, prior to Christmas feasts.
The 2. Working of the Criminal Officers ("FO-Penitentiary") requested the employees who had no service to demonstrate and block them at Tuesday tomorrow before the Criminal Officer, to make attention to the "the Stahl of what they are assured".
The 3. Workshop of Criminal Expeditional Officers ("CGT Penitientary") calls for "a strong mobilization in the different prisons" to which the non-payment of the overtimes, night advertisements attacked in October and the sun and holiday events in December will be burned as a "strange and inacceptable market".
The first association of the Criminal Officers, the Federal Strafstall Unit (UFAP/UNSA), called on "general mobilizations (...) to demonstrate the inadequacy and anger".
The Leader of the Criminal Office and the Ministry of Justice declared that the overwhelming hours in 2009 have been significantly increased and not all prescribed in the budget, but they ensure that the remaining requirements are paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice reported on the night, Michele Alliot-Marie has transmitted a letter to the officers of the Criminal Officers, in which it is guaranteed that the payment is performed in the next month.
"I really know the efforts of the staff to maintain and modernize our criminal system", the Minister of Justice shares in this writing.
"I have stated the leadership of the Criminal Office to take immediately action so that a situation that has occurred by lack of assessing the overtimes is not repeated in the future," said Mrs Alliot-Marie.
For this reason, the decrease of December declares the UFAP/UNSA, for which the "budgetary duties" must be maintained.
"This is a absolute skandal," the interregional FO association in Marseille recommends and announces that "all congregations and training" may be typical to new instructions.
"The staff does not work on sun and holidays when the hours from October have not yet been paid in December. This also applies to their overtimes," the FO Rh√¥ne-Alpes-Auvergne threats.
"In a time, when more tasks are made to us, without being set up more staff, the attempt to spend on the staff's money, more than inadequate", says the CGT company of Bordeaux.
As a result, the situation is not equal to all regions, some are less affected than other.
In any case, however, it is unrighteous, observed by the Secretary-General of the UFAP, Jean-Francois Forget.

The Francose Fr√©d√©rick Bousquet, three-face medaille winners at the Middle World Mediterraneans 2009, has received an international title on his loved distance, 50m Free Style, at the Euro-2009 short train in Istanbul.
On the first day of this struggle, at the last time the polyurethane routes were allowed, there were only three world records while they were expected to be a real record flow.
A record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m Lagens and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50m Lagens of the Lords.
Injuries for Bousquet, who wanted to attack after the world record at 50m freestyle, which he holds in the large shock (20.94).

"It can always believe, and in this case, I have said, if the world reset is in my wide range, I will try it."
As Bousquet, almost all the swimming swimming in Polyurethanan trains were prohibited since 1 January 2010.

"I didn't give everything this time.
I knew I couldn't reduce the world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my task."
"Lobintsv will be a serious enemies in the future," Biedermann explained.

A Roman Grab plate that appeared at the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated on Thursday at 1.5 million US Dollar over its value, so the artist of Sotheby's.
This place is two meters long and 63 cm high. She is from the IIIth century after Christ and has always been evaluated by 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The Marmore, in the "treat scenes of Dionyso in a sophisticated architecture, rounded by Satyren and Bacchus images, is a rare part. There are only four or five scenes in the world," explained Florent Heintz, Vice-President for the Proliferation of Roman and Egyptian Antiquities at Sotheby's, on Tuesday to the AFP.
It was sold under hundreds of pieces.
"The seller still sells, but this part is with safety the most of which the buyers have been offered until now," said the speaker of Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy towards the AFP.
The discovery of this purchase of the marble by Emile Zola is far back.
The plate was almost 300 years old in Rome, in the famous collection of the Borghese family, and then she took part for the French shooter C√©cile Sorel, who used in her bathroom for her Paris Hotels, and was at Paul Reynaud, Minister of the IIIth French Republic and President of the Council, before Marshall P√©tain came to the power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
When visiting the database of Louvre, heintz found that this plate was part of a "Erbe of Emile Zola" which was opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of the "Thehese Raquin" and Fresko "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelayas Outdoor Research from Honduras direction Mexico has been cut off
On Thursday, Mexico had the conditions for the transfer of the smooth Honduras President Manuel Zelaya on the homelands as not more agreed after it was rejected by the Putsch government as an inacceptable table.
After a telephone talk on the night with President Zelaya, it seems to be clear that it is only about the possibilities of execution of this transfer, the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, explained Patricia Espinosa.
According to the immigration authority, the aircraft submitted by the Mexican Government was returned to its starting point at Middle-West in Salvador for the purpose of transmission of Mr Zelayas.
The Putsch government wanted to need Mr. Zelaya to "aftake" and to ask for political asylum in the foreign.
However, the slaughtered President rejected this because he wanted to return to Mexico as a fellow and official head of State.
The Putsch regime "it was a renewed misconduct by trying to move me towards my expenses (...), she wanted to thank you", said on Thursday, Mr. Zelaya to Radio Globo, where he has been able to speak to words since the beginning of the political crisis that has already been in the United States for five months.
I can stay here a good and pleased ten years, and I have added my guitar, the smooth President, who had fled to the Brazilian message of Tegucigalpa two months ago.
The Mexican message has made us a request for the delivery, which we, however, could not accept, since it does not include asylum, stated in the midday Oscar Raul Matute, the Internal Minister of the Putsch Government, against the Honduran Radio HRN.
I'm looking for no country about asylum, Manuel Zelaya had answered in an interview with the telescope channel, whose seat is situated in Caracas.
A possible journey from Honduras, so he had understood, would only be chaired as President of the Honduras people.
The routines on a trip Mr. Zelayas were mobilized at midnight by the slaughter of the murdered President, who had taken place to the Brazilian message and had assembled around this, where the military had strengthened its use.
The Brazilian Minister of Exemplar Celso Amorim criticized the position of the Putsch government.
This, as its appreciation, reveals the marginal character of this government in view of international standards.
Zelaya, who was closed to the socialist president Hugo Chavez, was on 28 June, on the day of his organized people's investigation on the preparation of his re-elect, on the Council of the Supreme Court of Justice, the Army and the Congress.
From his exil in Costa Rica, he was surprised to return on September 21 and fled into the Brazilian message.
If he leaves this, he will be arrested because of the Supreme Court which he is accused of the justice, so the Putsch government.
The Putsch President Roberto Micheletti has been able to organize a Presidency election on 29 November to resolve Mr. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was acknowledged by the United States in the course of the surrounded election, but it was rejected by the Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the Kogres had voted massively against Mr. Zelayas back to the office until the end of his mandate on 27 January.

There are good news from various industry, judged Lindsey Piegza by FTN Financial.

According to Peter Cardillo by Avalon partners, investors are particularly fixed on the numbers of American trade balances, "when improves the activity in the fourth quarter."
The trade deficit of the United States has increased by 7.6% in September to $32.9 billion in comparison with September.
The analysts, in contrast, were calculated with a deficit.
The imports and exports have increased.
The great news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in the market export, which reflects the growth of the main trade partners in the United States, so Christopher Cornell commented by the company research Economy.com.
In contrast, unemployment reports in the United States in the last week have increased all expectations and now have reached 474.000 demands.

Kuba: hundreds of partisans in the power of "Damen in Weiss"
Some hundreds of participants who are at the Cuban Power have spent on Thursday the wifes of political prisoners together in Havanna for the purpose of the World Human Rights Studio, and also joined another committee, as a result of a twelve deputy deputy.
For the fourty "Damen in Weiss", the women or the midst of political prisoners, on an open strategy of partisans of the government under Raul Castro, just as they were found at the Fuss March in the Headquarter of the capital to ask the release of political prisoners, a journalist of the AFP confirmed.
Neither with the Yankies!, "South!", "The Strasse belongs to the Revolutionarys!", "It's life Fidel and Raul!" scanning the authorized partys with a faust faust of the dissidents.
The latter were discarded by civies that appeared to "turn their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "Dames in Weiss" was played at the pre-audience in Havanna, which has not come to a detention or to arrests.
However, in the Havanner town, a twelve dissidents, who also attended the Demonstration held on Thursday at the international human rights stage, were immediately arrested by civil police, confirmed a reporter of the AFP.
According to this journalist, the police have engaged in enhancing violence in civil vehicles by the delegations of the Government.
The interim arrest of dissidents under such circumstances is normally limited to a few hours.
The "Damen in Weiss" is a non-accepted routine for the purpose of the "Bite for the liberation of all political prisoners" whose number, according to the Dissidential List, was organized by about 200 persons, declared Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda has a prison penalty for 20 years.
Mr. Maceda is part of the group of Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, from which to the date 53 are settled.
The Cuban authorities accept the regimers as "South" or "Agent" in the service of the declared surgery, the United States.
A rationality is that the Cuban television observed the demonstration events held on Thursday between military pro government combaters and "contra-revolutionary" reports.
The unity party, the Communist Party, is regularly condemned by the European or American NRO to the unlimiting of rights and freedoms, in particular of the freedom of opinion.
Incredibly killing eighth years with the measuring and after 5 lost in Clichy-la-Garene
One of the two messengers weakened snakes killed an eighty-year-old age in the city of Clichy-la-Garene (Hauts-de-Seine) on Friday after afternoon and injured five other people.
According to the first details of the investigation, the 28-year-old anxiety had injured eighth-years in or before a pharmaceutical on the Boulevard Jean-year with two messengers and, accordingly, the police advisory, under the presence of Witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, has resulted in his infringements.
In or before the same pharmaceutical, he had a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, nearly in the triangles, was attacked and was blessed.
The first two victims were sent seriously injured to the hospital, where the 18-year-old man died.
The other blessed is in life, since, according to the police sources, it is obviously affected by living bodies.
The pregnant woman has become bad because of the events and should be hospitalized according to a police source in the "shock condition".
The armed man who seems to be in a police law under an impact on alcohol or drugs should also be encouraging on the street, the same boulevard Jean Jaures.
He had been injured by two other passengers, apparently unexpectedly: a thirty-year-old and a 40-year-old, and the last one of two is difficult.
The scenario remained in the dark night.
He was armed with two meats, which he slaughtered behind the back, declared before Arnaud Presse, a responsible of the syndicate alliance of the skin-de-seine region.
Many passengers, including youths, must have tried to boost the people with the witness reports identified by the AFP.
I saw a guy in the three-shirt with a green West.
Three youths tried to smile.
They didn't make it because the man was well built, Alberto reported a clever of a close bar.
One horse is cut over him, he added, including a city police who cut the handgel in there.
Still on the Boulevard Jean-Jauren, on the height of the house number 61, have two city police, including her employee, tried to establish the armed man and were blessed with shoes, so police information.
The event has been played in one of Clichy-la-Gar√®nes' main attacks where a number of businesses are found.
Passengers have come to me to tell me that there is a tragic person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person on the ground, I put it in the first help and observed a shocked wound in the magic area, said Fr√©d√©ric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmaceutical pharmacist, the AFP.
Five minutes later a second, about three-year-old person has been injured by snippets.
Employment forces of the State Police have indeed arrested the man who had no reports on himself.
The State Authority of Nanterre has carried out the central report of the Criminal Policeivon of the Seine (SDPJ 92).
The sweetheart has been hospitalized on Thursday.
In view of his state, he has not yet been legally entitled.
A police source does not swear that he is sent to a nervenheal.
Without another police source, it was six police officers to employ him at the police commissariat in Clichy where he was taken.
He was "in a state of transgression" as "all spiritually conspirators of this kind, in which the forces are released during the slaughter."
U.S.: Polianski's lawyer requests to reiterate criminal persecution
The lawyer of the French and Polish filmmacher Roman Polanski has requested a repeated request on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, the United States) to leave the criminal persecution against his mandate, which is at the time in his residence in Switzerland because of a post-seventh period of more than 30 years ago before the court.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the Governor of the "Pianist" has scheduled three judges in the second district of California in the negotiation time of 1977.
I call on the place of Strafferlass, Mr. Hummel, before he added that the conduct of the judge Laurence Rittenband "is a cold walks down the back at the time of the negotiation."
He said, the murdered - infantly - the judiciary band, before it was cut up, discussed with a State lawyer who wanted to say that Roman Polanski had paid a widespread house -- which represents a worse procedure error.
This discussion was designed in the documentary film "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and adhered) by the investigated lawyer David Wells.
Mr. Wells had finally declared that the authors of the documentarch film "basses".
If the Court rejects the penalty procedure, Mr Hummel requests the leadership of a process that would allow him to submit the evidence for his argument.
The complaint has repeated the evidence already explained in the first instance, i.e., that a debate on the restraint of the facts set by the accused to last cannot be severely taken into consideration, until Roman Polanski does not appear before the court.
The 76-year-old government was fled from the United States in 1978, but still before the criminality has been conducted because of "ilgaal sexual relations" with a child of 13 years.
Since that time he's not going to the United States.
The Chairman of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, stated that Roman Polanski had to be "to attend the negotiation".
Do you want to distribute the message in this case, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other detainees, which is a way of flee, Mrs. Asayma.
Your opinion is: "Bring the filmmachers to the Court of Justice on a case, and so denith its authority."
One of the three judges ‚Äì who now have 90 days of time to know their decision ‚Äì even showed, "what still has other refugee alternatives."
Hummel wasn't the only one who had requested the punishment against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also requested the restraint of the criminal proceedings.
She recalled that her customer wouldn't have been able to be able to be endorsed by any resurrection of the case of Polanski and added: "Nobody in this room can say that this procedure was right.
twenty-third years are enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland, on the event of an American prison order.
After two months after he was passed back to the guests, he was sentenced in expectation of a possible delivery to the house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad.
Wall Street is broken through the increase of the dollar and closed without course.

Based on the final numbers in closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Age has increased 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq 0.55 points at 2.190.31 points.
The expanded standard index & Poor's 500 is at 0.37 % (4,06 points) at 1.106.41 points.
"Really say, the market is quiet," Marblehead Asset Management Mace viewers set.
"He remains closely limited, the trade volume has become very low, and I think it will remain so until the end of the year."
The tendency was supported by the publication of better economic indicators as expected, as "the market perspective to improve the solvity of the rebuilding of the economy" was closed by Charles Schwab's analyticals.
In the United States, the sales in the individual trade in November increased by 1,3 %, thus two months behind and far more than expected.
Furthermore, the confidence of the American consumers has significantly improved in December, but at 73.4 to 67.4 in the previous month, according to the index preview of the University of Michigan.
However, the Index was slowed by a new increase in the dollar rate, which has reached the highest position towards the euro for which 'the sectors of the economic situation are pressed below', stated Owen Fitzpatrick, German Bank.
Technological values have lost something on grounds.
The obligation market has fallen.
In the midnight, the refunds of the shadow rate over 10 years have increased by 3,540 % to 3,482 % and the rate of 30 years up to 4,497 % to 4,492 % of the Friday.
Selecting Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of rumorise through South Africa, the 112 candidates will be overlooked to the title of Miss World on Saturday the last garden to realize their dreams: to be selected to the most beautiful woman of the world and to watch it prior to a million of television.
During the second time of this great beauty measuring assembled in the area of Johannesburg, five of them have already seized their ticket to half-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kayane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were slowed during its African residence towards Miss Sport or even Miss Topmodel.
This was a real strike of comforts.
In view of beautiful cities, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cap Hoorn, it was simply extraordinary.
I have seen many things and made all the experiences!‚Äù said Miss Sierra Leone with full encouraging.
This competition is located nine times in South Africa and will live on Saturday, from 17 p.m. (15 p.m.) from Midrand, north of Johannesburg.
I couldn't imagine a better country to send my chrones.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have done this experience twice, Mrs. World Ksenia Sukhinova understood in the heat of South African summer.
For the young Russians, her second residence in South Africa was marked by numerous experience exchanges with candidates and the rediscovering of "apartmental landscapes".
After a month of Galas, tests, meetings with the Press and Safari, the errors are now focused on the competition.
Inderin Pooja Chopra hopes to come to the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, chosen 2000 and will also be present at this election, as well as to follow Aishwarya Rai, chosen in 1994 and both Bollywood stars.
Of course, it's the dream of each woman to become the most beautiful woman of the world, but it's not just about the appearance.
We are in our country messagers and I want to go home with the chrone, Mrs. India takes a wide laugh.
According to the events, this 59th issue will be understood with music and dance.
The candidates defil in traditional struggles and not to forget in the bathroom.
The presentation is presented by a television-moderator, China Angela Chow, from the former beautiful king of South Africa, Michelle McLean and a responsible member of the Ms. World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it has been known to receive the world with an unrelated heart and pride, assured Julia Morley, Chairman of Miss World.
The candidates, as last year, have made a safari, the famous cityship in Sowjet, but this time costs the bike and the local kitchen.
However, the meeting with the South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them the hand.
Not usually for a Head of State, Mrs. Sierra Leone noted.
Its most beautiful memory, however, remains unfortunately the exclusion in Capstadt (South-West) to the football environment in June 2010, a kind of country to get something more for this event.
I'm wrong with people that I probably never could draw close to me.
I will return with security to the World Meeting 2010, promised Mrs. Italia, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday, according to his son David, is "speakly positive"
The news of Johnny Hallyday is "severly positive", assured his son David on Friday at his arrival at the airport of Los Angeles, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital for a few days.
The news is very positive.
He's very strong, it's all very good, David Hallyday of the Press explained when he went out of the airport, where he took from Paris a few hours after the local time (21.00 mEZ).
The son of the songer, who made an unexpected impression, assured that he would "accepte" to the hospital of Cedars-Sinai, was sent to the Johnny Hallyday on Monday because of a bacterial infection after an operation at a band shock in Paris on 26 November.
The songer was "the night in Los Angeles in a artistic coma to lift his strong pains and to carry out his treatment, the press service was known.
Johnny Hallyday was transferred by the doctors of the Hospital Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles in a artistic coma in which he was sent to Paris on Monday because of a bacterial infection of follow-up to a band band shock operation on 26 November.
The songer had to re-examine an operation from midday after the afternoon on Thursday.
His wife Laeticia took part in a school meeting in the French gymnasium of Los Angeles, where her daughter Jade went to school, set a photograph of the AFP.
The Chief of the orthopedic and traumatological surgery in the Hospital Piti√©-Salpereere, Yves Caton√©, announced that he would visit the songs in the hospital at Monday in Los Angeles.
The producer has severely worried the Neuro surgery Dr. Stephane Delajoux, who has performed the songs in the Clinical International Park of Monceau in Paris on November 26.
We were declared that he was designed the cleanest mass.
The Chirurgs of Los Angeles said they were completely disappointed, Mr. Camus.
I have heard that you may be introducing a court proceedings, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus is the view that Johnny Hallyday "too fast and this is going to be with the Permission of Paris Cyrus to Los Angeles".
I phoned personally with this doctor, who assured me that he looked like this journey as a very unfair problem, which was very surprised to me, since I already had two band board operations behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he was known to RTL that the songer seemed to have left the hospital after the operation "no dragon, without all".
Dr. St√©phane Delajoux is well known in the artler Miraue.
He had operated the magicians Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Newilly-sur-sea, where he practiced to this time.
In 2007, he also operated the shooters Charlotte Gainsburg to resort a hammer after a brain explosion.
However, he is also a doctor with doubtless call that has been sentenced several times because of misunderstanding operations and not to forget, because of tax interruption and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the doctor's room, has called him "one man without shrupel" who has responsible for "regularly" before the room, and is "all other than recommendation."
After a few days of the Swiss Dr. Stephane Delajoux gave a statement on Friday on his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
This declared that the intervention would be "perfect" and the post-operative investigations would have been "normal".
The operation "rides no blood and therefore does not require a dragon", he added.
In any case, the tour of the songer seems to be questioned, which healthy problems have been taken since the summer.
It is very clear that there is something to do for the continuation of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens), Mr Camus.
The UDF Joint Union (Franced Democracy) is enhanced and calls for the Party to use its victory no longer.
On Friday, the Party, which is watched by Fran√ßois Bayrou's Party MoDem, has strongly reacted to an overview of the victory, founded by Valery Giscard d'Estaing, on the side of the President of the Party of the New York Centre, Herv√© Morin, and asked him to use this seal on no document.
Herv√© Morin publicly announces his hope to take this UDF segel, since he believes that Fran√ßois Bayrou would not be worth defending this political heritage after he had the left hand.
The Defence Minister, whose partner is the UMP, also wanted to strengthen this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In view of his efforts, he had received the support of Mr Herv√© de Charette (e.g. UMP, now at the NC), which has received a right to the property of the UDF Mark, as it first requested this brand in the 2004 "Istituto national de la propiedad industrial".
However, the UDF Party's friends observed the Swedish office of Fran√ßois Bayrous, and made clear understanding that they did not abandon the Minister and the Deputy, under a legal persecution, a deadline to use this victory and to bring them to the property rights of the Marks.
In recent days you have made many statements that you would propose your political movement, the UDF segel to + over+, wrote the party meeting in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 officers, including Fran√ßois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarness, the party Modem and the Senator Jean Arthuis of the centralist council.
You also believed that you had the right to print the name of this movement +New Center+, the Slogan + the current UDF +, their political material and the start page of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, explained the UDF business office and calls for the NC to "remote the UDF name immediately from all materials and by (actual) sites".
Moreover, Herv√© de Charette asked to transfer the rights of the Mark to their legal rights."
If you reject this, we will urge a complaint against you to respect the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signs warned.
They stressed that "UDF" has been a full political movement since 1978 and remembered that Morin and his friends "having chosen" to leave them in 2007 in order to establish a competitive movement as they had already done in 2002 to found the "UMP" party.
The New Centre therefore has no right to use the UDF seegel (Union for the French Democracy) according to the signs.
They continue to remember that the last UDF conference of 2007 has adopted the three-year-old access to the Party Modem and the establishment of a business centre for the defence of the material and moral interests, founded by Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
What Herv√© de Charette requires, the business office continues "which was at the time he requested the brand names, not a member of the UDF" but the UMP for three years.
It benefits from skandaleus and betrugeral ways from the lack of the interruption of the acronym UDF to carry out this for himself.
Furthermore, consider that this impairment is the best way to turn into a crime and ironisize the NC Strategy: "It seems to be more satisfied in the policy and in life to make a name, instead of trying to come from the anonymity by adjusting a name on which no laws have been made".
Business Liliane Bettencourt : Fran√ßois-Marie Barnier is condemned because of the exploitation of weakness
On Friday, the Court of Nanterre decided to judge the artist Francois-Marie Banier to determine whether he has assigned the daughter of the Military Liliane Bettencourt to use a weak moment of the eighth-year-olds to spend a part of their property.
On 15 and 16 April 2010, the 62-year-old photograph, known for his Starfotos, is required to be responsible for the exercise of deficiencies for the court, a criminal who shall be sentenced to a punishment of a maximum of three years and a currency penalty of EUR 375,000.
This decision means that it will actually be given a process in this matter, which is the saga of one of the richest families of France, in which the mother and daughters have the skins of the cosmetic Imperial L'Oreal in their hands.
However, the 15th Criminal Chamber also accompanied a medical investigation of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is conducted together with three doctors.
The head officer of L'Or√©al has forgotten to submit a such investigation, especially not among those, during the investigations of the State Authority of Nanterre.
The doctors called on Friday, before 10 March 2010, should submit a report on which you clearly informed whether Liliane Bettencourt could have been found in a state of weakness.
I think she's going to take these investigations.
I will talk to her, the lawyer of Mrs Bettencourt, Me George's Kiejman, after the negotiation.
The lawyer of Fran√ßoise Bettencourt-Myers, Me Olivier Metzner, is very satisfied with the Court's decision.
This is a wonderful news (...). The guest will prove that he (Banier) has manipulated this old woman that you need to protect.
Since two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has introduced and condemned him to have used the weakness of her mother for a million euros in the form of banks checks, insurance police or households.
On the other hand, Liliane Bettencourt had always argued to be manipulated by photographs that she looked as a long-year friend.
Although the court should examine the validity of the clamps introduced by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the applicants had led to a large family detachment on Friday.
Thus, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt called on three of his clients to her note (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she misunderstanded the husband of Fran√ßoise Bettencourt.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "Please, please explain my daughter that I had written to Barnier for 15 years, two times a day.
Francoise, I never have spoken anymore since her home Council."
The State Authority of Nanterre reiterates that the applicant has no right to react, especially because in the last days, a prejudiciary has rejected its application to introduce a legal protection procedure against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is completely legal, is not protected and has no training.
No one has the right to act on their place," the representative of the State Authority, Mary-Christine Duubigney.
The Court has now decided to make a sentence after the process on the validity of Mrs Bettencourt-meyers.
Manager Revolution or the end of the Strategic Spring Declaration?
If nothing changes to the leadership of the large French company has been our fight for the development of economic intelligence...
Since over a decade, the management of large enterprises in terms of its employees, the position of the consumers in front of the marketing revolution: it is the best for the staff to "value" as it was to compare with consumers' products in the work.
While you are the customers at the center of the company, the marketing revolution has given the strategies for the opening of the markets in place ... although the authorisation trial of products separated factors to regularly compare customer preferences!
Demobilization of employees may lead to mortal demoralization.
The suicide in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the pitches of a larger phenomenon, especially touching the employees.
This demobilization affects the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially those of F&Eund, which are more crucial to those of economic intelligence.
Indeed, the IE (Intelligence Economique = Economic Intelligence) requires "for all parties involved" (...) a proactive step and a accommodated vision"; it calls for employees to oppose the instructions of the authorisation management.
This is why we call for a business revolution that would be there that the employees in the midst of the business's concerns are equal to the customers.
The very requisite benefits of internal opinion questions
Should the internal opinion questions, such as the questionnaire, which the persons have submitted their payment receivers, encourage this revolution in terms of management practice?
I'm afraid, I'm not sorry.
- First, because I could find that the whole composition, in view of a new situation, is finally starting to do this primarily... what it has always done.
It is also because the Authority - one of the pathologys of the power-related power, to the importance of its own misconduct.
Finally, because most leadership forces have a strongly simplified view of human behavior.
Previously from the great engineering schools, its interpretation of psychology is mechanical.
They take through intellectual comfort the old behaviorist theory that recently reactivated by the American "Neo-American Universities" and indeed widely distributed by research institutions and media.
So and by suggesting that it is possible to confirm the "hebel" (sic) to engage in employees, a current Le Figaro.fr survey of Ipsos increases the leadership forces in a position to a mechanistic control system that is inadequate for the present world.
Identifie and measure the mobilization factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for modern enterprises provides the adoption of a final view of human behavior.
It is to integrate a basic protocol in any transmission or practice of the tax: the engagement of the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to implement a part of its dreams, their honor and its projects.
Only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take this concept of the motivation of employees.
These studies have demonstrated that they shall evaluate their undertakings on the basis of a prescribed Doxa, which allows them to evaluate by their real image of the company, what they provide for the achievement of their lives objectives.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, the leadership forces of the companies can control, monitor their "social performance" performance and predict and relocate their human resources management in the right place.
Thus they create a fruitful land that is good for the development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The words of Oslo: the "just war" brings Obama Lob from the right
The American rights welcomed Barack Obama's speech in Oslo on Friday, and was satisfied that the Nobel Prize 2009 defended the term "just war" against the enemy of the United States.
The Conservatives who had put the price allocation to Obama on October 9, now applauded the speaking of the President, followed by the example of the former vice-Presidential Candidate in the elections of Sarah Palin in 2008.
My pleasant thing he said, Palin explained the face of the right flight of the Republic of the United States today and added that he himself had put the subject of a "while necessary" war in their own languages.
The war is, of course, the last thing I think that the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We need to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, the two wars from his preacher George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghan, tried to justify the use of violence in Oslo on Thursday, a way to explain his decision about 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghan.
Another enemy of Obama, Newt Gingrich, is the opinion that the President has done in Oslo "very good work."
I found that the speech was very good, pleased the former President of the House of Representative, which particularly recognized the reference to "the existence of the evil in the world" in the words of Obama.
In some parts, I have completely accepted this speech as historic, Ginrich explained that it was asked in the "The Takeaway".
The previous deputy, who was considered by some as possible candidates for the Republican's appointment for the 2012 Presidency, said that he was pleased to have seen a "president of the left" who reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that they weren't free and could not join a price for peace if the use of violence would not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and medium-sized editor at Washington Post, Obama has maintained "a very American talk".
Furthermore, he's called "cosmopolit" as "he always does", when he stated that the Europeans "as they have not created themselves and not much for their protection," says Gerson.
Under the few, not convinced rights, the former UNO committee John Bolton, a falk of the Era Bush, the speaking on the website of the National Review Online as "lang, high-training and inspirationless".
To the left of the President, the Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the retreat against the forces.
If you pack the war under the deck of justice, the massator can simply justify the innocents.
However, the press of the slightly left remains glorious on the side of the President.
The Los Angeles Times, who is still the view that the Nobel Prize was forgiven to Obama, declared the conversation itself for a speaker like him, who is known for his talent as "monumental work".
The speaking in Oslo "its an end plan to control international decisions against conflicts, poverty and underpression," says the Californian daytime.
The New York Times is the view that Obama "proclaimed the necessary discours" and describes his speech as "the dark and slightly compared".
Travellers: Three Marathons for an agreement that ensures the supply of Christmas
After three weeks of negotiation, the workshops of the road association and the TLF, the only employer organization that remained until the end, ended into an agreement that ended up the striking order and the threatening shipment of Christmas.
At the subscription meeting on the freeday "congratulated" of the advisory State secretariat Dominice Busserwater, which was introduced after a number of negotiations weeks at midnight.
After a second negotiation night, the negotiators were expected to sign the agreement rapidly on Friday morning.
And although the three employees (FNTR, Unstra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, more than six hours from the start of the meeting at 11:00 p.m. to the end of the agreement and only at 18:00 p.m. the Agreement was signed.
The conflict "a lot of damage has been added to the company" and "this was to fear that he would affect the celebration at the end of the year," says Buserwater.
The Agreement provides a increase in payment of 4% for the lower wages (local and regional road transport) and of 2.9% for the highest payment groups (international transport).
The rate of hours for employees with lower wages increases from 8,72 euros to 9,06 euros.
"It's not particularly much, but we're just getting small once," says Patrice Clos (FO).
Activityists are now indicated to not lock the supply centres anymore.
"But it will always be given a few opposers that are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
The TLF Chairman Philippe Grillot said about a "good agreement", although it was "acceptable to make these payment increases faced by international competition".
The increase of EUR 170 monthly for the lower and up to 100 to 120 euros for high loan groups.
"This agreement is based on the healthy human mind and respect for the employees," says Maxime Dumont (CFDT), where Thierry Douine (CFTC), said of "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) expressed this regard on "a acceptable compromise".
The Agreement also provides the increase in travel costs of 3 % and the maintenance of the total road transport network in the first half of 2010, which will be allowed in particular to address the 13-month term and the modernisation of the tariff contracts.
Mr Busserwater recalled that the "the thresholds of the employer's expenditure of EUR 100 million" object for an amendment by the Government on the draft legislation of the reported financials for 2009, which was adopted on Friday night by the National Assembly.
The government calls for a "identified" vote by the Senate.
The subscription of the TLF allows the agreement to first apply to the enterprises engaged in this organization and to apply, in the case of a dissemination by the Minister of Employment for the whole occupational status.
This will be "in the shortest time" of the case, secures buser water.
The opposition of the workers' associations may only delay the procedure.
The FNTR Association proposed a "reserving trade" because the 100 million euros were already promised to the sector for compensation of a part of the carbon tax.
The State Secretariat for Transport forced us to negotiate as quickly as possible, but not on the basis of a common analysis, but in order to not destroy the wine ears at the nearly Christmas meetings, the Onestra declares.
For the Association Other, the Agreement threatens the smaller and medium-sized enterprises of the sector in the coming 12 months.
Line RER A: Unpleasant disorders at this weekend, working with the proposals of the RATP
The disasters on the RER A line, the largest rapid train network in France for the largest Paris area and the islandle-de-France, continued on the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, 2nd strike between the workshops and the leadership of the RATP (Independent Paris) continued to wait for strikes with their requests for payment.
To this important weekend of Christmas, there was only one of the two trails and outside the central trails between 10:00 and 20:00.
The connection to SNCF's trends was interrupted in Nantere prefectures, which the travellers forced to increase.
The purchase chain Galerie Lafayette, which is counting every day 200,000 customers, welcomed the fact that "I'm trying to connect the RATP large business to transport technically."
The RER A line passes the Paris Ballung room from Westen to East.
The strike section of the RATP connects the Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre places as well as Boissy-Sint-L√©ger and Marne-La-Vall√©e.
On Friday, about one of the two trains were planned to transport the main time, and nearly no one during the transport time.
As on Thursday, there was no human preference on the stations, since the inhabitants of the island-de-France were put on the situation.
As soon as morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less than other, especially because of the lack of Gymn-Asists.
In Boissy-Sunit-Leger (Val-de-Marne) Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), he would have been extra "in some hours before to come to work."
The SNCF, who had planned an oversight of travellers by employees and order forces, pointed out that it hadn't come to an engagement in the Saint-Lazare station.
The SNCF on the line RER A or in the direction of Cergy-Le-Hout came to or moved through the Saint-Lazare station to ensure the connection to the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, the main meetings of the strikes were recovered, while the results were reviewed which the associations were included after the meeting with the leadership pieces on Friday as "decisive".
The RER business manager has prepared the specific preparation of a protocol for the RER A line with regard to all relevant aspects, worktimes, professional routes, etc.
However, this is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud) they call for a long payment attack.
The CGT was recommended that the RATP itself put its payment proposals in a pleasant way and stressed that the guideline "is not possible to solve a problem while it was possible for the transporters and the SNCF."
The RATP cleared that a renewed meeting was intended for the "comprehensive review of the working conditions" for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company "is ignored the weekend."
On Monday, about 150 drivers searched for a committee in Paris.
Once again, it was the leading threshold that rejected every debate until date, during the strike, and closed a meeting after a discussion of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to extend to the RER B line after an announcement of Unsa and Independents.
The associations require a wage of 120 (unsa) to 150 euros, from which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents).
The drivers of the RER line, which have more than a year's professional survey, include a brutal loan of 2.200 to 2.700 euros, as well as a payment of 600 to 650 euros for shoot services and sun and holidays.
Turkey's Constitutional Court resumes the pro-Curdic party. Decision with serious consequences
On Friday, the Constitution Court announced the resolution of the Pro-Qurd Headquarters of the country; a decision which followed immediately the demonstrations in the Curdial Community in the south of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens the work of the Government to enable the Curd Community to end the conflicts since 25 years.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was resolved, as it became a place for activities that are responsible for the independence of the State and its unilateral unity," says the President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kiliz four days after the decision against the press.
According to Kilich, the decision would be adopted unilaterally by 11 judges, where a majority of seven votes would have been needed to deal with the resolution, and he pointed out that 37 of the leadership of the party, including the President Ahmet Turk and the parliamentary Aysel Tugluk, were excluded for the period of five years from the political event.
Furthermore, the judges announced the decrease of the parliamentary immunity, which enjoys Turkey and Tugluk, as well as the conflicting of the goods of the parties.
The DTP now has more than 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
The Party leaders expressed that the parliamentary would preferably leave Parliament as a partial parliamentary.
The decision followed a procedure introduced by the Turkish Federal advocate of Abdulrahman Yal√ßinkya in 2007, which accused the DTP to follow the "disciplines" of the working party in Kurdistan (PKK), which was regarded by Ankara and many other countries as an terrorism organization.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political creator of the PKK revolts.
The party ensures that no link to the PKK is rejected to call it as a terrorist organization and calls the Government to negotiate.
The Court of Justice of the Constitution, which is intended to agree with the Curdial Community and propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the currency in order to enable the PKK's support through the currency and to put the conflicts to end.
The DTP leaders confirm that a resolve could lead to redistribution in Southern Anatolians, where numerous demonstrations were conducted against the prison conditions of the PKK's Chief Abdullah √ñcalan in the past weeks with the police.
Since the proclamation of the Court, thousands of demonstrates gathered before the areas of the DTP in the millions of Diyarbakir city in the south, which is overly populated from curves.
The order forces set up grain gases and water clays when the demonstrators began to cut Molotowcocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the Court of Justice, Turkey concluded that the decision of the Court would "develop further dismissing".
"The Turkey may not clarify this (courdial, anim.d. Editon) question on the basis of the ban of a party," he said the press.
The Government, which was composed of a party who had come from the Islamic movement, also regretted the decision.
"We oppose from principle against the closure of the parties.
This does not solve the problems," says Minister of Energy Taner Ylowz.
"This decision is a torture of democratic opening that has been promoted by the government," says the political market observer Ahmet Island.
"It can clearly be taken to a reaction of the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK was known to a attack in which three days before seven soldiers in the north of Turkey came around their lives, which was one of the most brutal attacks of the last months.
The Snee Incentive can come
A very nice winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not just because he wants to break the citizens, the Winter Service Chief of the FES says.
Especially to enable its employees to try and learn all the vehicle techniques.
In the weekend, it could be the first time so far.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to care for snow and iron.
The FES is in line with a precise plan.
When it slows in Frankfurt and the temperatures are under the grain of zero, Brauburger explains 20 so-called trails.
This includes about the main roads of transport and transition, such as the new road and the Hanauer Lander Strategy.
But also fire drivers, √ñPNV routes, footground zones and trails with accidents, such as the Atzelberg Streets.
The FES service begins at 3 p.m.
The 1040 miles [1040 km] should be shocked for maximum three hours with feed salt, which is better arrested.
That's why the FES starts at 3 a.m. "To allow the routes to be free until the professional traffic begins."
It's hard when it's only sneaking at 7:30.
Then we have a problem to say the winter chief, "before no one is ready to make the driving vehicles place."
First of all, if it is not further, there are roads of advertising and resolution, including the Council's share tracks.
The last priority has pages and side areas.
There will be a complaint, Brauburger.
On 5 o'clock the football of the FES is priorityly switched on the road, risk points and transmissions.
For all road roads, the FES often cannot care.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which holds the bridges from 22 to 4 p.m., says Brauburger.
As it goes on this fast floor, when the temperature goes under two degrees, the strike walks.
If necessary, this is also called by the police.
The way of the dinosaurer
Tawa hallae looked like many other meat dinosaurers: The two meters long and 1.50 meters great animal flew on two powerful shoes, had a long shore with sharp, shocked dents, short arms with sleeves and a long swimming snack.
If the type lived a few million years later, it wouldn't be special.
However, Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurers with these features, reporting Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and College in the Journal of Science of Thursday.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in New Mexico today, which was then in a soft zone of the Supercontinent Pang√§a at the Equator.
Tuva opens a new window for the previous evolution of the dinosaur, says Nesbitt.
He shows us much about the relationships, the expansion and the characteristics of the early dinosaurers.
2006 Nesbitt and other Paleonologists began with a decrease on the Ghost Ranch in North New Mexico.
Sometimes we found a twelve dinosaurier kit, which is unlikely for delays from the Trias, reports the team-member Randall Imits from Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the skins identified the researchers quickly as a new type.
During the expansion, they met the rest of the total of five individuals together.
Fund confirmed theories about Dino-Free History
The name "Tawa" is from the Hopi Indian sunlight.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is a extraordinary fund: "Dinosaurier photos from the Trias are extremely rare, mostly only ones are found."
Other dinosaurier experts do not shape the emphasismus.
In particular, this fund is not spectacular, but he confirms some theories about the early history of the dinosaurers, says about Martin Sander from the University of Bonn.
After the current education, the dinosaurers first took place 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossilians, however, are incomplete, because the arrangement of this ur-dinos is mostly struck.
Thus, the experts discussed, for example, when the skins were covered in their three most important development lines: the meat thermopods, to which the tyremosaurus rex, the Velociraptor, and also the birds, known as "Langhalse" and their associations, and the plants freshing ornithia, for example, triceratops and stegosaurus.
After the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropod.
He knows a interesting combination of primitive and continuous properties, says Nesbitt.
In the shadow of Tawa hallae, researchers found an indication on air chains, such as they have the follow-up of the theropodes, the birds.
Thanks to the air sack, the breathing of the birds is more efficient than the powder.
In Tawa hallae, the bones of the weapon room apparently were filled in part with air.
Tawa is the oldest and primary theropod with air sacks, says Randall Irmis.
Since the relative line of the huge sauro pools later also had air swimming and light-building kitchens, it probably had already produced these useful innovations.
At least three migration hills to North America
Because the most known dinosaurers in South America lived in South America, researchers follow that the skins were the first time there.
Thus, the three development lines were prematurely enhanced and spread from South America over all parts of the earth that were still a single farm mass.
The fact that the team, together with Tawa, has found the rest of the two other, not particularly closely related theropods.
The three cannot be delayed from a commonly immigred event, the researchers argued.
We believe there were at least three migrations to North America, Alan Turner from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a composer of Science Studies.
Freely there are opposites.
A more older, Silesaurus, who belongs to a group of dinosaurers, lived today in Poland, says the Bonn Paleonologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could be shown a devastated image, because in South America, only many primitive dino-filleds have remained, while there is little to find something on other continents.
As the dinosaurers made to develop a relatively rare page line of the reptilian seed to the dominant agricultural production of the earthquake, it is still dangerous.
During the Trias, the dinosauries shared their lives with many other reptiles, for example, with the past of the current crocodile and the aircraft, and with many other skins.
At the end of the Trias, the dinosaurers spread around the world and developed many new species, while the association on the border of Trias to Jura.
Success stories not forever chosen
There are two hypotheses to explain this channel, says Martin Sander.
It could have given a mass death that survived the dinosaurers, but other reptiles couldn't.
Or the dinosaurers were better adjusted, so they could shoot competitiveness from the field.
In any case, the success stories did not decide forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite invasion of a group of animals to flowers, which had also developed in the Trias, and from then, a shootase was shocked: the seed.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signs are international.
Professionals at the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or from Berkeley in California.
Centers from Neapel are from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police space of the Francfurter Goethe University's named casino suggests waves worldwide.
278 Professors and teachers of the Goethe University, but also from high schools in all Germany, Europe and North and South America are solidarized with protesting students at the Campus Westend.
In a German and English declaration "misablers" they are the scope of the police taken by the Bureau.
The Uni-President Werner M√ºller-Estler had left the building in the training trail in the past week, because the walls and art works were shocked.
Five students were injured.
The damages, judged the signs, did not justify "the violent resolution of self-organized teacher events of students and teachers by a police command."
The residence represents an "not acceptable invasion" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on Vandalism depends on the "delictization and criminalization of the protection" and depends on the contents.
The presidency has dismissed the necessary discours.
The dozens call for the immediate position of criminal persecution.
The majority of the owners did not support the damage, namely.
Protest legitimated
The young people of the Verdi Association and the German Collection Association also solidate with the students.
The protest is legitimate expression of a growing concern about the future, says the Verdi-Lande juvenile Alexander Klein.
Hessens, Minister of Sciences, Eva Kuhne-H√∂rmann (CDU) defended the action of the United President and the police.
We are grateful to the President.
Destruction and destination are completely unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday at the Wessbaden Landday.
We have a understanding for the protest, but no understanding for Vandalism, as the Deputy on Land Day, Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, this was the SPD, Green, and left opposition groups.
The CDU takes poor walls on the front to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of students, we have been slepted.
The left has made a request to the Minister of Internal Affairs to provide a report on the police.
New Silicon-Valley
For many years, she became a secret city, unacceptable for Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital city of Moscow, was a strict guard place in the Soviet Union.
Today the communities apply to its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 km from the Moscow Center, as "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production centres for micro- and nano-electronics are here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd had linked contacts with the Frankfurt Scientific Place Riedberg, with the Uni institutions and the company of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits, and on mid-day, Selenograd and Riedberg were signed in Frankfurt a "Protocol for closer cooperation".
The Moscow Vice-Claimer Juri Rossljak and the prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd, the Russian delegation, understood by Frankfurt planning deputy Edwin Black.
2010, representatives of the FIZ and smaller and medium-sized enterprises of the scientific research point for a seminar to Selenograd.
Scientific exchange
It's about a continuing scientific exchange.
But there is also economic relations.
The company of the FIZ is enabled to spend on the growing Russian market.
In turn, Russian science companies want to complement contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of more significant Russian research institutions and companies.
This includes about the Moscow Institute for Electronic Technology, the large concerns Sitronics and Rossijskaja Electronics.
The Commune was founded in 1958 as the name "socialist planned" for the resort research.
Selenograd (for example, "Green City") received his name from the controlled hillland, where the research institutions are registered.
Stuttgarter Bremsklotz
The size of Stuttgart 21 may not be high enough.
For the favorites of the project, it is simple and simple about "the new heart of Europe".
Right so. S21 is much more than the depth of a train station, more than a monstrost building project that will be destroyed by the city of the Baden-Wurttemberg headquarters for a decade in helloses building chaos.
Stuttgart 21 has emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
Headquarters with Gleisen, who ended in the middle of the city, at the time as a traffic-technical fosil of the 19th century, who acted as the bridges of a modern sleeves, as it needed for a lot of time to switch local motives from behind.
Introduction, shut up, go on - so it must go.
And therefore the head stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and M√ºnchen.
And in Stuttgart: a bicycle station, which is located at about halfways of the transEuropean skien magie between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava, is therefore the slogan of the "Herz Europes".
S21 is now in reality, although the visions of the 80s are not more compliant with the reality.
Even very ambitious plans have recognized that it is almost unpayable in the Hess and the largest city to implement the depths.
However, the head stations also have no problem of input and exit, since there are modern trains with train vehicles and tax vehicles at two ends.
However, Stuttgart 21 next to the ICE new construction line to Ulm is now reached.
Country and Community Policy has implemented it.
It is also due to the risks of the largest infrastructure project of the Republic of the Payers and not to the state centers.
The project is still able to justify some of the other parts of the cities.
It consists of a new city room that is believed that the computer-generated graphics of the planet are equipped with a lot of green.
S21 is harmful for the transport system.
The Headquarters and the rail construction are thought for the personnel's traffic, which is typically in the 80s, a huge growth.
There was no competitiveness of the flying flights.
However, the modern transport policy must first be able to strengthen the goods transport, since transport on the steel is significantly more environmental than by Lkw on the road.
However, the new construction strike does not spend because of strong stages for goods.
More serious is that S21 also tangents many other rail projects indirectly.
Good six billion euros should be pronounced in Swedish.
That's the official number.
Experts keep 10 to 15 billion for realistic.
Finally, in the next decade, the money is missing from other points and clusters in the network.
Overall, sixty more projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important ones is the construction of the good 180 km long road through the Rheintal.
Since 1987, it is built at the trace at the time of time.
Drugly, it would be necessary to press right here on the tube.
But S21 will act as a brems cloth.
The Rheintrail will be fleet by the international goods transport: in the heart of Europe.
Government checks the court for the airport
The country's government has opened a review in Visbourgland on the case of the Hess Administrative Court (VGH) for a night-floor ban.
The CDD/FDP coalition has employed experts in order to investigate the comprehensive VGH Office of more than 400 pages, said Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel had writtenly found that, in the case of the planned Northwest road trains in the Frankfurt airport, the country had to re-regulate the night flight prohibition.
The authorisation of 17 flights between 23 and 5 p.m., as the country government provides, should not be agreed with the legally provided protection of the population before night airline.
The coalition must decide if it is against the judgment until 4 January.
The opposition criticized this infringement and urged the representatives of the Government to reject a review in Leipzig.
SPD Head of Torsten Scharer-Gubel requested the CDU and FDP to return to their promises that were made before the choice of a night-floor ban, and in other cases, this should be a "wordbroch".
It's so hard when you can keep his word, said the green Chief Tarek Al-Wazir in reply to the "We keep a word".
Minister Posch returned to the project of shooter-gobble, trying to see the country government to come to their night flights.
An accurate legal examination requires its time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "like first impression".
We need a legal discharge, said Stefan M√ºller (FDP).
As they represent the opposition, the statements of his group never had been for a night-floor ban.
US banks pay aid back
The crisis protected the United States Great Banks strive to strive their State taxes.
The Bank of America has paid the aid from the Bank Reserve Fund in the mid-day period of a total of $45 billion ($30 billion).
The Citi-group also plans after a report of the US Sender CNBC to restore state aid.
The institutions want to conclude the restrictions that have been made with the adoption of the money ‚Äì such as the limitation of the payment of managerboni and the allocation of higher costs.
The Bank of America had worried about the wave loans of $19 billion fresh money in investors.
The rest of the sum took her from the own casse, which was well filled by sperten sales, among others.
Bank Chief Kenneth Lewis expressly thanked the US taxpayers: The currency has helped for a very difficult time.
The financial crisis was highlighted by the transfer of the Merrill Lynch Investment Bank.
The Citi-Gruppe wants to create money on the capital market to be free of its liabilities towards the State.
On Thursday, the US bank could announce a series of $20 billion invasion of its capitals, reported CNBC in professions on circles.
A citi-group speaker did not want to express himself.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repayed their aid.
Quick selection
Then it was more fast than thought.
After two weeks after the ZDF Management Board had the official chief Nikolus Brender from the office, the sender may present a follower.
Last night the body wanted to vote on the personality.
As Favorit, Peter Frey was head of the ZDF headquarters in Berlin.
However, a confirmation was not officially confirmed by the sender to do this.
However, it should have played a role to avoid further damage by the ZDF Intensors Markus Schachers, but this proposal should not be taken to the Governing Council.
Frey, shoeting candidate, needs 9 of the 14 grammium members.
The result of the vote has not yet been established in the edition of this expenditure.
Two weeks ago, the slaughter was slaughtered by the Administrative Council with his proposal to extend the Treaty with Nikolus Brender for five years further.
Only seven members talked to Broders, and seven voted against him. Broder's displacement was a shooting place for shooters, but a expectable.
Because the Union Council's membership had been signaled for weeks before the election, not to confirm the Brender in the office.
It was the residue of the Hess Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that, under the Brender, the CDF's reports would have lost to switch rates, he rejected another official period of the high-specific chief captain.
Soon before the election, there were Protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was slaughtered.
Lastly, 35 State lawyers had been in the debate, which were estimated to be the case of Cochs as a constitutional basis.
That's not the last time.
For person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied policy, padagogic and romanistics.
Then he worked at the South Westwestern and the Frankfurt roundview.
1983 Frey changed to ZDF, first to " Today-Journal".
Subsequent stations: 1988 to 1990, a personal referendum of the Chefmaker; 1991/92 Correspondent in Washington; Head and Moderator of the "Morgenmagazine"; until 2001, Head of the Foreign Policy ZDF; since the head of the ZDF Headquarters Studios.
The green proclaimed a constitutional declaration on the midst of the Branchenblatt Medium Magazine on the journalist of the year after the breakfast of Brenders, which was elected by the Branchenblatt Medium Magazine.
In the past week, the Resident of the Governing Council, the rhine-Paulse Minister Kurt Beck, declared that the countries should change the ZDF State Treaty so that the personal proposals of the Ombudsman could not be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, a disappearing of partial politicians from the CDF oversight schemes also concluded.
Broders of the predictable follower Peter Frey had recommended that the Governing Council behaviour with a slight shock -- by criticating the body directly after the breeding disappearance.
Thanks to this journalist independence, both slaughters could be named without the loss of face for the posts of the headmaker and also the Administrative Council, without being in charge to help a participant into the office.
Frey is calculated without the link library.
Studium is depleted
Subsequently, students: After a year of education, the Ministers of Collection of Countries ended on Thursday: at a meeting of Ministers of Cultural and High Schools, both sides agreed to enhance the conditions of study at Bachelor and Master.
The students should be able to be able to handle their study also.
In particular, they acknowledged to reduce the test loads: in particular, each study module should be completed only with a single test.
In addition, the labour load of students should be reviewed and safeguarded "a realistic and reliable measure".
Political and high schools also want to simplify the recognition of test services between high schools within and outside Germany.
The countries were obliged to build more flexible common structural requirements for bachelor and master studies.
In addition, it should not be able to give the dismissed countries arrangements.
Reverse tests
From the beginning of the student protections in June, the flying word of the best studentity in the mouth is the Minister of Cultural and Uni-Rectors.
Now it was first filled with a concrete content.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided to reduce the number of tests partly: "All modules are normally closed by only a test," says in a 30-side paper that should be renewed partly by the authorisation of studies.
The "declaration of the test charge" explained by the Reinhold Council of Accreditation Grimm, which aims to be provided for a "facility development, which significantly affected the study".
Furthermore, the "study" should be the "decisive criteria" in the future.
Modules such as content are "strict to review it", whether "unnecessary approaches to students in the choice of the students
Events would be avoided.
The students would have "the right to receive game spaces, allow and promote their own initiative".
The rules for the approval of new, but also for the review of existing studies.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years, however, which means that it will duration until 2015 until all studies have been reviewed.
For this reason, ten accreditation agencies are substantiated by the Accreditation Council established by the countries.
The Ministers of Cultural had requested countries "with pressure" in October, to influence the agencys that the fulfilment of substance is not too large and the test regime is not too strict.
In some federal countries, universities and schools with the ministers of the country have already understood the appropriate measures.
As far as the only country said, Rheinland-Pfalz was to be further developed in the Bologna process.
The money aims to establish high schools in particular Customers programmes and strengthen research and testing and foreign students.
Country and High Schools want to apply ten million euros.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to introduce a new of high school law into Parliament.
After this, only one test is necessary for the end of a study model.
The study should also be more flexible, ensuring recognition of performance reports to other high schools and facilitating access to master.
To the end of the coming year, all the studies of the country should be examined on their ability to study.
The government and opposition were again fighting on the studies conditions in the country on Thursday.
In addition to Lob, however, there was also criticism on decisions.
The federal headquarters of the Juso High Schools urged the establishment of education policy to take place in the future, "the doors closed" of the Ministers and High Schools.
Later after education, students should also be "a word" concerned.
The future academics received support from the President of the High School Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the experiences of students," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Cultural, with which the HRK was discussing a common reform paper.
The Association of Education and Scientific (GEW) did not have enough decisions: it calls for a law enabled to access to a further master study access to each one with a bachelor termination.
On the other hand, countries must ensure that, for the today's generation of Bachelor students, there are sufficient master studies with best studies available for the today's generation, so Andreas Keller.
The countries must clearly set more dozens.
However, to a free access to the master, the Ministers of Culture did not express.
More than a footnote to Herta M√ºller
Introduction in Germany and is almost no control... The start line of a Liriker Werner S√∂llner's mind, where this is thematicized the arrival of a dissident who wins the freedom, but also lost his language room.
The 1951-born Werner S√∂llner in Romania had first worked as German and English teacher in Bukarest and later as a reader in a child book department before 1982 he was overlooked to Frankfurt on Main.
Slellner has been excited with various literature prices, 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurt Poetic Reviews at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he is leader of the Hessic Literature Forum in the Mouse Tower in Frankfurt.
For considerable extra-literal observation, he was careful at the past Sunday during a meeting in Munich, where it went to the German literature in Romania in the Spiegel and the level of its security tests.
It seems to be insured and leaves S√ºllner a statement in which he had been collected before the Romanian German writer, e.g. Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Womendorfer, his work as IM for the Roman Secret Service Securities.
Within some of the attendants, S√∂llner had received the German language price in 1989.
The requests would have started angry, first in 1971.
I'm, sluggling, "because someone who has not made enough for the security tries."
Lyriker Werner S√∂llner is IM Walter.
At the same time, with the Nobel price for Herta M√ºller and its unrelated literary interference with the dictatorical government mechanisms, the literature scenes and, in particular, the Community of the German authors from Romania are shocked by a case that makes the decrease and the detriment of a political system, which is based on monitoring and separation.
Werner is a slellner, so far you can say, not only killers, but also victims.
In his Security Act, IM Walter played a role, said after the understanding of the slells of the literature scientist Michael Markel and showed the positive impact of the IM Walter.
He had him in all the different points for him, says Markel.
It is a moral need to make this note.
However, it was unexpected in the form and before this public, completely surprising the recognition of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Roman Secret Service.
Germany was a reserve for securitate spectrum, Herta M√ºller had already written in July after she had read her own record, 914 pages.
The interested ones, so they may be sculpted, and, in some cases, have also knew the clear name of the deck names Sorin, Vocu and Walter.
Instead of the very procedural view of the Stasi files here in the country, the interference with the security monitoring services is still very diffused.
A systematic declaration has been disappeared and disrupted over the past years.
One of the relevant National Councils on the preparation of security files (CNSAS) was based only in 1999, but the production of the data was more slower.
Since 2005, there is a law which regulates the management of the files.
The influence of the former security members in Romania was still very large, after announcing the Nobel Prize for Herta M√ºller, an interview in which a former security chief from the Teasvar was expressed on the prices.
She's got a psychosis, finally you just heard her once.
The Infamy of the Power said to be able to express the freedom of view.
Indeed, the case of the slaughter, as often in relation to a variety of debts, is inevitable.
Why is it now? Who has been succeeded? The reaction of the listeners to the sleeves hopes that the continuation of this chapter will be determined more than by knowledge than by debt instruction and shame.
For the genesis of the work of Herta M√ºller, who last night took the Nobel Price, it is more than one footnote.
Rating contribution Champions League
It worked just as an addicted foreign service from a very nice Christmas feast, on which a sportive producer Goodies had distributed, when the new VfB Trainer Christian Gross in the direction of an orange colorful platform of the exhibitor increased a fourth hour by midnight in a renowned C class.
The man with the marshing swimming swimming to fly because of his still foreign town.
On the contrary, he could also drive himself - alcohol was finally not in the game, and the 55-year-old boys was precisely little.
It was an audience night, but the work is on the morning.
Or just go right.
In the words of the first three days of Swiss, "We have reached the axlefinal", namely, in the Champion League, thanks to the 3.1 follow-up against the Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we should not leave us from the success: there will be a brutally hard fight against the delay."
The "wise more important task" is before Sunday.
Then it is applicable to repeat the king class in Mainz in Liga's Sunday.
And again, the weakness after the speed of three doors by Marica (5). Try (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.).
Excludement
The acetelfinal of the Champions League (Jolies 16./17. + 23./24 February/Reviews 9./10. + 16./17 March) is excluded in Nyon on December 18th.
Thus the joy of the fulfilment of the Babbel follower remained condemned.
Not only in the slightly healing band that had provided the uncertain steel garden profession in the short time of self-confidence, employment preparation and joy.
I came to the players and told them that they should be involved in their powers, and have stopped them to be more mutilating, the souls clamps gress explained that so simple success reception, which had no more effect under therapeut Babbel.
He has removed a certain magic, gave Babbel's promiser Jens Lehmann, "if a new impulse in the football comes, sometimes happens things that you wouldn't have maintained."
And Sami Khedira, who had a long-term injury thanks to his dynamic even to the best player on the place, tried to describe the "Phenomen" defined with the word "Fruit Wind" and the functionality of the new provisions: "He is a man who demands disciplin.
That's what we need in the current situation."
Under Babbel it was obviously missing.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet over the mountain, warning sports station Horst Heldt
However, the VfB Stuttgart needs mostly constances.
As Gross, also players and managers were able to overcome the victory against a replaced and completely overcome the Roman guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before four days later in Leverkuse at 0:4 the bad observance had been able to remember Khedira.
And the sports station Horst Heldt knew that even though a season target was reached, the other was still in the further television.
We're not over the mountain.
This herdt, on his 40th birthday itself after the first home seventh for three months, was not after celebration, at the events of the weekend, which lived freely in the form of a direct game-start television interviews by Torh√®ter Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions taken by others and not from the Jens, headt acknowledged the hard Critic Lehmanns.
He had predicted the headquarters and decided to change training on puberty fans.
Even if his free day has been stripped after games, Lehmann valued as a sign of lack of sovereignty and fault.
Lehmann's statements were "expressed in pure egoism," herdt returned and announced consequences for the final man.
You're not going to be friends for your life, the twoty-year-old.
However, they were always agreed with all others that without the work of the trainer team, it would have been possible to play and fight strong ideas.
Babbel and his assistants had "a great part of success", said Heldt and Lehmann unionso - and also the man with the Plastics.
WM-food in weight
Hitzige duel in Bern: Always trigger Kevin Johnson World Master Vitali Clickko with words and spirits.
However, after twelve hard rounds, the Ukraine defended its weight title after the WBC version.
The sentence of the advisor's decision was uncomfortable.
Hamburg - Vitali Clitschko remains a box worldwide in weight.
The 38-year-old Champion after the WBC Association, on Saturday night in Bern, accompanied the American Kevin Johnson according to points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was the third successful defence after his comeback in October 2008.
Before the Ukrainian was two times the World Meeting of the WBO and WBC Associations.
Unfortunately, it didn't shut up with the K.o. who all have expected.
Clishko built his balance on 39 seats in 41 professional battles, two times he had to be struck on the basis of injuries.
The challenger Johnson had to take the first place in the 24th battle.
Before around 17,000 observers in the Berner Arena, the sight of 2,02 meters of great clipschko wanted to divide the battle, especially with his left leadership hand.
The 11th centimeter smaller Johnson, who had proclaimed the end of the clipko era before the dull, was always declined to the slaughter of the World Minister, so that Klitschko could not impose its dangerous rights.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and tried only to come over the rounds.
Although he triumphed clysko with words and beasts, his shoes met the world master only rarely.
On the other hand, he was only the second boxer to Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went with Klitschko over the full distance of 12 runes.
The challenger had been buried before the battle in the Swiss capital for some weapons.
He rushed clipschko as "heat zombie," which "not can be right."
At the way, the Champion tried to shoot Johnson the sun bridges from the nase, "to see his eyes."
Fourth Victor to Clipchkos Comeback
Klitschko remained also in his fourth battle after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After nearly four years of age, he had shocked the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and returned his "seen" WBC building, which he had to previously abandon.
In this year he asked his title accounts Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and in September Chris Arreola from the United States.
I just got a shock in this struggle and I'm physically very well, Klitschko had founded the fast back to the ring.
But his dream remains the association of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Wladimir is the World Master of the WBO and IBF Associations.
But the wood of the WBA takes the British David Haye after it was able to shoot the great Nikolai Walujew in November.
Haye had shocked a fight planned for September before the summer against Vitali Clitschko.
Its promotion society is now planned for the fight against Klitschko in the London Wembley Stadium.
Fall Kunduz
Frontalan shock from the opposition: Head of Green Fraction J√ºrgen Trittin has called the Defense Minister Goodtenberg for false information about the client's appeal as a lie.
SPD and left requests a statement by the officer.
Hamburg/Berlin - After the recent recognition of the air attack of Kunduz, the Defense Minister of Defense in Goodtenberg (CSU) has signed a conviction.
The Minister said to the mortal bomb on two tanks in September "which is inconserved," said Head of Green Fraction J√ºrgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD newspaper "Tagsview".
They are called the land: he lied.
The order for the murder shall be issued under the rules of the International Protection Trust for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the substance of the NATO report, Mr Goodtenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday, it was known that it was not only a devastation of the slaughter, but also aimed at killing two Taliban leaders.
According to the Nato Subsistence Report, Nato has been killed or damaged by the Commissioner Oberst Klein requested by the German client.
Green, SPD and links requested the Federal Kansler Angela Merkel (CDU) to express themselves immediately before the Federal Day and also to clarify what Goodtenberg really knew about the event.
Mrs Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of the targeted murder component of the federal government policy is - and whether Canzleramt, Federal and News Service has approved this new strategy, requests J√ºrgen Trittin and Green College Kunst.
The government speaker Ulrich Wilhelm resolved the criticism.
The officer has not affected the concrete impact of the federal weapons in Afghan, said he.
On Saturday, there were also doubts about the exhibition of the Ministry on the reasons for the release of Inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to the information from the SPIEGEL, the two goodtenbergs have corrected and completely informed about the background of the tanclaster attack.
Officially, it was noted that they had leaked the existence of the Nato reports and maintained sensitive details to the Minister.
However, from the areas of the two spectrum officers, they had even indicated the Ministry of Defence on several reports, including a double document of the commanded Oberst Klein and a field report.
The "Frankfurter General Sunday Times" reports in a letter to clarify the contents.
He has not received a response, it is.
The Ministry did not speak to the proposals on Saturday and pointed out that this will be declared in the investigation committee of the Federal Day, which would like to constitute itself at the next midday.
Sound worlds
Some see in waking states and voices that others don't see or hear.
Not only in psychological nurses and in drug smoking, the borders between immagination and reality fall.
As long as it happens in bed, it's okay.
If we have closed eyes in our dark rooms, we can uncomfortablely give the most wilden ideas and phantasie images.
However, who experiences a dreaming situation sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, in the modern Western world mostly applys as crazy or drugly, at least as specialists.
However, such images and voices are not only in psychological nurses or drugs.
Debt has our imagination power: the same neuron processes that allow us to develop houses, develop images or write Romans, in addition to ensure that the borders between dream, wound and reality disappear.
Soundly changed observation situations can occur in the different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case.
Even if you want to differentiate discoverers and effects, the visions of mysticin Help of Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophecies Carlos Castaneda, shamanic infringement situations, psychos and halusinations can return to similar processes.
Haluzinations or ideas occur when the balance of neuron botanics of the brain - all before dopamine, noadrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholin - is accumulated and the interaction of different brain counted.
Complete hallucinations and awesome thoughts often occur during a cruzofren psychopathy.
The weakness has no power over him.
The link of angry and dream has been employed with philosophies and medicine since the antiquity.
Aristoteles describes Haluzinations as a form of a dream in the waking condition, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatrics, observed in 1861 a "great similarity of the Irish with dreams", for Sigmund joy, was the dream "a psychose, with all improperties, trainings, sensations of a such."
It is early 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic figure.
His body is twodimensional and quiet.
The weakness has no power over him, he spends on the room deck.
He feels a trick.
Between him, flewed diamonds with blutrod, dispersed fractures, dental.
They kisse him, hang him with serious, flanking shoes, cut him against the walls, he feels the pain in the whole body.
Sweet, bad voices smile from walls and radios.
He can't take her anymore, the voices that struggle and rule him.
Henning T. takes two cables from the stereoon plant, touchs it to a sling and confirms it at a hake at the board.
He stands on a sound speaker and slings around the hair.
Spring.
The slinges will be resolved.
This should be a teaching to you, shouting the voices in a thrombole-floor chor, "Go to the clinic and let you get healed!"
Today Henning T. 40 years old, he has experienced six accurate psychoses, the last two years back, the first 20 years near.
She was removed by LSD.
His diagnosis is diagnosed with strofeefficient paranoid psicose, and also is man-depressive, he takes medically against depression, the Manie, the Schizoperation.
He has learned to live with his sickness, and he has been married for three years.
In the psychosis, I have experienced the worst fear and deepest disaster, he says.
The trug images are gracely reality
At least a percentage of the population is sick in life, in psychiatric clinics it will be treated as the secondary disease after depression.
In an acute disclosure psychopathy, interested persons may mostly not differ between the internal and the outside world, they are divided into an overwhelming condition that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or persecution.
In particular, the voice is distributed - the voice that commands, comments or dialogues.
Also, optical hallucinations are not rare.
The interested one is not able to divid the important ones from an uncertain, the brain can't filter cutting signals anymore, the consciousness is overwhelmed by the impressions.
Like the dream, the psychose also opens the clauses for a flow of ideas and phansians, which deeply deeply conscious historys.
The permission of reality in the psychosis is under-ejected, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, the overseer of the clinic for general psychiatrics in the University Clinic Heidelberg.
The shooter is situated in the centre of the event, everything has an important importance on it.
At the same time, he is in a passive role, he becomes, like in the dream, overcome from the events and cannot act.
Thus shockers often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality compensation is mostly impossible, the trug images are awesome reality, excluding wave.
Once in life, a hallucination has been experienced
Rather than in the dream, Fuchs says, "but remain the sense and space structure of the reality that is undermined in the psychosis is based on".
The weird thoughts and hallucinations falled in the reality, the proliferation of life is placed in the real framework.
Why exactly our brain capriolen is shocking, researchers still give up the race.
Exemptions can lead to a short loss of reality in each person, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychose.
It seems to have a genetic event on shock operation, but sliling studies have shown that genes are not the only determined factors.
Researchers show that there are minimum brain damages in concerned.
We believe that the neuron remission of the brain is cut in an early stage of development, explains a virus disease of the mother during pregnancy, for example, flights.
But it remains a race, as the disorder of the neuron system, which will not be shown first over many years.
Environmental impacts also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be dissolved for a psychosis when disposal is available.
Pollusinogen drugs can also solve psychoses, since they enter into the transmitting system.
If our brain flows warm
The crazy is that psychotics suffer under their hallucinations and smell tear medically to get them out, others give money for drugs for which to get, says the Psychology Profesor Erich Kasten.
Whether Trug images are acknowledged or inappropriate, it is often only a question of the position.
The boxes have been collected for ten years reports on haluzinations and appearances, he has evaluated its results in the book "The irreal world in our head".
Haluzinations are part of the typical symptoms of psychose, but also of the surprising many other diseases.
In addition to psychological disorders, such as border line or depression, the diseases such as miglines, epilepsie, multiple sklerose or alzheimer and skin brain space.
Surprisingly, in certain conditions, the brain of healthy humans is polluted under certain conditions.
Haluzinations, such as boxes, are assembled with memorizers that are normally retained.
They emerge when hirnareale, in which senses are processed, are overactive or too few; if our brain runs hot or even if stimulation is missing.
Drugs can solve this condition as well as brain damages or a psychosis.
But also the outcome of travel, stress, love chair or other mental exceptions.
In recent studies, until a third of the questionnaires had experienced a halusination at least once in life.
In the summer 2005 Sarah K. 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg and visits the Gymnasium.
A very normal girl, actually.
If there weren't the pictures and voices.
In the pause, it may happen that a shocky boy with long, dark hair applies it.
When it answers him, the students are surprised to see it -- nobody else see or hear these kids.
They're holding the shooting girl for a shocked dayroomer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream that she knows.
She's waking, she hears and sees these kids, as she listens to the girl in the bank and sees.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
That's a good feeling. She likes the boys.
I'm crazy, sometimes asking her.
But she knows that this boy and the other trug pictures aren't real and disappeared.
Tonight the appearances are mostly shocking
The trug images are often a loading.
When it sits in the classroom, it may sometimes not follow the material because the teacher is just a new teacher in their eyes and ears, while he explains to all other mathematical equations on the table.
Tonight, the appearances are most shocking.
If she waits in her dark room on the bed, which comes too rare and too late, it often can not differ whether she is waken or already dreaming whether the pictures that she sees, the fractures or the girls with the blowing sleeves of arms and skins, appear before their open or closed eyes.
Let me calm down, she's shouting the castles.
Parents and friends say nothing about those who would be crazy.
Thursday 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old.
She's got the department last year and lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she got contact on the Internet with the psychologist box, she knows exactly that she's not crazy.
Hahn is also an artistic work of dismissing
If someone is socially isolated or carried out under a trip, he has a great probability after a time of hallucination, says the box.
I feel that the brain is then underemployed and is safe for his entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, had fear of other children, often played alone.
She began their hallucinations when she learned with 13 that the man her named Dad, since she could think, is not her body father.
Since the same brain areas are active in view of visual and acoustic hallucinations, which also process real impressions and machinery, it is interested in distinction with Sarah K., Trug images and Reality. "All experiences," says the box, "the place of the brain, the reality is out there.
Haluzinations are also images that can emerge to the brain, so they affect so real."
Any nightly dream pictures also values boxes as a form of haluzination.
Haluzinations of healthy health are not fundamentally different from those of a accurate psychosis.
In contrast to shocks, psychological health can be able to recognise their trug images as irreal.
Consequently, Casters suggests his patients to evaluate the haluzination as special ability.
Limitation between dream and halusination
In our very conscious world, imaging experiences are most pathologists, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and Chefarzt of the clinic for psychiatries and psychotherapy of Florence-Nightingale hospitals in D√ºsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, unfortunate disease, but it also engages positive, creatives - sweet is also an art work of dismission.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated the so-called unrealized experience form, a special form of the dreamly changed waiver conscience.
Oneroids are high-complex, detailed Quasi devices that hold the experience for reality and which it cannot differ from the guard condition.
The unreasoned consciousness situation consists of extreme situations in trauma or disease, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience a motor deal in full conscience.
If a person of self- and world loss is threatening, at least by continuing, complete movement inficiency, he replaces the threatened reality situation by a own, imaginative world, which has been linked by the reality, Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of border situation between dream and haluzination.
Since the detriment of a situation in reality is not possible, a world change is placed, but the real situation is refined in immagination.
Intensive form of sense and sensation in an unreasonable situation that allows us to humans to do with no conscious loss.
Everything is real, even later in the memory
The artist Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his uniroid experiences in his book "Change of Heart" as the soul's salvation action.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness has been held after a heart clapper operation with afterward heart transplantation a day on travel while his body is condemned at the intensive station to movelessness.
Claussen comes in a self-created world, visits foreign times and places: He lives as a tragic, old man, at the board of a train analysis, a robot waits for his health.
He lives in the early Mediterranean under adligen who produces blood fuels.
When a Greek on the motor route is swimming in its homeland, his spirit bed is in the garden of the Alpen and is a Korean mafioso.
He's fully on the imagined stories, everything is real, even later in the memory.
These internal trips are fundamentally different for clauses from each dream.
Sound is another condition, he describes his experience.
On the contrary, my memories from mental travels are most clearly for years and in close details.
German and intensive even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience is the horizon of our other world experiences, says the psychiater Schmidt-Degenhard.
Last ends show oneroids, psychops, hallucinations and drugs, as br√ºchly our internal figures of the external reality are also in guard.
Each change of the consciousness, the psychologic box, resumes "that can lead to a transformation of what we call the reality."
A experience that can also be a ranger.
The Snee Incentive can come
Burden
Childs should take the association with 27 years of age.
The new chairman Kallen is a intermediate solution: Hubert Burda long-term wants to give his company into the hands of his two children, said to the SPIEGEL.
The holding will also be 100% of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The Trainer Hubert Burda sees his business long-term in his children.
Both children have 27 years old and have the firm will to join the company, said the 69-year-old boys to the SPIEGEL.
The details of this have been carefully regulated.
The question whether they are also active in the company will only take place.
The question also is whether they are in a position.
No 7500 employees can provide their children if they are not sufficiently able.
This brings the children around and the company also.
Burda was announced on Thursday that he returned from January from the presidency, and Paul-Bernhard Kalen appointed his followers.
The 52-year-old Kalen is a member of the headquarters in Burda since 1999.
First he was responsible for technology.
Later, Treasury's responsibilities for enterprises and, following the separation of J√ºrgen's dead heights, also the responsibilities for direct marketing, foreign, pressure and finance.
For the first time, there is no family member at the corner of the retreat.
Burdas are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The name of Kallen also serves to overcome "10.15 years," says Burda.
The holding should also belong to 100% of the family, said Burda.
In view of the cases of Schickedness and Scheffler, Burda expressed that also family companies are not safe before the department: "It is always the case of families who have been shocked from a captain view that had completely shocked up and thought they could get up to the very great player.
My strategy was never.
He had no world power dreams, so Burda.
I don't see me as the political preceptor of this country, as Springer was, and I don't want to play in the world's liga with 'Time', these loads have become too large.

Christmas are always closer and therefore it is a good opportunity to copy the appearance of the stars and take their clothes into our clothes.
The form of the decollection, which is very important for the renewal of the silhouette, is one of the points that must be considered.
There are some proposals here.
The Phergie Single has chosen an overwhelming and very complicated decollecy, which is only possible to breathe.
Finsa and Barcelona with the electronic car
The electricity company has created the "LIVE office" together with the city of Barcelona.
This is a project for the development and promotion of the electronic car in the Catalonic capital.
The "LIVE Office" (Logic for Electronic Car Introduction) defines and coordinates the road map for the inclusion of the electronic car in the city and agrees on mobility by managing, coordinating, granting, etc..
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is just designed to promote electronic cars and opinions and measures in the fields employed.

However, Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electronic car in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla also participate in this project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electronic car.
Finally, the electricity company has signed a framework contract with the Government of Catalonia (the Generalitat).
This Framework Treaty aims to promote the activities of research and technological development in the autonome Community catalonies.
These activities are, inter alia, related to energy and, in particular, their performance.
However, it is not the only initiative that is finally involved in the promotion of the electric vehicle.
The company participates in European standardization groups and has undertaken a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of peace" for the car sector
The President of the Government, Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero, was the prophecy of the Spanish car industry, which is the largest exporter of the country, "a horizon of peace".
In the presentation of the Economic Report for 2009 by the Government's Chairman, Zapatero reiterated again on the measures made by the Government to support the automobile sector during the year.
"On the plan on the competitiveness of the automobile industry, we had today a panorama of the degradation and shocking of some of our main production works," said the President.
"Thank this plan and the disposal of car manufacturers, even in future in Spain in a very competitive industry, we can see a peaceful horizon for this industry, which is our large export industry," he added.
In addition, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, the part of the Total Plan for Car Industry (PIA), has provided 800 million euros for projects of 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which resurrected for investments of more than EUR 3 billion.
The Head of Government stated that these investments are intended for the development of new models as well as for modernization of existing products and procedures.
In addition, Zapatero stressed the measures of the Government to encourage the demand, in response to the 2000E Plan, which are applied in cooperation with the autonomous Communitys and the car manufacturers.
According to the Head of Government, this plan allows to reduce the average 6% of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market, which resulted in a "forced increase" authorisations in November.

Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmental sports
Mazda wants to prove that sports are agreed with the protection of the environment.
This is why Mazda recently has the automatic stop system of the motor, baptized on the name i-Stop, a device which is available at the moment only for the 2.0 benzin engine with 150 PS.
This second generation of the Mazdas 3 is exhibited by its good notes in the total image.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its swimming behavior, the mechanism, the i-stop system ...
All of these aspects are "very good" at the new Mazda3.
Starting at the pre-apartment, you can find that the front seats offer an excellent ergonomic and good stop.
Moreover, the Lencrad game is excellent.
Another consideration of the unit that consists of the instrument table and the instrument bar, it can be found that Mazda is located with a variety of clusters and switches in the observing colors red and blue on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a future inner sign.
This style reminds us partly of the style of Honda Civic.
Therefore, without further information, it can be said that both the Mazda 3, as well as the Civic, both Japanese models, of the usefulness of German cars, especially by the Volkswagen Golf, which all wants to be overcome.
The bike route of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than the corresponding comfort so that four adults can first be able to drive with the car.
All of this comes a larger space and clearly formatted coffee room.
The stop and driving system is only available for the 2-Liter benzin engine with 150 PS and a 6-gain maintenance.
This engine, however, is a genius. It is developed by his feinness, by its leisure equipment, its performances and by its low consumption.
And all those who do not walk a lot of kilometers in the year should take into consideration this i-stop with Benzin motor because of its great comfort in the gang and its small consumption, even if in Mazda, mostly the models are the sales in the most important.
For the savings, the named model sport is a speciality, since it has a significant increased number of elements from the series of refunds.
The serial reserve is mainly the assistant for driving switching (RVM), which is designed by the dead switch, but also the elements for the traction and stability, the speed, the lightlighting internal level, the switch computer with a green screen, the sensors to park, an independent climate system, rain and light scenes, Bluetooth and audio bluetooth, as well as the discovered 17-Zoll flegels.
In addition, this version also includes, even if it is not enough for equity, the premium, which contains an additional EUR 1.500: other elements, especially the learning Bixenon switchers and the sound system BOSE with CD-loading.
Fazite
The Mazda3 2.0 i-top is one of its best compact cars.
It is particularly amazing about the materials used, because of his conduct and the variety of equipment.
Furthermore, those who do not return a lot of kilometers a year may also buy the i-top version that is available only with a 2.0 benzin engine with 150 PS.
The only negative in this model is a little high price between 21.770 euros for the model luxury and 23.270 euros for the provened model sport.
However, as contradiction to this high price, the Mazda3 offers us every day to the new highest path.
A premier with a lot of love
L.A. rolls the red ball of the sensation for Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premier of "Noine" the stars, closed in models, which appeared as elegant as sexy more than ever. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as always, decided for a dark "Lady".
The discussions of FonPeek
Peek is first limited to a device with which you can only read his emails without a possibility to see or overlook some attachments via the Internet.
It has got his five minutes of ruhm when it chosen the magazine Time to one of the products of the year.
It is to see on the streets, it's most likely, but the idea of itself is particularly interesting for young people.
On the contrary to the smartphone, Peek costs only very little and has a very pleasant flat rate, for example only half of the price of the flat rate of a iPhone.
After the company saw the success, there have been two new devices on the market: one that is only thought for Twitter, the other with a lifelong free service for data, in contrast to Peek, where you have to pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at the event Le Web, is the European version of this creation and thus its third version.
It has the same borders as his American counterpart, however, has a surprising.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about 12 euros in month, includes Roaming for all Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone towards the world already know what it means to refuse all the data to read their emails when you have crossed the border or if you are doubtless looking for a coffee with WIFI (or a connection with the background).
The idea of roaming with flatrate is unbelievable and should have been possible for a long time.
It is true that some phone providers already offer special contracts and prices for foreign residence, but my experience already requires a doctor title in physics and a good bright to read all the small printed.
The repeated criticism of the European Commission, as regards the excessive roaming rates for Europe, remained almost uncertain.
On the side of the own country, you have always fear of reading his emails and it with right.
This is a small device like FonPeek (but it is always surprising that it has the background name, although it has no Wifi/WLAN) is possible to offer this type of tariffs, it means that the phone providers must be slow, but safe and start to consider different possibilities how they can use their data network.
Childle has another good example, in its prices the download of books and other requests is included in the Internet.
Without Vetrag and without haken.
This is an Internet-based device and it's only one time to pay for it, namely, when buying, and not monthly.
And exactly this is what I also expected a day of FonPeek to buy a possibility with lifelong internet access, such as the Peek already offers in the United States.
And that's not because I want to buy it.
I'll read my e-mails with the phone, thank you.
In particular, I expect this because I think it would be an appropriate model for consumers.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's fatigue color
Without doubt, the color of the American First Lady is no doubt.
Until Barack Obama's official advisory as President of the United States, they appeared in a clothing and a mantel of this color, and has re-selected the same color to meet him with his, without doubt, two-two moments in his life: the delivery of the Nobel price in Oslo.
Michelle Obama had very similar models with both results: at least that it was almost the same color - a brilliant green-, made the clothes from three parts - clothes, Jacke and mantels from the same substance, and then she got something largely stolen or a hair.
It is even so that the first point of view had the appearance that the first Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the princess of Asturia and decided to bring the same clothes in more than one.
However, the two clothes are very different in the substance which they are prepared.
In the office, she took a clothes from pitze and in Oslo a modeled seed.
The accessories were also different: at the first time green shoes with half high paragraphs and secondly a magnificent model, but gold colors.
The fresh was always different: the hair were highlighted at this pack as a hairkran, and at the previous time she opened the hair.
75% of the professional mothers have been obtained because of their motherhood problems in the work
Discrimination in the work has been increased in the past years, especially in the young women who have wanted children.
This results from CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for Women, the study "Freeability and Care of Women in Spain".
The survey under 9.737 women between 15 and 75 years does not doubt it: 75% of the professional women see their career rates in the labour market, due to their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are great differences in the decision to establish a family and there are the number of children after working women or not, and if so, what kind of vocational practices they are.
Those who do not do any other activities at the middle of the house, only working half day or have no fixed job contract, will be more mothers and have more children.
On the contrary, women have a fixed position, especially in the public area, the creation of a family and motherhood, and therefore have less children.
"Whos in the age group between 35 and 49 years of age receives their first child in the average only 3,7 years after the assembly, a number that increases at 4,1 years of age, which has been used to achieve this, and which had been carried out to its assemblies and the first child's works a long time later.
In addition, the CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado also has a great impact on the maternity, even though less than the calendar for receipt,‚Äù said the CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account at the age of women in the home Council and the first child.
According to the survey, the age at the time of the home and the first child is so higher than the level of education.
This difference could also be identified in women's same age.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, after having only the primary school or higher education, women were at average 25.1 or 32.1 to the first time of their mother.
Furthermore, after their level of education, there is another difference between women.
While women with the main end already married before their first meeting, and their first child, they make women a second or high school end exactly different, and they are only looking for a celebration and married later and then get their first child, Delgado sets out.
Diane Kruger is also valuable
Orreal Paris has recently added a new name of the list of emails in the field: Diane Kruger.
From the coming year, the German shoes will be the image of various brand products and also say the generally known advertising term "for you are valued".
The main designers of "Joyeux Noel", one of the most elegant players at international level, will be a new famous spectacle like Linda Evangelist, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last ones who attended this exclusive club were the students Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millennium").
With the men, the cosmetic company also has an exceptional committee: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey ÃÅs Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (Evangeline School College in "Lost").
Price allocation of the British Mode industry
The Britishs have a major word in the modern world.
Your Highest Representatives - Models and Models, both eve as well as today - have been at the annual price allocation held in London in the Royal Court of Justice.
At this point, they were all appearing.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, chosen to the best model this year.
The poker game of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent represents "Poker della Asse" (Alfaguara, forms of Fernando Vicente) to the three-range round images of writers who have joined him in his literary life (and, in some cases, even in real life).
In this way, he does not use a predictable and horrible gene (corzbiography, life and work), but searches for an identity to the fleeging heart of the Creator.
The trip is sweet and the Vicent does not disappear any of the fears or lightings.
As far as this book is a weak reader, it is also a moved call for reading and always reading.
Here are some extractions from the book.
About Albert Camus: "I found at his pages that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but much more a spiritual, almost sensitive trib, as I always recommended, without finding words: the joy, in contrast to the unclean salt, the moral without fault and the innocence without any God."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, the Algorian Christ, he wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, between the power and the inconsciousness, with a poetical humor, without any sense, like the measuring that had almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was joined by this woman with a suffering that was delayed for three and ten years, whose emotions were cut into her bath, in which the fleshs agreed with the joy of the bride, a spiritual privileges that were to come in the heavens on the way of the divorce."
About James Joseph: "The Odysseus" was issued in Paris by Sylvia Beach in 1922. It is one of the 8000 meetings in the world's literature, which must be loaded at the northern port, at the wall where the best mountains are still re-newed."
About William Faulkner: "He was a comma shop.
Sometimes he said about himself that he would be the heritage of a good possession and another time he said he would be the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams produced from a certain size."
About Louis-Ferdinand C√©line: This writer took the pleasant cry of a bridge out of that personality from M√ºnchen, so that his echo to deep in the night of the 20th century to his literary way. This he made it on a journey, on which he fled before himself and with full violence before the wool.
About Dorothy Parker: "Another day she went and prayed: My God, my glory, I'm asking you to do everything in your power, so that I endure how to write a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "These verses of Spencer are covered by Joseph Conrad: 'The sleep after the struggle,/in the gate of the porters,/the peace after the war,/ after a sacred life, they are found in the death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In her bag she always had her depressions.
The husband took it with full normality when she told him that Eduard VII was spontaned between the Azaleans, or the birds were covered in Greek.
It is not the only other case where the man had so much patience and was loved in a neurotics whose literary talent was much greater than its crazy."
About Pio Baroja: "What did Mart√≠n-Santos do otherwise than trying to shoot Matthew in Baroja?
What, then, was Benet if he didn't get Baroja to the guns of Faulkner?
What did this do, except to destroy the spirit of that man, so that he might put himself on this power?
Feed aggression
My 70-year-old mother went over the last week through our city part in the town of Fuenlabrada, as a group of young people from 15 to 18 years near you and our dog, our dog is a mixed who we got out of the animal house, and the only six pounds, and then they passed two footsteps from the sky, and he was hard to hurt him.
Our deployment cannot be made in words because it is unreasonable to us, since the path should be against a small and unable animal, which is, of course, executed at the lion.
This is still the case of a woman who had been shocking, when she wanted to justify those persons because of the event, she feared even of her own life, because if such an innocent attacks a dog, he may also be with a woman, a child, an older Lord, or probably even with anyone who is weaker than he himself.
The incident was held in a normally quiet town celebration around five hours after the afternoon at a very common service day.
The dog has shocked the whole day.
Of course, we have made a statement in a nearby police office, but we have great doubt if it will take something and to predict any predicts from the beginning, we only want to find out that the fellow offenders were the Spanish.
Our discourage on the event has made us to show this event.
We can't understand what should be done in the heads of these young people, that they find a pleasant attack to a helpless animal, to a animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We don't know where the good education and respect for the animals and people remain.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the Helm
Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Transport Safety (Fesvial), called a campaign for the promotion of Helm use, especially for the young motor drivers, as the company is today announcing.
This initiative aims to take note of the importance of heat use, as it is finally the only protective element that can prevent head attacks or even death in the case of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign was part of its commitment to transport security, which "widespread includes the design and manufacturing of products that will be more secure every day" and reaffirmed that they also contribute to a step closer to other actions of Beijing and Informative Characters every day.
This new campaign for the promotion of the heavy use on the motorway, which is under the slogan 'Tobe or non to be', will be distributed in a first phase of over 500 motor routes in order to achieve the best possible distribution.
As a result, Michelin emphasized that transport safety is "a permanent concern" of the company, and just because it is bound to be a manufacturer of reefs for two-related vehicles that one of its main objectives must be the development of more secure products.
The sale of small loading cars increases something again
After almost two years, the market for small transporters finally begins to see something light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9.425 vehicles authorized in Spain in November means an increase of 12,6 % in 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first increase after 22 months, with a steadily decline, as a result of the numbers presented by the manufacturer association and the manufacturer's Ganjam.
However, these good numbers are only worthy of time, as compared with the reference dates of November 2008, which was a very bad sale year with a decline of 60 % of the previous year.
However, it should be noted that, despite the increase in the last month, the total authorisations of these 11 months are still 40 % below the sales numbers of the previous business year.
Since January, 95.853 vehicles have been sold in total, but all vehicles contained in the small market include: slow-cars, pick-ups, small transporters, small delivery cars and smaller loading/facilities.
Moreover, they are still the same skilled clouds on the sky, which are mostly involved in the demand, as even if some of the vehicles of private persons are purchased, the largest part of the sales is to smaller and medium-sized enterprises that operate in almost 100% of all cases of buying with a third financing.
In this way, there must be further factors involving these restrictions, which are the consequences of the rounded money department of the credit institutions, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the age of the worse economic situation.
In this panorama and in contrast with the personnel vehicles, the financial support has helped little when purchasing a vehicle of the 2000E plan.
However, this plan is not only for private persons, but also for self-employed and small enterprises to be entitled to buy a small transporter up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 exit that can not exceed 160 grams per kilometer, but the low sales numbers speak for himself.
On the other hand, Ghanamel remembered that it was necessary if the State was necessary, also a special attention to this small layer, and of course also to the industrial vehicles (last car and bus).
The Prophecy for the 2010 year of a similar year, as just as the winning of the sales disappearance (in private cars and passenger cars) is 19 %.
Support for Bremsmanagers in critical situations is now obliged
As in the case of the anti-blocking system ABS, and as it happens now with the stability control of ESP, the aid systems must be an obligation for emergency in the European cars.
In fact, they are already responsibilities for all new permitted persons and light small transporters, for the remaining vehicles, to the end of February 2011.
The measures decided by the European Union are aimed at improving the protection of the flights, but they can also help to prevent many accidents because of their work.
The task of the emergency assistant is to perform more pressure on the brems in the case of a critical bremsmanager, which recognizes the system based on the bramspeak power carried out by the driver.
However, this system does not give this pressure to the end.
According to an investigation provided by the component manufacturer for the bosch manufacturers, a third of the drivers in an accident was not yet cut into the Bremsprison and half of them had not been cut off with full power.
Up to 1.100 accidents
However, the brake aid is rolled with maximum strength in the fresh system and reduces the frequency period and therefore the frequencies delaying a car at the breakdown.
According to a EU study each year, death accidents in which flights were damaged could be prevented if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency attendants.
It would even give a fewer accidents - it would be calculated that every fourth accident could be prevented by person's damage - if the so-called intelligent emergency systems are popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that recognises obstacles (or radar or camera) and warns the driver at the same time with light pressure on the fresh.
If the driver responds, he will help the system to increase the pressure on the Bremspecial if it was necessary.
If the driver does not react to the warning and even if the cost is already unforeseen, the bramsachest provides the maximum pressure on the fresh to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors moves the plan for Opel to January
While the adherence of the Opel-Werks in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) has already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will be started in April during the first week, probably on 8th, the American vehicle producers pointed out that he needs more time to bring Opel's relief plan to end.
Nick Reilly, the new President of GM Europe, wants to achieve that the relevant page already exists its approval to each point of the plan.
This may therefore be the final document that first will be submitted to workers and then to the Governments of the countries where it is work, until the beginning of 2010 will be moved.
This shall be assured by GM that it will take a decision on the sale of Saab in the next days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish Government has increased the pressure on the American car manufacturer so that it takes a decision as soon as possible.
GM has to be contacted with some possible new buyers.
One of the buyers could be Geely, who would like to buy Volvo, but wins the option of the Dutch Sport manufacturer of Skyper, which has the Russian Conver group, always increased access.
If there should be no agreement with these buyers, GM could sell some actives to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to slay the end of the year if it has not been sold until then, it will continue to be maintained.
On the tax of Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their new and very tears juwels, engineers used the boxster S as the basis and really made it make it easier to make it about 80 pounds easier, bringing only 1 275 kilos to waage now.
To create something like this, they refused as first on the automatic shuttle that was replaced by a cell switch with manual switch so that there was only 21 kilos of aluminium doors that were used in this model, as well as the GT3 "switching" 15; by exciting the climate system still 13; on the other hand they reduced the fuel tank of 64 to 54 litres, so that further 7 kilos were included; with the construction of sportive bacquet sites 12 times and with the 19-Zoll floor, five retreated.
Then, by the switch of the audio system CDR-30 again, you had reached six kilos less than and through the exchange of doors by the griffes of the substance the lack of kilo.
Although it is also available with the double packing PDK, the test was performed with a vehicle with 6-gain handling, mainly on the smallest landscape streets of California, on mountain lines that really have been very slowly lost.
Only the note can be given to him in the conduct of his driving.
The decrease of his weight, however, has not brought in any case because he would now not be so safe on the streets.
It's the opposite of the case: for many years we have no longer tried a so small and easy model, but a feeling of great security at the curves, even at high speed.
He's a small athlete to make his muscles warm at a low gang in the necessary time, until we give him the commands to raise, breathe, pick up and then again out of his engine...
He makes everything that you say to him, the car makes everything we eat with him with our hands on the lenkrad, thanks to his lensing, which is precisely communiqu√© and precise.

A motor unit for all shocking devices
The sound of your V6 boxers with 320 PS (10 more than the boxster S) has been completely successful and you can still increase it with the 'sport' option and through a system that can change the motor equipment that has already been used at Panamera first.
The acceleration capacity is unpredictablely cruel, unlike whether from the stage or at the renewed speed.
The Federations are strong, but not hard or inevitable.
The asphalt on the landscape streets we carried with the boxer Spyder was already very damaged, but the car was well shooted the slaughter.
Electron Assistants had almost nothing to do on the whole road; and it was, although we found some of these curves in the morning green and roll speech on Sunday.
Complete, you can say that it's a extra easy car, a car with which you have an indescriptive drive passing, how there is otherwise rarely, and there is much more than just a small improvement of the boxster Ss.
The car will come to the market in February 2010 and costs 70.831 EURO.

The songman, a bus friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the cosmetic line Coco Cocoon and a occasional starlet at the modern views of 'maison', which presents her wicked face with the same harstyness as its shoes of channel.
More than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she's a "Bag Girl".
Basconia gives himself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral celebrated, despite the many deceased players in Dusko Ivanovic's mansion, a wonderful triumph with 82-91 at his visit on the complex flight ball field of Maccabi Electra and thus comes on the first place within his group after the great event of Mirza Teletovic, which was with eight trips of the best of his masterity (29 at the evaluation).
The manage of Vitoria could replace the significant deficiencies of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov by a large dose of use and team work, even if they were waiting for the end of their victory.
The great threshold from the perimeter with 16 evaluated triffunctions, Mae ÃÅs eventually contributed to their final victory.
The game started with the leadership of the blue reds, which started on the show table from the beginning.
Since the first four corners of Vitoria have been out of the perimeter, they could already recognize that they had come to the game field with well-warmed hands.
It was English and Teletovic, mostly responsible for the 18-20 end of the first neighborhood.
The second fourth was unlikely different, just that the manity from Allava decided to be a internal game of Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, which was received when he returned to the manity with Pfifes and Applaus, which is his home to continue to build their advantage to the pause (34-43).
Teletovic has already started to highlight 13 points, even if the "minus six" evaluation of splitters has already argued that this would not be the best night of Brazilians.
Despite the clear advantage of the pause, the game was still not decided for a long time, and the macaboers wanted to remember the Vitorianers again that no one wins in their game field, and thanks to the assaulting "Hand of Elias" they came back to the game.
Eidson and Pnini were decisively helping the "good" around the ruder (50-49).
More Departures
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but all other than the dead, had to prepare a few games with safety to get air again, and with one of them the pistols of Mirza Teletovic, who had almost three matching trifacts and the support of English and Ribas, were able to ensure that the guest was shown again a distance of (54-67) in the show sheet that was able to earn the guest at the end of the third fourth quarter (57-67).
The Alaves were broken in the last fourth, and English and San Emetrio (60-75) already announced that no one would allow them to remove the victory they had won in the first three minutes honestly.
Nevertheless, the named Pnini and Eidson, who did not and tried to give their manity again by three points of the line (70-77).
However, and even though splitters were put on the place for Fouls, the team of Ivanovic did not get up, and even though the Israelites still recovered in the last minute (80-85), the game had already been a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja's slaughter
Unicaja lost his autumn in Greece against Olympiacos and had to deal with him with the leadership in the Euroliga group B, and that in a game that was made by the defeats of the players of Unicaya (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially at the internal game, was marked by the Greek.
The Municipality of M√°laga had no fear of stimulating the hall of peace and friendship, or of the opposite manity, which may have one of the most strong Europeans and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their offered games in the first fourth neighbors, the Andalusiers began dreaming. A aggressive defence and three matching trifacts, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, the guillem rubio was broken with 12-18 in 9 minutes.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the first Unicaja, even though the domestic manner with a internal game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis made it that the showing table at 13 minutes 22-20 showed their profits, the minute, in which the action was nearly in the slaughter between the two American Beverley and Williams and that both were disqualificated.
The Greek team began to be warm and his overwhelming on two games, while the distinction of the English country Joel Freeland was caused by an injury and the three of the very errors of Carlos Jimenez turned out clearly at Unicaja.
Among their players in the inner field and the Lithuania predictor Linas Kleizas, with his three faches, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute at 44-32.
A reception year was impossible
The third game quarter was marked by many attacks against the massage of Olympiacos, which showed its 19 losses and even created the difference of the game developed in M√°laga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which brought the leadership into the group again.
Unicaya tried to move on the many defects and the distinction of the late shoten Robert Archibald during the game.
Despite the many parts of the Unicaya, in the 31th minute, thanks to the Federation and the three facs of Cook and the use of Lewis, there was some hope on 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was impossible that the Olympiacos, when he attacked and showed his overwhelmingness with centimeters within the corb area, could not be breathed.
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic created it in 37 minutes to increase the corb difference on 81-62 and Unicaja had to shoot up and had to defeat the leadership of the Olympiacos.

The President taken from the Office must leave the diplomatic delegation on 27 January 2010 if its mandate is officially executed.
Francisco Catunda, the brazilian trade delegate in the Honduras capital, confirmed the television TV Globo that "Mel" would have left the message that he had found since 21 September.

Thank you very much!
After the most locked days since the past spring year in which the activity was the predetermination of the markets, the insecurity of the markets is returned to the markets, which is in no case wonderful because this is their natural condition, in a area where the macker decisions are taken by nature from an unbelievable future.
The measure used to stabilize the market was to compare the debts with the direct sale of active and to allow indirectly the liquidity of interests to be moved to the null to buy the activea banks.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of Activea have been finished as well and, without taking into question their heerodox policy on liquidity, start to pursue some sand in the fields, as the ECB has already proposed with its annual decrease in the next week.
Therefore, investors are doubtful about the world economy's ability to maintain economic recovery without these heerodox measures and we will only be witnessing a change in risk prices.
The refugees of the bridges and the differences in the business boni are again increased, even though they are still far away from the paranormal amounts they have reached at the beginning of the year.
The States were able to register private risks and re-established State debts.
Now again, the United States, Japan and Germany are the preferential refugee of investors, which brings back to an increase in the differences of the euro zone countries in Germany.
Instead of this episode of instability, Spain came to Standard & Poor's and threatened a new review towards Spain‚Äôs evaluation.
On the other hand, a certain insecurity does not harm to bring the defenders of the moral risk that had once again tried to make a consciousness for the responsibilities of the world's economic policy, for what they had caused, because they had disrupted the improved effects of the restriction of creditors to lose workers, when they really had to decide on a new day of appreciation.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai is said to be a stammed war between Emirs to restore the power in the Emirates and the development in Greece was already predicted before.
A government that disrupts the State debt, elections and a new government that is on the same line.
Prodi did it in Italy to Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal to Dur√£o Barroso.
It does not mean that Ecofin Hungary saved the beginning of the year from the non-compliance of its foreign payments, and therefore increases a euro Member State to not meet its obligations.
However, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and its citizens to take up the obligation to maintain the stability of the State money.
Yes, we are as expected to have an episode of normalization of risk prices, after some explanations on too high amounts, that would now be within the expected.
In the case of Spain, no concern should be made until the differences in State debt increased with the same speed as the European company bonus.
However, if the European differences are reduced and continued to increase the Spanish, it would be a special Spanish risk.
The standard & Poor's is a factor. While the indicators proposed have a large part of the market research institutions to provide their scenarios for recovery for 2011 and to correct their scenarios above, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which returns to a Japanese market scenario for the Spanish economy, all the warnings do not permit long life.
Again again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although in the moment it is called "foreguard on driving".
Connected branches
The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio S√°nchez Gal√°n, was first before the Subcommittee of the Parliament, where in these days the Spain energy supply strategy is discussed in the next two decades.
After his arrival, following the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Gal√°n de Presse made some indications on what he had submitted to the Subcommittee after closed doors.
According to the President of Iberdrola, Spain must invest more than 50 billion euros from this date to 2030, under the predict that the current nuclear powers continue to be operated.
If this is not the case, the investments required would be not at 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola is thinking that you should not be invested in an increased energy production capacity, but in distributors and international associations.
From 2020 the issue will be changed and the performance should be increased.
His proposal focuses both on gas and carbon works with installations to start carbon dioxide and, of course, on the renewable energy.
In this case, it is the need for more than 18.000 MW, under the predictation naturally by other "supporting energy".
Gal√°n, who is the view that the Sustainable Project for a Sustainable Economy, which was just adopted by the Government, was in line with what his company requested, would, in any case, say something against this law how to create encouragement to national carbon consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all political strategies in combating climate change.
His view is "the long-term point is clearly on this direction, despite some" individuals, as they were called the Chairman of Iberdrola.
It is like that, Gal√°n means that the decisions to invest, even if these are long-term, should be taken, since it will need some time and create a stable payment framework to attack them.
Ferrovial receives the "Handling" from Aer Lingus on ten airports
Ferrovial's daughter company for aircraft services on the ground, the Swiss Swiss sport, is the favorable partner of the Irish Flood Company Aer Lingus for the bag service on ten European airports where they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement which has not yet been announced numbers has been established for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the government of Kastilia-La Mancha and the University of Alcal√° de Henares, last night, signed a protocol for cooperation to create an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructure.
The twenty-first-first-in-law investments were invested from 20 million to 2012, with 50% of Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be the investigation of energy efficiency on cars and airports.
Acciona competites with high and high-speaked buses for its first car rental in Australia
Acciona fights for the authorisation of his first car trains in Australia, a market where they are already represented as energy and water companies.
This is a tunnel that costs 1.7 billion Australian dollars (around 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German High Facility are its competitors.
A 5 kilometres long tunnel in the Australian city Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to enable himself as construction companies and train drivers in the country.
The city management wants to complete the construction end of 2014.
After the administration of public-private cooperation (PPP) decided to advance the project after an undertaking plan established by Ernst & Young, the management is already in possession of a final list of candidates for the construction and management.
In the expectation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investments are at 1.7 billion of Australian dollars (1.047 billion euros), with three consortiums in the last phase, especially from European construction companies.
The group named Transity is identified by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of the largest construction companies in Australia, while the second with seats in Italy, one of the best specialists for deep construction.
The Northern Direct Consortium of Acciona is joined by the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, responsible for infrastructures and the French building group Bouygues.
The third and the last consortium, which is in the closest election, is called LBRJV, which is formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (Austrian Enterprises of the German Building Enterprises, which is back to ACS), also an independent Balderstone (in possession of the German Bilfinger Berger Group) and the French company Razel, which has specialized on the public construction.
The Australian market for infrastructures grants a powerful construction and privatization work, however, has a warrant that is applicable to overcome, only by purchase a domestic construction company.
A strategy that has been followed by the undertakings of high or bill fingers, in addition to Asian references, and must be followed by the Spanish constructors.
Even ACS has reached access to this market only by its participation of 30 % higher, owner of the Leighton mentioned.
Million to Active
Acciona sets the highest importance in this geographic area for the sector where it is already known as energy providers and in the discharge industry.
Under the activity, it has already been its large windmole park (192 MW) in Victoria, and the group of companies that have been employed to build and managed Adelaide's displacement with a budget of 700 million.
His hope is now to consolidate these two areas and to use these synergies to obtain access to the two construction and infrastructure.
The suburbane motorway that is promoted by the Brisbane Infrastructure Office and is hei-educated by Northern Link (Northzubringer) has the purpose to connect the western roads in Toowong with the surrounding streets in Kelvin Grove (see map) at a length of 5 kilometers per tunnel. This is how the large mathematicy is to shoot up on the streets of Brisbane.
The driving plan, issued by the city management, provides for summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Even if this switch is to be opened for transport in the last months of 2014, it is estimated that construction works will be delayed until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
He has two driving tracks in each direction, an electronic mood system and a complex solution system.
The Queensland government is involved in the financing of $500 million (308 million).
For the highest, Brisbane is already a big business.
Australia forgives higher rates signed by a contract with the Government last night of 154 million.
The ACS participating company will improve the infrastructure of the internal width band with a glass fair cable through its domestic daughter company Leighton.
This improvement will create a fast internet access for 400,000 people and work for the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the construction project of King George Tower with 27 Stockworks in the Australian city Brisbane. The construction work has not started and has received 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it competites with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and management of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment is EUR 75 million.
FCC receives the assignment for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has been covered by her daughter company Alpine, the construction of a tunnel over 2,1 km of length for a car train in Slovenia over the total of 64,5 million euros.
The company has received this contract only a few days after it had received the appeal for the construction work to expand the tunnel of Bosruck (Austria) of more than 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens his experience in the tunnel construction.
The start of construction work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and its implementation will take over 32 months.

The Rules for Competition in France, France T√©l√©com, has sentenced over 63 million euros because of anti-competitive behaviors in the Caribbean regions belonging to the country.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted the competition at a fixed network and phone by signing exclusive contracts, price plans and faithful programmes for consumers at the border of the regulatory.
With this sanction, the former French monopolie and state enterprises have still accompanied more than 560 million euros in punishment since 1994 because of the disability of its competitors.
The last sentence has even been increased, since the authority expected by the competition is the view that France T√©l√©com has started similar crimes in the past, and therefore has come back.
Application trade
On the other hand, the daughter company of the French company was followed by the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application market site on the Internet.
In fact, this application site is active in France and the United Kingdom.
You must wait until 2010 until this seven will be available in other countries such as Spain.
The game at the Champion League has introduced Madrid and Barce since early 476.4 million.
The Championship of League has developed its income in 1992 to a source of income for the Fuƒüball club.
So much that Real Madrid and Barcelona have taken 476,4 million, which involves the third and fifth place of the Floodball club, most of their money in Liga.
Leader of this list is Manchester United.
Leader of this list is Manchester United.
The EUFA Championship of League, not only brings place with itself. It is also one of the main income sources of the large grain.
Liga has shared from EUFA up to 5.362.5 million euros to the 105 units (for 12 Spanish), which have been shared in this event since its establishment in the 1992/93 season.
Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The Wei≈õe Club is on the third place of Europe, who has granted most money through its participation and the only part of the AC Mayland who won the Trophie three times.
The official Catholic Master and the last winner of the former Europecups 1992 are the fifth place.
The list guides Manchester United and Bayern Munchen, two men who took the most of their money by their participation in the past Champoins League.
And that's what they lost against Barza.
On the other hand, Spain is only a third place of countries who could eat money by the Championship, although it has more titles than everyone else (fif, on the contrary to four bees Italy, three to England and two to Germany).
Distribution
This obvious resistance is declared by the complex currency distribution procedure applied by the EUFA.
In this business year, the organization whose presidency Michel Platini has in place is calculated with receipts of 1.090 million by the Champions League.
The EUFA 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 Fullball clubs who participated in the qualification preparatory (including the Atlantic de Madrid) was 2,1 million.
In addition to the 550,000 euros for every game that they restrict.

The last four gets 4 million.
The winner receives 9 million, in contrast to the second, 5.2 million.
Thus a flight ball club receives at least 7.1 million and at least 31.2 million income fixed.
Bar√ßa rewarded with his victory at the European Supercup in August 2,5 million.
However, the variable payments are still available for 337.8 million.
This money will be granted proportionally to the value of each individual television market.
The Spanish belongs to the first and has 4 allocated places.
The master of the last year receives 40% of the money granted, 30% of the second, 20% of the third placed and 10% for the fourth place.
The other part will be distributed according to the number of games they are playing at this year's expenditure.

The offer is associated with the appointment of eight of the 15 advisors.
The group from Jerrez provides a period of 15 days to share their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV assured that it was not informed about this offer, although the company confirmed that it had been contacted with the authority.
The payment would be of 611.7 million, while the value of Sos 254.27 million.
At the same time, Sos continues to restructure its business management.
The brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar have announced the name of Mar√≠a Luisa Jord√° as a leader of the internal booking test when trying to remain at the random of possible purchase offers and the judiciary of his former manager.
A decision with which she becomes the first woman who has a high post in the food company.
This is a new post created which is directly supported by the Chairman of the Group.
This is all different than the freedom of Poland, because the company has been struggled in a legal battle because of the suspicion of more than 230 million of Sos to other companies of the family Salazar.
It cannot be excluded that, during the next months, another capital is moved.
On the credit of Salazar, the ex-Berater Ildefonso Ortega and angel Fern√°ndez Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) were held before the National Assembly and confirmed that they had approved the movement of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV authorises the public exclusion proposed by the Investment Society Mer
The National B√∂rsen Commission (CNMV) authorized the public exclusion account for Federico Paternina in the past October 9, last.

New programmes for the observation of vehicles
In these days of accidents and accidents, KFZs are not only granted.
Each day, thousands of vehicles have been carried out in an accident in the workplaces where a good advertising has to be evaluated the damage and the costs for reparatory.
No single accident is equal and the calculation of costs for parts and jobs may be a long-term and complicated task.
The calculation of the repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros per hand, including the parts and hours of work, may be allowed up to two or three hours.
However, it is a question of minutes with the support of the latest information tools.
This is why almost 100% of the good newspaper uses these types of systems.
Services and application providers for the evaluation of accidents and instances shall collect the information they receive from the manufacturers to edit them later and provide their customers in the form of a useful programme.
In Spain, Audatex is part of the American Solera Group, the market leader, 80% of all guests are designed with its products.
The other two companies that competite with the tool Market for observation and development of a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data available to the manufacturer is everything different than simple.
According to Eduardo Velazquez, the sales leader of Audatex, is working with 63 manufacturers and importers, providing each of them the information available in another format.
Furthermore, the quantity of data to be edited will continue to be larger until the point that in the past five years more versions, variants and engineerings were on the market than in the whole 15 years before.
When a new car comes on the market, the business begins.
It is a great task, because each one of the thousand vehicles must be catalysed and set up its prices.
Additionally, a "intelligent" graphic image is created by each model, where you can click different parts of the vehicle.
If it is a lot of sales models, the work may be closed in one week if the procedure is soon advanced.
If it is a less skilled car, it can take up three or four months. Audiex is currently available to 99.2% of the cars carried out in Spain with complete information.
They have, for example, information on the Porsche models, not on Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the car park on the streets, there are more than 99 %.
In order to implement the documentation work and the manufacture of databases, Audatex worldwide has eight (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), distributed centres and each of them has specialized on certain brands.
The National Headquarters is located in Alcobendas, Madrid.
There works more than hundred technicians (normally mechanical experts) simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in the processing of these databases.
Each month they take 2,5 million data and receive their customers updates every second day.
The development of this huge information flow allows companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use of repairs and installations, however, there are also tools for the management of shooting shoots or for calculating the value of a car or rest.
The only company that is informed about a driver who is informed over the value of the cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex offers this offer not in Spain, but in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to make a review of the type of support which they provide to the sector experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star of the AudaPlus products, a standard solution for the use of accidents for the winner.
It contains vehicles, motor vehicles and light and serious industrial vehicles.
In addition to the costs for the parts, it contain the reparatory periods estimated by the manufacturer or the lacking prices.
This tool will be paid after use, i.e. for every guest.
First, it will be used for customers who are rare, at least 10 times in the month, that is 5,75 EUR per month.
Nevertheless, any insurance company, which offers thousands of guatachten, is negotiating the price with Audatex.
With other products such as AudaVIN, you can fully identifie a vehicle and the equipment with which it is delivered from the mounting band.
AudaGlass is employed with the vehicle schedules, and AudaSubastas is an online open market service for vehicles that are declared as a total chain.
Their statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, implementing geodemographic analysis, or maintenance of information on deferences to mark and model.
For instance, you can examine how many models of a certain automarks were to be carried out in the workplace or how many of them had been developed in a serious accident in a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company that is the development of this type of computer tools.
It provides among other Gt estimates, which is also determined for good workshops and provides the same type of digital images, access to parts or prices and official working times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Unsa group which was founded as a provider for services and solutions for the observation of damages, pines or warnings of vehicles.
The GT Guider for Gutachten is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24.000 users in workplaces, 3.100 customers and 53 insurance companies.

At the beginning of the last few years, they began to go to the international market with the opening of a office in Paris.
However, Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and was established in Spain in 1979.
According to the sources of the company, 62% of their business is active in Europe and the rest of the world, and 38% remaining in North and South America are working together with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 jobs, 3.000 in Spain.

Increased accident cars on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline group purchased a platform on the internet for sales of accidents and motorcycles.
This purchase means payment of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company capital, which could increase the remaining 15% in the next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value increases, with the possibility of access to a huge international market.
This observation and purchase service is excluded to sectoral specialities such as insurance companies, buyers, car rental companies, workplaces, shocks and cars that must be registered before their activities.
This platform was founded in Germany in 1996 and managed more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of them alone in Germany.
Their main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website has more than 1.500 registered sellers and 4.000 good newspapers today.
Every day, 3.000 advertisements are managed and are added to 100 new advertisements on the Spanish market.
According to the Spanish legislation, a vehicle to which the vehicle has been recorded shall not be sent to the railers, however, certain non-trained parts may be used as parts of the replacement.
The cars with historical value may, however, be permitted again, even if they have been suspended after difficult authorities.
Implementation of the workplace in four steps
The Auda-Taller tool ensures that the user receives a cost scheme in only four steps: identification of the vehicle, search for the replacement part, construction and construction of a cost plan.
The light handling of these systems is a basic condition, especially to convince the older experts, which are normally more or less against the use of these new computer technologies.
The database includes 1.034 vehicles, 666 vehicles, 109 additional cars, 137 motor drivers, 78 small transporters and 44 last vehicles.
Of course, you need a computer to use with Internet connection.
After the model to recover, the model is identified on the basis of the driver number, a graph of each model appears and then the necessary replacement is selected.
The user may include variables with the way the price for working hours, prices or rabats, and then allows it to express the cost proposal and give it to its customers.
However, AudaTaller is no tool to view like AudaPlus, but more than a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that it does not contain estimated worktimes at the location.
The use costs for this tool includes EUR 350 per year, a amount that can pay the customer without any further.
At time the Audatex company works to offer these images also in three-dimensional formats.
This is an innovation that has been waiting for a long time on the auto-mechanics, where you can select a door with her, and the image can then be fully rounded to look at the internal page.
