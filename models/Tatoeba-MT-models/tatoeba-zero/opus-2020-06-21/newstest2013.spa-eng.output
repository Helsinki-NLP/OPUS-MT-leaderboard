A Republican strategy to prevent Obama's re-election
Republic leaders justified their policies for the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brandan Center considers this last mito and claims that election fraud is less frequent in the United States than the number of people who die because of the fall of a raid.
In fact, Republican lawyers have not found more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One is true: these new provisions will affect the rate of participation.
In that regard, these measures will be threatened in part by the American Democratic System.
In contrast to what happens in Canada, American States are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
At that same time, most American governments promulgated new laws that difficulted the registration or vote process from 2009.
This phenomenon has been extended after the elections of November 2010, which saw the increase of 675 new representatives in 26 states.
Consequently, 180 law projects were introduced in 2011 which restricted the exercise of vote law in 41 states.
The new election laws require the elections to submit an identity document with a photo, in addition to a test of American citizenship.
Furthermore, these laws reduce the preceding vote periods, invalid the right to be registered as a elector on the day of the scrutiny and to remove their right to vote to citizens with criminal previouss.
Before the elections of 2006, no American state requested the elections to submit a photographic identity document.
The Indiana State was the first in demanding it.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the Indian Law.
Consequently, the Republican authorities were pressing to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years, these authorities have supported legislative projects in 34 states to encourage elections to submit a photographic identity document.
It is important to take into account that, in contrast to what happens in Quebec, American citizens have no universal identity document, such as the social security card.
In fact, 11% of the American citizens, i.e. 21 million voters, do not contain any document of identity with photography issued by a Governing Agency of their State.
On the other hand, five million new electors in 2012 have no identity document.
But, often, the obtaining of the requested identity document costs more than $100.
In this way, new restrictions affect young people, minorities and persons with low income.
Indeed, 25 per cent of Africans, 15 per cent of people who win less than $35,000 per year, 18 per cent of people over 65 years of age and 20 per cent of the electors from 18 to 29 years of age do not contain a photographic identity document.
And there's still more.
In many states, students, electorals more voted to democratic candidates, cannot use the identity document with photography issued by their institution.
In addition, these states authorize members of the fishing clubs or chase clubs which are often voted to the Republican parties to use the documents issued by such clubs.
Before 2004, no State requested the proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to submit that requirement.
Since 2011, a twelve of states have adopted laws that require elections to demonstrate that they are American citizens.
These measures are obviously looking for limited Spanish vote.
It seems that two of the three Spanish electors support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, the Republican legislators supported certain laws that approve the registration of elections on the same day in eight states.
Furthermore, they limited the right of people and groups to establish an assistance service to electors who wanted to be registered.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general elections, election campaigns contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens.
The measures taken since 2009 have achieved the registration rate of new elections in 2010 compared to 2006.
Furthermore, the Republican legislators adopted laws in other five states to promote the reduction of the vote period in advance.
For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, 33 per cent of the voters voted forward were Africans, while these were not more than 13 per cent of the electors of the State.
In the case of Spanish, it would be exactly the same.
These are not more than 11 per cent of the electors, which is equal to 24 per cent of the people who voted forward.
However, the whites, which represent 76 per cent of the elector, are not more than 46 per cent of the people who voted forward.
Of course, the Democratic legislators and their parties were fervently opposed to the adoption of laws restricting the registration of electors.
In this regard, democratic rulers have blocked several legislative projects.
The United States Fiscal Ministry intervised to suspend the most contravented laws.
In part, it could be limited to damage.
For example, only 16 of 34 States adopted the law that requires the presentation of a photographic identity document.
However, it is unnecessary that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Critical Democratics claim the partiist nature of the voted laws, since it is clear that they intend to influence the results of 2012 in key states.
A report of the Brennan Centre 2011 shows that the states adopted by these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required in the election college for the achievement of the Presidency.
It is too early to state that these legislative amendments on the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the presidential elections in 2012.
One is true: these new provisions will affect the rate of participation.
In this regard, measures will be threatened in part by the American Democratic System.
Detection of prostate cancer: Do you try or not?
Indeed, the PSA test presents, at times, false results with false negative results or even false positive results, after which unuseless medical interventions are decided.
It is a more reason to doubt men, already retired of themselves, about whether they should be done or not.
Is the test done or not?
We have requested two specialists advice.
In the United States studies, a large counting index was identified between sample groups, so it is difficult to interpretate these data and make strong recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed a certain difference in mortality between patients who had been detected and who did not.
The study, with a follow-up to 12 years, has also demonstrated that there is between 30 and 40% of the possibilities of metastasis if the detection test was not carried out.
So I recommend the test from the 50s, or from the 40s if your father has suffered prostate cancer.
African men have a higher risk index.
The key is to take a good decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is really necessary to achieve that the patient understands the risk level of his cancer. All possible options should be offered and not necessarily treated by prostate cancers that do not care for long-term life, in which cases should be better optional for the active monitoring of disease.
Today, many men who have been identified a cancer are not treated, since this cancer is not aggressive or involves a risk for their life.
Instead, we suggest a active monitoring of the disease and, if this progress is progressed, provide treatment.
We are always determined with more frequencies criteria to decide who should or not be treated.
I recommend that the test be done in any case.
But it is important to talk to your doctor to determine whether the test should be done or not.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool that allows to evaluate PSA's progress and contrary to test.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no wonderful receipt to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress in research, the adoption of healthy life habits remains the best way to reduce the risks of suffering disease.
We estimate that if the world would eat well and move enough, 30% of the cancers could be prevented.
"If no smoke, this rate would be at least 50 percent," said André Beaulieu, a porter of the Canadian Society against Cancer.
Instead, we evaluate that around 10% of the cancers are heritarians.
Many others are still completely inexplicable.
For the Canadian Society against Cancer, the fight against tabakism remains a priority, despite the reduction in the number of smokers.
Tabak is linked to 85% of the cases of pulmone cancer.
It also constitutes a risk factor for other types of cancers.
The health of people greatly damages.
"Actually, there are still 1,5 million smokers in Quebec," said André Beaulieu.
A hopeful date: 10 years after stopping smoking, the risk of cancer death reduces half.
The weight
Fruit and obesity also promote the appearance of disease, according to the CCS.
They increase the risks of mammal, colon and rect cancer, shofage, skin and skin.
"The investigations show that the regular practice of physical activity during the whole life is protected against mother cancer," they add.
Food
The body also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, they scalled the risks of suffering a colorrectal cancer.
Caracterical products should also be avoided.
The conservation of the meat for its skin, seated or salary may cause the training of cancer substances.
"You can harm the organ cells and lead to cancer development," they explain.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitaminal complexs and cancer.
However, their investigations are not final for the time.
According to SCC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While there was a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer in one of them, in another, what has been observed was an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer was not clearly determined.
Moreover, Mr. Beaulieu stressed the importance of talking about the concerns and the family previouss of each one with his doctor.
"Doing the detection test does not cause cancer."
Higgs' Boss in detail
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boss generated a great conmotion last summer, and with reason.
It is actually believed that this forest is part of the massa-responsibilities mechanism of all that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what is more, it is the part of which there was predicted the standard model: our best or "measurable" explanation of the nature and behavior of the material, which has not yet been observed at times.
But for physicians, it's not absolutely clear that Higgs is.
We know without any doubt that there is a new particule and that seems very much to the higgs bosom predicted by the standard model.
Furthermore, new data launched this week in an important physical congress in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although there is still no more data to be completely safe.
In all ways, we suggest that this is Higgs, because the possibilities of being wrong seem to be little.
There is, in this great world, a generalized and unleavenable law which implies that two things cannot be found at the same time.
There is no way to break that standard and not to try it too much, because it will end up of harm.
Although the physical of the particules is a very complex world, it has been demonstrated that there is also a law of these features: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which indicates that two particules cannot take the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantic stage"; a "statue" that constitutes, in great way, some of their features.
Physicals classify pieces in two categories.
For one part, we find the good citizens called Fermones, who wisely obey to the principle of Pauli.
And on the other hand the bosons, a swimming panda of anarchists who have no respect for nothing, or at least not for this principle, which means that they can be found at the same place and at the same time.
According to the Web page The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratory, which, in fact, is extraordinary, the bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons who aren't talking here, and the "force Partys" whose great forces of the Nature are propagated and with which the Higgs Boss would be in some kind of parent.
These boss, it should be underlined here. It's not the exotic bikes we could believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronic, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal bosom: the photo or the "light part" that acts as "mensageer" of the electrical force.
In fact, when a part with an electric load accelerates or changes direction, "desords" the electrical field in that precise environment; a little like when we lay a stone to a stone.
In this "desort" is born a electronic wave (of light, of the infrared, of the ultraviolets, etc.) and this wave is not another thing than one photo; i.e. one of the "fighting ports".
More Stable Fields
It happens the same with the Higgs forest, with the difference in the other field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "disordered" so that this forest appears.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electrical field. To activate it, it is necessary to reach extremely high energy, a little like it would be treated by a heavy steak where only a grey stone could be removed by the surface.
It is therefore necessary to achieve such energy levels.
The analogy with the electronic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all parts and materials interact with the electronic field.
Some, like the believers, do it, but others do not: a paper strike, for example, will never be kept on themselves by the door of a neck.
And in the same way, not all parts interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while the rest (which the photo is true), do not have it.
Now, what can you bring all these investigations, Mrs. Plamondon?
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS) and also allows physicians to select the differences between observations and MS predictions.
For its part, many want to be found, because the less difference could open a door to a "new physical" that smells some of the model's axis.
This, we need to say, has still huge deficiencies, as it does not propose any explanation regarding seriousness ('ups!) or the dark matter, which meets around 80% of the material of the universe (other ups!).
But we haven't found such differences in CERN until the time.
Impacts
The impact of these investigations in our day is difficult to predict, but we do not believe that we are wrong when we say that there is no one.
To see: At the beginning of the 1960s, the laser pioneers in the laboratory do not absolutely suspect the revolution that their work would cause.
They were undergoing scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, as the physical Willard Boyle already said, he worked in the Bell laboratory, where the laser was invented in 1960, and developed the first continuous laser (the first was pulled) in 1962, at the beginning the laser was the most well considered a "laboratory device".
Imagine...
Furthermore, applications can also be carried out from all the instruments towards the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle developed a light captain in 1969 in the transit of its optic research.
Although it was not absolutely its original intention, this captain now serves "hoo" for all the digital devices in the world, which valued the physical nobel in 2009.
That does not mean, of course, that LHC's activities want to transform our lives, but that they never know...
Paliative care. The best way to die...
In his Commission to die in dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate should be soon taken while a draft law is prepared.
Now, within that essential domain, there is still much to do.
Devoir tried to look for him.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was alive in his apartment in Monteregie.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a breath of two years.
"I had been given five years of life, but I already take this seven," reports, a pass, cut into her bed in the centre of Beloeil's paleial care center.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for this," continues.
The disease has caused it strange: a huge weakness that prevents him to go alone to the bathroom and even to eat yourself alone.
Sit up against a sweet lunch, accepted assigned to help you eat.
It is important, even to smile, to talk to the unknown who give him attention, to bring medications and offer a bathroom.
The value of ordinary death.
"My greatest desire is that they cure me the diarea, it's humility," remarked.
A few hours later, the team found that badly.
"In the course of our lives we learn that a man does a footbooth," says Peter Brodeur, psychologist in the centre Victor-Gadbois.
Return to your childhood, for certain people, is an unacceptable humillation.
"This depends on the ability of the person to accept that return," observed.
Because, according to the view of the majority of people working in paliative care, the great moments have been held in the heart of that return.
All patients in the Victor-Gadbois paliative care centre suffer cancer.
They have a maximum life prognosis of three months.
In that state, the doctors and nurses team that round them no longer provide "curatory care".
The biggest fear of Mrs. A., 89 years of age, is to die "conscious and gentlemen".
But illness made him discovering his children.
"I have good kids," adds.
"There are no longer desires in this life," he says, before accepting that a masker is put to him to help her breath.
And wait, in the next days, for the last visit of your son who lives in Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, with a group of volunteers, the body care and food assistance are offered.
They are paliative care that they are given when no more can be done.
To help your death to be more comfortable.
In Quebec we have a paliative bed for each 11.700 inhabitants.
It's very little, because we know that we all will end up some day.
Here, life continues in the best conditions possible, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the center.
It is already the level of physical comfort, emotional, spiritual.
In the death, it is offered with brandy or Pepsi, according to the request.
Diabetes are no longer controlled by their sugar rate.
Death is part of the cotidian.
Tonight we served a bird to Mr. X, who died in the night's transcourse.
Tonight, his son ended the bird at the feet of the dilute.
"We help patients and their loved ones," reports Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the Victor-Gadbois center the days are walking without being never equal.
On the side of a 94-year-old man who saved his last family meeting in the patio, well put between his dinners while everybody drinks his health, a 36-year-old young man dies tragicly, rounded by his parents, his wife and his two children, after trying to survive.
"There are six months ago, there are always three to five beds busy by less than 45 years of cancer sickness," says Dr. Christian Martel.
53% of patients admitted in the Victor-Gadbois centre come from their home and 47% of the hospital.
Problem of access to paliative care
77 per cent of Canadians simply do not have access to paliative care, i.e. the care designed to facilitate suffering when a nursing arrives to the terminal phase of their life, or in their home, in the hospital or in a care center.
And several bodies, such as the Victor-Gadbois centre and the community of paliative care at the Grand Montreal house, are almost specialized in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely that great deficiency in the health care care of Quebec, which many physicians specialized in paliative care, is the adoption of a law which regulates Ethania and the assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifest signed by paliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, circle to demonstrate its opposition to this initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, the health system of Quebec is not sufficiently competent to ensure that any person has the right to quality palitative care before it is accepted to go with Ethanese.
"Recently," reports, "I saw a patient passing 14 days in Urgencias suffering great pain without having done what was necessary to relief it.
I am afraid that patients want to die alone because they do not receive appropriate care."
And parallelly, many employees are obstinated with their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognostics.
The hopes of survival of Helen Richard were already less than when he left a slower chemotherapy treatment.
"When I told him to my grandmother that she wanted to stop the treatment, she told me that I wanted to stop fighting, I wanted to let him go," says.
"But she had said to me that there was nothing more to do!"
There is no powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the nurses who claim to die thanks to their caregivers that they have not observed their requests once their pain has been raised by a paliative care team.
But it must be said that paliative care is not absolutely powerful for the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of Paliative Care of Grand Montreal, patients do not respond to treatments against pain in a 8% of the cases.
At the end of the life, doctors often turn to the paliative sedation, which serves to sleep to the patient until the time of their defactment, either in sporácical or permanent forms.
We can't finish that we do not understand that part of suffering.
Each more time, non-alimentated disease will have the possibility of having that paliative sedation.
The nurses who are not allied say all the same, "I want to die."
But that's not necessarily mean "I want Ethania," but "I want to rejoice me."
The implementation of this report has been possible thanks to a periodism board of Canada's health research institutions.
Real estate scenarios in Quebec
The funds of Italian mafia-based political and specialists, the funds of the BTP, the funds of the Italian mafia, are counted, day after day, what they know of a formable "system", which is part of the construction industry, officials, political, sindicalists and mafious.
A "industry" that was too expensive to the Quebequens contributions, especially in the 1990 and 2000s.
"It is wonderful how the system is pulled once we cast the big media," Ironize Jacques Duchesneau, deputed in Quebec and the former chief of Montreal police.
He led the skandale stall in 2011, which was possible thanks to a comprehensive investigation on the injury related to road contracts in Quebec, that the first liberal minister of that moment, Jean Charest, had not allowed more than to delay.
Duchesneau report established a direct link between the industry, the clandestinian financing of the parties and the corruption between officials.
"After the beginning of the investigation in 2010, only the Ministry of Transports would have been expected a million dollars in contracts", some of its instincts have to remain with a proportional part.
The Charbonneau Commission "he has been cut down to two alcalds," adds, while expecting to reach "to demonstrate the existing roads behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit established in 2011
The Permanent Anticorruption Unit, created in 2011, is also applied to its government's intervention team, researchers and analysts.
This unit also works with the police of the Marteau Scuadra, which since 2009 have made that the Montreal's "cateway" cart is moderate at the time of inflating contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has conducted a series of charges for fraud and corruption against municipal charges such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, a crowd of a city of the aventures.
The next one of the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, which just diminishes from his Laval's 3rd city, Quebec.
It was suspected that it has been renewed to change public contracts.
It has been formally accused of engineers from Montreal's virial network and Italian origin businessers, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Z framework.
The latter has been encouraged by explaining the "system" mechanism to obtain public contracts to the committee.
He himself paid for three years a 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia intermediary that transferred money to the Montreal Union, the party of the Generald Tremblay alcalde.
M. Z area has distributed the right and left money during the 2000s, granted more than 88.000 Canadian dollars (68.000 euros) to provincial parties, especially for the Liberals in the powers.
He also acknowledged a collection of illegal funds for the former Liberal Minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Infringement of the cost of contracts to be achieved
In Montreal, the "corruption system" worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, an exemplary of public works, explained it perfectly to the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tours, restaurants, hockey parties and firms of the construction sector for a total of $736,000, all of this as a change in contracts of shopping whose costs were inflicted.
Other network officials have admitted that they received money for inflating factures between 30 and 40 per cent in the concept of extra false conception.
Furthermore, a counterparty organizer, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay to have done the gorge vision deliberately to a parallel budget and filled his suicide boxes.
On the basis of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay disappeared at the beginning of November and led Montreal to a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected policies of Montreal that sounded the alarm.
As a chain of the Rivière-des-Prerairies district, in the east of the island, it was opposed to the sale of a municipal field purchased for $5 million and returned to 1.6 million to promotors in full-bum boom.
70% of the money of the election campaign was suicide money
From the investigation that will finally be carried out, she ensures that it takes "of a shield to understand the operation of the system, infiltrated by horms, to stop the gangrena and fishing the guests".
And adds that the process is "sweet, but positive".
We're cleaning the wounds, but we would need a clean research unit in Montreal and be very warned so that doubtful practices do not repeat.
How to clean.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, on its part, declares that "the officials have robbed hundreds of millions of dollars", but it is especially concerned about the role of the "political" elected to the flow of the strategy".
Assuming 70% of succumb money to the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, Ironics: "I have said that this is not more than a reflection of the reality."
The Quebec Government proposes to limit $100 the donations to the party, but this will not change the donation, according to him, "as far as electoral costs are not strictly limited, there will be suicide money in policy".
It provides a complete review of the system of obtainment of public contracts and financing of the parties: "We can't fall down; go to the bottom of things, with valuable valuableness, will allow us to rebuild the house with more solid bases, with more controls and laws."
If this story comes to the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who would look at the shore.
"The PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This time has acquired a new entity with the PSG.
How would this progress explain?
It could be explained by a individual consciousness, but also by the new PSG dimension.
They've got great players.
Progress from day to your side.
The technical staff has also given me a lot.
And these elements call me daily to increase the level of my game.
On a party, that's easier.
Everything's going very fast in the football.
But I don't wake up.
From my beginning in the INF Preformation Centre to my step by Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed at agganized steps.
He will benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Anncelotti.
The reclutations of this summer are pleasing to discuss partitions of very high levels.
They know that every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give it all.
On the other hand, Carlo Anzlotti gives me a lot about my position.
He's supported by adjoints like Clude Macelele, who played at the same position as me.
Antongotti is the man who needed the team?
Of course.
Aringlot inspires respect for all the technicians.
Today there is no one equal in Link 1 and is among the best European trainers.
He has a great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He worked with great players.
I think there will be other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comfortable conversation with him.
I ended out of a series of blessures.
The confidence that you have in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about PSG in the first part of the time?
In Liga 1, Lyon has removed us the leadership position.
But we're on the bowl.
One of our greatest objectives is the Championship League: we have classified for the final octavos with style.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We're gonna try to get the best way possible.
From now, you can happen anything.
But we have to say much about many and very good European teams.
We want to finish our first link to Oport to get the back of the final octavos.
Can PSG become a large European club short-term?
You already have the budget...
To become a large European club, Paris has to win titles and be there for a long time.
Today, that's not the case.
At the economic level, the PSG is delivered to its means so that the project is concrete.
Doesn't win the cup in Liga 1 as in the last time, would it be a great failure?
Of course, it would be a great deception.
This year, we will invest all our efforts to bring us that chamber title.
In the last time we don't get far away.
In May, we took a deceptive, because we have met with the best conditions to end the first time.
We had a strong time.
We're finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we should have been camps...
But another team, the Montpellier, had a pretty better time.
This year I think it's the good thing.
Even if the big teams such as Marsella, Lyon and Burdeos fight for the title, I think we're talking about weapons to bring it to us.
Does the media expect more than PSG?
It's normal to wait much of us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We have completely accepted it.
After we won 4-0 at home in Troyes, which are still found with things that reprove us is a little frustrating.
We're wondering what more people expect.
We can never win 4-0 all weekends.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to start a game project.
A team is built with time.
In the Championship, we have demonstrated that we can answer and be present.
Look at the Manchester City that after two times, it has not been able to classify to finish octavos, and they have also invested a lot!
In view of the inverted sums, we would imagine you with 15 points of advantage to the day.
This would disappear our opposites and the French campeonate.
Lyon and Marsella, who weren't good at the previous time, have been seen "impulsed" by this new PSG.
That shows that the Liga 1 is sweet.
I hope in May we can say with a dream that, despite all the difficulties, we have finished bringing the trofee to us.
The PSG seems fully dependent on the success of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Better we say we have a "Zlatan dependence".
That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and put many goals.
He's here to show that it's the star of the League 1.
And he has shown in all the teams for which it's been a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect man and player.
And he also respects men who are around him.
What you have done is really exceptional.
This encourages others to increase their level of game.
Timago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, allows us all to progress.
How did you live Eurocopa 2012 with the French team?
It's been a deceptive.
I was very encouraging to participate in this Eurocopa.
Unfortunately, my lesson stopped cumulating time of game.
I saw things there, and I came back.
Today I can play good games in the selection.
That's what I expected from my baptism with the blue.
We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine, and this should be the case that we today have an example of behaviour.
What kind of vision do you have of Didier Deschamps' first month in front of the blues?
He's obtained results.
They are well situated in the World Classification Group.
The selectioner is strict, close to players and inspires the winning.
Like the Laurent White case.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
White has achieved its goal to classify us for the Eurocopa.
I hope Didier Deschamps brings the selection to Brazil.
The quarter (1-1) of 16 October in Spain served to sit down the bases?
That game gave us confidence.
Everyone fighted for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I hadn't lived a similar game in my whole career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
In contrast to current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing loads among the parties.
In addition, as often happens in technologies, political vision is palmable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of bank monopolies, leads to financial crisis.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonimo), is both a convertible virtual currency to dollars, euros, etc. and a safe change protocol in BitTorrent's way, which allows the exchange of files equally.
About 200,000 transactions have been registered thanks to 15,000 network computers.
And about thousands of websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a payment form.
Bitcoin quotation, after reaching 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, falls at $2,5 months later, before returning to $10 (the contributions are sent on the Bitcoincharts.com page).
It is nothing impressive if we compare it with global changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (BCE) was interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, the bitcoin was described as "the virtual currency with more successful success", "what works with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin is different from other systems with virtual currencies such as "credits" used to advance in a video game and that can be winned or can be purchased (and even in canjear occasions).
The social network also developed this type of system.
But in all exchanges, a central authority controls and treats changes.
With the bitcoin, all network nodes are at the same time depositary of accountability books, checkers, monetary employers and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually between two e-mail addresses.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, guaranteeing the anonymous.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed through a double key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that Bitcoins changes contain in the public account book, which is distributed throughout the network.
The key hito consists of writing this new transaction in that book.
This comes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers and winners, a type of providing central banking, will be the privilege to add that supplementary line.
This is a stage of changing file, i.e., of transformation of a big file into a shorter and unique digital wheel.
The computers "cohen" the new transaction and add a number before "tree" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular wheel (better cereals at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes are easy to verify that it's the good.
The transaction is then undestructively linked to the assembly chain of the other transactions; all changes would change the wheel.
If, to make a fraud, one user would want to pay two times with the same very fast money (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept as a valid one of the two transactions; the other would be orphan, as both have different shoes.
The computer resolving the challenge is 50 bits.
To avoid inflation, this reward is regularly divided into two, likely before the end of 2012.
The number of bits in circulation is, therefore, limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to 100 million, which leaves a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also shown in each increase in the calculation power.
The life of the network has already its albeits.
The websites offering services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins have been stolen in depósito.
"The fault used does not affect the same protocol," says Peter Noizat, who has finished launching Paymium, a real currency pay company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of currency thanks to this anonymous service.
But the money in effect presents the same defect.
The actors of weight like Wikipedia reject this type's payments.
Others, as the Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Initito in Israel, analyzed the accountability book and showed that about 80% of non-circle bitcoins.
In November, the "great powders" were launched.
"30,000 dollars were changed," Jon Holmquist rejoiced, who works for Coinabul, which converts gold bitcoins.
Peter Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on this currency, believes enough in the potential of this technology in addition to the transaction network.
Your system, Paytunia, equates to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions, so they get more cheap.
The portator also manages its identity and may therefore remain in the anonymous.
The system is easy to start in trade, which do not need to install new terminals or software.
You are enough to provide a address that a phone can "food and recognise" requires Peter Noizat, which ensures having thousands of users.
There is a general revision movement for the Jerry systems by horizontaler systems.
"Bitcoin will have a time to impose, but in 2013 might have a change," predict.
Furthermore, in its report, the ECB plans to review the different risks today considered high, where this currency is successful.
We've been out of Afghanistan.
And then?
The French troops left their responsibility area in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the United States must go to the end of 2014.
It is time that the African army takes the possession of their territory and the Afghanistanns choose their future without expecting nothing of us.
We have sentenced mostly to the Afghan campaigns, whom we have considered terrorists.
And to us, with our 88 murdered soldiers, more wounds and mutilates.
The Talibans account for foreign extremists and former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often also by campsites who reject the presence of the Foreign Army, as in the days of the Soviet army.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and arcades, even if their causes are linked to the ehiyadists, the Pakistanites, the Arabs, the Uzbeks or the Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes even helped by local insurances, these will not be anymore when westerns are more discreet.
The partition of the French troops of the Nijrab base, which has been observed from the height of the grains planted by the French credits, was done by order.
Track and tank tanks returned to Kabul without suffering any attack, monitored by helicopters.
There will be no impact of talibans in Kabul from the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed from their irrestaurable progress between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country shocked in fire and blood because of the fights between different facts.
His country's control was seen as a type of liberation, the return to security.
The Afghanistans have paid the price of the darkness of their championians overcome by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is not better today.
The old hamihids, the current government and the present Taliban are shared with the desire to maintain women in a lower position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
Speculators have been converted, with government lands to return them as solars for refugees returning from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from a couple of huge United States sub-contracting contracts.
They are unbelieved; most of them have not struggled.
People, as I heard in the field, aspire to a government that is not formed by ladders.
Many young people want to walk, as well as those who have been able to benefit from the American generosity: capital escape is significant.
Young people are hungry of war and their ideology.
They lived the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and appreciated their advantages.
With about 65 per cent of its population under 25 years of age, Kabul now has 5 million people, a fifth part of the total population.
In the cities, state collections are filled with both girls and children.
The young people who do not want to return to the darkness of the former parties or the corruption of certain leaders will need to work.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, is abroad of mobile phones. The television and its tourists that present a modern world has great admiration throughout the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who want to direct the country be considered legitimate?
The old commanders of the anti-Soviet fight are already concerned about reconstituting the Provincial Military, which will take off the central power.
Afghanistan, a mountain country of strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization in the pictures of the Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with a strong presidency power, eliminating the position of the Prime Minister from the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai did not want foreign control, particularly because of the elections provided in April 2014.
However, its country depends on the foreign aid since the 50s and even before.
No industry has re-established its services, no embarrassment has been corrected and the important irrigation systems have been reparated.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
The priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country destroyed after 30 years of war, government control would have been needed.
The smile that Afghanistan had incredibly cherished mining riches was enlarged.
And that did not make it more than increased the feeling that the westerns were there to stand away from them.
Without energy to extracte the iron or copper of the land and without transport means to export them through mountains, there is no mineral exploitation.
Chineses have almost abandoned the mines of Mes Aynak, leting international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) excavate the huge buddhisation and remain as the most important employees in the province.
It will also be lacking that Afghanistan and Pakistan, a country which depends widely on imports and exports, restore their normal relationships.
The French troops left on 20 November.
The new Cooperation Treaty provides for the continuation of traditional assistance: girls' college, children's college, a department of French at the university, the Instituto Franco, the cooperation in military, legal, health and agricultural, and the support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, with the aim of "going hearts and spirits" and to carry out the impossible task to make the aid and offensive actions match, a service of "governmental and military action" from the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), removed in 2012, took and carried through a small French NGO work of collective interest and agriculture reconstruction in decades of mountain locations.
These works, pleasant to get local work, have helped contain insurrection: rich, powder, powder water, restoration, fruit trees, sun protection and increased cultural surfaces.
What will we leave in mind after two million euros of military expenditure?
A more modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, very hard in those regions often located up to 2,000 meters.
The Ambassaded received decades of written applications with small agricultural proposals made by local communities from Capisa Province.
To be free of the insurrection carried out by the foreign groups, something that the farmers have told me that they want, it would have no need to keep a small civil aid, well controlled and reach them directly.
A Constitution with forceps in Egypt
It's a twice or nothing from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever about the constitutional declaration, which is providingly full of powers, he decided to play all over it.
He took the whole world a surprise on Thursday when announced that the Constitutional Assembly would vote its final text on the next day.
Only one week ago, the Head of State had given two more months to that Assembly to end their work.
And almost two years ago, Egypt uses a provisional text, several times modified, which deficit institutional stability and leads to courts.
This new initiative has made no more than increased fraction in the country.
For its opposites, the President continues to "train its word" and "thriving the right".
By its parties, it is assured that this is a measure to end more quickly with the institutional and political crisis and accelerate the transition process.
In the next 15 days, a referendum should be organized.
A very short time lap that imposes the sisters to refuse their project to explain the text, article by the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to restore a popular and democratic legitimation while political causes in the whole country.
Mohammed Morsi seems to be convinced that Egyptians will vote to their favor, as stated in an interview at the American Time weekly.
Bearing in mind that this resource has been voted very quickly, there is a ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "or vote my text or keep the full powers", powers that will be able to reach its end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in that strange environment in which 85 members of this Constitutional Assembly, in its large majority, voted the text yesterday.
Most liberalians did not listen to the convocation.
In the midst of November, a little before the constitutional declaration, they closed the door because they estimated that they could not be able to value their views.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, last morning 11 persons, replaced members, were added to all early.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Sisters.
As we were expected, the voted articles have been one another.
The commenters thank you, on the other hand, that one of the few discrepances of the day has been expressed almost at the time of prayer, so several members of the Committee have come to think that the time of the Constitution was bad.
The text, which was still voted last night, contains 234 articles.
Article 2 of all views, which remains finally identical to the Constitution of 1971, which stated that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law".
The salaphist parties, for those who were established by the Islamic law, were a fundamental revision, expected that "principes" could be replaced by "the rules" which would allow a more strict application.
For Islamics, that this article has not been amended is a guarantee of their good will and respect for the other components of the Egyptian society.
liberalians take it from hypothesis and consider that it is not more than a public artimage.
According to them, the Islamicization of the Constitution is made through other articles.
It is particularly mentioned in Article 220, which trusts at the University of Al-Azhar, in particular for all whom he must confirm its compliance with the Sharia laws.
According to the specialist in Egypt Sophie Pommier, it is worried because "the people called to speak is not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we see the premies of a theocracy."
The fears of liberalians are also increased by the fact that the next rector of this university would be quite less moderate than the current.
"For now there is no specific religious implication.
With this Constitution we are in the framework of the civil status.
The majority of the legalists who have worked in this text are not ulmas, but university, some of them formed in the French system", explains Alexis Blouet, who prepares a test on Egyptian constitutional transition.
But it recognizes that there may be certain ambiguity around article 220, as the terms employed imitate the religious vocabulary.
"We refer in particular to the term iqh [islame jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question that could be addressed in the future would be in the measure of the competent civil judges to be expressed above all of this."
Besides their religious nature, the voted text last has received many critics regarding the extended powers to trust the President of the Republic.
Muslim sisters will argue that they are few in comparison with those who were during the previous regime.
Another conflicting point: the forces granted to the army.
In accordance with the desire of the military, the review of the Defence Budget will not be subject to Parliament, but to a national defence advisory.
The processing of civilians in military courts will not be banned, as they requested the associations for the defence of human rights.
They also showed their concerns on the text, which are considered free.
The offence of blasphemia is maintained and, from now to date, insults are prohibited, which could affect serious consequences for the freedom of expression, especially the press.
Furthermore, no article emphasizes the protection of women, underlined by Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to it, the only positive has been the prohibition of torture in accordance with article 36.
The word was not included in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president had to go on the television last night, manifestations for this medium are prescribed.
The parties of the head of State were expressed on Saturday.
In Israel, the Ukrainian tourists are waiting for the holy land, the slaughter of the world, and a sea of salmir
The promised earth combines the glory of Bible truths with modern comfort and a natural prince.
"AIF" identified the five most important reasons for which Israel should be visited.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is important to visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this "bautismal pile" will receive God's grace.
And Galilea, the place of the miracles of Jesus: the water converting to wine in the wedding, walking on the waters, the disappointment of the torment and the full networks.
In this same place, Jesus appeared before his disciples after the resurrection.
But the largest of holy places is situated in Jerusalem.
The believers here refer to the Viacrucis or the Camin of the Cruz of Jesus (in Latin "Beasts").
Starting in the Force of Antonio, the Pretorio, where the judgment was carried out, and continued through the streets of the Viya city, goes to the Holy Sepulcro in the Gulgota Mountain, the place of the crucifixion, the Piedra of the Union and the place of Jesus's sepulture.
In this same place the symbolic Christian tribulation of the world is also found, symbolized by the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cruz in Jerusalem, built in the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree that was made the cross for the crucifixation of Jesus.
The most holy place for the Jews is also found in Jerusalem, the Wall of the Lamentation; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 DC.
As a tradition, people from different religions leave notes with their desires, which will then be realized.
Realize a vertical journey
The destruction of the Masada Force was a secret refuge against the enemies, which Herodes the Great commanded to build in the year 25 B.C. for his family.
They are located in mountain squads at a height of 450 m above the sea level.
And reaching there by their own means, they can only those who are dedicated to the scale.
Others can reach this historical summit in the funeral.
And in the northern of the country to a height of 1600-2040 m is the famous station of Hermon, where in winter months there is a great influenza of tourists.
Together, from the foot of the colline, bus services are offered.
The total length of the ski squi pitches is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, in the top of the mountain they were presumably living by pagan gods.
Visit Single Museums
There are around 300 museums in this country.
On one trip, you can't visit them all.
But it is the worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting ones.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (Israel parliament).
There are the ancient Manuscripts of the Death Sea or Rollos of Qumran, discovered in the clouds of the wilderness of Judah, and about 500 000 pieces of archaeological and anthropological piece.
It is important to visit the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
In its exhibition of paintings, you have links of impresionists and expressionists such as Month, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Bathroom Al Basha, which are some rooms of old Turkish bathrooms with figures of visitors and bathrooms at that time.
In Cesarea, it is the penalty to pass through the exclusive private museo Ralli, where it can admire Rodin and Dali's sculptures.

The Fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages of the history.
The most tragic section is the Memorial of children, built in memory of 1,5 million children killed in concentration fields and gas cameras.
Go back in him and you're in absolute darkness.
The stars are lighting.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries where they lost their life.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health
The three main tourist areas of Israel are located at the Mediterranean sea, the Red Sea and the Death Sea.
In each of them there are pools, aquatic parks, delfinaries and oceanographic museums.
It is amazing that in the Red Sea even in winter months, since water temperature is not lower than 21 degrees and the air calms up to 23 degrees.
The Death Sea is still more calm and there are baths throughout the year.
Indeed, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is at the lower point of the planet: at 417 m below the level of the sea.
The blue waters from there are a salmière that easily supports those who do not know breast.
The landscapes of the surroundings are really beautiful.
People come here to pass treatment courses with salt water, salmour and curative bars and to strengthen their health in cases of demotitis, allergy, asma, eczema, artritis, bronquitis, diabetes and to order their nervous browlings.
Topicing the mysteries of ancientity
The old part of Tel Aviv, the city of Jaffa, is in the Mediterranean coast.
This was the famous maritime route which joined Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to the legend, he was here where Noah built his ark and Perseo saved the beautiful Andromeda with who, in this same place, brought a long and happy life.
Tourists like to pass through the close streets that bring the names of the Zodiac signs.
They say if you touch the walls on the street of your "mysm" symbol, the happiness will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa, a couple of recently married couples come from all parts of Israel, and even from other countries to be photographed.
And in Cesarea, the city of King Herodes, can pass through the Roman theatre, "tom" the strength of the crosses.
At the Roman era, Cesarea was the main city of Judah and the residence of the Roman Prosecutors, including Poncio Pilato.
The theatre, carefully restored, is now used for night concerts and opera spectacles.
Tourists Remember
If he travels to Israel, it is not worried if his English leaves much to want: in this country around 30% of the Russian population speaks.
The money for this trip is not recommendable to bring it in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily changed to sketches (as currently $1-3.8 sketches).
Urban transport is mainly composed of buses, but in Jerusalem there is a fast trail and in Haifa is the only metro line of the country, which contains six stations and connects the Baja City with the High City.
Indeed, it is a subterranean official.
Travel to any type of public transport costs 6 squeques and by this price you can travel transborder for 1,5 hours.
In Israel, according to the Jewish tradition, Saturday celebrates Sabbath.
From Thursday night to the sun of Saturday, markets and shops close and public transport interruptes their work.
But Sunday for morning begins a new week of work.
In many coffee, restaurants and hotels only serve cosher food, which excludes sweat meat, marisco, fish without scams and plates where milk and meat are combined.
There is a wide selection of vacuum and skin meat plates, softs and posts prepared with cocoal milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a large variety of salts, the flaffle, which are molded grains, fruit and vegetables.
In the streets of the cities of Israel, there are no street dogs.
Instead, there are many well-nutrited cats that "spend their guests" implicitly.
You can see them at night even sleeping on the shoots of the shocked cars.
The thrones like the competited places and do not reject the golosins.
The car rental will cost $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) day.
Besides the security, that goes for $15 per day.
And the car rental of a bike will get him out of 15 skeles the day.
The entries to the museums care for a average of 30 skeles.
Israel in digits
In 2012, more than three million tourists from the world visited Israel.
Most of those who arrived to go to the country and rest were citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Earth, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8.000 Ukrainian tourists, which exceeded 51 per cent to the same index of 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime on 9 February 2011.
"The great and powerful" will bring you to Moscow: immigrants strike for the language
While Members and Defenders of Human Rights discuss on the consequences of the binding examination law have already appeared in the typical country that trade with "false" certificates.
Each year, 13 million immigrants arrive in Moscow, San Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Its only goal is to win money to help your families who have remained home.
Since 1 December, a law enters into force, according to which each working immigrant must conduct a review to verify its knowledge of the Russian language.
This rule is currently applicable only to those who intend to work in the service providement sector, Community services institutions, home services, and transaction for less.
However, with time, as they promised in the Federal Immigration Service, the reviews will be binding for all immigrants.
Furthermore, it will not be enough to make the review of the language, if not the Russian history and the foundations of the legislation.
The knowledge of the language should also be confirmed to receive and restore the work permit.
The citizens of countries where Russia is the official language.
They will not be subjected to this law to the persons who have been able to obtain their education and diplomatic certificates prior to the resolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Use, fatality and defence of rights
The network of research centres will be employed by the Russian Lengua Pushkin Institute, the University of the Peoples, the State University of Moscow, the State University of San Petersburg and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants can be presented to tests in all cities, now in Russia are opened more than 160 centres of this type.
The initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by the deputy of the State Duma and the Federal Immigration Service.
But the rights defenders, long before the law entered into force, have been able to make this question to press many times: What would it actually bring this?
What changes will bring to the obligation of knowledge of the language, both for Russians and for immigrants?
First, they respond to representatives of the Immigration Service, which will allow to reduce the number of people suffering from "working slavery".
Many people today talk about the defence of the rights of labour immigrants, Victor Sebelev, head of the representative of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
Defence of its rights must be initiated before its entry.
Only a organized selection system will enable immigrant workers to solve the problem in 90% of cases.
There are problems with immigrants without profession, education, those who do not know the language or pass the medical control.
Without the understanding of the language, Sebelev says, the future immigrant will be condemned to find people without scruls that, with the pretext of help, put him a "payed visa" to a close and covac, where he and decades of others as he are consumpting for months without food or documentation, working from 12 to 14 hours per day.
We received a syntax of complaints from our immigrants.
"In your patriarch they promise something, but when they are inflicted, they are free of their passports, they do not pay them for the promised salary," reaffirms the Chief of the Tajikistan Migration Service Tolib Sharipov.
Don't be angry, boss!
However, while so many citizens of Central Asian Republics who want to work in Russia recognize that they do not only know the language of the country to go, but also write difficultly in their own language.
Of course, this is not both their fault but its own deterioration: the turkmen, the uzbecs, the Tajikians, which can be given the luxury of receiving normal primary education.
This should be that their families even have nothing to eat kids, not talking to them anymore, smell them and buy them what is necessary for the school.
When reaching adolescence, these kids become attractive to work at the first time.
It's difficult, if you don't know the language, they recognize them.
"Another feels humble and lower."
However, in respect of the language law, the rights defenders point out a significant point.
Exams shall be carried out only for immigrants whose status and status are legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no review and, therefore, no official work.
While the majority of immigrant workers remain illegally living in Russia.
Welcome or forbid the step to strangers
Many visitors say that the official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause is in the burocratic obstacles and in the difficulties of the language in itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: 12 thousand to 10 000 rubles.
However, a false registration can be made quickly and for only thousands of fifty rubbers.
The Russian police employees know that we are generally taking false documents, we are not registered and the cases of extortion appear.
"We ask 100 or twenty-five rolls for cigarettes or tea", commented the journalists of Tajikistan, Umed Hushkadamo.
"Get, you're not shooting, buy a painting."
The first day of the entry into force of the language law, it was shown that not only immigrant register documents can be false.
several "false" Language knowledge certificates have already been arrested by officials of the Federal Immigration Service.
The false documents had been printed in color printer standards.
Of course, the hands of the new owners were not as a gift: each immigrant wants to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid by the document by seven thousand rubles.
This is two times and half more cherished than the official review procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rolls.
The main task for the next future is to protect the system against corruption so that the "disciplines" cannot be purchased, convert government officials and rights defenders.
At the time, the authorities may promise immigrant workers that they had not been successfully examined the first time to study the basic course of the language.
Furthermore, there will be work that does not require active communication with people who do not speak to Russian immigrants.
The Ministry of Interior does not take drastic measures against illegal weapons trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite reduced
The Ministry of Internal Affairs proposes to apply the law more strictly with regard to civil use of weapons owners.
This is the reaction of the government to the recent incidents: to shoot fires during wedding celebrations in which there were no victims, and the mask initiated by the Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinográdov, in which Apretar 7 people lost their lives.
Police wants to prohibit the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and to increase the minimum age for the obtainment of licensing weapons from 18 to 21 years of age.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma Security Committee and against corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the reforms in the arms possession law will be brought to the Duma of the State in the next future.
Not everyone feels satisfied with the fact that Russian authorities are trying to oppose this problem by applying the "during hand policy".
The network has appeared an open letter, which authors, representatives of various social organizations of thieves, require that such measures be denied from "regulations without sense".
The percentage of vandalism acts with registered weapons is minimum, commented on the BBC news service, the criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lésnikov.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Interior, 142 crimes were conducted with fire weapons registered in Interior bodies for six months of 2012, against the total of 1168 crimes registered for this same period.
The authors of the open letter are safe that a more strict legislation in the civil use sector will not be an inconvenient inconvenience in order to lead the criminal to the black market.
Now, according to his words, in Moscow any weapons can be found under price.
However, the Ministry of Interior states that the situation of proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Providers: from factories to officials
The weapons' weapons market is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are years of age, says the colonel Victor Baranets, who has worked in the Ministry of Education and the High State of Mayor for ten years.
Screen capture of the website accepting weapons requests
The first, "walking of the army or military", namely, the weapons that were robbed during military action in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were shocked by Russian officials and the same cocaine officials," says Baranets.
The following type of black weapons, robbed by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that the weapons of the police stocks are included here and those slaughtered directly by officials of law enforcement bodies.
Illicit weapons go to sale from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals, there were explosions often.
"There are evidenced versions that some fires were caused premeditely to cover the lack," says a exmiliator.
According to Baranets, weapons manufacturers also put their sand grant.
"Here they have proliferated private weapons manufactures that are not competitive on the international market and distribute weapons under the weapon market, including the Moscow's", says the experts.
A more source of the black market is the contraband.
A large number of weapons and ametrailers come from poor countries like Kirgistan.
"There are with its own production, sometimes artisanal, and a mafia that has organized the weapons flux", explains the former military.
Where are the weapons coming?
Experts have calculated the nearly participation of each of these sources of illegal weapons supply to the black market.
A report on this issue was drafted in 2011 by the Public Management Analysis Centre.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of Interior and Rosstat, criminalization library, and public port access data whose thematic thema is around arms.
The large majority of illegal weapons, according to researchers, come from armed forces and security forces.
The half of the weapons of the black market has come there "for the fault of officials whose work is related to the weapon", says in the report.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of the weapons are coming from places where armed conflicts are stolen, 14 per cent of the cases were stolen during the production of weapons and 5 per cent corresponds to the "illicit architecture".
The dependant of one of the weapons shops, which asked his call not to be mentioned, says that weapons found by illegal scatters do not buy them anybody for a long time because they are too old.
More often, it says, suppliers are directed to military stocks when they need a game.
By means of some alferes, the supplier buys a unit, for example a TT gun.
They remove the record and pass it above the authority.
"This takes the weapon to the city and sell it to 900 euros per unit with two loaders," we account
"But, of course, the police is both of all matters, and regularly, when the crime detection plan is to meet, they make test purchases to illegal weapons traders," adds the dependant.
"Come in a luxury bottle."
The seller and the buyer are often found through known people.
"Web pages and blogs until a guy I propose to go to the "Begovaya" platform where a man would bring me to a "squinite" where we could negotiate.
From the weapon price, I entered it only there."
Commander Victor Baranets
"To get a weapon, I need a friend who has contacts," says the shop dependant. "I have a friend so, but I don't trust much in him."
There are sellers in the markets, but there is also need to arrive, we say "of Mr. Ivanovih, who asked him to say that a dent had fallen to his daughter."
I can even get a pair of steel hands through a person of confidence.
He also provides them to me only because he knows I'm not going to drag him out.
The new ones are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military Victor Baranets was tested in the role of an illegal weapons purchaser in the mid-90s when a article on this subject was available.
The schemes, according to their words, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album where he wasn't "of all".
"I felt like in a luxury bottle," remembers the military.
The buyer, according to Baranets' words, does not offer him a cat for love: everything that is possible to prove.
I, as potential customer, not only bought; I'll go with the seller to the forest, where we put a white.
"I give me the opportunity to shoot, and when I assure that the weapon shoots well, we start to negotiate", describes the expert.
Sofaa-to-power
Web search engines lead to "Vkontakte" sites and groups where weapons are offered for different purposes.
In this regard, no document or personal meetings are required.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the title of the advertising advertising advertising "Buy a weapon or a gun."
There users make their requests and ask questions.
And they're sell to age?
"No permission, of course," asked the user "Iván" (conserved ortography).
"That weapons TT. Moscú", laconally makes his question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a wide network of fixed web sites and captured two hands to those who want to buy fire weapons.
And the people go, as a fish hungry to the cerebrous, and then extract carbon in Siberia
Military commenter and exhibit Victor Baranets
I heard about these systems: generally, the website is registered outside the range of Russian laws.
People make the requests.
The buyer performs the payment through an automatic box.
"In response, send a photo and instructions to know where the weapon is hidden," reports the NGO's Press secretariat "The right to weapons", Dmitri Kislov.
Victor Baranets states that if a online request is made, one stays without weapons and put it into prison.
The Federal Security Service has created a wide network of fixed web sites and captured two hands to those who want to buy fire weapons.
"And the people go, as a hungry fish to the cerebrous, and then to extract carbon in Siberia," he says.
Makarov for $100
In the purchase of illegal fire weapons, according to experts, one may be paid to $100 to $900.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO 'The Right to Arms', a Makarov gun can be purchased for $100-300.
You must wait for a month and a half.
It is sent from military stocks by the heads of a medium-range.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry, compared to the January-October 2011 period, the total number of these crimes in Russia was at 7 per cent, which represents 22.900, and the number of cases identified in arms, munitions, explosive and explosive artefacts reduced by 7.8 per cent.
Employees of fast and supermarket food restaurants in the U.S.
Even a fourth part of the United States adolescents find their first jobs as "McDonald's" in "McDonald's"
In the past days, a protest gallery has been launched against the low salary payments in Walmart corporation supermarkets and in restaurants of rapid food chain, such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
For now, no one is trying to warn if he's coming or not to the nine points, or if he's intended to lose strengths and smell in his first stages.
Protection actions are supported by the sindicates and a series of left NGOs.
In addition to increased wage modests resulted from the workers of Walmart and the fast food system, the objective of protest organizers is the creation of workers' trade trade.
For now, this sector of the economy has not been employed by the sindical movement.
Four and six hundred per year?
The actions started last week, after the Day of Thanksgiving, the called "Negro Viernces". On that day, in the United States, he cohered the body of floors which captured millions of people, and sometimes was accompanied by conflicts.
On that day, some workers of the Walmart corporation, who are employed at 2,2 million people in the world, abandoned their jobs and formed protest pickets together with the syndicates and left-seat activists in corporation shops, whose products lead to people of modest and moderate income.
Walmart sold from all, from swimming pools, swimming pools and car batteries, even aspirators, eggs and milk.
The products in their shops are average between 8% and 27% more cost than those of the largest supermarkets.
That's why many badly paid workers from Walmart are buying only in the job.
Availability and extent of products have made from Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to the words of two critics, Walmart can be allowed to sell products very low prices, in part because they pay little to their workers.
These are also the bad working conditions such as the lack of mounting or hand scanners.
The "Noir Weirs" members of the manifestation requested the increase in payment and remained the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation passed from 30 to 100 monthly.
For a typical Walmart worker, who receives $9.5 per hour, this expenditure is too much, they said.
Scientifics at the University of California in Berkeley argued that if Walmart increases the average payment up to $12 per hour, this will cost $3.2 billion.
This is about 1,1% more than it costs in loans now.
If Walmart puts the wage increase in the shadows of consumers, each visit to the shop will result in only 46 percent more precious.
In one year, they will cost the rigid amount of $12,39 more than they cost now.
Walmart's parties commented satisfactoryly that the protest had so much place in nine states and that there was no loss to corporation.
The "Noir Wednes" was extended in its shops from Tuesday from 8 to midnight next day and, during that time, Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In total, its registered boxes performed the "Negro Wednes" almost 100 million transactions.
The representative of the company, Dan Fogelman, declared in an interview to the left Huffington Post website, which left his work position "minus of five" employees from Walmart and that the protest was not more than "other truck of public relations", organized by the workshop.
"Chaja free!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where the objectives were not exactly the Walmart large stocks (which has no appreciation in this progressist city, and therefore there is no one now, but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says that sales thousands of thousands of parts, and then they don't even give you low for disease and don't pay you for your honest work!
Jumae Williams, New York Municipal Council member
Today, according to the Federal and New York Act, the minimum payment is $7.25 per hour.
Quick food restaurants will increase it with time, but only slightly, and in average, ordinary workers receive $8.90 per hour in New York.
No one wins less than they're in this city.
How you can survive in New York with that money, for me is something incomprehensible.
There was a time when almost fourth part of the US adolescents passed through the McDonalds and worked there, behind the showers, partly after school, although they still lived with their parents.
Some were those who saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, constantly tropical in some interviews with McDonald's workers who want to live from this salary, and sometimes even even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a forum of the Wall Street Journal, there is a comment that the author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if you don't know what to eat.
The protest participants, which started on Thursday 6:30 on Thursday morning at McDonald's 40th Street and Madison Avenue, requested that fast food chairs and kitchens start to pay at least $15 per hour, or that their current minimum payment was duplicated.
They were also required to create workers' syndicates in the rapid food sector.
The U.S. Law prohibited the administration to prevent them from this right and punish the workshops of the synagogue movement with arguments and disappointments.
On the other hand, administration is rarely facilitating their lives.
However, for objective reasons, it is easy for the syndicates to cover the rapid food sector.
One of the main ones is the excessive rotation of staff.
Discords
Ruidos protests had the same day in other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action was placed by half of the mitin in the McDonald's location near Times Square, where several local democratic politicians participated, in particular the member of the Municipal Council of the city Jumae Williams, who said: "McDonald's says that he sell thousands of portions, and then not even gives you a hospital or pays you for your honest work."
The protesters received the support of other highlighted democrats from New York, for example, for example, from the candidate to the home of the city Bill de Blasio, which said "We must support the workers of the fast food sector so that it can receive fair wages and the economic prosperity of each neoyorkino."
As the New York Times described, this was the greatest manifestation of this type in the American eating history.
But in it, only a few hundreds of people, even not all of them were employed in the fast food service, where they worked tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is still not clear if this will serve from chispa to cause massive movement.
"To now, lie to the brain does not result so easy."
The theme of the increased reality, so popular between modern technologies, is recently generally understood through special data.
At the beginning of the summer, in his annual Google conference, a model in movement was shown and later, in November, was known that Microsoft had also submitted a request to claim the relevant patent.
However, on a conversation with the head of the interactive 3D technologie group in the Microsoft laboratory of Cambridge, Izadi Sharamom, was disappointed that for the scientists of that company, donations were already belonging to a past stage.
They affect the perspective of manipulation of virtual objects in the air with swimming hands and the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the object of study of your research group?
- We are dedicated to the individual-orienter interaction, but we also tried to expand the limits of this interaction.
For now, humanity in its large mass has been touched in the work stage with the pixels of the planet screen, sometimes touching the finger.
But we want to look forward to 5-10 years and advertise the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors represent a step forward, and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as it is interested in control by shoots.
- What else is our future?
- Despite Kinect has brought interaction to the physical level, most of this is still happening in a plate screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is not very good.
We are trying to change this, we are working in really three-dimensional visualisation systems, based on different technologies, including design systems.
The world of computers must be freed to our, physically, to do more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognise not only the user, but also the space that it runs.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, the hell with those twins of virtual reality!
- What do you think about the voice control?
A very popular detail, but do you don't think they overcome it?
- Of course, you can't be considered a panacea, it remains quite slow to solve the question of privacy, since the others are not always wanting to know about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in their own field.
For example, for the control of devices on public places, we had a project in which we thought on shoes, but not in slight movements, but more shorter.
Moreover, the shoes were captured not by the camera of the device, but by a pulse that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.
For now it's very big, but in the theory it can be reduced to the size of a pulsing watch.
But in general, the future is for a combinated type of control, for example, loop + voice.
- How is that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this soda side?
You will talk and show it at the same time.
- Normally I'm just talking.
- Oh, that'll be very difficult to recognise.
- Or, do you want to force users to adapt to what you can or can't do the machine at this time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I think in the next future, we will have to work primarily in the design of new types of sensors that can determine the reactions of the person precisely.
These may, for example, be laser sensors, because they provide a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you have from the modern cameras?
Do you miss resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with the three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in megapixels, but in the quality of matrix and depth.
Since this last point of view, all current technologies are not enough for us; this gives more work to the algorithm designers.
Or, that we must remember not only the resolution in the X and Y edges, but also in Z.
It is also important the speed, the number of tables per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the current 30 fps are really low, especially for shoes.
Steven Bathiche, from our laboratory in Redmond, made a contact sensor with adjustable delay of 1 to 100 m and can be mentioned that the modern sensors produced in series are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the human-machine interaction.
I would be very useful for my work a equivalent of that device, but it does not require contact to make the tables more.
- And isn't it necessary to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is in fact the emiser of infrared rays, and the second of the reflected signal receiver.
But the third camera is actually a simple sensor of the visible diapath.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Positively, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or instead, it increases and increases the amount required for calculations.
It would be good to create a flexible analog of Kinect, play with the camera location curve and see how this would help to determine the three-dimensional position.
- For what I remember, Microsoft, on the other hand of Google, has not presented his gifts to the public.
Does it not seem to be that from the view of the daily use of realized technologies, the gifts are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, passing all therats with a intelligent phone in the hands, it's not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be an increased "transmutable" reality when, on the basis of a cloud platform, you could pass from the donations to the intelligent phone,
The donations are very personal devices, in that it is your strength (private things can only see them), but also their weakness: an increased reality based on donations will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Imagine that the manipulation of virtual hologic objects in the air is not only available for Tony Stark's film "Iron Man", but also for any simple mortal.
There is a problem in this idea that the critics often point out: there is no tactic response!
The hands don't feel anything!
What answers will your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my conferences I often say that the increased reality is the seventh irruption in the interaction between man and machine.
I think it could be the addition of tactic feelings.
However, one of the most interesting trucks is the use of the second hand in quality support for the image.
Register the tattoo perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are really directed to bring tangibility to these "images in the air". For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed to a specific point where the deed is found by a sense similar to that one feels if someone was overlooking it in the eggs of the deeps, but this feeling is still very weak.
There are also pulses for the munique that affects the nervous conclusions of the teeth, this is also a promised address.
- Have you been trying to lie the brain?
Do you think he feels what he seems to be feeling at the time you see something?
- That's a good idea, we're not trying.
Here we hide another challenge with which we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very lower space believes that is going to an open space, almost without end. We are working also in the idea of the hurry cincins (not as the gymnasiums), mobile platforms, as well as in the magnificent globals.
For now, lingering to the brain does not result so easy, there is still need to work for many years.
That's what the work does with the virtual reality for researchers, which many things are found in a total conception state.
Subjective personal interest in place of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the "Vanguardism of San Petersburgo" project dedicated to the citizens who are in front, to the guard of art and culture.
In this list of best figures of the art and the scene of St. Petersburg, whose successes arrive beyond the city, are often recognized in Europe without the Russians even knowing them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city is known to Kirill Miller, a swimming man on the top of red, which can be found near the Russian Museum, near the winter garden, or in modes and inaugurations meetings.
Kirill Miller's tables always affect multitudes, where they wanted to be exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely sociophylophylophysicians of San Petersburgo, creators of new mythology.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the Vanguardism of San Petersburgo at the end of the 80th century.
Moreover, it is a cityman whose appearance appears on the streets of the city smiling in the dreams and upsets all the spirit states.
Recently, he took into his hands a organ and became the organist of San Petersburgo, since he has trained to make such a hard role, for his existence of bohemia, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you going to the red town, not to love or turk, for example?
- I chose the red color because I'm a mode designer and I'm dedicating me to the appearance and image.
In this world, the red color is a commitment between artist, image creators and society.
Although in society, everything that is not a little grey causes aggressiveness and agitation of good property.
But my provocations are directed to start a conversation.
All the story of my provocative actions is an invitation to the debate.
- When did you understand you should be artist?
- In an exhibition of the Nevsky culture palace, where my work was shown.
I realized that it was my way.
Then the oil of old non-official artists had been finished, and the new, free like me, were still in business.
I made my friends of the new wave artists, with those who were exposed to Gaza and Nevskiy, who brought to "Pushkinskaya-10", and was already finished.
I put me in the theatre for clothes, music of all genders, but not for letters.
And all this took place in your art clinic... - For me it was important to meet me in the cultural center of San Petersburg, where the best creative minds were to meet.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there was no reforms, there was a musical club, a bohemia club, the bohemia house of St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, remembering how Schnur brought the project to "The Prayer of Van Gogh".
Snur and his friends were sing light songs under the background, clothed adjusted pants, including the current Igor Vdovin mode composer.
When the group started to touch in life, he became "Leningrado".
Trachtenberg was an animator of many programs before Hali-galivskih times.
We told them to Trachtenberg and was the beginning of his great career; basic education and training received it from us.
"D 137", the "Club Griboyedov" is the remaining of the Art Clinic.
There were our employees and asylum customers.
I'm a hero of the last century when the culture means something.
In 2000, the survey was done in the press, the premium was "The people of our city".
In the name "Year Artist" I was elected, so my culmination ended.
In these new times, I am not comfortable to work; I am a man who loves the truth, honestity and culture of the last century.
In our days it is easy to be popular, but culture and popularity will be separated. One can be popular but very little worship.
- There's something acknowledged in your work.
- Many of my paintings are shooted, in them it is clearly expressed the current and event.
I'm going to make a programed exhibition, "The Russian Museum in Tarasos."
The payments are an temporary category.
I was formerly sociable, but now being so, it's painful and atterrant.
But in the bathrooms, everything is injured and the tragedy is removed.
I like the biggest, I have great ideas.
For example, world salvation through total and binding changes of clothing.
Now one follows it by the clothes, oriented on the outside, but not in the inside of the person.
And, perhaps, that person should not be able to give him or to give him the hand, but to shoot him in the face.
And the lie will be removed when it changes clothing.
We've seen you in the role of a urban organic.
Who's better than me to be it!
- Well, but, can the commercial art be beautiful?
- Now the commercial art must be sculpted, sweet, have tacton.
We are a witness of the desintegration of cultures.
Before the people were grouping in hands, the Bohemians wanted something, the simple ones others.
Now, everyone has divided in micro communities, it's difficult to make it possible.
I'm not a hundred dollars ticket to love you all.
Now we need to think about who you want to like.
Now, every worship hero has 100 fans.
- And to listen to Stas Mikhailov come for thousands!
- You're seeing them left, there works the sex-social area.
And at a cultural event of 300 people, 100,000 will never sell. As a result, less management, less money, everything is marked.
I have my fans, the most important thing is that you don't lie them, don't lose what you have done.
When youth was doing such tables that a collegeist had the teenage collected on the wall side of Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, with which people usually ended.
Now they are often confusing the concepts.
They say spiritual culture, consumption culture.
There is no culture in consumption, that is another history.
I am a man from the culture of yesterday, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, rejected the money only to draw squares.
I'm in favour of this culture.
- Kirill, what's wrong with San Petersburgo?
- Good cultural experts.
There is a concept: cultural official.
But not all of them can be dedicated to culture.
When the kings were the right things were differently, the kings may not understand very well the culture, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
There are very good advisors in Moscow now.
We have people in San Petersburg that may be experts, but they are closed, because they need experts at a higher level that correctly evaluate them and open their ways.
Now you're prospering the subjective personal favorite.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they say honestly that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to find other museums.
- What is San Petersburg for you?
- San Petersburgo is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there is much more culture, there is a terrace.
But on our stones it is difficult that art grows.
We need cultural land and we have more writers than readers, this is bad.
In Europe there are many people with curiosity that goes to exposure and consciousness.
In our case, this class is nice.
We have to make the art is moderate, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a subvention of San Petersburg.
Make light in space
Earth is in danger.
Global or shocking with a killer asteroid.
Space ships with humans on board go to search for a repos planet.
To preserve humanity is the principal question: How can the species continue in conditions of pregnancy or in the same placed planet?
I think there's little way to choose.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"This are Venus and Marte," said the head of the Statute Astronomic Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions in Marte are best for life, the temperature in Venus is 500 degrees.
You can only live in large heights or in the orbit of Venus... in the space.
It was started to address the reproduction problems in the area with the flower.
A half-century centuries ago, experiments were carried out with plants.
Four generations of guiders cultivated in orbit were not different from the earthquakes.
Then came the creature of insects in the orbit, small mocks of the fruit, the drosophiles.
In 1979 the codorniz egg was sent to check how the embryo was developed in pregnancy conditions.
We get a normal polling as a result.
But then start the problems.
"The problem is in which this pollulo must be supported, must be maintained on his own feet and start moving", explains Vladimir Sychev, director of the Institute of Biomedic Problems (IPBM) of Russian Scientific Academy.
When the powders didn't find support, the pollutants had turned back when shooted.
And after 10 hours in the newborn, a total atrophy of the instincts was given.
Pollulos did not react to light or sound.
And the regret was that at the end of four days they just died.
"And two times we could born the pollules, but then we left it because it was impossible to work there with them," commented Vladimir Sychev about the failure of the experiment with powders in the space.
The last time a biological "miniarch" fly to the orbit was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, in the "Bion" biosatellite only will travel species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent to the space already with fetes.
In principle, nothing overnatural was found.
"This was exactly in the biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this should be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After the earthquake, space rats were descendant.
However, it has not yet been possible to address the problem of reproduction directly in the space.
It's a difficult challenge.
The animals, losing their habitat, simply cannot perform their sexual instinct.
The man, however, can, in principle, differ from the small animals.
The Homo sapiens has abstractous reasoning and is able to create an adequate emotional fund.
Similar experiences are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women travel to space for 50 years.
The biggest risk passed it to Tereshkova.
And the most precise thing that humanity has is the women's body.
Our guviota flying, and no one on the earth could say: if it's after a flight to space.
You can or don't have a baby after this flight.
"After all, no one has answered this question," comments the veteran of the Vakhtang Vachnadze airspace sector.
In June 1964, only after a year of flight to space, the first woman cosmonauta, Valentina Tereshkova, gave a daughter light.
The father of the girl, Andrian Nikolayev, was also cosmonauta.
In 1988, the second cosmonauta woman, Svetlana Savitskaya, who had two times in orbit and even worked in the open space, had a son.
However, the risk continues.
We are few, the astronauts are counted after long flights all have been good, and a healthy generation will grow.
"And if you can say more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights," resumes the cosmonauta pilot, the Soviet Union hero, Russian hero, Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must find some new ways in biotechnology, radiological protection, in creating artificial gravity.
The water laboratory of the Cosmonautal Preparation Center is a binding stage for flight preparation.
In terms of no fleetability, cosmunes practice their working skills in space.
It's just water that we're moving in with you. It's going back in there.
If water for adults is a comfortable environment, although still hostile, for a newborn child is its birth element.
The small-anfibic men seem to confirm that life on the earth has emerged from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is found within about 9 months of his mother in the ammonic liquid, as it will be easier to get to water.
In principle, this is logical, because from the time of birth until the first bathroom pass only 2 weeks.
"This is very little to forget something," says Marina Aksenova, narrative monitor.
In summary, if pregnancy is a more natural state for a new birth, for women there is a need for gravitation, the strength of gravity.
In gravity, the abdominal muscles and the pelvis are very fast decreating, and the pharmaceutical exclusion capacity is reduced.
Well, we omited it, trusting in the action of stimulants for the birth.
Of course, it can be able to make light in a special camera, and it will press it.
"And what then?" Valeri Polyakov makes this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the sense of gravity, the body does not generate the squelet or the muscle system.
A new born in orbit is impossible to clothe it with a special clothing for training, such as adults.
He will simply be free of what is vital for him.
"And this experiment we're going to do together, allowing a child's birth in a strange environment, will give us place to the earth to a disabled person, to a completely inadequate person," prescribes the Chief of the Biotech Committee of the Institute of Biomedic Problems of Russian Science Academy, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue.
However, with the time this will be a reality, when human beings in their ships are directed to a farther planet that will be the home for their children born in the space.
NKU Chief: The inspection of the "shvarc" system has not been condemned by the guilty political
In the field of public appeal, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and a quality legislation, although it is fully implemented.
Thus, Miloslav Kala, Vice-President of the Office of Supreme Control (NKU) states that it was an interview for Update.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This is, in my view, what we have," describes the current situation.
The joint controls of the Czech and German inspectors also reach similar conclusions.
As an example of an incorrect practice, Petr Nečas' attitude to the system of self-nome being on the role, which is known as the "shvarc" system.
The first minister said recently that the ODS (Civil Democratic Party) would not rape businessers with inspectors. Does it then prohibit or permitted?
"The law must be regulated in any manner and, in that case, nor the President of the Government may prevent the action of the office that has the obligation to carry out such controls or require obligations", observes Kala.
At the meeting of the Board of Control at the Congress of Members, you spoke of the common project between the Checaan team and the German, in which the legislation relating to public acquisitions was compared in both countries.
What is exactly?
This is a paralel control that we have started carrying out some two years ago.
It is simplified: European legislation regulates how public appeals should be organized, to this end the existing legislation in each country and then practitioners in itself.
We have joined it all and, although the control has not yet been completed, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, our country's legislation is "strong and more complete," however, the concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate more strict rules but to concentrate on the implementation of the law itself.
What can actually bring this project? What do you think that the conclusions are?
Only a common control of this type could contribute to the stopping of efforts in the concreteness of laws, reduction and improvement of the limits, although this does not have such a positive impact.
The economy of the oil means obtaining a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) to avoid enrichment and, longly, criminal actions.
But not because we reduce the limit of appeal, it means that we're going to get it.
Maybe because the system is saturated with both "papeleo" that those who want to search for errors in the system can make it easier than if the limits remain so high as now.
You are talking about the problems of our country with the transfer of legislation regulating the practice of public appropriations.
How does the control system in Germany work?
Is it a office like our NKU or is organized otherwise?
As far as offices, such as the NKU, there operates the Federal Accounts Court (Functional Court), with a similar organization to our colleague, the only thing is that in its case is structured in a different way, but in principle both offices are parallelly evolving.
The competences are also analytical, however, as Germany has a federal organization, the Courts of Auditors are in this level, in this regard slightly decisive of our system.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control the federal money, which we call for state funds.
The public funds, which are managed by the regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled by the Federal Court of Accounts.
What the local legislation is, is it more simple than ours?
Generally, I would not like to set a comparison without specific data, but Germany remains a model in some aspects, but it cannot be precisely precisely precisely for what is better.
Can, for example, be better about the quality of inspectors?
That's sure not, but I repeat, I don't like to do this kind of comparison.
It is necessary to say that even those countries that we take as a model should face a large number of problems.
If not so, you wouldn't like any benefit to cooperate with our office, do you think?
As regards our country's legislation, what did it mean to its Office the law amendment on public appeals?
Bearing in mind that the validity period of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been demonstrated in control actions.
Since we perform ex post controls, we need to be counted with a certain delay.
For now, the process for the preparation of future controls is observed: we have started a new tool for "detection of non-economic risks", which has been conducted by almost 14.000 public contracts, which have been analyzed, and the changes will be perfectly reflected here, as the limits are amended, the conditions of certain types of selection and similar processes are corrected.
Does it consider that the adoption of this law is beneficial, or is it, instead, a burrocratic system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope that it is.
The problem that can emerge is that the rules are "induced" and that it is impossible to comply with it.
With the previous legislation, the controlled persons were linked to the contractor (e.g. in the case of regional operational programmes of the Regional Council), and every non-complianced law in the field of public appropriations means violation of budgetary discipline.
Do you mean to endure the law in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or use it and do not punish those who do a formal failure, which does not have an incident in the decision-making.
A system of this type will only be able to create more burocratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We'll see where this path is started.
The first minister has recently stated that ODS would not fail to employees with controls of the called SHvarc system, with reference to the fact that it is an autonome only on the role. What does this mean?
Is the shvarc system prohibited or permitted?
The law must be regulated in any manner and, if it forbids something, then the first minister of the Government may not even prevent the action of the Office that has the obligation to carry out such controls and require obligations.
You can say, "We change the law and let it", but you can't say that we'll do as if nothing.
In the public appeal Act, legislation is strictly strict about how to act formally, and that is how to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic to exclude the candidate with the best offer to do not meet formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. This is, in my view, what we have.
The roads present ice plates, although most of them are transitable
In several places of the Czech Republic, roads present ice and snow plates.
Although most of the ways are transitable, certain precautions should be extensive.
Karlovy Vary region
Tomorrow the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were transitable, but they presented ice and snow plates.
The temperature decreases and heats between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day, the thermometers will be slowly up.
He has left nest in the region and in the lower areas the neighborhood is finish.
Instead, in the Metalical Mountains the snow reaches nearly 30 centimeters.
In some places, the visibility was still bad because of the nest, according to the information of the control centre of the region’s routes.
The R6 speed road and the first category road in the region are now transitable without restrictions.
However, it is recommended that extreme precaution, especially in some points of which the surface can be heated and resaled.
Similarly, all the second and third-party roads, including mountain roads, are also transitable.
However, in some of them there are still wearing with ice and fired snow.
Attention on the road must be increased, especially in the highest areas.
Pardubice Region and Hradec Kralové
In some East Bohemia roads there are dangers of heat and in higher zones and in mountains can have been formed a swimming swimming snake on the roads, reporting on their pages the Travellers and Autopistas Directory.
Travel operators advertise the dangerous drivers, especially in higher areas in the Pardubice region.
They can produce heats in the immediateness of Lanškrouna, Ustí nad Orlici, Poličky, Svitav or Möta, and especially on the roads of second and third category.
Road I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is especially snow on the mountain roads of Krkronoše to Orlické Hory.
There is a swimming snow in the highest road areas in the towns of Rychnov nad Knśnou and Trutnov.
In the East Bohemia area, the sky will be between cut and partly cloud, without precipitation.
Temperatures will generally be oscilated between three lower zero and a positive degree, and weak wind.
Pilsen region
The routes in the Pilsen region are transit today in the morning, although the precaution should be exceededed and will be adjusted at time.
In the first hours of the morning there will be heats, the temperatures will swim between 3 and 9 degrees below zero.
After the nest and back down of the temperatures, some ways could also be covered by ice.
In some places, drivers will be found with nest, but visibility will improve progressively.
This is what is deleted from the information from the Road Control Center in the region.
The D5 autopistor is almost transiable without restrictions, although the precaution is recommended, especially in the way between 80 and 131 kilometers.
The surface of most of the first category roads is settled and without glass.
In the Pilesen road area and Tachov border with Germany, we may have brought with glass plates.
The second and third categories are humid, so in this case, it also warns us with glass plates.
The drivers should be more careful, especially on the less transited roads in the Šumava area.
Olomouc region
The drivers referred to the highest areas in the Olomouc region will be found in partly desired nest.
After chemical treatment, he was still sneeved in the port of śervenohorské and in the direction way to Videlskī kśí.
The road operators left the snow during the night; at the road of Šumper was cumulated about three centimeters of snow, according to the travel administrators.
In the rest of the region, most of the roads are transitable without restrictions.
"In the highest areas of the Šumper road, the rest of the snow remains.
Conductors at the port of śervenohorské will be found with a medium-sneeped neck in direction to Jeseník," confirmed today a operator of the Šumper road administration to the ŠTK.
On the ground and in the night they also accompanied Jesenická their colleagues and, after chemical treatment, the pists of the highest areas are now shooted and shocked.
On the road of Olomouc, the roads are transitable without restrictions, in which the drivers should conduct carefully in the forest trails, where the ways are still humed.
Region of Usti nad Labem and Liberec
The operators of the northern Bohemia roads have informed about complications in different we take at first hour of morning.
Besides some places where he renewed or heavy, according to the police database, the mountain road between Telnice and Knínice is closed in the region of Usti Nad Labem.
Temperatures are maintained under zero, even in lower areas, so ice and snow are obviously remaining in the calzade. In turn, in the lower areas, especially in the south of the Czech Central Maciz, there are no problems and roads, generally, are seized.
Service complications have not been recorded.
Travel operators have warned the ice presence in the arounds of  yangtæti.
According to the meteorologists, the conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day it is expected to rain and rain that slows and the sky will be shooted and there will be ice.
Since the general roads have been announced unfavorable conditions in road I/13, in the border between the Labem and Liberec region.
The road between Telnice and Knínice had to be cut by the branches of the trees that were covered on the road with the weight of snow.
Šimon Ornest: In our concierts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that at least a month will reach the end of the world, what do you think about it?
It's only one of the other alarmist news that we like to shoot us.
To the music group The Tap Tap we like to do blooms about this and we like to say that we're the only group of music in the world that can meet enough positive energy to put the end of the world or to avoid it.
In addition, you will organize a real original project in December: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain to our readers?
This is a state blessing act that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential that has the end of the massa calendar sentenced on 21 December at 11:10 morning.
On 20 December to 21 hours, we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Praga, Brno and Ostrava.
They will finish about the same time when the massa calendar on the Kiribati Island, in the Pacific Ocean, ends 12 hours before our time zone.
Who did this idea happen to him?
Initially it was my idea, and then we were forcing the project all together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to meet enough positive energy and to avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect together with society on the state we will leave the world to our children.
At the end of the calendar maya we also created a unique collection of articles: boxes, shops, bags and original keys against the end of the world that can be acquired at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The Tap Tap group, together with other interpreters, also sing the innocent call against the end of the world, which leads to the title "Fin of the world, cancelled".
It is currently very popular in YouTube, can you hear in the Beneficent Concerts?
Of course, yes, and it'll be the last, well, until everything goes well and the world doesn't end...
They will sing you all the interpreters at the same time in the three concierts.
The heroins will be linked simultaneously by special transmission directly in the Czech Television.
Tomáš Hanák wrote the letter of this song and interprets the protagonist role of Jesus in the videoclip, where also Xindl X...
How did this cooperation happen?
We work together even with other personalities of the checa cultural scene, separately to organize many Benefit and Concert acts...
We make all our efforts to participate in this project.
It has been demonstrated that most of them are interested and you're glad to work with us.
What will the money recovered in the concerts against the end of the world?
The equipment for the educational centre without the Studeo barriers, which we have led to the end in its sixth consecutive year with the Tap Civil Association in Jedličkåv cupstav.
The students from the school of Jedličkæv utstav regularly receive the visit of teachers with whom they perform funding and interesting activities.
Students do not have sufficient economic means to pay teachers and make us an effort to do so.
In the context of the completion of works in Jedličkw utstav, there will be an independent building to which we will be transferred with this project.
Each conciert acts several groups and interpreters.
What are the selection criteria?
We are trying to develop a programme that is attractive for all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, they will act in Chinaski, Lesbiens support, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiśí Suchī.
For more information, please visit www.kpks.cz.
Have you planned any other "spectacular action" similar in the future?
In May we will first act on the Praśské festival, so here we will certainly prepare an actory program with interesting invitations.
The year that we would also like to touch in the Bohemian National Hall of New York and to me personally by using that we are in the United States, I would like to complete it with actions in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not precisely minimumists, until now you have acted in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group formed by people with disabilities.
How is logistic and organization of these trips?
It's not so difficult as you can look at first.
There are five members in electric routine shields, the seals have to travel to the apartment for equipment and also we have a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
However, until now, we have well corrected them.  yang was perfectly prepared, which does not stop surpriseing me.
Even in Moscow, where we returned just a few days ago, everything went out without problems.
Thanks to the outcome to the foreigner, it could compare the different attitudes of society to disabilities and other aspects.
What did you find you until now?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities all works better than here; in Russia we have been witnesses that, in the east, there is a lot of ways to go back.
Unlike Praga, Moscow is filled with barriers, there still is no frequency that a person is moved alone by the centre of the city in an electric rule sill.
It is, for example, something that is likely to prefer someone on a shift shield in ascensor, there isn't it.
For happily, a civil partnership has been created that is striving to address the problems of persons with disabilities.
What aspects should we take for example from more advanced countries?
There are many aspects in which we're going back...
However, it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation are always dependent on those affected directly.
In London and Madrid it is very normal that people with serious disabilities are moved by their public account and can go to the service, to the museum, where they want to...
But it is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities participate actively in social life, in this aspect, with the Tap Tap Tap we have a little before!
A respectful or without barriers society is a thing, but when it comes to the moment where deporters, artists, actors, political or lawyers will begin to change everything true.
To now, they are isolated cases of people who have a great will force.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if we looked some years ago, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I entered as a educationer in Jedličkæv cupstav, where there were many young people around me who wanted to dedicate something.
And as I'm musical, I touch, among others, the saxon, worked a amateur group with a working partner.
And with the time, as our moderator Laśa Angelovič says, it was a little of the hands (rises).
However, popularity has not come to these recent years, or I am false?
It is true that it helped us to connect us with famous songs and also actively work to promote the group.
We have concluded that the work that is not seen is like if it wasn't.
Thanks to the aid of the European Union, we can also allow a teacher of quality, equipment, etc.
You intend to get so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential that he had, which can be done in another way.
The world of the spectacle is full of things that look to each other.
It is logical, in its way, all the new is welcomed with care and long too late to accept.
There are few extraordinary things, but I have to say that the Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clear compassion, is a natural reaction...
But compassion is fully superflu, because people with disabilities are not abandoned to suffer and to whom we should be compassionate.
There are people who are able to live a full life and to develop, with the condition of, of course, to have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well to people with disabilities, then it's not just a advance for them, but for the whole society.
Have you helped the fact that you are a demanding chief, as describes a lot of people?
If we want to do a quality work, we must be strict in many aspects and require certain discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people arrive with a Romantic vision and with the head in the clouds and when they know that they must take two days to test, go to the preparatory test and pass a long time traveling and concert, the initial euforia quietly leaves them.
But that's how it works in all parts, in each group you want to work and get something.
The Tap Tap group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were already in the beginning of 1998?
Only one: Láæa Angelovič.
We're a open group, people enter and get out, it can't be avoided.
Whoever has will and wins will always find open doors
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, Tuesday 20.12.2012 at 21.00 p.m.
It will be held in the Prague Inscheba Arena, Brno Fleda and Plynojem in Ostrava and will participate in 12 groups and other musical groups of the Czech Republic
The three cities will be connected to the end of the flight through video conference to sing together the song of the Tap Tap Tap Group "Fin of the world, cancelled"
The objective of the concert is to meet the resources necessary to finance multi-functional equipment of the STUDO educational centre without barriers in Jedličkåv ústav of Praga, which costs 25 million Czech Koreans.
The entry to the conciert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years have free entry into the previous sale option in Bohemiaticket
Clamp? I got it clamped. Hold it.
At the meeting of the Ministers of the European Space Agency last week, Poland was accepted as a twenty-fifth member of the EESC. It is the second member country of the EESC of the former Block of Eastern Europe, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of the ESMA on 12 November 2008.
Poland initiated intense cooperation with the ESA in 1994, and during the years later participated in the Agency project commission.
However, the way from Poland to the cosmos began long ago.
Polish enthusiasms were already dedicated to flights to space before the Second World War, although they were not always understood.
For example, I remember the A. Šternfeld conference in the Astronomic Observatory of Varsovia, in which, on 6 December 1933, presented his ideas on the pioneer study "Introduction to Cosmonautic".
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left unfaithful assistants and, years later, Šternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski was the only one that had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld obtained the premium Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for his "Introduction to Cosmonautic".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, became later a great impulsor of astronomy and cosmonautic.
He published hundreds of articles in Poland magazines and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promotor of the cosmonautic, was known throughout the world, and his contribution to science was rewarded when his name was put to one of the clayers of the moon's hidden face.
In 1925, a dryline was built in Poland, which would be provided by a cohete engine.
Unfortunately, who was the author of the proposal, and the details of the project are not known.
It is not clear if the cochet would be used for the start of the drasine or for its frened.
The information about this dryline is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
From 1933, Poland artillery began to dedicate the missiles.
The research was financed by the Comorka Techniki Usebrojenia in collaboration with Professor Mieczyslam Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the conservated material, it is obvious that the investigation came to the stadium of practical tests.
However, with the arrival of the German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937, in the press specialized the prototype of a photo-electric mixer designed by the engineer Rohoziśski, and the following year was published the study "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna the raketobomba lolnicza", author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were intended for military use of motors for missiles.
Shortly before the war, the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Committee Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all projects of missile techniques for military use and coordinated all works.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the beginning of the war.
Other studies dedicated to cosmonautic appeared in the Poland press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In November 1954, the magazine Problemy first refers to society with four very extensive articles dedicated to the astronomy.
In one of them, Professor Subotowicze, was proposed the creation of a society that would be dedicated to cosmonautic.
At that time, artificial satellite projects were already started and it was obvious that cosmic research was a disciplinary with future perspectives.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronaut Society (PTA) aimed to form part of the International Astronaut Association (funded in 1951) and the PTA became full member of that year.
The following year, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), was the Vice-President of the International Astronauttic Federation.
He deployed this charge until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the rm audio cohete (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was a success and became the first Poland cohete where a scientific research led.
The first type RM-1 was finished in 1957 and started first on 10 October 1958.
The cohete had an appeal of 1.800 meters, about 80 cm length and not reached 5 kg weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and in summer 1959 the air tests of the RM-2 cohetes were started in the wilderness of Bśdów.
The cohete medied 1,4 metres and weighed about 11,5 kg.
Another type of development cohete would be subject to real scientific study. The RM-34 cohete would have a 14.5 km support and its mission would control the high wind.
However, in 1962 the work was suspended.
The first part of the RM type was the Meteor-1 cohete, which was built during the 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as two stages cohete, with a total range of 510 cm and a initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which were different from the space available for scientific devices.
In the Meteor-1A cohete, the available space for volume was 0.4 litres, in the Meteor-1B of 0.34 litres and in the Meteor-1C of 0.62 litres.
The maximum support in the three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1965, the Air Institute was developed in the Meteor-2 cohete, which started the first air tests in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 cohete had a initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry out a useful weight of 10 kg to 60 km high.
Afterwards the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 version was built.
Poland's entry into the COSPAR (Commission for Space Research) in 1960 and the training of the National COSPAR Committee two years later.
In the framework of the Intercosmos programme, Poland joined the Soviet artificial satellite research and, in 1978, Poland pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second inter-monauta after Vladimír Remek.
The suspension of social works law is not the solution.
Last week, the Constitutional judge suspended the social law.
The resolution was a valuable discussion in society.
Since then, it will be interesting to consider the existing problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal Economic Systems in the EU, as well as globalized world, are based on the principle of a greater economic and less regulatory competitive.
Consequently, this means that the different economic forms and national economic systems are in a permanent conflict between themselves.
The cause is found in the principle of free trade and free and limited private capital movement, together with the dispersed financial speculation.
The impact of the major differences in the work cost (loans) produces economic tension.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, tries to raise distances and to "propose a lower" price of the competitor, with the aim of being made with the most part of the market, and thus increased its margin of benefits.
For most employees, the transfer of production to foreign, buying there more cheap or disappearing, the result is higher unemployment in countries where the price of the work is higher in comparison with other economies.
Since private capital does not have any social responsibility and, with this, it is not responsible for the unemployment generated by this phenomenon, the social expenditure of the state is necessarily growing.
All this situation provides the total interests of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and compensate the economic and social damages that have caused in their efforts to obtain benefits.
The situation is universally known that it is not necessary to provide specific statistical data.
The poorest practice of private capital creates situations, in certain economies, in which governments of such countries are obliged to competite with the aim of artificially reducing the social level of their own population, and thus attractive foreign capital to the country.
In other words, Governments make private capital available to their own population without taking into account the social decline.
This is especially patented in the changes of existing laws.
The goal is to impose the population to accept the opinion of the private capital, especially in respect of payments.
This is, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other hand, through the restricted right of employees regarding labour rights.
The result is growing poverty along with the increased differences between poor and rich.
A number of years ago, there are in Germany food delivery points for poor people who cannot be maintained with their own work.
The number of people receiving this type of aid is already coming to the million.
In the context of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, a sufficiently frequent case is produced: people employed with a wage as less that the state must pay the rest to reach at least unexpected to survive.
A scandale of this type related to the situation of assistant employees of the German Federal Parliament was published.
Measures of precisely all the Southern EU states lead to the same situation, and people, who are stressed by an abstract of their social level, are obliged to emigrate as in the 19th century or to ruin with a slight wage in the border of society, with the hope that a day comes to the private capital capital.
Is it necessary to ask from where it comes?
In the case of other countries of the EU, poverty goes from one country to another or never comes, since Chinese, Indian, Brazilians, Turkey, Morocco, Egyptians or Africans continue to work as a major part of a European wage.
This also affects the whole Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim to be aware that the state should not give capital to the economy, which leads to the economy to its failure.
The private capital defends the test that the state should not be involved in the economy by controlling.
Then it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not affect its self-employment in political course and, indeed, in all the states.
In this case, the answer is clearly declared.
The test is the existence of lobsters, in the very powerful and all-presented practice, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in corruption, in mutual favors, in a legislation which is almost reproveable in all parts but is not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is the following: state ministers, with the absence of financial means, are the drafting of laws to private legal undertakings which are often linked to the industry.
This type of law projects are adopted after the Federal Act, the German Parliament.
Thus, the whole non-eman power of the people is announced in the Constitutions of West Democracy, but of the strong financial groups representing their own interests.
It is obviously clear that democracy with a liberal orientation is slowly found in a situation as Appianos described in their work The crisis of the Roman Republic in César and Pompeya's time: "The state had time to be disintegrated, and the administrations were employed to force."
In change of soborns, benefits obtained illicitly and help to finance stones or swords.
Soborne and corruption were extended without prevention, and people urned the urnes with the clashed voice of premature... "No people had a nature to aspire to a position in the administration, so once, because of this deorganization, the state was eight months without co-sols"... "It stopped to speak seriously that the only remedie for such a serious situation was self-democracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man"... Although Appianos thought in Pompeya, Caesar was under the power and transformed democracy forever in self-democracy.
The conclusion, as in ancient times, is that the present society is based on unconscious preferences of individual benefit without taking into account the common interests.
Private capital is not able to understand and claim the benefits of the whole society.
The result is the same as at that time, a decade of the eleite without previous eleite, without an effort to reform it in depth.
The causes of the increase in the fascists and communist regimes should therefore be seen in the deployed liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and XX century.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems in favour of a liberal democracy, as a determined suspension, at the expectation of the next stage.
The real democracy is that the current eleite is fully ignoring the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, social and humanitarian disasters of which we have been witnesses, as well as crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient and recent history.
The suspension of the public appeal law is not the solution; at least not a long term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both at the international and within the EU, the Government of the Czech Republic will be obliged to continue to search for other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is, therefore, systematic.
The solution is conducted by concrete sociopolitical reforms, which strengthen the participation of the capital of the State and the influence of the citizens in the government and which deficiencies the position of the private capital to the society in benefit of the state.
Israel: the laboratory of the caos.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could" (Nor nothing comes from violence and nothing can do), Sting in his Fragile song and whose strible remark "Let's not forget how fragile we are" (We are not forgetting what we are).
"If my children don't want wars, there wouldn't be no." Gutel Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in his death leak in 1849.
After the last olive trees of violence between Israel and Gaza, different reactions have occurred as always.
One, on the side of Israel, argues for the right of self-defence and engages Palestinians in the role of terrorists. The other supports the Palestinians and claims racism by the state of Israel, the genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs and taught Israel of terrorist state.
I don't want to focus on whom is guilty of the murders periodically repeated and who is the victim, and at the end and final, the citizens of today's day in Israel, including the autonome territory, born within the current political situation and did not live the begins of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the phone, a look to discover who uses the tensions that have been draught for 95 years (called from Balfour's declaration in November 1917) in a small land surface in the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions I have arrived on the basis of my own way to understand the matter, about whom or whose group of people is the main impulsor of the events of modern history.
In the history of humanity, the history of the fight for power is in the first line.
At every time we can find Alejandro Magno or Napoleon.
But what isn't already so obvious is if these characters were all those who directed their steps automatically or if behind his throne had someone who directed his actions towards a certain objective.
We must accept that we live in a time that concentrates the world's richness in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that this implies, has not been reached in a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families highlights one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is someone back, I don't know, but I don't get it away): the Rothschilds.
It is not written very close to them.
Of course.
In the 1990s of the 19th century, they purchased the first news agency (Reuters) to delay their name to associate with criminal acts of great seriousity. The power and richness, or both, would cover them the swords, which always means strengthening.
They have major participations in almost all the world's central banks and in the countries where they are not represented, have been declared or prepared a war: before the attack to Afghanistan, they were seven countries, after the attack of Iraq were 5, only four, but between Russian central banks were removed to the Russian Government.
Everyone who tried to oppose this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the Central Bank of America of the Rothschilds, began during the Section War to print money and was killed in 1865 in the theatre.
JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the federal reserve system (FED) and was killed in 1963; the Congressist Louis Mc Fadden was inflicted in 1936 after he wanted to ask the EDF for having disappointed the great economic crisis in 1929.
His slaughter for the world power led them during the 1859 - 1871s to make a plan with three world wars, designed by the mason Albert Pike, condemned with the level 33.
The first war was aimed to remove the great monarchical states throughout Europe; the second wanted to remove the colonial suprême, especially from Britain, and the third was proposed to reduce the population of the earth between average and a million people (the same amount of slaves for their well-being and law sufficient and would not consume so many resources), and also to establish a universal religion (equivalentism is nothing more than a pre-project for such solution) and to adopt the absolute powers.
The method with which the group of the richest families, together with the Rothschilds, continues to be the dynamic of crisis deployment and the following offering a solution (order ab cao - order from the caos).
These solutions, however, are misleading, and always conduce a deterioration of the situation. If not, enough to remember that the EDF was created so that a crisis such as the year 1907 would not be repeated.
So, after the success of the murder of the heritage to the Austrian-Human throne, Francisco Fernando, Sarajevo, and after that, as a result, the First World War was slaughtered, the Sarist Russia was destroyed by the start of the Bolchevian Revolution.
The First World War ended suddenly and unjustly from the military and economic point of view, the heading of Germany (the wars to end with the Arctic Russians were already unnecessary) and the later reminder of the great power of Central Europe, the Austrian and Hungary imperium.
In order to prepare the field of the Second World War, bankers and political banks were enabled to create a conflicting situation in due to the huge war repairs on Germany, which had been created the optimal conditions for the radicalization of the poor mass. Afterwards, they were based on the solution of the Führer, which was sufficiently strong and simple and indicated to the guilty, and then built a Czecholovakia composed of a strong nationality with a strong minority that was to represent and represent the role of the fifth colony, which took the Führer and promoting the war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds encouraged the foundation of the sionist movement, a wide range of the training of a Jewish state, preferably in the ancient Jewish region with Jerusalem as capital (regress to Sion).
The previous Balfour declaration sent the bases for the massive immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place.
Terrorist attacks were produced in both parties.
He established the Second World War: it is difficult to know whether Hitler had taken too much from the currency to the international bankers in a principle or if everything was part of a plan, but the suffering of European Jews in concentration fields created the best conditions for accepting the Jewish state in the world society.
Israel was officially established in 1948 and, in similar ways, the war repairs in Germany slowed the way towards the Second World War, the proclamation of the state of Israel was created the focus for a third war.
If international bankers could start it, the Jewish nation, as in the Second World War, would become victims of the first line of battle, now with the Arab population or, in general, the Muslim of the Middle East.
Israel is a large laboratory, a soldiers and caos machine, not only in the framework of its country, but also at international level. We take an example of sharing the sympathy and detractors of Israel in a way.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where does injustice engage in an unfinished spirit of violence, if the beginning of all was the code of some individuals and their faults for the world's power?
In this regard, it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their mandates, because, as is happening in our country, international bankers are only presenting their candidates in the elections.
The current President of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist political, loyal to international bankers, which makes everything possible to declare the war to Iran, and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would be threatened to become a global conflict and, if we take into account that I will control Ormus's stretch, where 20% of the world oil (the navigation corridor has only two thousands of wide), would lead to the destruction of the global economy.
Under what light now is shown the words that David Rockefeller said in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree with a new world order."
The new world order in its imagination is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the population serves to a smuggling of people who are part of well-commodated financial aristocracy.
A world where every new person is impelled to be a chip when he naked controls all his being.
"And is obliged to all, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves, to have a mark in the right hand or front, to not buy nor to sell the name of this monster or the numbers of their name.
It is necessary to understand: those who have two front dents, which sums the numbers of this monster.
The number marked to the person and this number is six hundred and six."
Film Argo: If you get crushed, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a group of Islamic students protested the American Embassy in Teheran and took 52 diplomates as rehenes.
His release was to be changed by the destronized shah Mohamed Reza Páhlevi, which after the revolution flew to the United States, a country who had developed his regime for decades.
For the American administration, the situation could not offer any positive perspective: to remove the shah from the border could not be allowed, because, if he did, he would put the confidence of its partners in other countries in danger.
But the release of rehenses in Iran, where the revolution had been designed in the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not at its extent.
It was a shock to the US prestige, which later further intensified with the failed attempt to release rehenses through force.
The diplomates incarcerated were released 444 days after the negotiator of the Government of Argelia.
In the United States, his destination caused a sound of solidarity and animation against Iran.
The failure in Iran contributed decisively to the derogation of Jimmy Carter before Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film "Argo" of the director and actor Ben Appleck addresses an episode of this story, which made a small success for America.
Shortly before we busy the embassy, six employees of the building escaped.
After a complicated periplo, they ended in the residence of the Canadian Embassy.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, helped them out of Iran, to help a extravagant story covering: they went out with Canadian passports, as members of the cinematographic team that examined the location in the country for the shift of a fictional science superproduction.
Gender combination
The plan of the expert in "Exfiltration" Toni Mendez requested Hollywood's cooperation.
To make the lie seems true, it was written about the filmmatographic project in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, the physical production society had even a real pack.
The details on the operation remained secret for a long time, the film has been made from the memorys of Tony Mendez.
The film of Appleck is a unique combination of several kinds.
On the one hand, a realist political striller; on the other hand, a "caper movie", the history of a episode that went well, a lie (a example can be the Ocean's Eleven series).
In the film, we find well-documented sequences in Teheran. In the sequence of credits, emblematic photos of the time of events, which were plasmated the same way in the film; there are no many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes are so much more liviane, marked by ironia and a weight of exageration.
In addition, scenes from the CIA center and other institutions: men who have been handled to analyze the situation in the negotiations table, on the office passes, by phone...
Ben Appleck has been able to restart your cart in a excellent way.
The actor, who had been objected of burns, has become a respectable director and its way of action has stopped being the white of iranic comments.
Argo is his third metrage, after "Small, Adeus" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. Ladrones City" (2010).
At the same time, it is the first film of Appleck in which the action does not take place in the city of Boston, where it was created.
Also, the sensitivity of catching the atmosphere of the place was a feature that was located in the directors of ancient films above Hollywood's standards.
And Appleck shows it in Argo, where Tehe will become "rueda" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film are located on the streets, in the reconstruction of the true events. The introductory sequence of the embassy's taking is impressive by its symptoms capacity that, at the same time, transmits the emotion of the unconsciousness and the lack of warning that happens when, in some place, the story gives a step forward.
Appleck and their collaborators have similar effects on the physical scenes (the imposing team in the Teheran's ball).
A lot of action in too many places
The director had to accept that an explanated history does not offer much in the cinematographic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
And it is quite well. Sometimes it adds something to the reality: here is not all so elegant (the scene in which the crisis in the airport of Teheran, the disappearing of a call to America, and the search discovered after his track becomes a loose).
Argo's flag is the discontrolled need to demonstrate deteriorate action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very pleasant role as Hollywood's collaborators, although their characters are more than space and are not, not much less, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, the film of Appleck loses a little dramatic trace, but it is a film that can be continued with a moderate interest, assessing its performance and the back style of a thriller that calls the 70s.
But it's gonna be hard.
As an invoice of a real history and as a proof of the exageration that may be the ideas of ominity and omnisity of secret services, it is sufficient.
Rules for global inflation, bananas and circulation
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which presents each year an investigation on the most absurd bank rates, has now decided to announce the complaint on "the most absurd regulation or ideas of the EU Taller".
"If we have occurred after the last event, the EU has planned to adopt a quota of 40 percent of women in large European enterprises," explained P. Patrik Nacher, the investigator of the survey.
For example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify insurances between men and women.
Eventually, women had better prices in life insurance because they are objectively a lower risk.
"Another incredible ideas of the EU Taller can be proposed by people until the end of this year."
The election will take place at the end of February 2013," reported Nacher.
Among the contravented regulations of the EU, for example, the obligatory addition of biocomponents to the fuel that, as a result, harms the environment; another prohibition is the use of the mercury terms of all life only because they contain a small amount of dangerous substance or the shadow of the size of galleries, which has contributed to a significant increase in the price of eggs this year.
The faculty prohibition to use the "mantequilla of untar" expression or the removal of the classic trade bomb was criticized.
A quality plate must have a length of 14 centimeters.
The Union device takes this type of decisions often under the pressure of one or other commercial or industrial lobby, whose requests in Brussels are normally defended by any state or group of states (Czech Republic, including by the vite threat, reverses the requirements of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that the higher quality platforms should have in the EU a length of at least 14 centimeters and could not present "anormal curvature".
The European Commission was defended by saying that this is only trying to harmonize the non-homogeneized national standards until the date, which only complicated their marketing.
The standards which refer to fruit and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some states, have been underlined on the basis of the existing directive constituting a dispersion of food.
The candidate to win the survey could be the prescription of the EU of the last year, according to which in inflable globals marketing it is obliged to warn that children under eight years are not allowed to inflate them without the supervision of an adult.
The EU refers to an American study that, when we talk to games, the globals are the main cause of child death by asfixia.
Similar limitation to the use of murderer by children up to 14 years is also existing.
Interesting events are born even in our country
Similarly absurd is the regulation on European officials: any one who has any official role in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia. To do not hurt Greece's sensitivity, it must be spoken of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
Bankovnípoplatky.com, in collaboration with the partnership of liberal economics Laissez Faire, appointed in the survey, among some above-mentioned absolute proposals, the Union's prescription on the volume of food supply in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has determined the maximum volumes of food supply that can be found on the Territory of the Czech Republic on the same day of our entry to the EU.
The Czech Republic, for example, exceeded the volume set for seals in conservation, with a threat to substantial quantity.
The organizations of the survey also interested them in paying those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subvention for the application of subvention.
This kind of ideas occurred not in Brussels but in Prague.
"We're in depreciation for the fact that we don't have sea.
We requested the European Union a compensation," the Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas in autumn 2004 declared.
He argued that in our country a lot of cereal was produced and, as a result of the intervention purchases, the state had full stocks and was to export.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far away from the sea ports, the EU should pay for hundreds of euros.
Finally, the European Commission was prepared to help the Czech Republic and organized a public complaint for purchasing the cereal of countries that do not have access to the sea.
The subsidiation to receive a subvention was proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development addressed by Minister Pavel Nśmec (US-DEU) and is in line with the drafting of Brussels subventions requests.
EU: Rare requirements are an exception
Member States' guidelines are often white of critics, EU's efforts in the field of regulations and, as well, more effective functional and development in the whole Union are better, our recognition, according to several experts.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the EU's subsidy cover for projects that have nothing to do with the deep integration of the European integration, but that Member States have achieved in budget negotiations.
The Cheques also touchs the sensitive fiber as well as other countries of the Union, the right to the name of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always been victory of these pugnals.
The Cheques, six years after conversations with German and Austria, successfully defended the name of origin of Olomouc's requisite, but had to change her name to the national row, whose tradition in our country was removed to the 19th century, and passed to be called "tuzemak".
Only products made from sugar cancer distilled can be called ron, but not those from sugar relief.
In the official list of protected origin names from the EU, together with the fat and gorgonzola wheats known throughout the world, the Shupan of the German city Lübeck or Parma's feet, for example, are already found in the Karlovy Vary's gallets, the carp of Pohoṣṭelic and Tśeboō and, even, the variety of luxury.
As protected seas from the EU, they may be proud of the Pardubice's helmet pan and the ships of Hośice v Podkkkkronoši.
People want to save the Republic, but I'm an afect, says Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how did the elections have been submitted to the President?
This is not the Senator of the President.
If in our country it was all right, I would not present my candidate.
But I can't be able to see how it is robbed in the last twenty years of our country, how ladders are impunity, taxes and age of jubilation are increased.
I had no ambitions to be political.
When I see something I don't like, I'm trying to make a solution to change it.
And since I have forty years and my candidate is independent, the only possibility I have to change things is to present me as a senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but soon he went to the presidency.
Isn't it a shock to those who have voted it?
I always said that my candidate to the Presidency was depending on the results in the elections of the Senate.
I later predicted that if I was elected by Senator, I would submit my candidate to the Presidency.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can realize my own ideas.
That is why I need the most powerful effects and the most powerful mandate.
The problem is not just that we are a nation that criticizes on the bar or front of the television, but that we stood anybody who wanted to start a change.
This is the means of communication, which deprecise you and confusion the freedom of expression with the freedom of lie.
From me it is said I was subjected to journalists that I was advised by Jiśí Paroubek.
We'll talk about your ideas.
The presidential struggle is presented with financial tests and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of the property for more than twenty million.
To that end, the law must be changed.
As President does not have this competition, and only the Senate in its whole may propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have formed a group of pressures that would be recognized as an autonome work, and we achieved it.
The problem is in the policy: if someone comes with a good proposal, either right or left, it is rejected in order and this affects the citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have a greater potential to obtain support of all parliamentary groups.
Without matching or dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is better for our country and to apply it.
Does a man of the right or left better be considered?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more left.
It's not important for me, either a little left or a little right.
What I care is that we get out of here.
I don't care if someone is right or left, I want to join people.
Always openly support any good solution, independently whether the proposal comes from KSṣṭM or ODS and, in the same way, will be against the bad ideas.
It's ridiculous when you say it's popular.
But isn't he showing it with what he says?
When a business plan is created for the company, you also have some objectives and ideal objectives.
And you're trying to get close to them.
There will be people who call it popularism, but all the proposals I speak are already working in the world or known experts are talking about them.
But without the Parliament's support, it is only a sign.
And so it cannot survive in long-term policy.
Or do you think if you are directing people and speaking with them, will you, for example, get a criminal and financial responsibility?
I don't have any other option.
Convincing political, journalists and civil society and trying to put them out of my part to get it.
If the President was elected, there would be no problem to organize a direct television remission in which the leaders of the parliamentary parties would ask to legitimate the criminal and financial responsibility for political, officials, judges and taxes.
And, eventually, they would have to communicate why they don't want it.
If there is a strong person who indicates the debates, it can be made pressure in the political scene.
We take the direct election of the President, which has been a achievement of public pressure.
At the same time I say I'm just an affiliate, I'm not a genius or intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I'm trying to search for partners.
I've just started in policy and I'm trying to get the most possible support for my program.
I'm trying to get out of the matter before me, but if I don't go well, within six years I'll leave it and go back to the private sector.
It sounds a little like Okamura was going to save the Czech Republic.
I'm no salvador.
I know that I don't do anything with a person, so I visited a series of known personalities, so if it is best to be encouraged to submit their candidate to the senate.
I saw Radin Jančura, but he refused because I had a lot of work.
For me, at least, I supported the research journalist Jana Lorencova, who slowed the fraud with low heat oil.
I was present from the basis that people are really unconscious, now I'm in the balance.
The 60 percent of the population did not listen to the urins and, those who did it, voted to the representatives of the establishment.
We are two of the independent sectors in the senate.
People chose the senate, so it will be complicated to achieve changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of calves or governants.
Are you thinking to form your own game?
I have not yet considered it because I have no time for it, to check the untailable past of each of the potential members of the party, and I have no money.
I have no money or for the campaign to the Presidency, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 colonies.
You don't have money?
She's talking about the ownership statements, how's your?
I think my private property in about 60 million.
In Praga I have a terrace valued in 25 million, a valuable floor of ten million, another floor decreased in eight million, a collection of art works with a value of ten million, a Aston Martin of about 3,5 million and a superb skoda valued in a million, and in the account I have a couple of million.
Indeed, I have a Aston Martin because he was my young dream. I always liked James Bond, who drived this car, was tangible with women and, at the same time, fighting against evil and injustice.
Does Aston Martin drive, your property is valued in 60 million and has no money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic but you don't want to put too much money from your part.
It's not very convincent.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to blame me?
I've already put 2,5 million in the campaign.
The fact that you have no patronators shows that there is no too much interest in my program.
And I don't have the obligation to pay the campaign with money from my bottle.
The expenditure of the campaign covers as a result of what was received in the concept of senator lounge.
But I couldn't live from that, for example, I couldn't pay to my son the English school, which costs 30,000 monthly coronas.
If I would only want to win money, I wouldn't be a candidate.
So you're going to continue with your business activities to live?
Didn't he say before I left this activity?
This has nothing to see with a biggest summer.
As I promised, in part I left my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will be my replacement in spring.
People wanted to be the Samaritan who saved the Republic.
But I also need to live from something.
How much will you win monthly as a entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 to 400,000, I still win.
If I was President, I would leave the business.

The MVRDV architecture study shows that the real adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the Spijkenisse library and the new ended "Book Montagne" - 2 photos
"I think that the building is diverted, has a futurest aspect, and finally there's something interesting to see", says Lisette Verhaig, a cross-end that pass through the street.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technique in a great company near the library, points out: "Adam, the building is beautiful."
But I ask why we need a library today.
We all have Internet, tablets and electronic books.
No one's income in those mode libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a bedroom city situated at the doors of Róterdam, who just wants to escape a visit, listens to the doubtful honour to have been held with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 people represents the lower Alphabetization rate of the Netherlands.
To oppose this so honourable situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute to the general culture and to copy the seven fixed points that appear in the euros in the form of decorated weapons miniatures.
The success of the offensive education was limited.
And so the political responsibilities decided that there was only a possibility to improve statistics: did it have to build a library?
Winy Maas, from the Dutch architecture study MVRDV, all a master in the art of bar diagrams and responsibilities of chanical buildings, took the topic with its usual sweetness and composed the presentation of the concours in 2003 with five books under the arm and a dream on the face.
And while the jury looked shocking around him and shocked out of shadows, Maas tried to smile the books in size, forming a pyramid, and concluded his short discours with the words: "Stimated citizens:
Here, my proposal for the mountain of Spijkenisse books, called 'Boekenberg'.
9 years later, the mountain of EUR 30 million is high on the planned place.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with a subterranean packaging, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of housing and born buildings.
At the beginning of November, the mountain of books was galled with the second Best Library of NL 2012.
In addition, the project is also called "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
In this way, the small city of history, which until the date had nothing more than offering a pomodern peatonal area and an incredibly shooting after which white shoot one would intuite a milk central, now with a modern architecture work.
But above all, Spijkenisse has now the first public cultural building of his history.
The long way to the book
The first impression is that it is a paradise of books under a question.
It's true that there's a staircase that brings us just to the center of this magnificent mountain, but the real lovers of space and reading do not use it, but prefer to be funding with their topography at each step of their scale to the top.
The totally grown inside is light and easy to shoot with view, the floor of the recognised ladder, and the elegant faulas are inequitablely supporting the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
When the view is highlighted, the park banks, the dogs, and the kids and the girls can be viewed by playing the football.
And by all sides of books, books and more books.
"That book stars are normally available over the floor, and in the center is opened a large dark room that usually is something unpleasant and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
What we have done is to put up the classic space configuration and get out of the inside reading area.
The inside of the mountain is very useful: the offices, the Internet library, the ajedrez club, the environmental education centre and the maintenance room are located in the middle.
Special mention mere the black stars that live in the wall, parapete and barandilla functions at the same time.
The view, the tacto and the oil are strange.
Even architects and civil engineers at the day know the head when they hear about this unknown material.
"We want to work with recycling materials," explains Josop Trouborst, the head of the project in the city of Spijkenisse.
And this is like a day, in a cold agricultural exploitation, we shared with the appropriate subproduct from the agriculture.
For many years, in winters and in the Netherlands's fields, there is a plastic tissue of few millimeters of spices as a basis for subjecting the roots of the cultures.
This is a cheap and efficient material.
This tissue ends up two stations and then goes away.
For the library, this tissue was taken, for the first time in such quantities, until reaching four centimeters of speed.
With heat and pressure, the name of agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that slows to a new car mixture and sports shuttle.
After 105 pieces, it reachs the top of the mountain.
At the end of this road, almost 500 meters around the mountain waits for the reward: from the coffee it is not only a fantastic view of the city, but it can also enjoy some Dutch crochets and its fiber planted in huge macets.
They create a pleasant environment to maintain the proper atmospheric humidity for this literature mountain.
Donations for a new soul
"If you want to believe it given its large increased surfaces, this building is an exemplar project on ecology," says Trouborst.
The necessary heat and refrigeration are obtained from geothermal energy.
Despite the mountain of books it is located under a huge cristal pyramid, even in the most solar days the sun is only lighting for a few hours inside it.
The vast wood strikes situated in transversal sense to the crystal facade serve to give shadow and absorpte most of the sun rays.
This creates a comfortable internal climate.
The rest of the automatic persianas.
Stefan Spermon, the sceptic worker of the Information Technology Sector, has already been strict to put the feet into the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has been there too.
Similarly, the traditional physician professor Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She qualifys the "Boekenberg" as the "the late" of Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, due to the inauguration that happened a couple of weeks ago, all the people of the city were invited to give a book of their private collection.
This is how it is intended to fill the optical shoes of a library that is still not counted with its complete file; in the present time there are 70,000 examples.
The concept has calmed.
The stars are filled.
"There is nothing worse than a medium library," the architect Winy Maas says.
"I believe that thanks to our initiative now all people have a certain link to this building.
Everyone knows that your book is part of the library.
Although he's just there to smell.
Thus, the MVRDV study has achieved a whole success in this reign discipline that is known as "Creation of a Identity".
The city of Spijkenisse wrote a part of the history of literature.
Independently from the young and inculte that can be.
Finally, a start point to comply with your identity.
Szabo: "Deutschens must play a more protagonist role"
Germany has been abstented in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, the expert in the relations between the United States and Europe, this is in Berlin in a slightly diplomatic position.
German Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany understood that it would vote against the proposal to grant Palestinian territories the condition of observer of the United Nations.
However, finally, Berlin was abstracted.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelites have done in Gaza.
However, because of the special relationship with Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time, I think that nor supports the North American posture.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical with Israel.
During the resurrection in Libya in March 2011, Germany was also abstracted when the deal was to establish a flight prohibition zone.
This has been finally declared by the NATO.
Is it difficult to Germany to adopt a clear post when they are playing important international topics?
Yeah, yeah.
This should be the reorientation of its external policy in these times, with a leading policy, so say by the United States and focusing on a German external policy.
And what is still more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
Consequently, the Germans are in a crewed.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not habituated to do.
I think that they are still slowing their role, but they have already started the way towards a "normal" external policy.
A external policy similar to countries such as France or Great Britain.
What specifically means a "normal" external policy from the German point of view?
It is a policy that is available to defend different posts from the United States or its European partners when it is national interests.
I believe that the German external policy is a strong motivation in economic policy, i.e. in exports and in their relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Next East.
German economic interests are even different than those of other major powers and therefore Germany must protect their interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the post-adopted conflict in the next East and the vote of the United Nations?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the next East, especially in the Golf.
For this reason, it must be careful and not aligned from the Arab public nor of the Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I would not give him so important because it is not a completely unilateral relationship.
However, a fundamental role in German consideration is played.
Have Germany understood his relationship with the United States when not to vote in major decisions such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe in Europe, and even in the United States, the German posture enjoys a huge understanding level.
For this reason, I do not think that there has been such a dramatic rupture as in Libya.
Maybe with that Germany has achieved a certain respect.
At the end and final, all this has not done but showing that it is a country that takes seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
In Europe there are different opinions on the Palestinian initiative.
Instead, the United States have clearly shown for a vito.
Is there a difference between the United States and many European nations?
These differences have always existed because of the United States internal policy.
I believe that the Obama Government has a secret understanding towards the European position.
But because of the political situation here, it is obvious that the government cannot defend this post publicly.
I believe that the real disparity of opinions does not actually have the degree assigned to it.
If we analyze the relationships between Obama and the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not for nothing enthusiasmed with the development policy.
Is Germany difficult to conciliate close relationships with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the posture of their main partners in the EU?
I think that's exactly what it makes to be so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little more easy for the Germans if there was a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but it is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility to be part of an overwhelming entity, but that they must stimulate things from their own position.
That's exactly what you are doing now with the euro.
I think in the future, Germany will take a role of leadership at the time of obliging Europe to adopt a European posture.
Of course, this is not nothing easy for Germany, just for the relationship to be maintained with Israel.
This has always been a smuggling theme.
However, I think the Germans have clearly to play the role of independent figure.
Does Germany see himself in the role of an international actor? Do you really want Germany to take a protagonist role?
Or may it continues to be difficult to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet been habituated, has always come to something unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, the country continues to play a more important role.
If we observe the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany is positioned as the main actor, some anti-aleman feelings are disabled.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is a old problem and is that no one wants to be around the enemy countries.
In this way, Germany is in a very harder position than the United States.
Receiving attitude should be shown towards the different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
U.S. influence on European policy is increasingly reduced, but the EU does not cover that empty, who then remains?
The Germans will not remain more remedies than taking a more protagonist role.
Even if you don't like them, if they are unpleasant or become them more unpleasant, it's life!

"Marke Protection" in China: when Puma and Armani are suddenly converted into Chinese brands
Armani is a known world-wide mark and Polo Ralph Lauren also.
But what is Armani Polo?
After this name, a officially registered name in China is hidden but that there is nothing to see with the original companies.
However, this joy of protection is while true epochs do not submit a request.
And even then it is not clear that you will give them the reason.
"As foreigners are increasingly more difficult to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer attorney of the Taylor Wessing buffet specialized in protection rights violations in Extrom East.
Each week comes to my table a new case.
The imitators simply add a couple of letters to be able to record their brands.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and is registered in place of Prada-Kny.
German enterprises are also legally copied in the same way as it has occurred to the manufacturer of sports items Puma.
Pattloch opens a architect in which you sit from the Pekin Marks Office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company requested to register the Zegna DF Puma mark, a artificial name that also served from the model house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That Chineses are global campaigns to copy and violate intellectual ownership rights are known for sovereignty.
In large cities there are large stocks of various plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of falsification.
However, the cases of Pattloch are otherwise in the field. On the basis of their customers, he fights against the fact that the mark office officially granted to Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name already registered in another place.
The Chineses call it "Bang Ming Pa" or a closer mark.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
which refers to women who have "beat" to a rich man.
Chinese authorities do not feel guilty
"It's harmful for business, it's got to fight against it", requires Pattloch.
"The brand makes water, monopolist position disappears, and the damage that suffers the image is great."
Financial losses and processing costs in the affected sectors are thousands, especially in the case of luxury emblems.
According to the CLSA market analysis company, with a volume of EUR 15,000 million per year, the third market of luxury items is in size and the increased rythm.
However, the cancellation of duties in the mark registration is complicated and is also much money.
The processes can be extended up to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed a request because he had passed so long that the objective name of the query had already been converted into a "market reality".
"If the applicant has bad luck, it may even have to pay money to the player because the process has damaged the mark of it in China," says Pattloch.
At times this is the wild law.
Some of the most known cases have to see with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a plot against the Sany machine manufacturer, the company which has been absorbed by the German manufacturer of putzmeister hormigon bombs.
So today Chineses can continue using a very similar emblem of Mercedes star.
The purchaser of Volvo, Geely, first useed a white and blue logo that recorded largely BMW; the matter was addressed to the courts and Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste Steel manufacturer lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo type represented a cocodrile in the opposite direction to the original.
Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO brand office in Peking recognizes that in 2010 there were difficulties due to the lack of staff equipment and supply.
Last year, however, "the situation of labour emergency returned to normality".
Thus, the number of untramited claim processes has been reduced to 22%.
About 57.000 of these cases were solved, 75 per cent more than the previous year.
However, 81.500 complaints continue to be resolved.
Trying this costs a lot of money
As normally in China, digits are surprised.
Last year, the CTMO registered more than 1,4 million mark protection applications, almost a third more than 2010.
This would be a new record and means that China will lead for a tenth year to the list of new inscriptions throughout the world, according to the brand office.
It seems that this also happens with the number of valid logs, a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.800 million Yuan would have been borrowed in the concept of rights.
In other words, this means that the average of each registration costs EUR 1,280 yuans or EUR 160.
Playing this costs a lot of money, as shows the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For over seven years the group fights in the courts against a Chinese imitator.
Although the Germans have been able to stop the illicit manufacture of pieces of imitation,
the imitator has been able to ensure the Chinese rights on the Freudenberg mark.
"We have caused this situation because the appeals are not protected in Germany," says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman and Counsellor of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO brand office also dismissed the resource of municipalities.
In the following two instances, they gave you the reason to Freudenberg, but the opposite party would continue to fight today.
There must be a lot of care
The case has now arrived to the doors of the Supreme Court of Justice, where it remains a resolution.
Wentzler trusted in ability to resolve the issue and endorsed the professionality of the courts.
However, it also states that "the procedure is extremely costly, both in terms of money and time".
It is difficult to estimate the internal costs; the entrepreneurial archive has had to review exemplary from up to 100 years of anti-government to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the opposite "sum of six figures in euros" to reach a friendly agreement but did not succeed.
"This shows much about us," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Middle East are threatened by affecting Europe,
specifically if the imitators are safeguarded there on non-protected marks.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register the name Freudenberg for skins and skin products in Germany.
Since the group left this trade area, it has been possible to prevent the registration.
"Here you have to be very careful," Wentzler says.
He and the lawyer Pattloch recommend the German companies that are very careful at the time of business with China.
Not enough with confidence in the international Market Rights Law, but what must be done is "registering also in China all that might be possible to protect", such as Wentzler.
On the contrary, the topic may be much more cost than a simple record.
In fact, if Freudenberg loses the last assault of his special battle, then the party would have to pay the contrary license rights for its own name, as explains Wentzler.
That or in the sector concerned would exit us from the market.
World Day of Combating AIDS: dance, song, help
In Heidelberg, the Coro Imbongi and Suaziland are rejoiced by the AIDS orphans
The history of a link enabled to exceed more than 8.733 km from distance.
First it begins by the dance: cowboy bottles, baloncette skins, tacon shoes and mocasins search for the coma on the parquet ground, and they find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then they start to slowly higher the voices of the songers (control, low, tear and above), rhythming, struggling and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to get out of his boxes by trying to order his powerful and sweat.
It is Monday for the evening and in the music room of the Heidelberg Medical Institute, the Coro Imbongi strikes a new song.
The 50 songs, from 23 to 69 years of age, have also arrived from human genetics to home love.
"Om'Obani" is not a easy piece, each coro voice has a different text and also in a foreign language only known: Zulu, a language speaking by 11 million people in South Africa, Botsuana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some areas of Suaziland.
_Other Organiser
According to a UNAIDS estimate, the United Nations AIDS combating program is about 34 million people in the world.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
In Suaziland there are 245,000 orphans of AIDS.
More than 40% of the population is already seropositive.
The Voices for Africa's association was found in Germany for the 180 orphans of the AIDS people of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend the secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month, a child can be discarded.
This contribution will cover the school matriculation, the uniform and ensure a warm food day in the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means "historial narrator" or "panegirist".
In this room no one knows speaking with fluidity this bandu language, but sing himself.
Since ten years ago, this coro sings in this foreign language that, at times, it has been able to transport them to their origin: the South Africa.
At 8.733 km from Heidelberg, northwest of the Kingdom of Suaziland, there is a population called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German krone.
40 per cent is infected
About 2.000 people live there, some still in simple shoes of bar and shoes, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 have no longer parents because they have succeeded in AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the higher AIDS infection rate and the lowest life hopes in the world, according to Unicef.
The population does not see circumcision with good eyes, a practice that has demonstrated that half the risk of contagio has been reduced.
More than 40% of the people in Swaziland are immunodeficiency virus portators, and more than 30 years of death has become a normal thing.
During a joint journey to Africa in spring 2005, the coro discovered this recruited population, but most of them had seen many children in the streets that were not only in the protection of their parents but also in the main way: food, clothing and training.
Without school, the possibilities in a poor country are more than less.
In a principle, it was only the particular commitment of a few things that could make a child out of the college and enjoy a warm food day.
However, a year later, the Coro founded the "Voices for Africa" association which has been professionally occupated by AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Data on sexual transmission infections
What are the main sexual transmission diseases?
Among the bacterial origin STS are the syfilis, the clamide and the gorge.
The most common viral origin STS are AIDS, human papiloma virus, genetic herpes or hepatitis.
The ladders and the salt are among the ETS transmitted by parasites.
What are the main groups of affected persons?
Syphilis and gentleness are more often given in men who maintain sexual relations with others.
The Robert Koch Institute is part of the basis that at least four of each five cases of syphilis registered in Germany have its origin in a sexual contact between men.
In the case of gender transmission diseases, the most common sexual diseases are clamed, tricomon infections, human papiloma virus, candidiasis (Humanity) and gorgeous.
HIV contagious among the adults of the country is relatively low, but about 20% of the new HIV infections are registered in this group.
Between young people, claming infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three four of all infections affect youths from 15 to 25 years of age.
In our country, human papiloma virus is also added to the most common diseases between youth.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexual transmission diseases are subject to a binding declaration.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections had due to its number of 1.697 cases in 2001 to 3.698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections maintains a descendant trend since 2007.
In 2011, about 2.700 cases were registered.
This is a tenth part less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that this is a veterinary disease?
Infectional diseases can cause ulcers in the genetic area, orinar, flux, abdominal pain, ampolles or ruins.
They often do not cause any pain or cause other symptoms and therefore are not detected.
How can a man protect?
Conservatives can reduce the risk of contagious, but they do not provide protection for 100 per cent.
Some pathogenes of sexual transmission diseases may also be transmitted through suicide and physically contact.
For this reason, experts are recommended to be regularly subjected to medical examinations, especially if a couple is often changed.
If you are diagnosed prematurely, most of the ETS may be curated and it is possible to avoid any late consequence.
Through cooperation, donations and, finally, but not less important, the honorarys that cover the core for their actions in all Germany have come to recur enough money.
"In total, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," said the proud Annette Lennartz, the President of the Association.
In the own village of Zodwa Dlamini, a safe woman of himself and with leadership has managed the money sent from Germany.
Orphans find a good accommodation, for example, with one of the grandmothers.
The "gogs", as the older women in Zulu, are the people's pilars.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans to their charge, offer them a box where they live, and they take care of children to school every day at time and clothes with their uniforms.
Those who have no one remain under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman, which, as both kitcheners are responsible for kitchening every day for more than 200 hungry children, results in a shared salary of the association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has run a coast school, has built two gallines and, in collaboration with the US Health Organization, has achieved that many of the people have been subjected to a HIV test.
This is not obvious, because, despite the patent that this disease is in the whole country, it is not usually openly talking about it.
A king with 14 wifes
"AIDS is a absolute table," Annette Lennartz says, "for you have to see sexuality."
Somewhat strange in a country where the king has officially 14 wifes.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known by its opulent life style and filled with excessions.
Poligamia instead of democracy.
This form of life not officially accepted is mostly responsible for the propagation that has experienced HIV virus in the past decades.
But it must also be the innumerable temporary recurrence of the country from one side to another and take it there where they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "in any skin can be obtained free, but these are only used.
It's another culture, here they only accept the skin contact against skin."
To promote cultural exchange, the Royal Imbongi travels every two or three years from South Africa by songs speaking of melancoly, combating spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many in the most Southern African continent are still remembering the time of apartheid.
A white bus filled with songs in a black language; so recognition does not only bring with me a great environment and much joy, but also have also launched a couple of laughs to some of the other ravious border soldiers.
The trip always leads them to Esitjeni, where the songs visit the distracted children.
Despite this small population appears only on maps, the Ezulweni river is very known.
"Acceed to Esitjeni, there lights the light," states the people of the place.
And after resorting the 8.733 km online back to Heidelberg to the test rooms of the Bergheimer Street full of songs marking the step, one is accounted that it is also possible to see the light from there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice in Mercurio
The Messenger Son has found evidence of the ice existence in Mercurio.
The glass helmet probably has a speed of up to 20 meters.
NASA, the North American Space Agency, has provided evidence of the ice existence in Mercurio.
Despite treating the nearest planet on the sun, there are also heat water, as well as out of three studies published on Thursday in the specialized magazine “Science”.
The Messenger Son would have found evidence that in the planet area that is permanently located in the shadow has been formed a ice sheets.
It seems that it has at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 meters of speed.
The water is presumablely produced from computes or, with great probability, of asteroids that in their day shocked against Mercurio.
Nobody relates to the ice finding with the possibility that there is life on the planet, says the chief researcher of the Messenger son, Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercurio can reach up to 426 degrees.
However, findings could help to explain how water and other components of life have arrived to other areas of the sun system.
In full unconverted way for the people of the Earth, sounds, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix are dedicated to explore the depths of the universe.

Like Pluton, which turns around the right sun behind Neptuno, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomic Union in 2006 Ceres is not any "planet".
This section of an infrared image taken by the telescope Spitzer shows a "familiar radar" in which infinite generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue points, although the most difficulty to recognize is the red color of the "recent born stars".
This region of star training, called unromanticly by the W5 scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the Casiopea constellation, at a distance of 6.500 light years.
This image returned from an extinction star was taken by the NASA Spatzer telescope.
The ring in the form of donut is composed of the material that the star is covered in its extinction process.
In the great Trifide Nebulosa, at 5.400 years of earth light, new stars are formed from gas and powder.
The NASA Spatzer telescope took this photo of the galactic star training area.
The Pleyades, a group of stars also known as "The Seven Hermans", are a simple view object in the night sky.
However, with the telescope you can better appreciate the colors.
The Nebulosa of the Helize appears as a great red eye appears in this image of infrared.
It is located at 700 years of light of the Aquarium constellation.

Depending on the tonalities, some images of spirit galaxy become true art works.
The image published by the Australian European Observatory shows the Trifide Nebulous situated in several thousands of light years in the constellation of Sagitario.
The name Trifida comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided in three), since some dark powder lines share the swimming heart of this stereolar training area in three lubles.
At Ofiuco’s constellation, astronoms could picture the indications of a cosmic character: at 400 million light years of the Earth the two galaxy nucleus in the fusion process was shocked up to the other to end shocking unremeditablely.
This formation of stars was captured by the Hubble Telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abreviations can refer to it with the overname of Molinillo Austral.
The photo of the space telescope Hubble shows a section of the Nebulosa Iris in the constellation of Cefeo.
The nebulous situated at 1.400 years of light is composed of powder particules whose size is between 10 and 100 times smaller than the powder particules we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and radiographies made by different telescopes.
Shows a ring of black rings situated at 430 million light years of the Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, served for a model moment for the NASA Space Telescope Hubble.
Scientists call the Spiritual Galaxia of larger size UGC 1810.
In this nebulous there is the most brilliant young star group of our Lactea.
This star training area constantly produces new stars.
In this star cloud, associated with the Rosa Nebulosa, also constantly emerged new stars; at 5,000 years of Earth’s light.
In this so brilliant galaxy there is no powder yet, only gas.
The researchers suggest that short after the big load, when it could be found over all the hydrogen.
Our universe window: the most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei would use it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the specimens of the optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images offering us have more deeply.
During the 30 years, particularly from 1947 to 1975, the telescope Hale situated in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His show, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S., the Binocular Large Telescope is highlighted.
This allows to observe the cosmos through two specimens, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.
The interior of the Great Canary Telescope located on the island of La Palma is great - only the shooting has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The spot of South African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmentated to spend costs.
Despite this, it reaches a diameter of about 11 metres.
The inconvenience of this more economic construction is that the telescope has a fixed higher angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Tejas also has a fixed height angle.
Your personality is your huge ability to collect light.
Despite counting with a relatively smaller specimen diameter, this capacity is equipped with the largest specimen telescopes in the world.
With the support of the Radio Telescope of Arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers can explore the universe in search of external life signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.

The ESO will also welcome the named E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope or European Telescope Extremely Great).
Your primary spectrum will be 42 meters and will be composed of a total of 1.000 reflecting elements.
Not until 2018, it is expected to take images.
To 2007 the two Keck telescopes located in the Hawaii Hawaii volcan of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They contain two specimens, each of them with a diameter of 10 meters.
Keck’s telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which together explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
In Mauna Kea is planned to build a new telescope of huge proportions and with a specimen diameter of 30 meters.
This is a picture of how it would be.
However, the most important information of cosmos comes from the hand of the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, I sent images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler is looking for extra-sollar planets, mainly those living.
On 2 February 2011, NASA announced that from the beginning of its mission had been placed 1.235 candidates to planet.
The last preparations before the Kepler space telescope launching are found in the image.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) telescope will not be launched at the board space of Ariane 5 to 2018.
The primary spectrum of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will search for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big round.
The investigators are part of the basis that there are ices in the south pool of Mercurio.
However, there are no fashionable evidence, since the Messenger son runs around the planet in a very closer orbit to the northern pool.
Since decades, the radar measurements focus on the existence of ice in Mercurio.
Thanks to the Messenger Son (2004), the first orbited around Mercurio, now scientists are sure that this is.

The rear by the mountain region of Talysh could be qualified by savity and Romantic.
The minibs continues with a great stretch through the slight road that goes next to the forests, the rivers of great cattle and the simple houses of the local farmers.
Everything is green and joke, one could even think it's located in the Black Sea.
However, we are located in the southern area of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is just a few kilometers away.
Here they live the "talyshi", a people that is not well known, unlike they dominate perfectly the Persian and the Azeri and are very long.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small city presums of an architecture maybe too massive designed in the Soviet era and that doesn't seem to be shocked in a so-called mountain landscape.
European tourists only reach this place, since the way from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too weak.
To recur the 323 km that separate both urban nuclears, eight hours are needed because the road is one sense.
The wonderful richness of which the country enjoys thanks to the Caspio Sea oil has not yet arrived in this recruited region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what to be made to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku was famous in May for the celebration of the Eurovision Festival and the next year we will celebrate the festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
This is the director of the Longevity Museum, perhaps the only part of the world.
Here is documented the life of eight decades of Tayshis from the place that have over 100 years of age. Fatulayeva indicates a white and black image.
This is my grandfather who lived 120 years old.
A son died at the age of 136
However, the indiscutible star of the museum is the pastor of Shairali Muslumo, which seems to have lived 168 years of age.
However, there is no birth game that certificates it.
And if we take into account that the older man documented lived in 122 years, it seems that the age of Muslumou is quite suspected.
"He born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married in three times and had 23 children. When he seemed to have still had a time to make a daughter more than 136 years old.
Have Siirali Muslumo been wrong then in his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, gerontologist in the Max Planck Institute of Rostock, has also heard of the advanced age of this population in Central Asia.
"In some regions of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan also live very advanced people," said Scholz, "as well as in Cerdeña there are many older men. "
Because of the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age; maximum if there is no civil registry.
Each day full of swimming snacks
It is a fact that the inhabitants of the region around Lerik often reached a Bible age.
There are now 20 people who exceed 100 years of age.
Why live here, in the south, so many advanced age people?
Azeri Tourist Guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that this is the special genes of the Talyshi.
The director of the museum, Mrs Fatulayeva, believes that the cause is in the food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logically that precisely the rich nutrition in the calves of the Tayshi, which worship the flesh, bread, and especially all milk products, and many of which, as well, are daily drinking a dry mantequilla vase, being so healthy.
Or may be the form of natural life that keeps young people? In Cengemiran, a small village not far from Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
97 years of age is relatively young for what is styled by these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple typical tree house of the whole Caucasus region.
Sit on the ground, move in an incantable way a huge twin of mantel.
Eight people live under a tea, among them one of the children and a daughter of Mirzayeva, both became grandma long ago.
They also play on one side to another two small children.
In the kitchen, they prepare tea for guests, a tea that serves in some typical vases with abombada form.
Mirzayeva's dentists are white and are perfectly aligned and under the puzzle hides two long treasures of dark hair that his son discovers us proudly.
I've always laid my hair with milk, so I've never fallen and maintained his color.
"I have never used a champion", says Mirzayeva.
Pension is enough to live
He has always eat only what he had produced in his own farm: tomates, patates and guisants.
In my whole life, I never went to buy a supermarket.
Then he talks about his husband, that I was in the army.
The worst was the time after the Second World War.
However, everything returned to his castle when the "sweet father", Heydar Aliyew, took the control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds rare in the mouth of a larger woman.
However, in Azerbaijan the worship that is professed to the paternal figure of the nation, who directs its country as a dictator, does not know limits.
This remained in power until 2003, at the time that the Witness held his son Ilham.
At least Azerbaijan's older people do not know what the poverty is.
Mirzayeva cobra 230 manit (approximately the same amount in euros) in a monthly pension concept, a amount that can live well taking into account the situation here.
And perhaps the channel son of Mirzayeva has the right: "The grands are very respected in our culture".
Living in a great family, they are loved, receive all the necessary care and are happy.
Like if this wasn't enough to keep life with many years...

The revolution returned to Cairo.
Manifestations that reevaluate among themselves in the Cairo show the tremendous division in which the country is summoned.
The future constitution, with sharia as a basis, is very controverted.
The Egyptian President did not scatter into patientism.
"We must overcome the transition.
And that this happens is my responsibility, before the people and before God," said in public television.
His speech would be directed to all the people, especially to the Christian copies, the liberalians, the illustrated Muslims and the seculars.
All of them, unremediated until now in a confused opposition, are feared.
I am afraid of a theocratic to the Nilo's oceans for the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Mursi explains, almost asking for forgiveness, he had had to temporaryly cancelle the competences of the Constitutional Court and extend his "to save the revolution".
However, neither Egyptians nor the whole world know well what this 61-year engineer wants to really save.
Do you want to free your power to judge?
Indeed, the 234 articles, whose adoption has been forced by a representative assembly of 100 representatives predominantly Islamic members at a night meeting of 15 hours, are really concerned.
As in previous constitutions, the borrower also states that the legality is based on the "principes of Islamic law".
But what does that mean "principes"?
This was and continued to be open to interpretation and it seems that Islamians will use this vague formulation, as well as the legal margins that appear, to place a more strict interpretation of sharia.
This is at least what it suggests a new article added: in all matters related to sharia, it is obliged to consult the Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution of the country with a large power in the entire Sunic Islamic.
It is not so, but this may mean that the clergy would control legislation, something that - in fact - would have resulted in the incapacity of the judgment.
A large part of the Constitution abolitor is open to interpretation
What also results of problems is that it intends to keep the military courtship.
During the dictatorship of Mubarak, these courts served to exercise a deep repression on opposition.
After the dictator's chair until 11.000 civilians were arrested in military prisons.
As the borrower sets, the State must protect "the true origin of the Egyptian family" and "promote its moral and values".
This is a so important formulation in legal terms that state institutions could even control the contents of cinematography and literature with this article.
It is clear that it is nothing else than censure.
Indeed, no article provides explicit equality between men and women.
Instead, another prohibition of abuse or calumniation to the prophet Mohammed and his licenses.
However, it is not clear that it is a abuse and how to be sanctioned.
Similarly, it is the formulation prohibiting the "opposition to people"
Is it enough for the President's loading or a chat on a reader?
Interpretation question, as well as many other things in the slaughter that has been submitted to Mursi for his signature and that, according to his words, "morely" will be submitted to the Egyptians to be subjected to referendum.
"The Revolution has come back"
Last weeks the opposition is shutting lines against the superiority of Islamics.
10,000 people gathered in an inusual harmonity on Wednesday evening in the Chariot's Tahrir Beach and pleaded to fail the Act before they could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will end up overcome," says Hamdin Sababai, who takes the third place in the lists to the presidential elections.
The Nobel of Peace and Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, declared that the constitution slaughter should be "in the cloud of history."
Through Twitter, Mursi accused the followers of wanting to lead to a "state golf against democracy".
"When the referendum calls, we'll go to his palace and we're gonna cut it", says the opponent Jasser Said.
"We are not weak, the blood of our brothers has not yet been lost," was quoted in the Egyptian media to the opponent politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Coran is our Constitution."
For its part, the well-organized Islamic community called to celebrate a contra-management; for it is not in the Tahrir Beach, but after a prayer to the other side of the Nilo, to the University of El Cairo.
Many women covered with a speed and party of salaphists took part in the same cry of: "The people require the application of God's law".
They requested Mursi " cleaning the country," at the same time they proclaimed: "The Coran is our Constitution".
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Plata Tahrir, where it started all, would have caused a similar situation of civil war.
It is obviously that the Mursi Partyers did not want to argue to happen.
The Muslim brothers claimed that both those opposing the Constitution's borrower and the parties of the same would have expressed their high and clear views.
Now it would have been the time to let the people decide in the urnes what direction the country should follow.
In this sense, it seems that the abolitor of Islamics has guaranteed most.
"The expression 'Human Rights' does not even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this forced constitutional process that should actually have longed up to February and included all social forces.
The lawyer of 48 years of specialized in human rights and the President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended Muslim brothers when they were arrested or had to face a judgment during the dictatorship of Mubarak.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because human rights are indivisible for him.
For this reason it was shocked, condemned and incarcerated.
"And now the expression ' Human Rights' does not even appear in the new constitution," is regretted in a conversation with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag".
The expansion of Mursi's competence to the three powers of the State made it resigned.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the democratic game rules and will bring Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, what the President has done is abolishing it," Saeda regrets.
However, democracy cannot work without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that is holding at the Nilo's oceans with a mixed of curiosity and tension.
This could be back in your opposite.
A manifestant in the Tahrir Beach warns: "You are conciseing a monster that you can't control."
The Norwegian Rafisk: Is the most malicious fishing in the world?
The five million people in Norway enjoy one of the largest living levels, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the success of the country holds some relationships with its awareness for a very malicious fishery?
Take a series of excessively curated cheese.
Put them in the midst of a swimming and humed football mountain.
I'm in there a week.
Then you can listen to the aroma paralyzing of the Rafisk, one of the Norway's exquisitives.
I find me in the small town of Fagernes, at 3 hours of Oslo.
It's sweet. The landscape is spectacular and that oil, always present, is flewed in the air.
The rakfisk is a storm in salt that lets you ferment in water during, depending on the malliant you prefer it, until one year.
As the dark and will make more cold, the Norwegians are a tropical feast that is celebrated here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this manner of most, so say, cautive.
"It is eating crude and then drinking a aquavit vase of a trageon," says Havard Halvarsen, a bomb of the city, who is also known as the "General of Rakfisk", who is responsible for organizing the festival.
On all sides we see people eating this fishing that is guarded in small cubes and drinking a significant quantity of drink.
"A few people like the aquavit than the rakfisk", says Havard.
The drink can kill the oil.
I've tried some strikes.
If you can avoid passing it near the narrow, it's not bad; it's not very different from a part of sushi that has cut some kilometers in bus.
Rafisk is a product from a very different time, in which poverty was shooted by Norway and in which, before heating, fishery was guarded during the summer of water and salt in hermetic barriles.
Later, in full winter, when it is already fermented, it goes out and, obviously with the inactive sense because of alcohol, it is eating.
Only one generation ago, thousands of Norways were forced to leave their country in the search for work, and mostly migrated to the United States.
Today, the population is rapidly increased; more than 13 per cent are immigrants, affected by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a full social service system.
A flow of Sweden, the old rival, and even too richer than Norway, comes to this country to work.
Rafisk is considered something important, an essential part, although quite malile, of the past of Norway.
It is between the cheapest plates that can be purchased.
But, in fact, it's money. A bird chain or a sandwich cares for you 10€ ($14).
Norwegia does not usually appear in the agenda of international news and most Norwegians like that.
Here the people are still poor to speak on the name of Anders Breivik, the extreme right racist who acquired shoots and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shoot as "the event of July 22".
Norwegians are very costing to believe that in their calm country one of them was able to do such cruelty and murder.
After much of the current richness of Norway, the growth, from the early 70s, of one of the larger oil and gas industry in the world.
"But the oil is not the only reason why it's so good for us," says Anna, our cousin, while it's going to pass rakfisk bands and that, with its long melan rubia and its surprising blue eyes, represents the image of the Norwegian well-being.
"We are, as you say, aware people."
Your English, as most people in this country, is impossible.
"We don't like to expand, we don't like obtention."
Norway has managed its oil riches with a lot of care; however, except a small percentage of the money from this industry is invested in a special fund for the future generations.
While the whole world was missing money that I hadn't had for the years before the financial crisis in the world, Norway maintained the well closed ticket.
"When we can swim in winter and make senderism in summer, we are content," says Anna.
"And eating rakfisk," adds with a swimming snake.
I'm in the snow doing colds to eat something; I had enough rakfisk.
Now a wood hamburger is uncertainly something different and quite sweet to save.
But for the night, it returns that bad fishing.
The hotel in which I stay is one of the many places in which a rakfisk scene is celebrated in which the comments vote the best fished, or perhaps the one who makes it most to test the nails.
A television has been connected directly to a presentator who brings pajarita and is around with rakfisk plates.
It looks like the Eurovision competition.
"What are your points for the best fishery there above in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"This is our point, Havard."
There are rise and applauses.
A man falls out of the sill, maybe winned by the aquavit.
Or may be the vapores of all that fishery.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a hard start
While the incoming President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, is prepared to have his duty, the BBC corresponsal, Will Grant, analyzes the challenges to which the new President and the different expectations of its population will be addressed.
Trafficking in Mexico City is currently particularly bad.
In a city that, in the best circumstances, has already been congestioned, has been installed from Monday a staircase that shorts several of the main roads that lead to the city and that is caused by a huge caos on the roads.
The goal, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their place of work, but to avoid that protesters could reach the Parliament.
On Saturday, the new President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and submit the country's management.
It is a complicated task.
Mexico has obtained good economic outcomes during the outstanding government of Felipe Calderon, but the country is summered in a drug war which has already been covered by about 60,000 lives in six years.
"My Government has the great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence", explained Mr. Peña Nieto at the beginning of this week to the President of the United States, Barack Obama, in the Oval Dispacho.
"I will propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal."
Before codifying with the President of the United States, the previous political experience of Mr. Peña was the ruler of its birth state, Mexico.
A very poor state and a fast growth, which rounds the capital; opinions on the new leader are shared in this territory where he was moved.
A Honest Man
In the bukical city of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is remembered with love.
Their residents contribute to the merit of the growth of tourism in the place and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive one of the new roads of Mr. Peña Nieto, which is a huge improvement compared to the agricultural roads and the full of bathrooms that have been renewed.
You can also see plates with your name in the entry of a modern polydeport and an interactive museum on climate change.
"We believe that he can make real and sustainable changes", says his friend and allied political friend Gabriel Olvera Hernández, deputy of Mr. Peña Nieto's Partie, the PRI.
"Partially, in terms of security and economy, we expect the interesting and real change that our country so needs."
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in the power, the PRI was defeated by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Mrs Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations for Enrique Peña Nieto.
He also rejects the qualification that the opposition does not have the origin of the new President.
"He is a very honest, very compromised man and with a great vision of the country.
It's a great state man, and, above all, it's a person who knows listening."
However, on the other side of the state that is not the impression that many people have about their old ruler.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the smooth streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Scope under high autopsy is, in many senses, a suburb of the city itself in Mexico.
And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban.
At the beginning of this year, military intervention was requested to help combat drug bands operating in barriers and violence against women was particularly serious.
In a desertry park, situated next to a swimming floor, the body of tens of murdered women was abandoned in that only in the past two years.
More than 1,000 women were killed in Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was the ruler, a much higher rate than the city of Juárez, unfortunately famous for their violence and a place that is synonym of innocent women.
The critics of Mr. Peña Nieto say, in the best cases, that I couldn't address the issue of feminine while it was in charge.
The most critical accused of their administration to do the warm view.
In a hormig house, typical of the deteriorated barrio, Irina Buendía has to make efforts to contain the laugh while showing me photos of her fallen daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the facts, Mariana was suicided in 2010.
Her family believes that her couple killed her.
"When I came to his house, it looked like if they had cleaned the body," remembers Mrs. Buendía.
"There were signs that he had been shooted and the dead strike had already appeared."
While her mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana's picture looks out of the walls, along with a cross in which one word is read: Justice.
However, this is exactly what the family says that it has been rejected.
"State authorities have treated me as if it was a old chismose, an albourgator, a chessman.
What they want is that one simply accepts what they say, and that it goes."
"But that can't be so when there's been so many irregularities and so many weakness," says.
The presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by a huge responsibility.
Decades of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico for the past six years, and the new President has promised to give them priority during its mandate.
"I hope it was the same type of President that was when he was ruler," said the Prime Minister in the Valle del Bravo.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Neza are worried more.
Bradley Manning did not condemn bad treatment, as they claimed,
Inspectors are trying to face complaints of abuse of Bradley Maning during their stay in prison
The judgment is focused on the period of Manning in the military prison of Quantico in Virginia
Defence wants to dismiss the case based on the serious incarceration of Manning
The army soldier is accused of robber thousands of confidential documents.
Scientists tried to demonstrate the Wednesday that the soldier Bradley Manning, accused of the largest confidence filtering in the history of the United States, lost a number of opportunities to declare the bad treatments that now claimed to have suffered while he was under military detention.
During the survey that the investigation had performed Maning in a view before the judgment in Ft. Meade, Maryland, the Inspector Ashden Fein stated that the weekly visits of officials of the unit that Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia does not show any claim on the treatment received.
The questionnaire, which was carried out during a view carried out on the request of the defence that the case was dismissed since its prison was hard and that it had already been sufficient punishment, came a day after Manning had witnessed that he thought to be killed while he was arrested.
The army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of robber thousands of confidential documents while he was serving in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Maning is out of the source of information.
On Thursday, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that the officials filled after their visits to Manning during their arrest in the military prison of Quantico, where he was incarcerated in maximum recused regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officials would have made questions to Manning and reported their answers.
When Monday Fein asked about the formularies, Manning acknowledged that he had qualified the treatment of cattlers as "excellent" and the treatment received in the installations in general as "more professional".
The formulars do not show any complaints of bad treatment, although officials requested Maning directly on the treatment that he received, stated Fein.
Manning responded that he had expressed concern about some issues and that the officials who had visited him had spoken of these problems and had indicated that they would be treated, but that they did not let them observe those issues in the record.
"Scrib without incidents" (as far as I talked about the problems) but this does not necessarily mean that I hadn't mentioned any problem," Manning said.
The judge, Coronel of the Army Denise Lind, also asked Maning why he had not claimed the treatment he received during the meeting held in January 2011 with a counsel to consider the suicide intentions expressed in a month before.
Manning answered that his intention during that meeting was to gain the reduction of the "prevention of lesions" regime under which it was found.
The military said they had put him under that restrictive regime, which is a degree under the possibility of suicide to ensure their protection and security of others.
"I wanted the largest state to know that I was good and (he wanted) to stop being under the prevention of illness... to enjoy what, from my view, is a better quality of life," said Manning.
Manning witnessed on Thursday on his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was retained for almost two months before being transferred to military prison situated on the basis of marine prisoners in Quantico, Virginia, July 2010.
He said he had considered to kill himself in Kuwait and, at one time, lost knowledge because of heat.
He said that the fact that he wasn't allowed to know what happened to him or what happened in the outside world was very awesome.
"My world was so excited only to the Arafjon Camping on that jaula," she explained on Thursday.
"I thought I would die in that jaula."
Manning stated that, once transferred to Quantico, most of the days were in a small cell, at least 21 hours and often 23 hours, without company.
Manning said that only it was allowed to have a cold, a mantel, a channel, something of clothes and his skins.
I explained that I tried to move all the time, because I was banned to sleep or even smile during the day.
Manning stated that he had always a light coming out of the outside, touching his eyes while sleeping.
He said if the casters couldn't see her face when they turned around the night, they turned him to turn back.
The lawyer of Manning submitted a formal complaint on the treatment received by Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to the military prison of Fort Leavenworth in Kansas in April 2011.
On Wednesday, the judge asked Maning about a delegate who had been held in the Thursday statement, according to which, after being obliged a night to sleep in its Quantico cell, he was obliged in a morning rental to stay low before the prisoners and other prisoners.
Manning had witnessed that it was never given to him the opportunity to cover the mant during the account.
During the jury's interrogation, Manning said that he decreed for the order he gave him the caster that had to leave the mant with which he could have been covered, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered to leave her to fall.
Manning witnessed the juvenile who had forced him to sleep in the past night because of an attempt to demonstrate a officer that he had not a danger for himself.
Manning stated that he had told the office that he could have used the elastic of his internal clothes or channels to self-release but that he had not done it.
Manning witnessed that that night they had removed their internal clothes, their channels and their skins.
His lawyers hope that the judge takes into account at least the experiences of which he had been held during his stay in prison and drasticly reduced his sentence in case he was sentenced in the war council, which is expected to begin at the begins of the year coming.
The defence stated that he was planned to make Manning declared guilty of minor crimes and defend other extreme accusions.
The view is expected to be renewed this weekend and the fiscals are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon supported that Manning was retained in accordance with the rules of application to any detention that is found in Quantico.
The cases against Manning include cooperation with enemy, illegally cause the publication of information on the Internet, the filtering of the national defence information and the robust of public property or registration.
If it is declared guilty of all charges, it could be faced with perpetual chain.
My crisis of mexican-studio-unident identity
Reaffirms that many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans intend to criticize those who have been; he says remembering the Mexicans of those difficult times.
Navarrette comments that the Mexican-Staundians are shocked between two worlds.
In a recent journey to Mexico City, he was only cut by the explanated and reached to the Migration Tramitation area and was already completely confused.
Some cards indicated the way to two shoes: one for "Mexicans" and another for "Extranjeros".
I stayed there a few seconds without being sure where I should go.
When I grew up in Central California, my whole life called me "Mexican."
This is the ethnical taquigraphy, the same way my friends in Boston refer to themselves as "Irlands" or my New York friends are qualified to themselves "italy".
Afterward, I decided for "the Mexican and the United States".
But this was Mexico.
And, in the patriarch of my grandfather, the taquigraphy or the guisions weren't necessary.
He was just a American.
I speak Spanish. It's enough to manage me during a interview in this language.
But I have no vocabulary level of a nation, and I can't get away from my American acento.
So I took my US passport and put me in the cola of foreigners.
I thought at that moment of this week in which the election President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet President Obama.
At the agenda, as long as the leaders of these two countries were gathered, it was said: immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was wanting to talk also about the growth of Mexico economy, one of the reasons for which at this time it is so likely that a mexican is staying in Mexico as an avventure to go to the United States.
He wants to associate with the United States and Canada and to create a trade block on the style of the European Union in North America.
Furthermore, Peña Neo promised to continue fighting drug cards in Mexico, although he did not detach them.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and is full of relief.
The majority of the United States may never be remembered that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced their leaders to cease half of their territory at a weapons point.
But for the Mexicans, who think in centuries, not in minutes, the elements that they remember are all parts.
So, at the time of an United States official says anything that brings the minimum critical to Mexico, you began to hear complaints, both in the press and between the Mexican eleite, about how Americans are using the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the children of Moctesuma are cut into war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a challenge is that they have more than 35 million mexicans who live in the United States.
Did we talk about record?
There's a lot.
There are winners and losers in Mexico, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for which it is not so.
The only reason why there are so many mexican ascensions living in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point of our genealogic tree, there was a person, maybe the father or mother of the grandfathers, who closed the door of the opportunities in Mexico and had to go to the north.
And most of the times the person was covered in a certain profile: dark skin, a level of low studies from a poor people, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Mexico no.
And although we may live now in the American dream when we went to good schools and have had good works, we can't never lose what we're living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican.
Sometimes our identity is not clear, but our loyalty is that it is.
It's for the United States.
Furthermore, we are conscious that many of the mexicans belonging to the eleite of the leader class do not like them.
The feeling is mutual.
We see as a memoratory of a humiliated derogation and look at us above the shadow as if we are from a lower category that is not enough to mexican.
Our Spanish will never be the enough good enough, and our neighbors with Mexico will never be sufficiently strong.
In your way to see, our existence is synonym of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And now we wouldn't find us shocked after this seat corner, living well in the United States, but, still, like solitary souls.
My wife, born in Guadalajara and came legally to the United States when she was a girl, remembering me that there is this rock between mexicans and the Mexicans and the Mexicans because the firsts know more solidity who are, and to the seconds, this is mourning them.
Although it is a citizen of the United States, it is considered a part of the two countries.
While so, many Mexicans and Americans that I know feel that they are not part of any of the two.
We like to listen to the Mexican group The North Tigres, but also to Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best thing of each country, but you're not raised to any of them.
In Mexico, you see us as Americans.
And in the United States we are considered mexicans.
Now, to complicate more things, so I have learned during my trip, some mexican leaders and some intellectors want to connect again with the diapothesis.
They want the Mexicans to work as unproposed "ambassadors" of Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would say to our American partners that it is great to visit this country and to press the political leaders to strengthen their relationship with Mexico.
Yeah, of course...
That won't happen.
There's too much back.
And, with the inequality of wages, the galopant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure that it is a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're gonna stay alone with this idea, friends.
It's just.
If some mexicans are still not prepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a half-century century ago, they must accept the fact that some mexicans and Americans are still resented of how they treated their families very less time ago.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more mexicans than I thought.
Visual battles, New Middle East
The high fire between Israel and Hamas could be an unprecedented basis for peace
Can any day have a sustainable peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another blood distortion that seems to indicate that any hope is vanity.
Among the inutility and habitual discussions about whom first began, mounts of buildings have been reduced to shooting; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelites have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, Israel's metropolis, and the sanct city of Jerusalem.
However, despite the Israelites and the Palestinians, they seem to be enclosed in their ancient conflict, as it turns into them in the Middle East.
The Arab spring has left it all the pieces of things, or not, the Palestinians and Israelites have been arrested in the regional alborote.
Maybe this makes your fight more blood than ever.
However, there are reasons for thinking that their lealty situation could be discalled.
A war that doesn't lose nor wins
First of all, optimism seems to be very difficult to justify.
Even if the hot fire was held on 21 November, the faces of this week have been strengthened by both bathrooms.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelites to get away, although Gaza has received a good paliza.
And although he killed some of his leaders and put pressure to the 1,7 million people of Gaza in one of the most misunderstanding and popular costs of the planet, Israel could not end with Hamas.
In fact, Hamás is winning land in West Jordan, the other part of Palestinian currently ruled by its implacable rivals of Fatah, the most moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, the leaders of Hamás could reach the conclusion that the time plays for their favor.
Since Islamians have gained influence throughout the Arab world, Hamás has made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a renaissanced regional power that had previously been the most closest Muslim allied to Israel, has declared the cause of Hamas. It also made Qatar, one of the most rich and dynamic states of the Golf.
The exciting members of Hamás say that the average Islamic moon is rounding Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hazbulan party dominates Hizbula, passing by Syria, where the rebellies of a more Islamic trend could shoot Bashar Assad, until reach Jordan, where Hamás allies are threatening the king.
In particular, in the southern flanc of Israel, the growth of the Islamic sisters directed by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, with the most popular and fundamental difference of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the lake depot who ruled in Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, has not been too long for Hamás.
Instead, the Muslim Sisters are the first brothers of Hamás and their leaders depend on the popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, Hamás may be a protagonist to whom it cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
At the same time, the duration of Israel will take the contrary conclusion.
As regards the military question, they put Hamas on their site.
The Israeli Heritage System has demonstrated its effectiveness and many of the Hamás mixes have been destroyed.
The Israelites will sleep more quietly... for some time.
With regard to diplomacy, the United States is more stronger than ever; many European countries have also accused Hamás to have started the last oil of violence.
First of all, Israel has prospered, especially under the Government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a first minister who has widely ignored the peace process.
Although the shooting cohetes from Gaza have been shocked since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide terrorists, in particular thanks to the Western Jordanian barrier, the main part of a aspiring territory to become Palestinian state, and protect the Jewish settlements that continue to grow, although international laws are illegal.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose party is joined by Likud to a group of still more harder lines leadered by Avigdor Lieberman during the preceding elections on January 22, is in a good position.
Why are those Palestinians shocking by giving them a own state?
If they really rule in West Jordan, would they not shoot cohetes as well as their companions in Gaza?
It's better to keep them behind that wall and give them a good shock if they get the head up.
It may be imposed by the hard range, although the Arab spring could change its calculations.
Although Islamics who take power in Egypt and in other places do not have too much appreciation to Israel, their priority will address the internal difficulties.
Israel's defence budget is greater than the four Arab neighbors together.
Starting a war with the superpower of the area will help the new Arab governments to improve their economy.
The pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to obtain the high fire is a good anger and could mark the start of something.
The Israelites should also think for a long time.
With the rest of the Arab world more democratic, the freedom of Palestinians from their right to self-determination is to create a powder that one day will be exploited in Israel's occupied territories, as this week has exploited a bus in Tel Aviv.
Repression is already mining democracy in the Jewish state, and democracy deplores the situation as the Arab population increases.
The cruel missions against Gaza each two or three years to reject Hamás will pay a more diplomatic peak.
Both baths need an employee of people in the conflict.
The solution remains that people are sensitive of both bands, most of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and the sending of the territory by Israel by reasons of security.
The hope, a small in a short term, is that the high fire gives a little more impulse to the other people who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, who must begin to put the weapons in Gaza together with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas that he accepts the idea of a Jewish state based on the borders of 1967, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs instead of the matter should also press Hamas and Fatah to join themselves.
This would contribute to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual status category in the United Nations.
Mr. Obama also has an important role in bringing Israel to the negotiation table.
During his first mandate, he refused to submit his own plan for peace.
Once again in the White House, it seems that it's equal to the reticent to dedicate his attention.
This is a deplorable vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest in the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinian.
The Generic Tabak Package Act enters into force in Australia
Warnings on the risks of smoking and parts of the body with diseases light on boxes of a green color, which are the same for all smoke marks
Australian law on smoking and generic packaging, pioneer in the world, enters into force and replaces the logs and the colors of the marks by a green olive abolition, a splendid image of body parts with diseases and representations of children and children sick for being smoking parents.
Unlike different images and health warnings, the only difference between boxes, binding from Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of them printed in a small type of source.
This is the most strict regime of the world applied to smoke packaging.
The Federal Government of Australia claims that the goal is to dissuade young people to smoke through the elimination of races that this habit is slight.
I trust in studies that show that if a person has not started to smoke before 26 years of age, there is 99% of possibilities that he never do.
"You can see that children, even since very early age, understand the message that the tabak company is trying to sell through their brand," stated the Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plibersek, quoting studies showing, for example, how the girls related to the logo of a coron with the idea of being a prince.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and that these changes will not be too affected to the benefits of multinationals, other countries are considered to take similar measures.
Tabak industry has exercised a huge pressure against law.
Tabak companies claimed that the law would promote the black market, where cigarettes would be more cheap and more accessible.
"The legislation will have serious involuntary consequences," said Scott McIntyre, from British American Tobacco, Australia.
It will increase the amount of smoking that will bring China and Indonesia to the false manufacturers to sell it in the streets of Australia.
Others say that their business has been benefited from the law.
Sandra Ha, from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, stated that the request of cylicon cups and cups to capture the unpleasant images of the castles had been shocked almost from twenty months ago, when the British American Tobacco, the British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost the law in the Supreme Court of Australia.
She stated that Zico had sold up to 6.000 units to senior institutions and that it was expecting more stocks.
"For us, it's a good business."
According to experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networks between the democratic sector to which the plan is directed.
After a series of Australian laws that prohibit advertising in television and sports patrocium and who impose the majority of sellers to not put cigarettes in view, smoke marketing has been online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Internet to local companies and websites, but it cannot be limited to foreign pages.
"If you market tobacco and just this small window to promote your products, the online space is the most convinced place in which you are," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman observed an increased review on brands from "food citizens" published on social network websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
It should be wondered if it is just a private citizen who really love the Marlboro cigarettes and has been taken the pleasant to perform a video or whether any marketing company is behind all this.
The British American Tobacco of Australia indicated that the industry is more focused on the new legislation than on marketing.
The industry has even paid to the Ukrainian, Honduras and the Dominican Republic rejecting new rules; these countries are claiming to the World Trade Organization that is restricting trade unjustly, despite any of these countries have a significant volume of trade with Australia.
The WTO is likely to say a resolution by mid-2013.
Plibersek stated that the Government had maintained conversations with other countries that are considered to apply similar laws in the field of smoking.
In 2001, Canada became the first country that introduced the obligation to include images in the boxes.
They are currently binding in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Greece, New Zealand, South Africa and India, it is considered to apply more harder laws.
In Australia, many smokers show disappointment.
" photos do not affect me.
I'm not simply doing the case."
"Coop the cigarette and keep the package," Victor El Hage says while buying a package with the image of a tumor in the mouth.
"Thankly, there's only one reason why I would stop smoking, for my daughter."
James Yu, the king of the Pack in the center of Sydney, indicates that the uniform boxes makes it the most complex to put them in the stars.
"Only a hour was late in deploying a delivery; now four, " said Yu.
"The government should have fully banned smoke, and then it's, right, it's been closed and we closed the shop," says while the hands upward.
In a constantly connected world, it is not so bad to burn a little
During the Thanksgiving Day of this year, unexpectedly, I had to pass five hours in a airport because the aircraft in which we fly had suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another flight.
So I had a lot of time to think about the aburriment.
I won't lie them.
It takes a half day in a airport waiting for a flight is quite buried, even if you have means to be entered, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forget us from the duty-free shops.
But there are more academic and child development experts that echo the goodness of the burden.
According to them, it's good that, both us and our children, we smell once.
Burrishing the brain obliges to search interesting options and may support creativity.
Since the majority of us are currently connected to this or the screen, we do not experience the benefits of burning.
So, should we accept a good spirit of burdening?
Yeah.
And no.
But we'll be talking about it further.
First, as many people, it was supposed that, now that we have more time for hair, the burning would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But as Peter Toohey says, Greek and Roman Catholic History of the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History" (The abbreviation, an animated history) published in 2011 by Yale University Press, is not so.
"In fact, the history of burning is very extensive," says.
In the walls of Pompeya there are graffiti in Latin on the burning dated from the first century d.C.
We must also draw up how we define the burden.
"The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in very different ways," says John D. Eastwood, professor of psicology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada.
After considering the investigations published and putting the idea before a group of discussions formed by 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined the burden as the experience of "desear, but not able to participate in a activities that fills you."
Reaffirms that the difference between abstainment and pathy is that the person does not something but wants to do.
She states that there is no desire to do anything with the pathy.
The main experience of burdening, said, is "the change of the care process, associated with a low state of spirit and a sense that the time passes slowly."
The burning can sound terriblely like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that, although they may be related, people who are buried have to see the problem as a matter of the environment or of the world, while the depressed persons consider that the problem has it.
Sometimes we believe we're burned, when what really happens is that we have problems to focus on us.
In its study "The Uningegged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" published in the September edition of the magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues were sent to a previous experience in which participants heard a skin of a person reading the article of a magazine.
Some groups listened in the room with a television program to all volumes that did not keep any relationship, others listened to it with the lower volume, so that it was only perceptive, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group who listened to the program with the volume under showed more absurdness than the other two groups; the cost of focusing on them, but they were not sure why and assigned to the burden.
"When you are trying to concentrate on a difficult or interesting task, the change of care can lead to the burden," said Mark J. Fenske, professor of Neurocience of the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
"On the other hand, when you're doing something awkward, such as detecting defectuous pieces in a manufacturing line, a music that distracts you can help you not burn you."
"In fact, we now know that moves or make galvats, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of burning, can actually help fighting, because they do that person is physically more warning."
"The investigations demonstrate that children who are allowed to move to learn more and have more information than those who are obliged to be quiet," says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it's going to be burned at some time: the delay of a plane, a monoton speaker, a specially burned film.
But some people have more tendencies to smile than others.
To help me mitigate it, some researchers developed a "scale of burning trends" in the 80s.
The scale includes questions such as "mous things I have to do are repeating and monotones" and "I have so many things that I don't have time to do all".
Stephen Vodanovich, professor of Psychology at the University of West Florida, states that, using these scales, researchers have found that kids have more tendencies to be burned more often than girls, and specifically need more external and more varied stimulation.
But, in general, adolescents are a group type that is quite easy.
In 1991, Reed Larson, the professor of Human and Community Development at the University of Illinois, conducted a experience in which 400 adolescents were contacted with their parents between seven and eight times a day through a search.
He found that 32 percent of the adolescents said he would be buried while he was in school or do the debts, while 23 percent said he would be buried when he was not in the school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of the parents said they would be burned.
Professor Larson said that he did not know whether the current burden percentages, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said that what he knew was that "Youth is a period in which the burden reaches its higher counts," mostly because both children and adolescents are not given a great control on what they want to do.
So, returning to my question of the principle, is it good to be burned?
Sometimes it is not, because, leading to extreme, it can make us exposure to absurd physical risks, how to put or fall into the consumption of substances as a method to combat it, as well as to demonstrate investigations.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers speak of the connection between abusiveness and creativeness, as Professor Vodanovich states, which has been studying this issue for over two decades.
"The burning is the way he has the brain to tell you that you should be doing another thing," says Gary Marcus, professor of Psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain does not always know what's the best suitable.
If you're buried and use that energy to touch the guitare or kitchen, it'll be satisfied.
But if you see the television, it's possible to satisfy you short-term, but not long-term.
"So, if your son is buried and gives him a iPad, it's possible that it's not already broken, but he won't have learned to entertain himself or to double himself," says Professor Fenske.
And "this ability to double applies to other situations", states.
Your son learns not only to entertain himself alone, but to learn to be better controlled in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise the burden.
But we should not be too critical with him.
Our goal should, instead, be the comfortable paragraphs of the continuous rum of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"In our way to see, we need more burnts, but burning is a too worried and worried desire as to relate to something that worthes the punishment," says.
She states that what people really seek is a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time.
"In a environment where we are constantly overstimized," says, " it's difficult to find ways to focus our attention when the laugh falls."
Coloured: without book of instructions for the new marihuana consumption law
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student in a Community institution and futbolist in the south-east of Colorado, is faced with a criminal process for something that will soon be legal in all the state: the possession of a marihuana stone and a pipe used to smoke it.
Orozco says a September day, he and some friends led by Lamar, near the Kansas border, when the police stopped them.
The police found marihuana in the car, and a time later, Orozco received a judiciary ' s ownership of drugs and related articles (related lawyers that contribute each of the United States $100) in which he was informed of the date of judgment.
"We treat as criminals," Orozco says.
And they're?
In the weeks of incertitude following the vote in Colorado for the legalization of the tension of small quantities of marihuana for recreational use, the response in hundreds of causes under drug tension depends on the law less than the location.
Hundreds of minor crimes per possession of marihuana are cancelled here as well as in Washington State, where a similar measure was adopted.
Police departments have stopped submit responsibilities against the older than 21 years by smaller ownership, which will be legally adopted once the law has entered into force in the next weeks.
But the taxes of the most conservative districts in Colorado have been committed to continue with the cases open for marijuana's possession and are still quoting people.
At the same time, several cities, from Denver’s suburbs to the western mountains, are voted to prevent marihuana’s shops, recently authorized in their communities.
"All this is changing so fast that I don't know what will be next," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, just to the east of Denver.
Those who are responsible for the rules in the Washington State are also giving them back to the matter.
They continue to search for advisory to establish a system of production, manufacturing, distribution and sales licenses; all of this before reaching the limit date on 1 December 2013.
They say, for good or for bad, Colorado is in front of most states regarding the regulation of the use of marijuana, first with therapeutic purposes and now for recreative use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide", says Brian E. Smith, portal of the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what it could work.
"There is not a real previous who serves us as a model", says.
The Washington Act, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December, which also leaves a year during which two waters will be slow, since the license system in that state will still not exist, but the possession will be legal.
Furthermore, there are delicate mechanical issues that should be solved during that period, such as the way to maintain a balance between the requirement of the state to provide a "appropriated access" to the authorized marijuana and the prohibition of conducting cannabis business in a radio lower than 300 meters of schools, parks, children's game zones or children's centres.
"In any place there will be more difficulty about an authorized cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Metropolitan area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, the port of the Centre for the Legal Cannabis, a group of research created recently.
On 21 November, Oates, the police chief of Aurora, sent an email to his police officers in which he informed them that the city's police would stop interfering judicial action for the lack of marihuana’s ownership to those older than 21 years of age and that the police would stop presenting charges against these crimes "in immediate effect".
The police head of Oates said they would be able to comply with the rules of the city which regulates marihuana's culture for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to continue to pursue traffickers and drug sellers.
At the gate of Ward, in the northern Colorado, the district's fiscal Ken Buck represents a more strict vision.
After the vote, he assured that his office would continue to follow the cases of marihuana’s possession, mainly to press consumers and to be decided to be treated.
Today, 119 persons face ownership of 56 grams or less marihuana, although many of them have other responsibilities.
"Our office has the obligation to interfere judicial action against those lacks that were sentenced at the time when they had come to crime", said Mr. Buck in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places such as the rural count of the Mesa, where voters rejected the initiative on the legalization of marihuana.
The police of Grand Junction, the largest city of the gate, no longer refers to adults for small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, the fiscal of the district, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the cases convicted by possession.
"I don't think she's losing the time when he continues to fulfill the law until it changes", said.
Despite 55 per cent of the voters supported the measure, it was never considered that the consumption of marihuana for recreational use of the government and the judicial system would be easy.
The contradictory reactions in the whole state show a marked ambivality between officials regarding the great ecological experiment in this state.
"This is a cultural barrier with the district taxes," says Sean McAlister, a lawyer of Denver, who represents the accused of marihuana's possession and is local porter of the National Organization for the reform of the law on marihuana.
"There have been so long, bringing people to the courts that, in fact, are not yet able to accept that it is legal," he stated.
As the first states that consider the small quantities of marihuana in the same way as if it is alcohol, Colorado and Washington are prepared to become test cases at national level in drug legalization.
While lawyers and officials of the State have a new border of legal sales, they also expect an anonymous receipt of the federal government, which still provides for consideration of the sale and crop of marijuana as federal crimes.
Defenders of marihuana's legalization have hope that the Department of Justice is over.
Despite the highlighted arrests of patients and marijuana solders for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has allowed mostly to sell marihuana businesses in Colorado, Washington and 16 more states.
"As it is likely that anti-drock agents do not throw the doors down to a small drug bag, they may be reacted to allow the operation of shops regulated by the state for the sale of marihuana for recreational use, allowed in the new law," said Kevin A. Sabet, an anti-drought policy exhibitor of Obama administration.
several Colorado cities are not expected to act with the federal authorities.
Even before the day of elections, some local governments adopted moratories on any new Marihuana shop, although it would pass around a year before any of them could open.
Last week, the Western city of Montrose adopted a ban of six months and it is likely that it approve the week that comes.
"We don't want to put us into a situation where we authorize someone and then have a serious problem at the federal level," explained Bob Nicholson, a member of the meeting.
" Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying for what the community voted to vote for what the state has voted."
There are many questions in this regard.
Petronella Wyatt: "I'm tired until I got Oxford for being a Tory."
Do not attack universities for their views only now
I don't remember any moment in my life in which I haven't dreamed to get a place at the University of Oxford.
My father and my grand brother had been in which I suggested was the best place of the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that promoted the two pillars of civilization: the free thinking and tolerance.
However, in the two weeks to take my place at the Worcester College at the end of the 80s to spend the historic cart, I had already done the shoes, which dismissed the first scene of my life.
My father was smiling and crying.
My friends were unconcerted.
The Evening Standard stated that I had left because he did not tolerate that some colleagues of university keep sexual relations in the room on the side.
The writer A.N. Wilson announced that I had gone because they forced me to drink in unconscious tastes.
The truth was less fun.
I'm out of there.
Yeah, I'm gone, because I had been subjected to a sweet and intimidating system.
Not because of my extraordinary name, nor of the fact that I came from a private school.
They pleaded me for one reason, that in the face of the illustration there was something intolerant and barbaro: my father, the difunto Woodrow Wyatt, was a high-speaked counsel from Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservator party.
Maybe you're wondering what it's coming now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of the right centre students is suffering similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hate towards the conservator party is such in Oxford that, last week, a group of them recalled the same level of rights with homosexuals, disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conserving members of the JCR (grouping students of the Christi College) claim that they are "severely, personally attacked and treated as non-grateful persons" for their political ideas.
They want to create a position in the university's equality committee to ensure that their opinions are able to express freely.
His situation was not favoured by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and the Right" (The Paradise: youth, brilliant and right) on the policy of students and presented the Tories as excentric and neonazis.
He showed the puzzle student Joe Cooke, an ex-president of the Oxford University Conserver Association, at a Rolls-Royce Royce, playing a plateed clothes and a bath with the plate snake.
In other universities, conservator students say that they are treated as "turk heads" for the introduction of higher matrix rates.
Luke Black, a 20-year-old vice-president of the Nottingham University Conserving Party Association, declared in a Sunday Journal that " there is a growing left trend in universities.
People think that we are like the Bullingdon Club without or even know us."
Samuel Roberts, a 21-year-old and historic student in Corpus Christi, who presented the motion for a greater protection, states that this environment is "incommoded", while Stephanie Cherill, 19-year-old president of the OUCA, declares that the attitude of the members of the JCR towards those who are in the right center has started.
“This poses a threat to the environment of intellectual debate and the well-being of members” said.
During my first weeks in Oxford, I was more than one.
I entered the university in September 1986, a 18-year-old young man who was terriblely tired.
The hatred towards the Conserver Party was at its highest point.
In the past year, the university had voted to reject Margaret Thatcher, an old student, a title "honoris cause" after the financing of the Supreme Education.
The environment had been exciting to any stalinist.
For the first days of the week of Welcome to the new universities, when new students are known and known to the Catholics, I received a sample of the amarcure that I was expected.
I found that the Catholics did not only the gorgeous view of the mofa that was made from the conservator universities, but also participating in it with good gain.
The policy of mining, privacy and opposition of the Government to sanctions against apartment in South Africa reached to the seminar wood rooms.
At the first time I was assisted to translate the French texts of the XVIII century and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Sra. Wyatt," said the Catholic Harry Pitt, " please translate the first paragraph."
I don't say any.
Pitt, a man kidnapped with a face that looked like a weird mask, knows well how to expulse a bad bilis.
"Is that the checherists refuse to learn French or is that they are just tonight?" asked.
Other universists laughed.
I was smelling the eyes of the laughs I tried to contain.
"I suggest you to go to French classs in your free time, always and when you're not too busy to know people," Grudged Pitt.
I reserved my room as a soul in pain.
That night I sat alone at the dinner at the university, and then I felt a slight palmed in the shoe.
He was a second-year English student named James, who was presented as OUCA member.
"I know who you are," he said.
"I'm afraid it's how it's okay.
They're putting to anybody who's suspected to be Tory.
It's very complicated for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so that's gonna be worse for you.
Many recently experienced Tories appeared to be workers."
Next, in a local pub, I tried cobardely to dismiss.
I asked that I didn't agree with all that Mrs. Thatcher said.
That truck resulted inutile.
One student of the first year of Philosophia, Politicals and Economics that, paradoxically, had studied in Eton, said, "You are a daughter of a fascist sweet.
You're contaminated."
Other students adopted that song.
I turned me into the pervertida Sweden.
"What do the Tories have sexual relations?" asked one.
"I'm going to give you one to another, don't you?"
I felt the same way that homosexuality should be sensitive before the Liberal Law of the 1960s.
Can I take a normal life in Oxford any day?
Would I be obliged to stay with people who thought like me only after the night?
Should I do a laboratory and repress my natural trends?
The three years I was expected were presented as a purchase of ostracism and isolation.
The only Catholicly openly Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History for my university college.
They hated him because they were not only the Conservator party, but also the advisor of Thatcher in external policy and one of the people who wrote his speech.
I was just there.
He detested the place that he considered it provincial and insignificant and for his accession to the Marxist-determinist vision of the history.
In 1997, he accepted a cathedra at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not gonna be happy here," he said.
I started to move from Oxford daily to the house of my parents in London, finding refusal in my family and friends of the most open metropolitan mentality.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he studied there in the 40s, all political points were accepted.
"But if it's the best place of the world," he said with tristeness.
"They never did that, not there between my loved students' skins.
Even my communist friends have always had an implicit attitude."
His painful eyes started clouding.
"Don't give me another chance.
I'm sure they've done it only to broke.
I would leave my heart if you leave it."
Happy of many travels to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorate.
One of my friends, who also supported the Conservator Party, had succeeded in pressure and had rejected his faith.
The next week, during a seminar in which another Catholic history had instructed, speaking completely seriously, that I was a "anxiety of the people", I decided to do the same.
I admitted that my parents had me "Laid the brain" and called them "the old idiots".
The strike took a little time.
It was my father who put the last key in my university career at Oxford.
For that time my father wrote two weekly columns in Murdoch’s press.
My door was closed with key.
I was in fear, and in the past five minutes my persecutors disappeared.
When the fuck was done, I took the first train to London.
I never returned.
Maybe you call me weak lloona.
But none of the 18-year-old person should be subjected to such intimidation and hostility in a educational institution.
More tragic result is that it was Oxford, which has not only formed 14 first ministers of the Conservator Party, but that today, after a reputation, nothing deserved of equality and freedom of thinking is hidden.
"Valentino prefers elegation to notoriety."
For the sample "Valentino: Master de la Costura", who has been inaugured this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian designer
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital to accommodate an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognised it during the inauguration of "Valentino: Maestro de la Costura", a retrospective pharmaceutical that meets more than 130 high cotton clothes created by its "maison" for the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," says with its unconfundable Italian acent.
This sample is the colleague of a history whose only protagonist is "the Lord" Garavani, but that couldn't have been written without its different customers.
Valentino always has a sense of fascinating the wedding and far away the world of nobleness.
In the first room of this exhibition, open to the next 3 March, there are many private letters and photos with the sign of the most granted aristocracy, from Princesa Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through the Princess Maria-Chantal of Greece and Margarita from England.
Valentino teaches those personal memorys as trofees of their social ascensus: of modest modest in the city of Voghera, north of Italy, to the idol of the "item-set" international.
Be lovers of reality has nothing bad.
"At least they do not remove the legs of their neighbors on your magnificent shooting as they do some beautiful festivals of pop music," says the Barone Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 70s we lived both in the Alpes and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular anfitrion and interviews with generosity and elegance.
"We all liked to be invited to your chalet in Gstaad," explains the exmuter of "Heini" Thyssen, intimately forgotten beautifuls like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always prefered elegacy to notoriety.
And yet, it's a star.
Valeria Mazza, lighting a Valentino
The argentin model Valeria Mazza does not forget the carism of the modest.
For many years, after a disappearing in Piazza di Spain, Rome, we went to his floor.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In each detail of the floor, decoration, food, music, all looked and felt his spirit.
"Anyone of the guests made us feel important and loved," remembers the "top model", which began working with him during the Paris High Cost week, in 1995.
"It's no modest because your designs are works of art," remated.
Hot Desfile
The life of Garavani is not a history of obsesions, but of well-complied loves.
He loves people with good education and best titles, and they love him.
One of the galaxies of Sorset House has been transformed into a glassful passion of six hundred meters of long, which offers a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must be dismissed through the passale to view a "audience" of a student that lights of master works from Valentino, such as the clothes chosen by Jackie Kennedy for his wedding with Aristotels Onassis, the clothes who used Monica Vitti in "La Notte" or a lana and skin ball belonging to the Emperat Farah Diba.
In this public of manuscripts are names such as Sibilla de Luxembourg, Gloria van Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norwegia, Bulgarian Rosario or Habsburg Sofía.
Naty Abascal and the modest, in 2006
Many of those customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "is impossible to forget".
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pantalonia, a shop, a "gilet" chaleco, and a chaleco of the autumn winter 1971-1972 collection.
"I did a gift he made me," says Naty Abascal, one of the museums of the designer.
"I prefer him above others for his wedding, for his great love to women, because it realises our beauty," adds the ex-Feria's Duquese.
I like the colors that I use, they have great light and are "donts" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princesa and Mode Prescriptor Patricia de la Jovpaola de Arenbergtampoco can forget the first time you saw a Valentino.
When I was adolescent and living in Italy, I was dreaming to have the age and time to use one of his night clothes...
Finally, the time arrived at the end of the 1990s.
I purchase my first Valentino clothes to use on a party at my first castle, the Prince Edouard of Line.
It was a red clothing with flights, "corsage" dragged and chosen word of honor.
"I was a real dream", says Rodrigo's widow of Arenberg.
"Valentino is independent to the mode, its obsession is the temporary", explains this Italian aristocraty who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg holds his modist feast clothes with "the maximum care... because a clothing is not only a clothes, it is also the assembly of memorys".
The "rey" of the mode
The great end of the Sunrset House exposure is Mary-Chantal Miller's girlfriend in her marriage with Paul of Greece in 1995.

The world's hardest office: the human beginnings of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the Indonesian volcan ports play life and health by loading 70 kilograms of stone seeds
There are people for which their work is a hell and another who, literally, works in hell.
It is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 mines who wins life by swearing out of the Kawah Ijen volcano, to the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
For that reason, you must slow every day to the bottom of your crater, where the sulfurous gas that eats from the wings of the earth is solidated when you enter the air.
After launching large stones of soft, which are totally swimming about 70 kilograms, it spends into two bamboo shoes loading on their shadows through stone seeds.
It is only 250 meters up to the top of the vulcan, which is up to 2.386 metres, but the extensive portators late over 40 minutes in tortuga steps, guarding the balance and measureing their steps in order to not rescue and fall through the precipitation.
They know that any transpire could cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who was disappointed for years by the risks of Kawah Ijen.
The miners of Kawah Ijen win 5 cents of euro for each kilo of sweat that extract
Once above, they open a step between the tourists who were photographing them as if they were circle monkeys and, loading fairly the canasta weight, walking three miles to the balcony that a mining company has located a little lower, up to 1.850 meters of height.
This is the PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that exploits the volcano since 1960, and, never better say, its workers, who pays 662 Indonesian rupias (5 hundred euros) for each kilo of Zurvee.
Then it is sold by 10,000 rupias (83 cents of euro) to the petrochemical industry, since this mineral is generalized in the daily life and is used to manufacture cells, artificial fires, cosmetic, dynamics and even to blame sugar.
"When normally it is loading 70 kilos, we get some 46.000 rupias (3.8 euros) on each trip," we explain Anto, who usually performs three daily doors.
It takes three hours in each and ends, but allows it to join 138.000 rupias (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems to be a mercy for such an inhuman effort, it is the trial of what would win in the field.
"The mining newspaper is very high here, where the collection of coffee is payed to 15,000 rupia (1,2 euros) the day and average monthly payment is of two million rupias (167 euros), ", he pointed out the portator, who had previously worked as albañil in the Bali tourist island.
There, his lounge was 75,000 rupias (6.2 euros) day and the bath was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a people near the volcano, for a weight reason that, in Indonesia, resulted as condemnant as the azure: "I caught with a young bali, where they are Hinduists, and I brought it to Java to become Islam."
Anto has asma, breath with difficulty, constantly touched and the eyes are irritated by toxic gas
At its 27-year-old, Anto takes three pieces in the Kawah Ijen, whose azufre has already started to pass the facture even to cover the face with a special mask.
He has asma, breathe with difficulty, smells constantly, and the eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that dismiss the volcan.
It's the price that you need to pay for your dream.
"I will work for more than two years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," I promise in a more acceptable English.
Casted by life, this good and intellectual young man could be a tourist guide, room or receptionist of a hotel, but instead of doing the work of a start.
Sharing an immense wood chain with other portators, each day it is up to two of the lunch because the sweet does not stop dinnering night, when its charming color becomes blue and slight in the midst of the darkness.
Dessert the shadows, Anto cut down the clayer with a small lintern adhered to his castle, which he himself purchased with his money.
About 400 portators load the snakes on their shadows from the back of the crap
Despite its skin benefits, the mine company has not mechanized the extraction of the sugar to spend costs or provide any equipment to the ports who work for their account and weight.
In fact, there is no part of the $30,000 rupia (2.5 euros) of loading by camera that, along with the entry of 15,000 rupia (1.2 euros), the guards of this natural park cover to tourists that add to photographing the volcan and their human beginning.
"This work is for the beasts and not for people," protested Madrusin, a 42-year-old portator who takes the Kawah Ijen three decades since he left the college.
The ability to up to 110 kilos, ensures that you will survive by working "all that can" because you need money to educe their three children from 18 to 10 years of age.
I'm not gonna jump, I'll die here because the volcan has been my whole life.
While the sweet burns and hears the eyes when the wind changes in improvisedness and touchs the mines in the pillars that come from the volcano, they are so hard that no one stops suffering serious diseases... more clearly there is, of their habitual breathing problems, artrosis, pain in the wheels and smells in the shadows, which have been misformed by the weight of the smells.
Oninik is already able to load 50 pounds to 53 years of age by balanced the shooting.
Each day, he and his companions get 15 tons of azufre to the volcan, which three trucks transfer to Tanzari's store, 18 km from distance through a castle between the evil.
"I'm not going to smile, I'll die here because the volcan has been my whole life," Uninik declares by opening the mouth well, where it misses several dents.
From his five children, the larger, 30 years of age, also works by loading azure.
The time passes, but the perpetual mercy of generation is one of the most hard officials in the world: which makes the human beginning of Kawah Ijen.
Singapore search for babys to save the economy
Singaporees are responsible for the care, stress and cost of property and education because they do not have children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I'm a patriotic husband, you're my patriotic wife, we comply with our civil duty and believe in life!
It may seem inverosimil that these verses are part of an advertising of menta pills, but despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video became viral in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references like "We're going to put a bath on the horn" to rise from the Singapur's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, offers the hope that with the advertising logren calls attention to the problem in a pleasant way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said I wanted to use the music power so that people comply with "the national duty".
This is something cleanly of the Internet, so we had to do it pleasant and pleasant.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst of the world in playing ourselves, so we felt that this was a theme we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as launching perfums with feromons or organizing velets of rapid quotes (speed-dating).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they did not necessarily work.
So we think, why do we not do the most creative possible to solve this problem, which is composing a rap?
1,2 children
The government of Singapore is not taking it so slow.
$1.300 per year in policy to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents provides up to $15,000 for child, extends maternity licenses and depends on fiscal benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high technology city in South Asia, also known by the conservation of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, in accordance with its national population division, is currently in 1.2 children per woman.
The last time I was above 2 - known as reposition rate - was in 1976.
So why the Singapore do not have any more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage Policy and Family of the National Population Division, says that it is due to a "more education" and "a larger range of care opportunities".
"This has allowed people to have a broader range of options in terms of life and priorities, more than to marry and form a family," explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to the increase in solitary and to the delay of marriage and birth, resulting in a decrease in birth rate in Singapore.
However, an immigration policy has been aimed at dramatically increased immigration to face it with the decline of the population has created residues between local populations.
In Singapore there are websites where the xenofobia is only dismissed against many new immigrants, in particular the Chineses, who criticize to maintain lower wages and not integrate.
Increased immigration is also seen as one of the reasons for which the Singapore government party has experienced its worst electoral result from independence last year.
Since the elections have been trying to correct the problem, with higher quotas and gravities for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the rate of birth has an impact on the economic growth of a nation, tax revenue, health costs and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also has some unexpected consequences.
The government tries not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has started to affect the real estate sector.
The Urban Development Authority has been controlling the number of small apartments known as "shaped box", which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have surfaces of 46 square metres and have had a lot of success of sales.
However, there is concern that they can promote a single life style and decline the developers who want to build large, family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the Immobiliary Business EL Developers, says that its "shaped boxes" are much more faster than the largest units.
They are most popular, in the sense that the units are slower days, even weeks, more faster than the larger size units.
This makes it much better for our box flow.
However, it acknowledges that the new standards provide clearer guidelines for developers, to which they had previously been put to work if they wanted to offer disadvantaged small units in a project.
Strengtheless
Singapore is a state city.
Although these new rules can be a step towards the increase in the national birth rate, speaking to the Singapore who work in the financial district of the similar centre that will not have a great effect.
"The people are very stressed, the houses are faces and it is also education, so many people are putting it", says a young executive man.
Other people may have children.
"But for me, it's important to tell me my own money and time," says another youth of about 20 years.
Man and women mention their care, stress and cost of property and education, such as reasons for preventing children.
So, as long as the government is trying to encourage its citizens to have children, when it is about to make children, the Singapore are who have the last word.
Lo private off line is private on line
Privacy.
According to the Spanish Real Academy Dictionary, it is the private quality or "the area of private life that is entitled to protect from any intromission".
What is private for a less than 16 years?
How does this definition apply in their daily life and social networks?
Does the dangers that are exposed to venture in Internet situations that would probably not share out of line?
The period interviewed five boys between 10 and 15 years of age, frequent network users.
In four of these cases, they associated the term "something very me", in personally, and "in the key and name of the user", when they applied it to social networks.
"My deepest secrets would not go to a post," says Jorge, ten years old, when trying to explain the meaning of private in websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where you have accounts for two years.
"It's very secret, my mom can know you, but not all," says.
In FB under beautiful images or games.
I'm also talking to my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that isn't my, or from someone who's doing the crazy," says.
The child recognizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, disnumbers, crimes, or write humilious or violent comments.
Jorge ensures to meet the 35 friends with FB and their nine followers on Twitter.
Most are parents.
The mother is included, has the key of one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express me and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I'm just under them," adds.
"Social networks are entertained, I can talk to far away or with my friends in a rapid way," says.
I do not doubt that I would never accept a request of an unknown person.
I wouldn't do anybody who would recommend him to a stranger.
Joseph's case of 14 years is different.
The adolescent has open accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in this latest appeal, do not know 20 of the agreed persons in his friends list.
"Don't scare me, because we have something in common, music for example," says.
According to the boy, no one has entered it or has requested the address of your home or phone number.
"If they pressure me or just demand me the shoes of my account," you know.
José was a follower of Ask, then read a Twitter recommendation.
The boy is not the experience of what today is known as ciberbullying.
One known friend of my friend was extorting him in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"No one knows who he was," says.
The victim, according to José, did not close the account.
"I just put him in privacy."
Once this is the first time that I got over with your account.
On the contrary to Jorge, this boy would be born photos of known in uncomfortable or pregnant situations.
Yeah, I would do that if I'm bad or I'll get him.
"I know that's cyberbullying," says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, English teacher and license in Education and Education, considers that to guide children and adolescents it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"Internet occurred as a means to search information, but with the appearance of these sites, they changed the rules of the game," mentioned.
Porras pointed out that the Academic Marc Prensky, which was in Pedagogy by Yale University and author of the Digital National and Migrant Work, counted these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital nationals are they, children and young people who were born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants we have to teach them when we are still learning," says.
She comments that the topic is complex, "for we ask you to have a defined criteria on what it should or not spread, publish or say to a age that you do not give it to this."
"If they are also selective when what they are most important is to be popular, have thousands of friends without thinking of the consequences," adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach what is private to children and adolescents is through questions that make them reflect.
"Don't say that you don't serve it," adds.
Then, Forras lists some options: There are things that you wouldn't tell him to a stranger, why do you do it online?
Or, would you like you to publish a photo of you as you published from a friend?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you label photos, did you ask the other people to label them?
And another thing, do everyone need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make you see that you must act on line as they do offline.
It's the same rules.
"Another outside Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles must be in social networks," says.
Monitoring
Studio Watch Tower, university Catholic, professor of primary and educational consultor, comments that the family parents read the social network policies with awareness.
By understanding each of the incises, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the implications of opening an Internet account.
"For example, the age and what is allowed to share or publish it," says.
According to the Guardia, it is key to remember the children's lesson of "not speaking with strangers".
Finality of the Unsur Summit without making public the Declaration of Lima
The VI presidential Summit of the United Nations (Unasur) has concluded today in Peru without that the Lima Declaration was publicly announced preceding and theoretically signed by the seven assistant mandates.
Effee tried to reiterate access to the document signed in the VI Headquarters' Order Meeting of Unsur but sources of Cancilloria and Presidency pointed out the start that would be delivered after the closure, but then they claimed that it will be published at any time on the Peruvian Government's website.
In consultation with the text, they pointed out that the content was exposed by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during a short declaration to the press.
The access of journalists to the information of the Summit was at any time limited.
During the day, only, in the press room, the video without sound of the presidential Assembly was transmitted with the message "private, limited audio session".
The few information circulated between the reporters was provided by the press chairs of some of the Governments of Unsur assistant to the question, although not Peru.
The only document published during the day was the list of assistant chairpersons, which occurred in the painting of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media requesting more information.
Afterwards, the Peru Presidency sent an email to the media with the "final declaration" of the Summit, but it is Humala's pronunciation, and not the official document that closed the summit.
In October last, Peru was the anfitrion of the III Summit of Southern Arab America (ASPA), and at that time, although it was urgently requested by the press, the also called Lima Declaration that had previously announced was not distributed.
In the official ASPA website, the document was published on Tuesday.
In both international quotes, the Peruvian authorities were endeavoured that there had assuranced transmission systems for all journalists but limited the receipt of information to the maximum.
The Summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a failure from the Hague Court that is a different border between both countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and of Chile, Sebastián Piñera, were gathered during the regional quote and ratified that they would be respected by the decision of the (Cí), which begins the Monday in the Haya to listen to the delegates of both parties, in the process submitted by Lima against Santiago.
"We will end and execute the sentence that defines the differences we are today leading to this international court," Humala said, along with his chilean par.
"Chile has been, is and will continue to be a respectful country of international law, the peaceful solution of disputes, treaties and international courts", acknowledged Piñera, and he welcomed with an appreciation of hands to Humala, along with the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of both Chairpersons that would be subjected to the CIM was then that Colombia declared this week the Bogotá Covenant accepted to be subject to the failures of the International Court, after a decision on maritime limits with Nicaragua which considered seriously wrong.
The Summit was held with the insights of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Onesur since 2011 after his former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the quote.
The anfitrion President, Ollanta Humala, was the officer to open discussions in the morning and closure the Summit, just after Lima's midday.
The mandate reads the final document in which 16 agreements were adopted and the action lines for 31 projects between South America ' s countries were fixed for a total of $17 million in investment.
Among the agreements adopted that UNASUR countries would give "important steps towards the purpose of a South American citizenship for what we are being expanding the residence agreements".
It was noted that actions were encouraged to improve cooperation in the fight against civil insecurity and transnational organized crime, action to make medications more accessible, access to internet to low prices in all demands of South America, and to achieve joint and efficient risks of natural disasters.
With a crisis Europe, "the economic consolidation (Late America) must not have a triunfalist matrix but should serve to expand our productive matrix and visa a better future for our peoples," acknowledges Humala.
"We have decided to have a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of South America's spaces, especially in rural and border areas, joining our countries and generating new economic circuits," said the Peruvian President in a read message.
Among these projects, five were corresponding to Peru, and are located in the cross-border edges of their territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two focused on a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not have more details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the election process in that country serves for its reintegration to the United Nations of South America," which is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and good relationships between neighbors, was another of the issues underlined by the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said to start his participation in the regional quote that was expected to meet with his couple of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, the Saturday in Mexico to treat the maritime difference after a CÍ failure, questioned by Bogotá.
"The morning day (Sat) may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega", said Santos.
"We'll review all these ways, they're not exclusive, including Nicaragua's treaty will require a conversation with Nicaragua," he stressed.
" With President Ortega I hope I can tell you that we handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega would be found on Saturday in Mexico, where they were planned to attend the new President of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also, as a part of the Summit, the Ministers of Bloc Defence had previously been meeting to adopt the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay integrates UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
Peru has the Presidency for the time of the regional block.
"Suramerica must learn from Europe to integrate citizenship": Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, stated today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "Suramerika, in this case, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the VI presidential Summit of the United Nations of South America (Unasur), was held in Lima, declared the Peru TV state that the Europeans were "slaughtered in the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but now they are almost a patriarch."
In that sense, he defended the draft establishment of South American citizenship to encourage the Unsur Member States.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country is to be obtained, as it is already with the integrants of the Andina Community, but there are still reactional sectors that want us to return to the past," warned.
The Ecuatorian President also showed the recovery of the United Nations of American States (EEA) under the premium of raising the influence of the anglosay states and taking into account those signed by the Covenant of San José on Human Rights.
Those who give cathedra never compromise to nothing and, instead, we're the suramericans signed it all.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the financing of the United States," stated Ecuador in the allegation of the political asylum given by the WikiLeaks Foundationr Julian Assange.
Correa ensured that it is not repentant from that decision because he did not trace his principles, but respected its "democratic and human rights deep values".
He stated that, at its time, "would suspects found that Assange was extracted to a third country and was not respected by its process."
He also criticized the Swedish justice in order to require him to be subjected to the questionnaire in your territory by a sexual offence when "the Swedish law allows it to be carried out through videoconference, which could be done from the Embassy of Ecuador in London".
Correa stated that there is a risk of deterioration of the physical and mental health of Assange.
"I didn't talk to him since he was in our embassy, but the embassy told me that he had a small pulmonary problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuatorian mandate.
Whatever it is the danger that your physical and mental health is deteriorate because it is closed in a small space without being able to exercise free air.
"It's complicated the health of any person," added.
Correa noted that the solution to the asylum offered to Assange since June in the Ecuatorian Embassy in London, through the conception of a savior conduct that allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities and stressed that there had been discussions with London in searching for a solution to the end of the WikiLeaks founder.
We have not negotiated with human rights, this word we did not use it in this case, but have been continuing conversations.
"The solution of this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, is doing a number of procedures in different European instances", said.
And he thought, "If Great Britain last morning the safe drive this ended."
And if Sweden, as perfectly allows his legislation and as he has done in other cases, asks Mr Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or asks it to Skype tomorrow ends this problem.
Correa used to reaffirm himself as a defender of the freedom of Press and died that what does not tolerate is "middleness, bad faith and lie, which disfellowship the freedom of expression".
"The largest enemy of the freedom of print are not the evil and wicked politicians, but the bad journalists on the basis of lunch, chasing and extortion," said.
In this regard, it was pleased that these journalists weren't "nor the bankers or the hegemonic and bourgeois countries who dominate Ecuador" and succeeded that it would be released "developed in the revolution to continue the right way and direction".
Correa also supported the decision to keep Paraguay veto in Onesur at least until its next elections, as it argued that the body "that should be strong and not tolerated the opportunism and the refined golpism of legality" because, in fact, "destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguay democracy".
The Ecuador President also considered "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian Homologo, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate now with Nicaragua the maritime limits between the two countries following the failure of the International Court of Justice of the Hague, which benefited from the Nicaraguês maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, that failure is not completed.
It is a problem between a South America and a Central American country.
The conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overwhelmed by the will of walking together.
We need to process them in a wide way to overcome them and continue.
He also trusted in a good conclusion of the struggle by maritime limits that remain in the same Peru and Chile court and believed that "that is right for Latin America to look for international instances if the two countries are committed to accept faults as hard as it is."
With regard to the possibility presented as a candidate in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to find a third consecutive mandate, he pointed out that this possibility "with very optimism and joy, although sometimes is very hard."
Correa has assured that if you lose the starts of February 2013, it will be removed from public life.
I have never interested the power in personality, but in situations as in Ecuador this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected from political power.
"My pólitic movement believed that I was who guaranteed that likely victory, because we have to accept that replyability," said.
It would be my last period in the presidency and we go out of public life.
If we lose the same thing.
"It's a decision," he stated.
Correa was also referring to the new health treatment of the Vienna President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just talked to the Vice-President Nicolás Maduro and said that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, of rutin, which was expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It does not mean a receipt in the health state of President Chávez," commented.
Today, the Ecuador State Chief participated in Lima in the VIC Summit of the United Nations Heads of the South American Union (Unasur), which had concluded with a greater regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today are cause of late detection
Manufacture had 21 years old when the test result was confirmed: positive AIDS.
"I was like if I'm falling a bomb," refers to remembering the time of the announcement, that the doctor tried to make "more fashion", without clear success.
The boy hid it to his family.
He decided to be charged only of her disease and began to inform her; with such an effort that she had already celebrated her birthday 43.
It is, uncertainly, one of the oldest patients in the Guadalajara Civil Hospital Unit of the Guadalajara (HCG), which came in 1994 after several battles.
Manufacture lives with human immunodeficiency virus (VIH) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 90s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, until the director of an IMSS clinic, he avoided his "for he was taking a cut."
Then, having AIDS was a synonym of death.
Now you can survive this syndrome and do it with quality of life.
However, ignorants of their disease, many still arrive when the virus has already caused rabbits, "acted" to its immunological system and are victims of opportunist infections.
At 31 years of the appearance of AIDS in the world, at least in the first cases reported, "the great achievement in this moment means that the survival of a patient who began to be treated in a timely way and the survival of the general population is exactly equal", stated the Chief of the HCG Unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after referring to that information was entered in April of this year in a prestituted scientific publication.
Infection and experts in HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva stated that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and the quality of life depended on the rate of impact on the immunological system that present patients when they start diagnosis, with better expectation for those who are not drug users: from up to 30 years with a 200 CD4 and 50 years of age, when reporting 500 CD4.
In simple words, the previous means that who receives the positive HIV diagnostic in the age of 25 years, under these terms "which keeps in control can live without problems until 75 years" explained the interview.
To dimensionate this progress, it must be remembered that today's life hope for medievals is 76 years.
Although mortality has been significantly decreased in the past years, in Mexico, the number of patients who died from AIDS lowed from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNSIDA Annual Report), also is true that 60 percent of patients have failed from the appearance of AIDS.
Only 255 people in Jalisco had fallen in 2011 and from 187 deaths until May of this year; however, there are universal access to antiretroviral medicines since 2005.
- Why are you still dead?
- I think that the problem is not access to treatment.
So I'm seeing it, so it happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we have not had a drug disappointment, the problem is that patients have been very advanced because they don't know their infection state, or, in late phases of disease.
God is a contundent given: "Now of each ten patients come when they are already presenting some opportunist infection that you have to have to have to have a greater impact on global mortality, is to make diagnostics more premature and, therefore, to provide massive detection tests, to all those who require it."
In its proposal, specialists and officials of the AIDS State Prevention Council in Jalisco (Coesida), also the patients like the Fabrizio, who had been able to test a special laboratory, only motivated because he had made a friend and, despite the short age of him, was already in AIDS stage and even ill-sized in Caposi, a cancer tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you're sick.
Some think they're going to die and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm already going to die, I'm better returning three times a week," they say not in my case.
The change was to improve, eat me well, exercise, take the medicines.
At the time, your parents only know that he was ill to cancer.
I lived a normal life like anybody.
" Work, I have many activities, travel, I have an active sexual life, but corresponsible, I care for me and the other person," urged Fabricio, who accepted to share its intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate his witness to whom today, in the framework of the World Day of AIDS, are afraid.
They are tested, if they were risked, that among them know if they are positive HIV, it is better and if they already have the diagnosis, they learn that they can live as any person, being responsible.
That, his message, resumes the skin of battle to AIDS this 2012.
Conditions after the displayer
Great are the shoes between health programmes and common citizens, Sussite Ricardo Salazar, assaultist who took the cause around HIV.
And the biggest is in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "this has been effectively increased the distribution of condons, before they gave us one or two, now gives us 100 packages, and that's very well but results that there are still people who have access to a condon," said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"What do you want?" is a common question, with a sound and awareness of the value of social workers, school orientators, pharmaceuticals and health personnel, which did not want to be exposed to adolescents, ensured the communicationr.
I propose to redirect this distributed inefficiency; that the condons are not only after the showers, and that hundreds are found in public bathroom dispatchers of the youth sites.
It is not motivating promiscuity.
It is no matter to pay them the chelas and the motel, as the Governor Emilio González answered, as he asked if there would be a redistribution of conservatives in his administration.
"There is not sexuality, the best is approaching convictions to those already practitioning sexual activity," he pointed out.
Keys In Jalisco
There are 13,435 accumulated cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is 4° national place in new and AIDS accumulated cases and 13th HIV.
92% of counts correspond to sexual path, 6% to blood and 2% to perinatal route.
500,000 people may live with HIV because, for a registered case, there are 4 to 5 people that do not know.
Ratified by a U.S. appeal court to a sentence that is unknown for the restructuring of the debt of the Vitro achieved Group to go to a commercial competition in Mexico, the scenario puts a preceding injury for any national undertakings with rations in the neighbouring country that have problems of solvency.
It would therefore be said that the procedures for survival of the signs that permit mexican laws are not valid in the country of bars and stars, in contrast to international conventions.
In the practical field, the slope of the sentence issued on June 15, last by Judge Harlin Hale from the Court of Bancarrotas for the northern Texas district, let the mexican signs in defence against the possibility of embargo of its property in all the parts of the Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door to the main vessel manufacturer in Mexico to address the United States Supreme Court, arguing three inconsistences.
Introduction, while the judge of the case states that the creditors must be registered by the Act of the United States of Quiet Branch, the Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuito, with seats in New Orleans, said that the principal procedure is the commercial competition treated in Mexico.
The first point would imply on the international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of undertakings with transnational profile.
Indeed, to that end, the United Nations Model Act for the Uniformity of International Market Law was established, as an arbitrator of the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the court states that without the inter-companionary vote, recognised in the critical mass of the marketing competition, the debts that had with its mother the subsidiarys of Vitro, had not been achieved the majority required to adopt the restructuring.
However, the possibility is recognised by the Mexican laws.
In fact, the Vitro has not been the first case in which the scheme is accepted.
There are a mid-third examples, including Agremex and Commercial Mexico, whose inter-Company debts covered by the Federal Institute of Markings.
It is also true that, remaining the votes of the subsidiarys, in all ways, the crediers of Vitro who struggled against it in the United States Courts, namely the "buitre" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved most.
The vote would have been 45 per cent against 37.
The date prohibits the Court of Appeals.
From another angle, this is Vitro's difficult situation from 2008 to the slowest economic crisis in the United States, taking the collections to the country.
The signing of the family González Sada will soon interpone a revision requiring to the Court of Appeal to reach the full of it, namely the five judges, since they have only voted three.
This will not be achieved by the Requirement of Cerciorare that requires the review of the process by a Supreme Instance, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The serious case is that the Court has subscribed a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the figure of friends curiae, in which the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the Market Concours Act was desacreed with appeal to the Conventions signed by both countries to assist it with Chapter 15 of the United States Banking Act.
Furthermore, it is noted that the country had been implemented to the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, i.e. the rules laid down for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for debts and creditors.
Two bands character: take you to Vitro and get it to the country.
General balance
Between several months, the complaints made in the table by the Aviation Associations of Mexico against the excursion of the company, Gastão Azcharraga Andrade, whose charge of fraudulent administration, have already found the Sindical Association of Pilots of Aviators.

As you know, Azcharraga Andrade is the main shareholder of Posdas hotel chain.
Search for Dragon Mart
A group of national and foreign environmentists, academics, entrepreneurs and members in general of civil society adopted the creation of a wide front to oppose the inauguration of the Chinese Mart Dragon in Cancún.
We are talking, as you know, of a colonial sale and distribution in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the wall, with a housing area for employees of 150 companies.
Before the Canacintra had able to unify the rulers of the south-east area to oppose the monumental coso that struck with a part of protected areas and put the mother of all the smuggles against the industry.

Hector "Hein" Reyes: "The ballocesto has been my life."
Trottants of the ball Hector "Hetin" Kings were more than 60 years connected to the table sport and, thanks to him, traveled the whole world.
Many people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of local balloncet history as he has Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
And it is that before a brain throwed him in 2008, Kings were injured in the sport for more than 60 years, they were a player of minor categories, a player of the National High Baloncet, supported and leader in the BSN with the Bayamon Vaqueros or President of the Baloncetto Federation.
"I put many shadows in the bathroom through my life, including several times the same time, as when I was the president of the BSN, the head of the National Team and the federal President for the 1990s," Reyes recalled during a visit from First Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
"The ballonest has been my life."
Reyes don't exager to make that warning.
The walls of your house, almost all decorated with photos and memorys that denote their broad trayectory, thus witness it.
Charming in the heart
Of course, those who smell more emotively are those who remember their step by the Vaqueri from the mid-50s as player until 1982, when he complied 15 years as coapodered or supported by the French.
"These were my best years, those who most disappointed me because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Vaqueros' Championships since 1967, it was already as a supported, co-faced or leader.
Those were many years of satisfaction, including the five champions run from 1971 to 1975.
And then I was drunk with one in 1981, Jerome Mincy's debut year in the BSN.
From then on, "Choos" Ortiz was charged, which was a great administrator", stated Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, "I have a strong player of 6"7.
You want it?"
And that's the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players who have had Puerto Rico.
Bartow then recommended the Francoter Raymond Gausse, who was native and was one of our best drivers.
I remembered that if Mincy had given him a campionate to Bayamon, Gausse would help bring another.
The Vaqueros Championship with Gausse enjoyed it, but at the distance it was already, because for 1988 it was already federal commands.
For that time, I prefer to enjoy its executives and the Mincy at the National Team.
I remember when we win to the United States for the first time during the 1989 Preolympico in Mexico.
Then the World of 1990, where we arrived four and should have been bronced to be not by the Canadian arbitre that made us repeat the final game for the second time, Reyes said.
Is that World Group in 1990 the best national team you have seen?
It is among the best, as well as who won it to the Dream Team in the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the Pan Americans in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and we told him one for the U.S. team, which was very similar to the one we won the bronze in the world.
The team did not only repeat Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculin" (Ortiz), but also had "Toñito" Colon and James Carter young, Leon brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, which couldn't be in 90 because of a lesson in the routine.
A team that may not be the best in personal terms, but gave us a gold medaille and a great joy was the 1995 Preolympico in Newcene, Argentina.
With role players such as "Canito" Nieves, Paul Alicea and a young Rolando Hourruitiner in substitution of players suspended by the Lake of the American Panorama of Mar del Plata, we win gold against all the prognostics.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
Nevertheless, that's been Piculin Ortiz.
His numbers at the level of international tours are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated that level as Piculin did.
And that's without telling his trayectory in the different lines you played.
Who has been the best boricua leader?
It's very difficult.
We had a very good shooting that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armageddon Torres.
Young people, I like Leo Arill's work.
What do you think your biggest achievement in the Federation?
It was a part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that at the beginning of the 1990s the BSN was up to 17 teams in a time.
What was the rest of you to do?
There were things that would like to implement, such as regionalization of minor categories.
For example, Ponce's boys are only playing in their area and only faced teams of other island rewards in national playoffs.
Now children travel and play too unnecessaryly.
At least I see the fruit of the compulsory certificates and course for leaders, table officials and arbitres.
That's fun.
What are you doing now?
The most I'm doing is listening to music, see videos of my YouTube time, enjoy my neighbors and sometimes when I go to bathroom games.
And of course, enjoy my wife's company, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Death the actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born 21 September 1931 in Forth Wordh (Texas), was worldly famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, most known as "J.R." in the "Dallas" TV series in which he was incarcerated to a businessman without scrupulous, malicious and manipulator.
Larry Hagman, whose role as Oil Depredator J.R. Ewing in the "Dallas" TV series, became a symbol of avaricia in the 1980s, died.
I was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new time of "Dallas", died on Wednesday after the afternoon because of cancer complications, according to a reporter of the family provided to The Associationed Press by the Warner Bros., producer home of "Dallas".
"Larry was back to her loved birth city of Dallas, representing again the ironic role that I liked you most," said the family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Holiday of Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who interpreted the role of his wife in the original and secular series, was with Hagman when she falled in a Dallas hospital, said the publisher of her, Jeffrey Lane.
I was gonna bring him joy to all that I knew.
It was creative, generous, pleasant, pleasant, sweet and talental, and I will extraordinaryly strange it.
"He was a original person and lived the maximum life," Gray stated in a communication.
Hagman diagnosed it in 1992 and recognized that he had been taken for years.
In 1995, it was found a bad tumor in the heat and was subjected to a transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman was famous on the television as a decent type in the lingery "I Dream of Jeannie", distributed by the NBC chain from 1965 to 1970.
In it she interpreted Captain Tony Nelson, a astronomy whose life is changed when she found a genius attractive, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and he lived with him in his home.
He was also a protagonist of two codies that had been shortly at air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the cinema included well-received papers in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his magistrate interpretation of the charmingly detestable J.R. that brought Hagman to his maximum star.
The dramatic series of the CBS chain on the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit were at the air from April 1978 to May 1991.
The Promotional phrase "What shot J.R.?", thought to generate expectative expectations around a full episode of emotions, in which Hagman's character is almost killed, generated an international speculation and millions of dollars covered in shipping houses.
He also helped to give the series a hearing record at that time.
When the response was revealed in a chapter of November 1980, a average of 41 million TVs synchronized it and converted to "Dallas" to the second most viewed entertainment programme of history, behind the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million spectrums.
It was J.R., Christin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. was pregnant and then shocked her with a prostitute, unless he was out of the city, but others had reasons to attack it.
Hagman interpreted Ewing as an inconsistent corrupt with a charistical dream: a trapped entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who tried that his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), was inside.
"I know what I want in J.R's laptop," said Hagman in 1988.
I should say, "This is the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only negotiation he lost.
Victoria Principal, a co-protagonist of the original series, recalled the Wednesday to Hagman as a person "world me, inside and outside the screen".
It is unforgettable, and unreplaceable, for millions of admirers in the world, and in the hearts of each of us, we had the chance to know him and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were transmitted a few months ago with great success to the TNT channel.
The recording of five chapters for the second time and a sixth was in process, reported the chain.
There was no immediate statement of Warner or TNT about how Hagman's loss series will be managed.
Oriundo de Fort Wordh, Texas, was a son of the actor and sing Mary Martin, who sing out classic works like "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a youth when he was married in 1931 with the lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried happiness in the New York theatre scenarios at the beginning of the 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
When he was there, he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and caught with her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrations live.
In 2001 he referred his memory "Hello Darlin": Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life."
"I didn't put anything there that I would think I'd swear someone or affect them anyway," said the Asociated Press at that time.
After hepatitis transplant, he became a promotor of the donation of organs and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to attend fearful patients.
"The advice, I give them valuable, meet with them when they come to their surgery, and then," said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer something of comfort, like "no friend, will be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but you'll be fine."
He was also active against the smoking habit and participated in several campaigns.
Start course to explore the "Fin of the World"
Each week, students explore philosophical topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germees, and global heating.
This seventh, when the professor in religion Stuart Charme decided to set a course on the end of the world, I knew that he was counting with an irresistent angels: the end of the "width back account" of the Maya Calendary on 21 December, which many people had been obtained as a test that the end of the world comes.
But Charme had no idea of what he was expected in the next couple of months: Huracán Sandy, a fiscal precipitation that some have called "deducracy" and a growing conflict that involved Israel, the place where Christian theories in the end of the times believe that the Apocalypsis will start.
"I didn't realize that this would be the most philosophical semestre that has happened," she said this week to the students of the Rutger-Camden University (New Jersey).
If one analyzes what has happened in the world today as if we were 30 days and talking about, this has been a very good period.
And remember that bad is good for those of apocalic mentality.
And he is not the only teacher that offers courses about the "the end of the world" this semester, in the theory the last of the history.
In Temple, the adjoint professor Barry Vacker is dedicating the course "Mediums, Cultures and the end of the world".
Each week, students explore philosophical topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germees, and global heating.
"We analyze why these ideas proliferate with time," said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios that lead some human behavior.
If nuclear material falls in the hands of terrorists, for example, it could be a war.
In this month, students analyzed films with pharmaceutical topics and explored how compared with examples of real life.
"I've tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
In the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, professor of Latinoamérica Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjoint professor of History of Art and Anthropology, have made a team to set a course, which is just "The end of the world".
"We do not add '2012' to always tell with the option to resume the course again, if the world is not finished," said Restall.
Despite the "imminent destruction", students should study, generate projects and take final reviews.
In Penn State, the final review will be taken in the vineyard of the Apocalipsis, which does not leave students another option than to work " until the same night in which the world ends", said Restall.
The courses were very popular.
"He was breathed in two hours," said Restall about his course for high average students, which was filled with 35 students.
We received e-mail messages for weeks and weeks before the start of the seventh, of people who asked whether it was still in place.
Students, on their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting ones.
"I'm fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old school student in Religion and Sociology in Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that pharmacological, secular or religious mentality is only a matter of comfort or absence.
Will Wekesa, a student of Psychology and Nursing carriage of 25 years, said to have seen all the apolyptical films.
"I had never heard about a class that could teach that," he said.
I'm glad.
But no student interviewed - and much less than one professor - said to believe on the date of 21 December.
"Our first project was treated about the maya prophecy and in a certain manner we dismissed it," said Julie Zeglen, a student last year in Temple, 21 years and West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
But there was an apocalistical concern in the Western culture, which takes place for several centuries, in which people react to changes around them by predicting the end of the world.
Internet has caused an increase in these speculations.
"In other sides, people do not think about this," he said.
In most of the world of English speech.
Joseph Duugherty, a religious teacher at the University of La Sale who implies courses in the Philippines this year, quickly responded to the question of whether he knew about some course about the "the end of the world" there.
"The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world," wrote, teaching an exception of superior authority.
We have a dad's indulgence.
Restall noted that during the years it has been spoken of many days of the final judgment, and said that if nothing happens on 21 December, "the people will start thinking immediately on the next date" or philosoph that 21 December is the start of a period of seven years after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date slow.
Some have said they think they're going to celebrate the end of the world.
"I may call some friends to get together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communication student.
