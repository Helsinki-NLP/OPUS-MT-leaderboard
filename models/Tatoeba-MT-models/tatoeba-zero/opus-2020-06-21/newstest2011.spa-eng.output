What do you mean? ŠSSD in Praga does not know or Voldemort or pastelary
The new designs in the capital will have to exceed, as seems to be, the clear language barriers to enhance the parts of the Prague Board and the municipal Council's renewed ODS partners.
The current period has been "examined" to the members of the new Council of SSD to verify their knowledge of the slang language that has occurred in the last few years in the Council when Praga ruled the current members of the coalition.
The encoding dictator used by Prague's political flower and birth during the previous period, the Pavel Bém alcalde, including some of the most known persons, situations and causes of metrópolis.
Surprisingly, the new concepts are almost not understood by these known concepts.
At least, that's what they say.
"What is Voldemort?"
"The truth is that I don't know."
"Make I'm a new in Prague policy," said during the terminology review of "college" the Lukáš Kauckī cultural concept.
And with regard to the political veteran, he reacted the same Karel Bśezina.
They may know the golf hoyo concept.
"It may be the only expression of all you asked me to use once."
"If no, normally in jobs slang."
From the glossary, whose definitions published the Update.cz newspaper last June before the ODS vote congress, the edition chose six examples, especially those who are particularly related to the municipal authorities of Prague.
Socialists had to explain the concepts "Voldemort", "Mass of the Golf of Prague", "Ire to the Pastelaria", "no toro", "Chair Traition" and "Blindar".
Three designs accepted the test and a fourth, Antonin Weinert, who will be responsible for the education in Prague, first accepted, but did not recovered the phone again.
The fifth conceal, Petr Dolínek, refused to do it directly.
"I don't go into these things, I don't think of how the Democratic citizens divert."
"What it is important is how we understand in the implementation of our programmes", he stated.
As has been seen, the conceptal Lukáš Kaucký had not been realized that the previous title was an expression of an influenced entrepreneur and a friend of the exalcalde Bém, Roman Janoušek.
The word "Voldemort" does not say anything to Kuckī; the only word that you have opened in the review is "the largest golf today of Prague".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kauckø, who immediately adds, "but I know better about the news."
"I'm gonna have to focus on a course of languages," brome.
Karel Bśezina is not the only one who recognizes the Blanka Tunnel in the golf today, but also the Lukáš Plachī environment design.
Then, both sociodemocrats know who is truly Voldemort and Lukáš Plachý knows where to find that person, and also suspects the meaning of "to the pastelary".
"I think I want to go to a Praga company," soon it turns out to Plachý that it is the headquarters of Janoušek.
Just as Bśezina indicates that such knowledge have obtained them from the news, but that does not use such vocabulary.
According to the test participants, there is no such family glossary between sociodemocrats.
"I asked my friends, but it really seems that we have nothing liked."
"Besides, among us we use abrasives, sometimes abreviatures or make words games with the names," says the President of SSD praguense, Petr Hulinský, whose game partners call Hulda.
"In the colleague they called me Bśíza, but I don't know if my colleagues also call me that way," admits their own support Karel Bśezina.
The Updale.cz newspaper tested the name and functioned.
For his partial partners, Weinert is Dśda (similar to "yayo") or, less friendable, Dśdek ("old"), the representative of Miroslav Poche, who was associated before the wrong elections during the party's headquarter, receives the support of "Igráček" ("playmobil") by some of its partners.
The apodes are also the only expressions that socio-democrats tolerate in the conversation within the party.
Hulinskī does not like to call you Hulda, but the Update.cz newspaper discovered even other appeals for this President prague.
"The doctor of the Laws" seems to be remembered that Petr Hulinský obtained his doctor in law in the Bratislava Police Academy.
The Government wants to restrict the torture of the "brids", as published in a brochure
Women considered brushes in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They often have a advanced age, they can not work, for example, for health reasons, only and have no children.
Women who are "volving" brushes are sent to an isolated area so that they do not harm the rest of the people.
"The men are rarely suffering so much."
"It is also left to young women healthy because they are helping in work and have children," a monja explains that, in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso, in a special residence of more than hundred women excluded from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this inusual "social medium".
He issued a information sheet that should contribute to avoid the castle of brushes.
But this has a piece.
"Besides 70% of adults in Burkina Faso do not know reading," reports The Standard on the deventure of written sensibilisation.
Urgent accusions are also common in other African countries.
In Gana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, last week Ammy Hemmah died, 72 years old, when three women and two men tortured her, cooked gasoline and burned her.
The news occurred in BBC.
The authors claim that a disgraceful cluster of circumstances was due.
According to its version, women were taken in the oil used for ritual unions.
It was taken in calls when the group wanted to "expulse the wicked spirits" of the woman.
The isolation of the "brids" supports people from all educational levels.
The Journal Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old employer in Burkina Faso: "The devorers of human souls always represented a danger", stated.
While the government is trying to cut the castle of brushes in Burkina Faso last year, the President still participated in it last year in Gambia.
"The Gambian President Jammeh, after his daughter's death, launched a wide castle of the brushes which, supposedly, had been related to his death and had tried to kill the President's own through the black magic."
"To help you to call from the nearby Guinea that, protected by police, military and the President's personal election, were brought to force men and women who were elected by the Gambian people to the ownership of the President in Kavali," states the International Administration Organization in its report.
In the end, the arrested persons had to drink a poster of herbs with alucinogene effects, which also caused intellectual and renal problems.
Two of the arrested didn't survive the stay in the end.
After international pressure, they finally released around thousands of prisoners.
Bakala's inquilino: it calms with carbon stomachs and signs a higher rental
The man, age and age, crossed the doors of the centre of attention to the client of the RPG Byty company of the "carbon snake" Zdeśek Bakala, the largest private owner of swimming pools in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm, he carried a few documents with the new three floors contracts: his own, his daughter and his son, which is fulfiling sentence.
To the three, they are just to pillar the liberalization of the households.
Instead of 3.500 Czech Corones per month, the child will pay from the next year 4.100 coronas for a two-site floor with separate kitchen from second category.
"But there is no hot water, and heat is based on a solid fuel chair," shows the man in the new contract of his son, on which the sign has full powers.
"But I firmed it," he explained the midst, mid-resigned.
The BytyOKD.cz civil association, who qualified the new conditions of acquiring as “incorrect and indecent”, recommends the inquiries that do not sign new contracts and that they are expecting until 7 December, date when a guide will publish information on how to do in these cases.
But, before that, the man just makes a damn.
"Chatever says something," he says with bad face.
Ostrava is converting into a large liberalization test laboratory.
After New Year, it will happen with the great majority of the floors that, in the Czech Republic, were up to the moment under a regulated rental.
That is why Updalian.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The mining room of RPG is one of the four of Ostrava's and, March to nine was already filled.
Just next to the doors are the security guards and its side a machine to cover number.
"Have 2011" can be read in a light button from your tactil screen.
When pulling it, go out of the machine a paper with a number.
Never gives time or read "157" and the number already appears in the large screen situated at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in the cock.
Shortly later, a advanced age marriage comes to ask, but the lot of the room is not here for the new accommodations.
Most people are going to solve normal problems such as anciently: requests for arrangements, insurance issues and similar matters.
The letters with the new acquiring contracts will be reached in Ostrava to the inquiliant buzzons of most of the 44.000 floors belonging to RPG around November average.
RPG Byty proposes in letters an increase in the loan between 15 and 38%.
On November 18, a special window is opened in the customer's care center for new accommodations.
"It's working a week, so it's starting," they answer, after short doubt, the workers who are in it when the customer is presented as a journalist.
Liberalization and old pools for Bakala's miners are the most delicate topics in the area.
Before the elections, the Vice-President of the Parliament, originary of Ostrava, Lubomír Zaoralek, from the SSD, has already been treated, and now are continuously appearing in the journals of the area.
"twenty years later, I want a new land."
"I haven't changed the bathroom of the bathroom," the man mentioned in the introduction is disappointed.
According to workers, they are at the time more than nothing joined to check whether they receive a discount in the hill if they sign at time, as they promised the special offer of GPG.
They will also receive half of the discount on the carriage of February the rest of the inquiry who sign the new contract before 15 December.
However, the window of the mine "liberalization" is uncertainly not able to divide the slaughter of doubts.
"The 360 customers who were here yesterday, so only asked for the rental in 2011 about 40 or 50 people," estimates the vent's employee.
At the same time, RPG proposes on the web and its tables to hold individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If the two parties do not reach an agreement on the loan, the question should be addressed by an independent judge.
"It is not a threat, but information about the only way to walk and completely in accordance with the law," warns RPG on its pages.
"Here he's not going to judge anybody," one of RPG Byty's employees and a man who is on the street before the customer's care center gives him at least the reason.
"I receive a pension of 13,000 and I remain 5,000 for food; I don't have any means to accommodate the courts," says.
But immediately, the employee has a doubt.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek warns them in the ways that they do not hold, so maybe people wait," says.
The regulation of the carriage will stop existing in the majority of the Czech Republic at the beginning of 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase in economic needs.
"Current rentals do not even cover the amounts required for the maintenance of the community", remembers Pavel Klimeš, director of the RPG Byty's residential cart, who adds that the uncertainty state of the Community's fund that is inquiry to the people's owners, is the main reason to increase the rental.
While in the five years between 2005 and 2010, RPG was able to invest in apartments 4 billion, in the four years that will be from 2011 to 2014, the number will increase 5.200 million.
The large screen that covers the roof, in front of the seats of the waiting room, now repeats some data that spend on red.
"The increase in accommodation in 2011 in 15 per cent and less applies to 31.200 apartments, i.e. more than 90 per cent of the properties of RPG."
"Only, it will always be as maximum 7.50 monthly chemistry coronas per square metro," is indicated in the screen.
Only increased in 38% the cartillar of 400 PPP.
"In such cases, it is an increase from extremely low quantities, of 19.66 square metro coronas," states RPG.
In 2.600 floors, the rental will remain invariable the year coming.
RPG Byty promises that liberalization will not affect housing, but will be scaled between four and eight years.
Furthermore, adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money of the loan (consults the graph) again on the floor, mainly in heat: new windows and warming.
They will have priority for persons who firm the counterparty agreement.
Architects have understood that offices also need guards
The Adriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new site of the Arch.Design company.
No one would say that she also hids in its inside a small guard with all the same to such installations: colour walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outside terrace.
Since October of the last year, they can take care of her the children of the employees of Arch.Design.
The company of Arch.Design Architechnic projects, from which many known buildings of Brno came from the first boxes of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its miniature.
In the company, about 90 people work, mainly at the age of the baby, and they wanted to allow architects and delineants to return to the work after motherhood.
With the possibility of enjoying a lower time, guard is one of the benefits offered by Arch.Designing its workers in the framework of their social programme.
Constructors and architects in this way have the possibility to combine a required profession with children's care.
The Ministry was an idea of Arch.Designu's own employees and, with the support of the direction, obtaining funding from the European Union and of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The ministerial of the company is financed through the European Social Fund in the framework of the Human and Employment Operating Programme, as well as of the State budget of the Republic of Czech.
Thanks to the granted financing (a donation of more than 2.8 million Czech Koreans) were able to buy the equipment and, two years later, contract qualified staff and services.
When finances (2 years), the company Arch.Design has the obligation to maintain the miniguarder with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project was a year, and in the presentation of the financing application, the Economy Rating company contributed.
Children’s care is in qualified personnel hands; moreover, they are present for their care a nurses and a teacher of the Ministry of Education. The guard would currently accept children without age limits, although most of them have less than three years.
Since this is a "minister", it is only possible to accommodate at the same time at a maximum of five children, although the turns grow more during the day.
The guard operation is flexible to adapt to the needs of parents and children of all workers with the same right to use the guard, independently of the jearchy within the company.
Although this is a individual education and care, the contents of the miniature programme are comparable to the pre-school education programme.
In it children play not only, but also receive a quality teaching: from basic learning to school preparation, they teach to English.
The class has not only table games and games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of small children in the company itself creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents may go to see their children at any time and avoid the stress to late the children of the college when they are far away from their workplace.
So, parents are more productive as they work.
It is not surprising that this is naturally a relationship of loyalty between the employer and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design is between companies signing that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and finally strengthened the staff marketing.
The house of the bones remains fascinating over 100 years. Watch the inside of Gaudi
The roof seems to be the luxury of a prehistorical lagart, the scalars remember the column of a dinosaury, and the balcones seem to the mouth of a open fish.
This is the Batloo House, in Barcelona, from the Catholic Architec Antoni Gaudí.
Because of their similar shape to a squelet, the locals put it "the house of the bones".
His organic forms, their calling colors, the new use of the stone, the blue and mosaic fragments, a facade that remembers the scams and all slightly curvated lines, all this is typical of the Antoni Gaudi Session.
The port of the house plays with holy lines, delicate colors and textures from nature and fauna.
More attention, a certain geometry, rhythm and a carefully thought order is observed.
Tonight, the whole house's facade seems even more impressive, since it is illuminated so that the light of the colors is improved.
Serpentea and the torture of forms continues to surprise us also in their inside.
The onduled wood copy the window frameworks, the barns, the doors' s sights, the mirrors and the letters.
The House Batlló, located in the barrier of Eixample in the 43th commercial road of Passeig of Grecia, occurred from the restoration of a house of the Emilio Sala Cortés in 1877.
The reconstruction was two years old, and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the rich industrial Josep Batlló, initially insisted on detrimenting the previous building and starting from zero, but immediately accepted the idea of Gaudi's new and more cheap reconstruction.
However, the House Batlló, formed by several apartments, did not design Antoni Gaudí alone.
He cooperated in the design Architec Josep Maria Jujol.
In fact, in its project plans, we were adorned for the representative apartment of the property duty and the mosailics used in the fachade.
In the facade, also workers other creators and artists.
Co-operation in the proposals of the Batloo House was the start of the successful cooperation of Jujol with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the Mill House and the Güell Park of Gaudí, where there are other parts of the same.
Because of their organic shape, locals shortly after their finalization led to the "the house of the bones".
Others, because of the specific opening mechanism, began to call her "the house of the bostes".
It is also said that, at the height of the building, the sword of San Jorge, the patron of Cataluña.
Other sculptric elements of the construction conceal religious reasons.
Gaudí designed in the house a single system for the central heat time with ventilation breathers and typical chimenas.
It may be strange your 40 degrees inclination.
During the construction, Gaudi did not comply with the moment's construction standards and was left to influence them.
Even so, the construction obtained the relevant permission from the beginning, although it is obvious that the data on the rebuilding planned were so vague that, two years later, the construction was so influenced by the result that requested to be corrected.
For instance, it was angry that the construction includes columns even to the public aircraft.
The arrangements have never been performed, better than the other: only 15 days after the invitation, Josep Batlló requested (and obtained) permission to accommodate the two higher floors in the building.
The own owner was installed in the lower floors.
In the second floor gallery there was the salon and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The low floor had a joy.
The house, of six floors, is completely crossed by a scatter that brings to the terrace of the roof.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all the right angles and lines, covering them from curved walls.
Gaudi also worked with the modern concept of space connection.
The common party can be connected fully by opening the doors of the chambers and a larger group can be communicated in such a way without that the necessary privacy for more intimate conversations is rejected.
The house, with the rebuilding of Gaudi, won not only a new facade, but also an inusual table and two additional floors.
It also is impressive how Gaudi plays with light, white blue and blue that covers the inside and traglues.
The game with the two colors provides the maximum light in all the places of the house.
It was simply based on the principle that the white reflects more light than the dark colors, which, on the contrary, absorpte the sun rays.
Any person can visit the Batloo House, which was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005.
At the first floor of the house is the most spacious and reloaded apartment of the public access.
The duties decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, at the time of the 150th anniversary of the famous Creator's birth.
With visits, they confirmed, or found, that it was a very useful business and extended visits to the common area and the buhardilla, including the terrace of the table.
The price of the entry to the monument is not unlikely, at EUR 16.50, although students, jubilants and tourist cards have 20 per cent of discount.
The amount exceeds significantly the price of the entry of other buildings of Gaudi in the city.
If you want to enjoy the real bed environment with your lagarto towers, you should be a friend quickly from some neighborhood resident and visit them home.
How choosing and summer is chosen: women and men are looking for different things
Nothing of a pumping frame for bed; what really trusts your quality to a good bed is the surface to smoke, i.e. the cold and the summer.
First of all, the perfection should be supplemented to adapt to specific users.
During the election, many elements are playing, including weight, height, health status and sex of the household.
It also results important the type of internal in which the collar and the summer is sit.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend chain that does not usually have warming, it should not be used latex balls because "calients" is slower.
Furthermore, it often pains significantly more than the normal polyuretane shoes.
Consequently, it is necessary to give them the most frequently.
If the center's channels are not properly aired and, above, they are on a firm base, they keep inside the humidity.
At the time of choosing a bed, they also influence the habitats.
Whoever has passed for a long time in the foreign, often uses a very high cold with a swimming floor and will have problems to feel well at a lower and harder surface.
"It was all the hockey players who returned from the NHL that they didn't sleep here as well."
"For their shadows, houses and chairs, they needed shoes with a wheel-shirt shoes."
"This type of colchones is also recommended for people with diabetes that time problems of the nervous system, so they receive bad information from articulations and skins," explains Sylva Hadamczikova, which is specialized in the swimming mobiliary.
Many hockey players, as well as other customers, take time by prefixing viscoles.
"How there is no problem, because they have these suitable Temppur and Italian Magniflexers, but also the Checa Tropico mark."
There is no longer need to be a NHL player to be able to appreciate the viscoleatic.
This "middle" works in a very simple way.
Optimize your rigideness and shape due to the absorpted heat or is adapted to its body heat.
Nothing exertes pressure; during the night, he will not give turns as after a hard game.
Simply sleeping me better.
Viscoleatics also works as a protection against rings.
By choosing the size of the ball, added to its height the length of its feet, i.e., between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be in a double room of 90 cm in total 180 cm.
In the case of individual rooms, for example, solvents, it is recommended as at least 120 to 140 cm.
To ensure that a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If no, a simple standard can be applied to calculate the width: to the upper mouth, the hands should be shocked up to the shoes," recommends engineer Helena Prokopova, expert of Cechu čalouník to decorater, who has already been taking many years on the healthy dream and mobiliary ergonomy, the theme that teaches in specialized schools.
In double rooms, each one needs its own summer and cold, so during the purchase, there is a need to provide attention to combine the height of the colds.
In other cases, the summers will be mounted to different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
The smuggles should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the mollular models with a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters are for the board that is adapted to the forms and swimmingness.
"When touching it with the hand or rejoice in the ball, they should not be observed the muelles," warns Helena Prokopova.
Each hole requires a type of sum.
The fully busy bedrooms, in which the cold and the base are like smiles, have no sense in the bedroom.
The colchones breathe badly and can't lay their foundation, which is often done today.
And as each night we trapped between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sudor, it is clear that after some five or seven years, the colcon will begin to remember a great (and congestioned) Tamiz.
For this reason, specialists reject the sloganians who speak about a lifetime of up to 25 years or even of a guarantee of life.
However, everything has a but.
Thus, the sellers give a advice: in the colcons with a width of 120 or 140 cm, carefully approve the cleanness and the lavage of the foundation, but better add a cotton protector that can be removed and washed.
Although they are currently manufactured with clothing clothes in all their perimeters, so when they are opened are in two parts (which is very important for washing and lavader size!), their manipulation in larger size models (and by one person) when the collar is upset, it can seem to be a struck between a mosque weight and a weight weight.
Instead of a summer in bed, do you have a strong table?
No!
How much for the beds thought to pass the visits one night.
However, you must do (if you don't have them already) ventilation orphans in the table and should be used with a muscle with skin inside and a minimum of 15 cm height with skins (such as the German Taschenfedern) and a skin.
Polyuretan balls should not be used on such bases.
For non-artific lame summers and containing between 14 and 18 laminas, the latex or sandwich colchones can be used (e.g., a combination of latex and coco fiber), although it is better to be a sume with a greater number of laminas, 28 or more, in which the lamps of the lumbling area are strengthened and can be regularly reduced.
It should not be used with a mould smell because it does not react to the reclination.
In addition to adjustment of the rigideness of the lamps, it can also be used to protect shadows.
It is a special set of lambs that allows to press or even smile the lambs so that they "rode" perfectly to the shadows during the dream.
For men who have very wide shadows, this is something very important.
They even remembered colchone manufacturers who, in the "masters", began to use a smaller area precisely around the shadows.
They also remember the women, for which they put a larger area around the chairs.
For the most demanding customers, there are remembers with cross- or table structures with the called multitruction.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the pressure is reduced.
It should also be taken into account that, although it uses the cold and suitable sums, if it uses a bad dinner (grand and "mulled"), most of the benefits will lose.
The basic standard is simple: the lunch must support the head and the skins can only reach the shadows, so that the muscles of the same ones can be relaxed.
The appropriate size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
At the side of the tumbling, the lunch must be at the same level (when it is combined with the summer with relief for shadows or the most slowest area of the cold) than the height of the shadows.
Modern colchones have something to see, as it seems, with the original fill balls.
Manufacturers continue to use, more often, natural materials or at least mixtures.
In fact, biological colchones are in moderation.
The oil-based substances, with which the polyuretain spum is produced, are filled with natural oils, such as rythme or soja.
In fact, almost all known manufacturers use soya.
"Biology, in the case of colchones, means that the center is only manufactured of natural origin materials", explains Petr Vašíček from the Tropico Plus company.
Similarly, natural substances are used during the manufacturing of the base of the colchone, one of the first true aloe.
But it can also be opted by the microcaps, which free a fresh wood or lavanda aroma.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men are "refreshing" with vegetables of grain, so that the foundation of the collar abstains the warmth and refreshes the body, women prefer "calencing" the foundation.
The red painting extract improves blood movement, so that women feel warm.
Do you currently enjoy the favorites?
The cold colds, which are more porous, with a adapted cell structure, which makes it more permitable than normal polyuretanics and offer more permeability.
The combination of strike strikes of cold and viscoletic strikes allows to manufacture colchones of various areas that are perfectly knowing where the head goes, the shadows and the houses.
A good-quality ball will cost you from seven thousand coronas to the top.
Those who play a therapeutic role often have a lower IVA, as they are considered as health media.
The first benefit I obtained in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It is complicated to smell in smells and soms.
Sometimes the offers of manufacturers or sales may be approved, which offers two colchones for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze colchones with a spum with memory adhered to the foundation of 11.990 coronas.
The second is available free.
The era of the viscolease with a open cell structure and a great density began with the "cosmic" material of Temppur.
At first, the NASA's material appeared, because during the slaughter of astronaut loals were subjected to a huge overload.
Temperpur is opened with heat and endure with cold.
Therefore, the human body, calied, exercises a perfect effect and is optimumly adapted to its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to avoid producing legs, although also to improve comfort during the dream.
The viscoel acid is used not only in colchones, but also for health products, for example for dinners that are placed under the feet and alliable, as well as their circulation.
National manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver and similar spumbs.
More parents use people's monitoring devices to control their children
The fear of children brings more people to think about controlling them by GPS.
The system, originally thought for the follow-up of vehicles, can also follow the movement of people and contribute, for example, in the case of the disappearing of the nine-year-old Anička Janatkov.
At the time the device has the closed size of a cell box, but will soon be reduced to the size of a watch.
Many people feared the case of the disappeared Annička and began to inform about the ways available to better protect their children.
Even the coast to invade his privacy.
"We all try to say that it's not to shoot, but another means to reduce the possibilities that a tragedy is produced", considers Petr Pilin from the Macro Weil company, one of the follow-up device providers in the Checa market.
"I recognize that, in some cases, such devices can be abused, for example, if they are put into the stove of someone without their knowledge, but we have not yet counted with such cases."
"The majority of customers really buy it for security reasons," adds Pilin.
In their opinion, children should always know what to serve the "cachate" and how they are used in the case of emergency.
The child psychologist Dana Bočková warns the fact that, if the child doesn't want to bring it, he'll just take it away.
"In addition, smaller children show great creativeness in time to lose intentionally certain things if they want to avoid controlling them."
"Before, parents were greatly trusted in the mobiles, but these could be removed as easier as the follow-up device," says Boşková.
In its opinion, it is discussed if, in case of attack, such a device is really useful.
"If this is a prepared sequence, the author shall practically always check whether the child brings some type of electronic device that can deploy its location."
"There is the phone."
"Indeed, the use of monitoring devices will be extended, and it will also search for them, since its sale will be made with a lot of advertising."
"In such cases, the crimers always go to a step before the police," says the psychologist.
However, it adds that such devices can help in the case of an unprospected attack of a pedofil.
According to the RC Monitoring company Robert śech, which provides monitoring services for vehicles and persons, even if, after an attack, the monitoring device is immediately destroyed, its presence can serve help.
"The device can be set to send the position regularly after a certain period."
"If it suffers, at least it will facilitate the last position of the person concerned."
"The most precious devices are integrated inclination meditor, so if the person is just rescue and remains inmobile, the device will immediately issue an advertising with the in question", says śech.
In its opinion, this type's service can even be obtained with intellecting mobile phones with navigation, where only a special software must be installed.
The problem of the current monitoring units is that at the time it is devices with a similar size to a cell box or low-scale mobile phones.
So they can be lost.
According to Macro Weil Pilin, this is why tests are currently performed with devices that appear a digital clock.
"But there will be the advantage added that a possible aggressor may not identify the device."
"On that identifies it after a certain time, which can make the police gets time," adds.
While monitoring devices are driving in the munch or rolling, they will continue to use the same technology that is used for the monitoring of vehicles.
This is the verification of the position with a GPS system (which is used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough mechanics as to run all the Czechy. But just two years.
The Czech army bought 445 miles [445 km] to take explosives.
Last year, the Defence Minister added to his kitchen of 224 miles [224 km].
Therefore, there are 225 years of existence.
The problem is that the useful life of the table is of two years, four to the sum.
The army purchased the table for explosives to the STV Group, by 40 million coronas.
The general staff responded to MF DNES by justifying the purchase of a so large amount of measuring, saying that soldiers needed for measuring manuscripts for 60 miles per year.
According to the calculations of the army pyrotechnics, with which MF DNES was contacted, it is, however, decided that, in that case, these manipulations should also be carried out with frequent use of explosives each year as well as all general, senior officials, and even secretariat and cleaners.
They did not want exemptions, nor the Minister of Defense Alexandr Vondr and the army captain Vlastimil Picek.
Only so could it be justified that the army goes sixty miles away.
This length is equal to 25,000 explosions.
Even so, the army would have enough existence for more than ten years.
In the contrary, as the experts say, for the initial training of each new professional is reached with a maximum of two meters of measuring, the army would have the new purchase (including the consumption of engineers or special) sufficient existence for the 225 previously indicated.
Soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade were personally sentenced before Minister Vondra because they say that they only have a munition for various weapons, so they are limited to the shooting practices for money.
And we don't talk about the lack of internal clothes.
"I'm not able to understand that these quantities of mechanics are repeated."
"But it's your decision, and they will certainly know why they do so."
"For us, the army is a good customer to which, as a company, we try to satisfy", admits the STV Group's commercial director Jan Dåckī.
The port of the Defense Minister Jan Pejšek defends the hundreds of miles of tables, also say that there will be existences of this "munition" as a minimum for ten years.
However, Jan Dåckī of STV Group indicates that the table has just a useful life of four years and, in the case of the pirotechnical products for the army or police, two years.
"If it is stored in perfect conditions, it may last up to four," said one of the soldiers who, for the possible critics of the army, do not want to give their name.
After the end of their useful life, each munition must be carefully checked to see if it is still reliable and will not harm soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument of the Ministry is that, when purchasing 445 miles of mecha, I got a discount.
"We costed 60% less than the request of the last year of 244 km," indicates the Pejšek port of the Ministry of Defence.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of the police pirotechnics, which eliminate the ammunition of the Second World War or left by the Soviet army, has not been exceeded from 1,500 meters for years.
Furthermore, the police always requests the fair amount as to explode the munition before its useful life is completed.
They decided it for security for pirotechnics and, moreover, so much more modern and reliable table types can be obtained.
The Ministry already has clear difficulties to end decades of thousands of munition tonnes of the time of the Varsovia Pact, when the Czech army of twenty thousands of people were prepared for a campaign in the Rin.
According to the pyrotechnics with whom MF DNES spoke, after a couple of years the following problem will be produced with the current: there will be a need to remove hundreds of miles of old measuring, which is now buying "barata".
Even now, I still live from the contacts I got thanks to the competition
The fact of winning the "Company of the year" competition helped Lukáš Pytloun in the sale of the Frenchs of his hotel.
The last edition won the 28-year-old Employer Lukáš Pytloun of Liberec.
Your success history seems to be out of a film.
Lukáš Pytloun liked to travel.
In the foreign area, it was realized that Liberec had lacked quality accommodation to good price.
With the horses that he met with stational works in the foreign and a bank credit purchased a house that was a mid-five floors composed.
As I was still studying her third year at the university, it was really courageous.
"Actually, the quality and price relationship of the accommodation in our area has encouraged me to do something in this regard," says Lukáš Pytloun.
He began to accommodate the first rebuilding floor to foreign workers.
All income that was obtained again in the building, which gradually became a pension of 54 rooms.
Since then, in seven years in the business, there were four pensions in Liberec, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of around 300 in all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the design hotel of four stars Pitloun.
However, this year opened another of the same quality.
"We've just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tè, which we sold our concept of franchise, and others are interesting in a Pytloun Francis," said the entrepreneur number of the last year.
"In this sale of licenses for the opening of hotels, the fact of winning the 'Company of Annual' competition", added Pitloun.
The victory increased its famous and popularity in Liberec as well as in the area.
"The people acknowledged me on the street, still blessed me often and, I should say, that it was very pleasant," remembers.
Nevertheless, it recommends everybody who wants to try any company that participates in the competition.
But it believes that it is not necessary to win, but that the participation is already profitable.
Declares that, until the time, it continues to live from the contacts and known that, without the competition, it may not have been obtained.
" With some people I knew thanks to the competition, I began to cooperate normally."
The name associated with success, in its opinion, also included in employees,
in total around seventy.
"I have seen that they show a greater loyalty and they are proud of participating in something I obtained the general recognition."
"It's not, not much less, my personal success, but that's the result of the hard work of the whole team."
"Only that is my name that appears in the first place," says today modestly Lukáš Pytloun.
My successor wants you a year more quiet than we had in Farmet
The Euforia for the Victory was soon dismissed by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, it is possible that Farmet has already been worse.
Farmet's company's duty, Karel śarskī, received the first prize in the last edition of the Vodafone Concourse "Unit of the Year", last year in the "Slave Casha" of Praga.
The jury valued his efforts, with which it made it possible to convert a small technical talent to Skalice into a sign with a volume of hundreds of millions of business.
"I can say that the premium has not only encouraged me, but to all my collaborators and improved our trust in fighting competition," says the winner of the last year.
The history of the company Farmet begins with the desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the State proposed the father of Karel śarskī the acquiring of a small talenter as compensation by the ownership embargo during the community, he was not too doubtful; he refused to his position in the company where he worked and, with a couple of partners, found the company with his father of plastic piles.
Shortly later, they began to specialize in vegetable oil prints.
Eight years later, they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in the centre of Europe.
There was also a greater presence between non-specialized public after the success in the competition in media.
"Don't only our customers have started to consider the Farmet mark as a significant better, but also foreign partners began to evaluate cooperation with a company that had a greater success in their country," says Karel śarskī.
Last year, maybe it was not only a sample of the Euforia of Victory.
It also acknowledged the commercial results until 2008 and, partly, of 2009.
And just 2009 was the hardest year for machinery sale.
The deterioration of the crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, caused companies to defeat their investment projects and began to limit the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"We, obviously, are not free of such a situation."
"Income reduced in a 40%, we had to limit the production and even had some disappointed", explains Karel śarskī.
A viable undertaking must, in the case, include little popular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and maintained the profits of the company, although it was at lower levels than before the crisis.
Despite all, where Farmet did not cover expenditures, it was in research and development.
"We have built a research and training centre, strengthening the presence in the international market and gained great national feasts,” says Šarskī.
Everything indicates that they have already left the crisis behind.
Income returns and, with them, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement is expected to support a feeling of victory, but in a quietest atmosphere," says Karel śarskī.
A survey that develops rigid standards
The annual Absurdez survey is part of the fourth business tour.
It has already been possible to eliminate some rigid standards.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdez survey of the year was the obligation to carry out documents to which officials can access online.
The decision adopted it more than a third of the almost four thousand voters.
For example, the administration of social security requested an extract of the commercial register, although its officials could obtain it with two mouse movements.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The checa Administration of Social Security will no longer ask for an extract of the commercial register when it performs a control of the taxes of the safeguard", stated Jana Buraśova's portal.
The objective of the Absurdez survey of the year is to consult the rules and regulations to respect the companies and entrepreneurs in Czech and to try to eliminate the absurd ones.
This year forms fourth part of the business tour of Hospodaá publishing noviny and begins to create an affair between the general public.
While the edition of the last year conveyed with the participation of three thousand voters, this year almost reached the four thousand.
And it is not surprising, since we still have various legal obligations of sovereignty that should be respected simply to trade.
"He wants to make a number of roles necessary for the declaration of taxes in the first world," says Karel Havlíček from the Association of Small and Mediterranean Employees and the Czech Republic.
Since years ago, simplification of business standards is a declared goal of all governments.
However, in comparison with the rest of the world, the situation of improvement is particularly in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions to have an undertaking, Czechia is located in position 74a, i.e. eight worse places than the last year.
An Absurdez complaint was held for the first time in 2006 and each year was repeated.
Everyone can indicate any administrative or bureaucratic absurdness each year between April and September final, when the complaint is closed.
The proposals can be performed on the www.firmaroku.cz. Then the complainant organization chooses seven candidates for the "anti-premium" and allows the public to vote on the Internet via www.firmaroku.cz/absurded and www.ihned.cz.
Get the absurdness that you receive more voting.
For the survey of this year more than 100 were presented, in particular 105 rules and regulations that have no sense.
The examples sent them both entrepreneurs and professional and journalist associations.
For example, between the "finishedists" of the committee was the requirement of vehicles for the maintenance of roads and autopistas pay the piece or that the employees with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms are divided every two years on the walls.
The list of the seventy proposals for this year is published on the request pages.
The advertisement of the concours, which is always held at the start of November at the Wenceslao de Praga Beach, is part of a event in which often participates in political and social personalities in the world.
In this year, for example, they attended this act of the complainant Eva Svobodova, Director of the Association of Small and Employees of the Republic of Checa, or Petr Kuśel, President of the Comercial Chamber of the Republic.
"The economic prosperity cannot be maintained if the State keeps it continuously to employees, so my goal is to eliminate a minimum of thirty paragraphs currently unnecessaryly trade", announced the Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kokurek.
The efforts to eliminate absurded regulations are not in the water of burns.
In 2007, what was worried more to people was the obligation of the employee to communicate with a preceding of three days to the business office of the permanent operation area, the intention of accommodating a vacation or exhibition.
This obligation was eliminated in the new industrial law.
The obligation that was concluded in the second place in the number of votes in 2007, i.e. the communication to the work office by foreign workers from work travelers up to 30 days, was eliminated in the law of the green card.
And the third is the winner.
Absurdez of 2009 was the regulation for the physioterapeutas to have a large spectacle, a necklace and two soil bags in their consultation.
Therefore, this year, the Ministry of Health issued a communication, saying that he had removed the obligation to have a feed.
A new category recognises socially responsible enterprises
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sportive projects are evaluated.
The newness in this fifth edition of Hospodaahské noviny is the category called Company responsible for 2010.
The committee of this complaint is to support responsible and fair enterprises.
"In this way, we want to support the companies employed by the impact of their environmental activity and socially responsible activities", says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of the mobile operator of the Vodafone company, organizer and patrocinator of the complaint, as in the case of the Rebellion of the year.
For this new special subcategory of the edition of this year of the main counterparty of Vodafone Company 2010 were presented undertakings for which trade success is not the only long-term goal.
The history of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities would fully vary between one and another, the common designator is the support and consideration they offer.
In a case, for example, persons with disabilities, in other personal or health problems of employees.
Among the 14 finalists of the whole Republic, for example, the Et Netera software company, which supports the training of informal sports equipment among its employees, which then participate in various sports tours.
Another example of company in the Pardubice area is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has already been the main fund provider for disabled children.
In Podæbrad, there is a role that is particularly concerned about health problems of its workers, because they represent more than 70% of the plant, and therefore received the company title of the central Czech area and the Vodafone Employee Concourse of the year ended in third place in the region.
In Olomouc wins the MiRyz Soft accountability company, which reduced the worktime, even under the average of 35 hours of week, without reducing wages.
The title was also granted because it was priority to purchase checa manufacturers, supports Community activities in the area and respects the environment.
"We strive to recycte the maximum possible for our production and administration activities to produce the lower impact on the environment", explains Miluše Ryznarova.
The IT Enlogit company in the Usti region also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each portal, offered them a ergonomic sella and keys; and supports work from home and business events uses the catering services of a local protected company.
"But we support the Beca Person in approximation, which helps specifically the local Roman community," comments the representative of the company Ondśej Searchø.
The Pranii Lavanderia company is also a good place in the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive a special way that impacts their pension funds.
"We give benefits in food, transport, improves qualities and sweet", says Josef Strapač, from the construction company of Bruntal Czasch, winner in the Moravia-Silesia region.
It was automatically designed to all regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the year that responded to the questions of the registration form and sent it to the organizations before 15 August.
The organizations removed the forms that were not complete or wrong.
"If the representatives of competitive enterprises did not answer the questions, they couldn't participate in the company complaint of the year, but were not disqualificated by the "principal" vodafone of the year."
"The individual candidates for this computation are not allowed, since this is a subcategory of the main company competition of the year," Karel Goldman explains the adviser Bison & Rose.
The police held arrests during a public substance in the building of the Agricultural Fund, Pilsen
The police against corruption held several arrests in the building of the Agricultural Fund in the last days.
Detectives married a local entrepreneur in the media sector and the Luboš G.
It seems that this intention is to handle a current public substance for the refund of the rights so that the underlying land had received it a specific interested person.
I had to pay you to Luboš G. half a million coronas.
"To the moment I can only say that the police is looking for a person who is born during a public subscription and offering", said Plavo, the chief of the general fiscal of Pilsen Antonie Zelená, adding that for the time it is not possible to disclose more details about the current investigation.
After twenty-four hours, the police left the 46-year-old employee.
On the way you could influence the public substance, given the few official information, so it can only be speculated.
The portfolio of the Lubomirah Agricultural Fund answered the questions of Pravo, saying that the police really carried out the arrest at Pilsen's headquarters and was during a public substance.
"It's a customer, not one of our workers," said.
According to Šerná, the public substance is called "Convocatory for the presentation of land transfer proposals in accordance with the land law" and is being carried out when several interested parties have appeared in relation to the offered field.
"They, during the convocation, offer a higher value than their refund, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced."
"In the basis of the offers, the order of buyers is determined and then the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person offering the largest offer" explained the port of the Fund.
Luboš G. had information on whom he was going to be submitted to the convocatory and, as it is at once interested because he acquired several refund rights, proposed interested in the field that would not participate in the substance.
Please, it was covering a committee.
This would explain that at the time of the arrest there was so much money above.
Luboš G. had special contacts in the Pilsen Fund for a long time.
He expressed the cause of the former head of PF Václav Sankot, who was accused of discharging the substitution of lands for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Luboš G. has just been obtained from the Fund for the construction of public infrastructure, especially where a large route should be built to the industrial area of Borskaá pool.
Then he changed them in a very useful way with the magistrate by a house in the historic center of the city with a very higher value.
In this case, the loan had to be intervened because, on the other hand, the blocked lands would avoid construction.
Familys should pay additional costs of hundreds of colonies per month
Homes should be paid from January not only for all types of energy, but also by water and electricity, complemented by heat and, in some cases, higher accommodation.
Therefore, the families will have to get out of the card, from January to January, several hundreds of coronas per month more than now.
The electricity price increases in 4.6%, the gas around 2%, some cities must pay up to 10% for water supply and many also increase the price of central heat.
The upset of electricity for families living in apartments should be at about 100 coronas more than now.
However, the main electricity providers reduced prices because it has increased support for the production of renewable sources, in particular photovoltaic.
However, the gas is moderate, especially at the time when heat is most useful, and there is therefore greater consumption.
In this case, it should also be counted with a couple of hundreds of coronas more than the year.
While electricity and gas are covered throughout the country, the price change of central heating would take place to another place.
The upset of prices plans it primarily to the largest municipality.
For example, the households of Pardubice or Hradec Kralové will pay from January to January for the central heating over 50 coronas more than a month, while the Liberec family will pay more than 1,000 additional coronas per year.
Residents in Prague should also support an increase in 9% of the water price and heat, especially if the city increases the infrastructure rental.
If the rental wouldn't go, the praguins will pay an additional 6.8%.
The prices in Prague, however, will continue to be among the lowest of the country.
In the northern Bohemia, where the current prices are among the highest, both rates will be 7.4%.
They can significantly increase the prices of the accommodation of 450,000 pools in Praga, where the regulation will end in January.
For example, the CPI Byty company, which is in Ustí Nad Labem around 2.500 floors, will increase the rental from January to 100%.
The company shall bring the courts to whom they are not in accordance with the new accommodation.
The regulated households, which benefit from residents of around 300,000 floors, could increase the year that comes to 10 per cent.
Check youths join with Fernet and ron. The beer is no longer in the way, because it makes slow effect.
Fernet, ron, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen to their parents.
These are the drinks that lead to youth drinking health care with a age less than 15 years of age.
Childs who ended in the hospital continuously to overcome rescue are no longer an exception.
This results from the experience of doctors with such cases in hospital pediatry admissions.
"Beating the wine is no longer in mode, because they're too late in throwing them."
"There are the strong alcohol drinks now," states the Chief of the Hośovice hospital in the centre of Bohemia, Ludśk Pelikán.
"When you can get a bottle to your father of the alacena, it may be whisky, but it usually is Fernet and Vodka."
"The vodka has the advantage of healing with sweet and not smiling so much," explains.
It is also confirmed by the Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinova.
" Normally, you're usually treating Fernet or ron."
"These are modern alcohol drinks, especially among schoolers."
"In some cases, they use awaitance that they covered at home," added Jurinova.
According to the Chief Pelikán, they are 30-year-old drinkers who are often appearing in hospitals.
Before Hośovice, where she worked since this year, he worked for a decade in the carriage in Motol, where ambulances brought young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to get in four times."
"He took up to the twelve years when they brought it with 3.5 of blood alcohol, in addition to a mixture with ecstasis", states the doctor of the Department on this case.
"He was found at the Holešovice Festival at some dance party."
"It's interesting, that his mother didn't surprise him that his daughter was gone 48 hours," the chief surprised.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents, or even their clear tolerance towards drink by their children, which is considered the main cause of increased alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, it is not possible to speak self-dependence.
"It is understood by alcohol to a person who has a chronic dependence of alcohol for several years, with all phenomena associated with it, which is not produced in children."
"In those drinking alcohol repeatedly, but it must be a systematically failed social or family environment", explains the Chief Pelikán.
According to the Jurinova port, this year in Motol’s pediatric clinic were hospitalized up to midnight of November for fourty ebrious children.
However, statistics are only shown to those who have a serious intoxication and should remain in the hospital.
Youth drinkers who, after the ambulant medical recognition, go home with parents or with the police, do not account.
In addition to the cases where children are simply gathering after the school and drinking, for Pelikán there are three statistical highlights that should be mentioned: the birthday, Fine of Year and the end of the school course.
"In such circumstances, drink for bad notes or, on the other hand, celebrate the start of holidays."
"In the day of the breast I came to see in admissions until seven children ebriated at once," added Pelikán.
Beverages that pass the night in disintoxication under the supervision of the doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that at the next day they do not suffer a terrible resacon in their homes.
Morning head pain, caused by deshidratation and lack of glucose, is avoided by injection of a soil with glucose and with nutrients that lack the body.
"They's bringing it much better, because after the smiling night, they get up well and don't hurt them."
"Onely are confused about where they are," says Pelikán, adding that patients often lose good humor at least when seeing the costs they have generated.
The shipping to ambulance and hospitalization in a room for serious patients comes to cost a decade of thousands of corones.
"I often use the cost as a way to educe them, when I say them directly to the children how much their embryo has costed and they would have to pass all the summer in a job for young people to win enough to pay this night," adds Pelikán.
The medical insurance may, in its opinion, as a returning measure, which usually returns to persons the treatment costs, does not do it in the case of children drinking.
Two L-159 aircrafts are first in aircrafts in Spain
Two L-159 flights from a total of five, for which the Czech Republic of Defence replaced the Casa C-295M aircraft, took part on Tuesday to Sevilla, where the manufacturer of the House - EADS aircraft is located.
It's the first time that a device of this guy is in the hands of someone who isn't the Czech army.
At the time they were only in the foreign area to carry out flights of practices or demonstration.
This is the biplace version L-159T1, which until now used the Czech Army and was still in the state of flight.
The three remaining aircraft are the L-159 monoplace.
These are still stayed in Aer Vodochody and the sales intermediary, the Omnipol company, has already been charged by them last week.
Jan Peješk, from the defence press department, indicates that it is not known when the physically removed planes of Vodochody will be removed.
"Monoplace aircraft L-159 was, instead, separated from the reparated aircraft long ago, without investments or additional contributions by the Ministry."
"The L-159T1 biplace changed in their current state," said Prvo Pejšek.
He added that the army was not left without biplace aircraft, since in May 2009 the army signed with Aer Vodochody a contract for a amount of 200 million coronas for the construction of four unnecessary L-159 devices.
One of the new aircrafts has already received the army in July, the other will be delivered to the end of the year.
According to Pejšek, EADS forced to add aircraft to the equipment of some aliad countries.
"The contract clearly indicates that the EADS company is the one to retire aircraft L-159 and to serve for the practices of NATO pilots."
"In this way, depends on the buyer to decide how to use them in this framework", says Pejšek.
The Hospodaá noviny newspaper published before time, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.500 million colonies were approved last year by the Government of Mirec Topolánek.
The Defence Minister did not convoke an offer for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defence address states that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159 to the foreigner.
The Czech army purchased Air 72 aircrafts, so only uses 24, so he wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of aircraft house may have judicial consequences.
The European Commission has already condemned the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice because it should choose aircrafts by carrying out an European offer and not contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three Casa flights and the last should arrive in the Prague Airport from Kbely in 14 days.
A longer index than the anular indicates a lower risk of cancer suffering
Men who have the longest index of the cancer are subject to a less risk of suffering prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Monday in a British newspaper on cancer.
They could depend on the teststerone level, the male hormone.
"Our results indicate that the relative dedo length can be a simple test of the risk of suffering prostate cancer, especially for men with a age of 60 years," indicated the co-actor of the Ros Eeles study, professor of the Institute for Cancer Research at the Warwick University.
Therefore, the dedo could help to determine what men should be subjected to a test of prostate cancer, especially if this characteristics are associated with genetic risks or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, as indicated in Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, monitoring was performed with a British homolog more than 1.500 patients with prostate cancer and simultaneously 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the indic dense of the right hand more shorter than the angle.
The same possibilities were to suffer prostate cancer as 19% of those whose dents were from the same length.
In the case of men with a larger index than anular dedo, this risk was reduced by 33%; for men under 60% the reduction reached 87%.
The relationship between the two dents concerned, determined during the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the feto is exposed in the matrix.
A lower textsterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies indicated that the teststerone affects the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czechian and former President of the Scientific Academy, Professor Václav Pačes, said that he knows the study, but that it doesn't seem to be that the relationship between the deep length and cancer can be "demonstrated fully".
Czech Republic under snow: D1 and D5 are closed
Czechia, as most of Europe, loved the juvenile quarter of snow.
The roads and shoes are mainly covered by compact snow and the swimming machines circulated all night by many areas.
During the morning, D5 was closed between the kms 89 and 93 in direction to Rozvadov because of several accidents of industrial and tourism, as well as the D1 in Brin in direction to Prague.
The news transmitted them to the operator of the Ústedniyo automotoklubu (UMK).
In the mile 91, two industrial vehicles were shocked in 93.
several tourists also ended in the kitchen.
There are also problems in the D1 car in the 185 km direction to Prague.
There they shocked two trucks.
The drivers should slowly circle after Brno in the 190 kilometer or cross Brno and be included in the 182 km in Køvalce.
There were some knifes of a few kilometers.
There has also been an accident in the D11 road, just along with Praga.
Praga is covered by a swimming floor of several centimeters and the thermometers indicate -7 or C.
For example, they are training tops in Prosek, although it is also congestioned Štrboholská.
The safeest transport is the metro.
The tranships circulate with a delay, for example, in the line between Karlovo noamsti and Námśsti Míru.
On the eighth morning, another crisis state will be produced in Prague.
The problems also affect the railers and the airport.
As a result of the nest, the Czech Rail Carriage company had to cancel seven connections for three speeds.
The problems, for example, affect the line between Praga and Kingupy or Praga and Beroun.
The travellers should check what the current situation is.
The Ruzyn airport was closed from Tuesday's nineth night to five of the morning.
Today, most of the South Moravia roads can be circulated, but with extreme precaution.
In Vyškovska are closed to the circulation three secondary roads, in Brnænska are training nest languages and in Blaenska are required chains to access certain higher access to higher points.
One of the most affected places was Vyškovsko.
Eventually, the connections are closed: Rusinov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
The fressors will be required to rip them out.
At the time you can't say when the movement will be opened.
In Hodoninska, there is a career required in the Belé Karpaty area (white Carpates).
The routes in the region which, as regards a protected natural area, must simply be left in inerte state, are cumulated up to five cloud clouds, as indicated in the CRR.
In Czechy, between two and ten centimeters of snow, more than north of Bohemia, where the neighborhood reaches 18 cm.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, there were about 15 centimeters of snow.
Nevadas gradually return to Checa.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapons"
American army is employed in Afghanistan a new "intelligent" weapons, known only by the name XM-25.
The generals expect that the new rifle affects the local conflict with the Taliban and that "changing the progress of the game" makes their victory.
The new weapons are like a small weapon and with a extremely precise point.
Your guns are fired with a laser with a precision of several meters.
The special 25 mm calibre munition created for this rifle and the high load of explosives that contain makes it actually function as a small granate.
Projects can be programmed to exploit not only when they attack the target, but at any point in their balistic trayectory.
They can be used against enemies who are hidden after a barrier, a wall or a tricky.
Uncertainly, you can not use a normal protection and, when launching your rain of metalic shoes, it can be essential in the battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of XM-25, the new gun is the first weapon for childhood that uses a "intelligent" technology.
"The soldiers handle it in such a way they find the goal, point their laser ray, which determines the distance, then obtains a precise miracle and, on the same basis, corrects the projection line and cuts the gatelet."
"We say that 503 meters have been measured."
"When the chat is pulled, the weapon is loaded and launched the project to a distance of 543 metres, less than one, two or three meters," says Audette.
400 jobs are transferred
The Fujitsu consortium transferred his succursale to Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of the next year, 400 employees will change their workplace from their previous office building in the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg at Astro Park.
The Japanese consortium Fujitsu translated his succursal in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As he informed the giants of the computerized sector and its maintenance on Monday, 400 men and women will be transferred in July of the next year of his previous office building in Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a great team of offices on the Lyoner Street Street in the Niederrad barrier, Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu port explained that at the average of 100 other employees more than the consorcio, which were previously designed by the region, will be located there.
The offer is very attractive, and the collective office in Astro Park will benefit the way to work employees.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only inquiry in Bad Homburg.
The director Bernd Wagner stated: "In Franfkurt-Nioderrad we found a central placement with a excellent infrastructure."
The brilliant connection with the airport is very important today for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new changing of a significant company in the region led to joy between those who were favorable and deceptive among those who were opposed.
Markus Frank (CDU) head of Economic Section in Frankfurt stated that there has been a Global Player.
This is a "magnical recognition of the placement".
Fujitsu is located in the city, the residence is a great impulse for the Niederrad.
The Chamber of Bod Hombruger, Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regrets the decision of Fujitsu.
The address was informed before the city about its intention.
"We offered to the company our help," Korwisi stated.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the ownership of Marienbader Platz could not change the difficulties.
At the end and end, the economic reasons caused the fall.
Thus, there is now a large empty place that covers the famous place.
"I hope the owner and the owner of the building will show cooperation."
The immobile used previously by Fujitsu in the Rathausplatz and the neighborhood "Verticale Kile" were part of the sovereign buildings of Marienbader Platz for ten years of a convergent project on the balneary city.
As a joint project of the city and a private company of projects between station and homelands, it is a new entry to the city, which is responsible for the criticism of the massive construction that previously used shoes as packaging places and the building levels.
In 2001 the Investment and Rating companies, the software manufacturer for reservations systems, Start Amadeus, and then joined Siemens with the Fujitsu computer manufacturer house.
In 2006, the building employed by Fujitsu was acquired by the real estate group of Frankfurt, German Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later returned to Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu Consortium, the orthodox of Tokyo, is recognised as the third largest world provider of TI.
It provides companies, such as computers and servers, and provides specific services.
The sucursal in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, in all ways Fujitsu accounts with more business in Munich.
Field Fujitsu Technology Solutions is installed from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following branches in this place will be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
This is why 7.000 square meters have been hired in the Astro Park office building.
The old complex of the twenty-five years, its name aludes its plan with a star form, between others to the central electronic association and the electronic industry.
Amazon cancels the server - Amenazas against Assange
The anxiety is increasingly supported by Wikileaks.
The Amazon Internet Service provider has removed the opening platform from your server.
Probably behind the political pressure is found after hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, seems to be arrested in England.
Wikileaks’ revelations platform is always the whiteness of the critics, always stronger in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are currently looking for an Internet patriarch in Europe.
The famous American Senator, Joe любrman, calls other countries and companies to Wikileaks' boicot.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, which is located in the list of people searched for Interpol, must remain detained in Britain, according to a article.
"Whileaks released from Amazon's server."
"Speak freely in the country of freedom," reported the public actors of the revelations through Twitter message service on Thursday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company Amazon had removed the Wikileaks documents from your server.
Internet activists had been in the publication of secret diplomatic documents to Amazon Services website so that they could face high document access digits.
By Twitter, Wikileaks explained: "Perfect, we will allow our dollars to contract people in Europe."
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, "that should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped the use of his server through Wikileaks, after a Senator Joe loverman's employee had requested investigations, he informed the CNN chain according to a call to the loverman office.
The presidency of the Senate for Security in the country had threatened Amazon with boicot, informed the British Guardian.
"I had wished Amazon to take these measures before the previous Wikileaks publications were classified by Wikileaks," said the Senator.
Lieberman also requested that the platform would also prohibit the use of the server in other countries.
"The illicit, monstruous and unconscious process of Wikileaks put our national security into game and threatens life in the world," stated in an independent senator's communication.
"No firm, either American or foreign, must help Wikileaks with its service to extend robbed material.
The founder of Wikileaks, Assange, which is searched for injury in Sweden, is found in the list of people searched for Interpol.
According to a article of the London newspaper “The Independent”, the Australian of 39 years is arrested in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
Internet activist has constantly qualified research in Sweden as a trauma of his enemy.
The Wikileaks porter, Christinn Hrafnsson, stated in London that there have been threats.
"I was even called on a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why I'm afraid of Assange's security, Mr. Hrafnsson stated.
Therefore, the location of the Wikileaks founder continues to be discovered.
Hrafnsson obviously reacted to the Declarations of North America.
In America, the former Republic of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, stated that the Wikileaks statements should be judged by tragic and should be executed.
In Canada, he stated an advisor of the Head of the Government Stephen Harper, clearly with irony, on the television, Assange should "slaughter" and Obama could "use a drone".
Among the White House and Assange grows a great debate.
Robert Gibbs, President of the United States Barack Obama, was qualified of "riddle and absurde" that Assange requested the department of the State Secretariat, if she was responsible for recently ordering diplomatics to participate in sponsorship tasks.
"I'm not sure why we should importate the opinion of a guy with a web page", said Gibbs.
"Our external policy and interests in this country are much stronger than your website."
The United States government must demonstrate the effectiveness of the protection of its databases in general.
Russell Travers, Adjunct Director of the National Terrorism Centre, was appointed an exceptional task, announced the White House.
Travers is responsible for developing "the important structural reforms", which are necessary to the light of Wikileaks filtering.
The White House also wants to inspection the ways, as well as to change the total information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the United States government announced that to be responsibilities of the security of departments and activistas, Wikileaks publications should be in danger.
"We've done everything possible to contact them," stated the port of the State Department Philip Crowley.
"We're ready to help protect them if it was necessary."
The university of the helied
In the "Gelato University" in Bolivia is prepared in the best times of the year.
The basic course of three days for future helders has the maximum afluence and visitors throughout the world.
Really, where is all the heat coming?
The glass and the gelatorium.
The heavy develops the creme in accordance with all the rules of the Italian art for the preparation of helmets.
The heliat spends with a spot the helmet of the displayer, extends it on the ship and sell it.
To know this, he doesn't need to go to Anzola of Emilia in the province of Bolivia.
But whoever wants to know more about helloes should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the iron university with frozen in 2003, so that the helmet creme of its machines comply with the Italian high ideals in all parts.
The basic course of three days for future helders has the maximum afluence and visitors throughout the world.
There are also more special courses for more days on chocolate helmet and practices in the helmet of your own house.
In these times of crisis, some play with a new professional career, others rise in the swimming pool their desires.
This time are 40 participants from 19 countries of all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, professor of this art in California, likes the slow food movement and in the future wants to offer an European quality product on the land of the industrial heavy.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business advisor and wants to create something own in some years within an enormous work.
Two young Egyptians play with opening a heavy in the Cairo.
A man from Malta and another in Brazil wants to improve the quality of heroes of their bars, and a love of Canadian house, Julia, comes because their children love Italian heroes.
Leader Luciano Ferrari explains the ideal quality of perfect helmet later to the participants.
It is not only decisive for his good pleasant, but also for his sisterliness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his training or birth cover of the national top house and mainly from the country: "The Italian helmet is just the best, and therefore every ball has something romantic."
The first step to preparation seems easy.
Luciano escapes the basic ingredients: milk, birth, powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large bathroom, which smells all with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and at the time he cryed up to four degrees.
Then open the machine's griff and get a pastorized white base cryma, the base for all types of milk helmets.
Unfortunately, the professor asks: Can healing cream only be designed with natural or without stalling elements?
How can some want to experience suel?
Lucian advises to get away from the trends of the time.
The one who speaks of helmet "not only of natural ingredients", at the best time has used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar-goma, cold.
Of course, it can be made heat without stabilizer, only one day you have to buy it, put it in a tass, and the customer will smell a heat of granite.
Some variations are allowed in the basic mass.
They're using aromas.
As regards the glass, Master Luciano distinguishs between the ingredients that are purchased in the fruit section or in the sweet of the supermarket.
Bye, there are powders and pastas.
"All suppliers will try to collapse ingredients aromated in their goods."
"But you have to try again."
Be already with fruit sorbetes with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or even with the white base mass ice cream, which with eggs will become a amarilla and with powder cake as a basis for all possible chocolate funerals.
Now the participants of the course can use the helidars.
Lucian let you always prepare four different types of grain helmet, chocolate, moca and avellana with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less grain aroma or other natural ingredients.
Realize the same experiment also with fruit helmet types.
It knows better not necessarily depends on having more sweet or cleaner aroma of fruits.
It is not necessary that the helmet of avatans save to seed fruit, if there are more aventures.
The working group develops the giant kiwi heavy, which uses more fruits, less water and something less stabilizer.
First of a balanced mixture, heavy swear, says Luciano.
The preparation of helmets is a problem of artimetic: the melocoton clean is used with very sugar, the proportion of sugar from the basic receipt must be decreased.
For the limon helmet there is a extra part of sugar.
Luciano takes a tool to determine the quantity of fruit sugar (measuring of the wine for Oechsle in the wine).
Happily, the tables facilitate the account.
Developing heat does not require more than physical application, as before.
It is not only helping the auto-development of the basic mass.
There is also a utility, in which simultaneously the preparated heat mixture is shocked and frozen at the temperature under zero.
Nevertheless, all automatization remains out of the small folder.
The brazilian Gustavo is missing himself and his companions from the top down with fruit clean, like if it was a gigantic minipresser without control.
"In all courses," the master Luciano says, "It's just a question of time that happens something like this."
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European Food Safety Authority has been infiltrated in the industry experienced with transgenic plants.
This issue is currently the group of experts of Testbiotech, which is considered a institution for the independent evaluation of the impact of biotechnology.
"In a conspiration theory, but we did not document it well," Christoph Then, director of Testotech, stated the Sunday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, director of the Ephsa expert group on genetically modified plants, and another expert of Efsa has also been contracted for years in the Ilsi Association.
Consorts such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer cost it.
Kuiper has significantly cooperated in the control standards of genetically modified plant plants, which is in a clear conflict of interest, criticizes Then.
The provisions of Efsa are in paragraphs with the same terms as the documentation of the Ilsi situation and imitate the company's writing, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
It is the second time that Testbiotech criticizes a collection of interests.
Thus, recently, a high-range manager of Ephsa was without support or transition time to Swiss Agriarkonzern Singenta, and has changed with that his band.
Recently, also Mediadeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) revealed personal connections between the EU inspection authorities and the industry, which conducted the Environmental Office and a clear EU Parliamentary.
However, Efsa cannot recognise any conflict of interest.
All formal data, also some of the industry, are recovered by high quality and technical quality, are ordered in a report.
The experts working in Efsa are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But you must exposure these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
It is called itself as a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and policy, among others for biotechnology assessment without the load of Lobby.
In this issue, independent experts such as Then criticize that transgenic plants are currently allowed without investigating food for animals and that the impact of genetically modified plants in the environment is not checked.
"We want to know what, for example, the maize genetically modified in the agriculture", says Then.
The current practice consists of verifying only isolated proteins, but not the entire transgenic plant, which does not offer reliable results.
"If no risks are searched, how are you going to find?", asked, accused, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck thinks the same way.
Since 1994, science investigates the field of genetic engineering and currently works in the Zurich Technical Institute.
In this area, the industry is increasingly trying to influence or defeat critical scientists in the United States and in Europe.
Therefore, there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortiums.
For enterprises, critical studies are not generally published.
"The industry controls security research", says Hilbeck.
The raster of the stones
Uli Gsell has achieved some, over 400 kilos.
Monday was in front of Stuttgart station, with Tuba on the shoes.
There were manifestations
Nevaba.
The story is known: In September, they arrived the shootings and began to throw a great throne of the northern ala.
The land of Stuttgart never again was the same: thousands and thousands of people were manifestated against the s21, the suspension of millions in the station.
As precisely, most of the ale were shocked.
Round in 6.000, 7.000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rugish stone, rising between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
A couple of strikes have been secured.
"This stones are religious."
"Don't have to disappear."
It is entusiasmed: "A chest and poor stone, simple and natural."
As he once said, he was the smoke of the cigarettes.
You still don't know what he'll do with the shoes.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell also.
The stone raster of Stuttgart leads to a forest in Tubingen in a former French army munitions deposit, where Manuel Rongen established his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man is treating old stones.
He purchased everything resulting from demonition in Stuttgart.
"I would have dishonored, wounded the grave or sent it to the bottle," says in his office, a wood box that once it was a guard box.
He was insulted and threatened, explaining, when in September the newspapers appeared, who had purchased the rest of the northern ice to the waste company.
He spoke to the enemies of 21S for several days.
And he explained them that I couldn't do anything for the bleeding.
And when it happened, it was the most reasonable, when the stones continued to use.
About 200 S21 enemy took the mass of 80 kilograms cut, with a switch price from 6,50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as remembering but also with the hope of the power of returning it to a reconstruction.
Rongen had purchased 500 tons, a 25-track load.
Nearly half is still in the forest, the rest has been sold.
Many gardens, gardens of landscapes, undertaken by projects.
They came from all parts and took what they could be brought into the sleeves and above.
The stone of Stuttgart of the impulse has long been converted into the wall or the delimitation of Kröuterbetten.
"In fact this stone is nothing special," Rongen says.
"If you don't leave by the political component."
Besides your whole earth, it takes a tour for its great kingdom of 20 hectares.
He studied right, interrupted his studies, and later biology, interested in computers and finally worked with stones.
And it's loved by stones.
Go to 4.000 tonnes of stone.
Transport your treasures throughout Germany.
He says he is the greatest treaty of ancient stones in the country.
Frena.
In the snow there are artists of picated sandistic stones.
"Their belongings to the point of Dresden Marienbrücke," explains.
Calize alba, sweet, calm, entusiasm.
"My loved stone."
The way crosss the forest.
It states a lot: Arenisca red, a previous strike of the Karlsruhe station.
And continue.
"Travery sweet."
Anciently, the mazizos belonged to the tribe of Stuttgart.
For all parts of the snow, stones and stories, awesome traverty of the police headquarters of Stuttgart, red grain of the Sankt Blasien Church, Heilbronner's hospital.
That's a job, that's a lot of efforts, that's so sweet.
When Rongen thinks of how he screwed before the stones and moved them with a simple appearance and a cart, he feels very dedicated.
"I'd be a scandale if something would be destroyed."
It has not been rich, in absolutely very rich.
But today 14 people had to do the stone treater, also canters, a sculptor, a shooter, a vetrier, and a garden have been installed above in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfied," said the man who is responsible for the rest.
He's got to go to Colonia in a little bit.
There are also stones to save.
Trust of talents around major potentials
Rejoice an active afluence in the buffet.
16 students are cut around the panecilles, the tomate soup and the sweet.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Vokswagen manufacturer of cars have invited a talent to mechanical engineering and design students.
In a species of ideas, they must talk about the car of future with VW workers and also learn everything about Volkswagen.
Recalling and in the same way, many enterprises, such as VW, are gathered in a fight against body around the most privileged minds in cooperation with universities.
Your mission: To contract students with more talents from universities, before they enter the labour market and to be contracted by others.
And since universities do not facilitate publications about their students' skills, it is tried to attract exceptional talents in practical projects and capture them.
The second project day at Braunscheig Technical University, the consortium wins talents.
A lady of the staff department departs bottles, gomits and folders with the VW logo.
It explains the illusioned young talents the practice programmes and works for students and shows their ways in the consortium.
Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig brings the project with VW.
It benefits both parties: "Learnings are in contact with the industry and purchase experience."
"To their time, VW can know students, observe more closer to interesting candidates and consider them as possible future workers."
Some collaborations, says Selle, are not very common.
The newness is in which students are so desired so directly.
"The main point was previously found in technical projects", says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates is getting worse.
In many areas, companies cannot already choose their employees between a large group of demandors.
If you don't have to advertise and, above all, to obtain a high-qualified hand.
All students of engineering disciplines are in a excellent negotiation situation.
According to the German Ingenieurs Association (VDI) there were 40,000 vacant engineers in October.
And, according to the VDI prognostics, this empty of engineers will grow even more.
In the audit and advisory company, KPMG, Roman Dykta is charged by the talent box.
It organises costly contract events, such as KPMG, a modern type of yincane, where participants must find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the U.S. next year.
Furthermore, participants may observe KPMG's branches and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go into two election rounds in the output.
Only the creation of many participants goes to the United States.
universities are increasingly experiencing in choosing and cleaning the high potential of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the cart we want to highlight the mass."
"The simple trajector for himself was short."
For the Dykta Cazatals, the notes and results.
"Today we have a similar action in the last year with all participants."
" Some are near their end, and they want to ask for work with us," says.
In addition to the direct approach in the campus, they are also at the caza, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, classical with their work holidays.
"We tried to get students at the specialized holidays."
"Introsol" says Sitha Stube, who is responsible for the Solar Technology manufacturer world.
The Bonner company has about 1.500 employees in Germany.
Stebe knows the problem of the new generation.
Currently on the company's website appears 35 vacation places.
"It's being very complicated to fill vacation."
"It's a lot of time and money," says.
A shorter way is the contact with the teachers of the university.
Solar world cooperates with several higher schools, for example, the University of Freiberg.
"Professional teachers suggest that they can do practices with us or carry out their tests.
There are no public campaigns for solar experts.
This is why the company needs to be promoted with other advantages: personal environment, swimming jearchy and comfortable communication.
"A large consortium can normally not offer it", says Stebe, the staff charge.
In searching for employment, money is no longer the most important.
Decisive factors are flexible worktimes, children's assistance or good-ascension possibilities.
According to a study of Great Place to Work Instituts, Solarworld has the place 55 among the 100 best employees in Germany.
The institution sets up a annual list of the best German job providers.
For the question of the employee, I satisfy that it is with the work and the environment in the same way and observe the pre-conditions of employees.
Stebe, the staff task also expects additional points in its classification for its aspirants to work.
"I believe that the applicant is particularly set in the external classifications of a potential employer," said.
Wolf Reiner Warler of the German Employer Branding Academy advises the companies who want a long-term strategy that gets a good name as employees.
Advise your customers the most authenticity.
And that means, according to the warler, especially internal measures.
"The best way to be attractive as a employer passes through the own employees", ensures.
In the sector's gear is called Employer Branding Internal, also promoting corporate identity within the own template.
"Another satisfied employees are the best embassy."
When it is good for people and identifies it with the company, then the employer is directly promoted by friends and friends.
"It's like a game with pandilla," says the warler.
Obama holds new oil perforation
From the coast of the United States of Florida to the Golf of Mexico, in these years no new oil perforation appeared.
The Government of Washington issued a contingency prohibition, and thus cancelled its previous plans in an unacceptable manner.
The Atlantic Coast also remains new perforations at the time.
This announced the Minister of Internal Affairs, Ken Salazar, on Thursday.
What has caused this strict ban, which will at least take the next five years, is the explosion of the "Deepwater Horizon" oil platform in April.
Before the deterioration that the life costs for 11 workers and caused the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had granted new perforements in the west of the Mexico Golf under the pressure of opposition and industry.
The parties wanted to reduce the dependence of the United States of new oil supply.
Even today, it has not been cleared about who is the responsibilities of black sea in the golf.
The British Energy Consortium BP is located in the centre of the criticism, which is faced with millions of demands.
A investigation commission undertaken by Obama will present its results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the minister of the Interior, led the perforationmoratory after the explosion.
Afterwards, different petrolean consortiums submitted requests for new attempts of perforation.
Obama and Salazar want to disappear a new disaster by using more harder controls and strict security regulations.
Currently, the responsible control authority, which has been accused of corruption charges, has fallen in decrease, is restructuring root.
It is a parallel advertising that will close lucrative tax for oil and gas consorts.
The industry announces publicly that total extraction in the golf will be less thanks to a more strict regulation, until date.
" Government plans are the largest fren for the growth of oil and gas industry," says the current analysis carried out by the Advisory company BDO before the prohibition of extraction of Monday.
American Energy Alliance claims insecurity in the sector: "Nobody knows what is exactly changed with the regulation."
Investment in new extraction projects will soon be extended in detriment of growth.
Ogoniland is ruined
The water of the rivers is oil marron, sweet as a gas line: thousands of green litres have destroyed the nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live from rob, corruption and illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari looks good.
"Don't smell you," calms the environmental activist to the journalists: "How is going to pass enough oil to your eyes."
The Nigerian of 37 years has been able to photo kids walking in the water to the skin with the light of the lights reflected in turbulences on the surface: With the colorful water light, the scene seems almost beautiful.
You don't see that on the floor they're frozen oil thresholds.
Before here, he was swinging legs, explains Esther Badom on the east of the Bodo-Jetty River.
While, fluid waters are totally dead.
Five years ago, in the formidable humidal, a impressive amount of oil was covered by a rotating tube.
The fish of the surroundings of the small town of Bodo had to pass six hours to reach full fishing water: which, in the heart of the Niger delta and located in Ogoniland, is considered as one of the most affordable regions in the world.
In the way of the river's rear that passes by eating, the extensive desolation results obviously.
Instead of a clear water, the ship engine removes a marble heat that smells its hand in the water, he will cut some full of oil.
The roots of the dinner trees are high from the ground as dark balls of regaliz, so that they are shocking and shocking their palms.
In vanour, they are looking for bands of birds, as if they were in the humidal as always: When the outside barrier is round, there is a fantastic type of calm in a previous paradise with gasoline oil.
"What happens here is a ecological struggle," says, hamper, Celestine Akpobari. "We lived in constant danger for health."
The balican comparison is going to be.
The area of the Ogoni residence is a rhythm of battle field for years: more than 60 years ago the first European operators were broken here, there was the first resistance in the 80s with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, where he had to put its first manufacture Shell consortium in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for oil employers.
Even today, enterprises are prohibited to return to Ogoniland: While they bombed more than two million black gold barriles in the whole part of the delta region, three times greater than Switzerland, with over 5,000 sources of extraction and 7.000 miles of tuberculosis, oil fields in Ogoniland were calm, the location is too instable for consortium.
Each twenty-century meters exceeded steel platforms as water sculptures: "Boats of ships" were sweetly called the heads of the perforadors.
They have up to 50 years, most of them have a total corrosion.
Each moment falls a head, thinks Akpobari, then where a constant oil chorus in the water.
According to the evaluations of experts, more than 2 million litres in 50 years in the ecosystem of the delite: Year after year, the amount of penetra oil, such as the ship "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the Alaska Sea, one of the largest echoological disasters of the history of humanity.
Whoever is responsible for the long-term environmental region will lead to it.
While the shell consortium and oil robbers are responsible for more than 90 percent of the contamination, ecologs see the heads to break and tubers with flights as the main causers.
In Nigeria, Shell applies primarily low security standards in the world, reproduced the scientific Richard Steiner to the consortium in 2008: only the tuberculosis defect indexes are "with a multiplier than in another place".
In a place, which seems to be forgotten from far, appears a full oil tanker under the free sky, appears figures of among the manners: they are sneaked and covered by oil.
Among the many barriles, which sometimes are joined with perforation, sometimes arbitrarily dispersed on the ground, fled a fire: a small illegal relief.
In the barriel, oil is calmed in the fire over hours, explains Michael, the chief of the group.
First, the gasoline is pending through the tubers in the cereal, later the beet oil tube and finally salt diesel.
Thus, Michael and four employees are produced daily to four 300 litres of diesel barriles: "We have 34,000 nairs," around $22.
Detaine habitats use the weakness of fuel in one of the largest black oil states of Africa.
Nigeria only accounts with a single resident.
With the absurd and precious price of the diesel of only 40 euros-cept per litro, illegal calentators can offer less: thus reduce the value of their primary matter.
It comes from "bunkers" which took the network of tubers that crossed Ogoniland: According to experts, at least 16 million litres of oil in the whole part of the Niger are lost.
Only an unsigned part of the preserved pre-served material is clearly refined in an illegal manner: organized criminal networks, which also belong to political and high military charges, keep the best part in aljibes and sell it in the world market.
Actor Akpobari considers fully academic the debate on whether the environmental disaster should be better in the manner of the population or the flow of production.
"If oilers do not behave as invasors and have not had completely destroyed the natural habitat of fish, there would be no sambatage, nor robs, nor illegal resins."
While the conditions of the ogons are mostly destroyed by Shell until the point appears only a deduction of consortium: "You want to be better to present another nationality, such as China."
Michael is nervous.
"I'll be time that you're gone," the muscle Olimann says.
"The soldiers can come in any minute."
If the army's special unit takes the illegal rebuilders, don't threaten them to arrest them, if not with a painful soborn.
Soldiers from the north also want, like all the Nigerians, to benefit from the first material.
"This condemned invent has made pieces completely to our country", says Akpobari.
Researchers detect dangerous manufacturing defects in A380 motors
It seems that A380 has a great security problem.
In an investigation of a machine that performed a forced atterrissage, researchers found a possible factory defect that could produce "a catastrophic failure in the engine".
Qantas airport wants to ask the engine manufacturer.
The Qantas Airbus passengers who experienced an emergency atterrissage at the beginning of November had much more luck than what can be imagined: Australian air security authorities thanks to their investigations a great security problem in the engines of some A380 and warned the possible factory defect.
The potential defect has complicated effects: In a connection of malnutrition, fixes can be caused by hamper or grieve, the ATSB authorities have announced in a juvenile report published.
This could have caused "a catastrophic failure in the motor."
This affected the motors made by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 flights of the A380 series.
Among those found the Qantas-Airbus that had to carry out a forced aircraft on November 4 in Singapore.
Australian airport starts legal media against the manufacturer of British turbines.
He sent a request in the Federal Court of Sidney that could be more legal measures against the company.
Alan Cœdès, director of Qantas, declared that his airline would claim a compensation for the incident of November principles.
In the motor brand they lost pieces and its board is deteriorated.
Rolls Royce distinguishs the type of gas as the cause of damage.
After the incident, up to 40 motors around the world have to be rested.
Australian investigators announced that they will carry out more security tests to superjumbos provided with affected motors.
The Security Recommendation is the result of a cooperation with Rolls Royce, said by Martin Dolan, ATSB's portal.
The security problem has become sufficiently important to inform all affected ones.
After the Qantas device’s emergency aircraft, the airline kept its A380 fleet on earth for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines maintained approximately three of its eight A380 temporaryly on earth.
Air has put the A380 motor as a precaution measure.
This double aircraft is the largest passenger flight in the world.
A Nevada in the whole country causes caos in trafficking
Germany totally white: From one day to another he sneaked nearly all the country.
In many streets the caos reigns, trains and aircrafts fall.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
The winter in Germany: almost all the country has reached temperatures during the Tuesday night, which has discovered the chaos in the traffic in many points.
In some parts of the north and eastern, there is a 15cm sneeper sneeper cloud.
Traffic is very limited in most autopistas and in many streets.
In the A7 at the height of Flensburg, the quitanics are continuously functioning, removeing the new snow again and again, but it is not prepared.
Furthermore, strong wind rats bars the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrograph Agency of Germany (BSH) expects live seas with the water level of 1,2 metres above its habitual level in the coast of the Baltic Sea Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Shanghai, the cumulation of snow caused considerable problems in autopsy and national roads.
According to the Meteorological Service, the red warning is called in Sachsish Sweden, actually the highest warning.
There is partly 30 centimeters of new swimming snow and cold winds and strong winds to remolinate it.
There were many trucks and cars in the night.
The police authorities also reported significant disorders in the streets in Sayania Anhalt.
In A2, snow and wind paralyzed the traffic and created uppers.
In Turkey, nests affected A4 and A9.
According to German Bahn, great disasters are expected in Sajonia, Sajania Anhalt, Turkey and the north of Baviera.
The snow on the road, the trees falling on the carriles or the destroyed chain and the legs are the main problems.
The Leipzig inter-urban service in Nuremberg is suspended in Sajonia.
In Saafeld, Turkey had a ICE train to stop his trip to Munich.
Bombers and rescue services attended the 165 passengers on the train with milk, food and drink.
Wines with snow bars the streets.
In the largest German airport, nest winds caused many flight suspensions.
According to a port of the flight information center, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a Fraport port there are 40 flights canceled.
Quittings are in continuous function.
However, few passengers vary in the airport, despite that there are 400 camping beds for them.
In many streets, Sunday night there were already many accidents.
During the late, a truck falled in a colision with a train on a road cross in Eastholstein.
The machine has suffered mildly wounds.
In the neighborhoods of Nuremberg, a similar accident occurred because of the Nevada Streets: a truck was also reached in a road cross because the vehicle was surrounded.
The driver lost his life.
In the train four passengers were blessed, Bayreuth's recruitment in Nuremberg was blocked for this morning.
He also failed a 30-year-old woman, after giving a flight with his car near Aucciburg in a resbald road.
The meteorologists have a good news: the snow will become more sweet and powder and therefore will be sweet in their snakes.
But the wind will decrease.
Only the baltic sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
Indeed, it will continue to do much cold, in some places to 15 negative degrees.
Godche Bank is looking for a buyer for its gymnastic tours
The German Bank wants to separate its symbol: According to a article, the financial institution seeks buyer for its office towers at Frankfurt's headquarters.
The ownership could provide up to 500 million euros.
Recently Germanyn Bank resolved his headquarters: the gemell tours were modernized in the Frankfurt banks barrier; while bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium wants to look out for the costs of the reunification, and look for a buyer for both rascaciels, as the Financial Times Germany says, based on a portion.
The portal does not designate the reasons for the sale in the project.
"We always verify whether the property should be owned or sell, and then return to accommodation," said.
As a result, the largest credit institution in Germany returns to the headquarters of its company after a short period of time.
The bank purchased the gemell tours in the average 2007 by 272 million euros from the investor of a house fund, and then implemented the relevant arrangements.
Energy reforms reached some digits of about 200 million euros.
A sale would like a lot of money for the bank.
The experts in this area calculate the value of the newspaper tours renamed as "Greentowers" in about 500 million euros.
Where the buildings renewed in a bank fund or an independent investor have not been discovered today, the portfolio stated.
Thousands of people of fight for failed mines
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people were thinking of the sepulled mines, which were defeated after many explosions in a mine.
There were no victims, since security measures are still precarious in the place of distress.
About two weeks ago there was an intense explosion in the Pike River mining near the city of Greymouth.
29 mines of age between 17 and 62 years were entered in the mine.
A survey was introduced in the place of disgrace, but did not find any sign of survival.
Because of the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no salvation team was able to cut down for security reasons.
After the second intense detonation, the authorities and experts declared that there was no possibility that miners had survived.
The body could not be restored until the date.
The family and friends currently remember those who have fallen with a remindering act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the solar light in Greymouth in the southern island of the neozeland.
You keep silence for two minutes.
In home of the settled miners, 29 tables were placed with shoes, lamps and mine names.
He also had personal photos and objects, under clothing and surf tables.
The flags were at the middle of the country's government buildings.
New Zealand hoped that mines return to the surface "of the depths of the land", said John Key, President of the Neozeland government, to the participants of the Memorial Act.
"But they never returned home."
He cannot take the death of his son until he saw his body, Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was sepulated in the mine.
Among the President of the Government and the families of the victims participated in the Memorial Act of many foreign diplomates.
At the first explosion on 19 November, mines were also seized from British and South African origin.
Saving workers began expanding a fire within the carboan mine in the southern island of New Zealand.
As the explosive gases have been extracted, the abrassing temperatures of the mine will begin to fall, Gary Knowles, the police higher, to journalists.
Shit, warrier!
Does the goat go in the art cine?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn returns to explore the gender borders with his warrior "Walhalla Rising".
In what public will the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have been thinking about rounding "Walhalla Rising"?
A viking warrior captured with a single eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is free of his torturers and murder to his enemy with almost superhuman battles, it is ideal for young spectators who are looking for bloody action, precisely because our heroes likes to use brutal methods to kill and launch his enemies the trips of their body with life when it is a bad humor.
On the other hand, Onejo, as it is actually called, does not say almost any word during all the film, and other characters are left to carry for as much as one or two phrases or a couple of dead crys.
On the contrary, they are shocked and enjoyed by the great and terroristic montuous landscapes of Scotia, which the pustitors offer the viking world about thousand years ago.
Better ideal for growing and interested cinemats in existingism and very quiet camera movements.
When a film has several recipient groups, it is a punishment that cannot be discarded mutually.
The director Winding Refn considers his sakes and trilogy on the "Pusher" drug trafficker as a Danish type of version of Quentin Tarantino, but it is noted to make its works for all publics with something more humor in the main course or something less brutal in the artistic house.
A brain mass and a brotan triangles can not disagree most of the followers of the art cine.
The majority of the fans of the action dies of a burning, if one takes a ship to Jerusalem with a troop of violent critical missionaries for interpretative reasons, and there is a everlasting life in peace and nest before his team comes to America and turn back there.
It's the latest that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a film distributor in Germany and is only published in DVD.
It is a disaster against the magnificent images, but also because, after the presuntuous and bloody fatal, a piece of cine sometimes is hidden, which worth a little attention.
This film does not matter dialogues or logical action, everything is atmosphere, a febril dream transformed into film.
And so there's no shooting for spectators.
Refn is just a moment of relaxation and its glass pictures and the lucrative sound band makes him a cloud in your gargant, especially the amazing hatred, which from the hearts of the persons go to him.
Only a small young voice, which supports the One faithfully, maintains something as innocence, all others are possessed by anger.
Moreover, the hero of a single eye, whose reasons are never explained, becomes at any time a warrior from the hell for the allied enemy and provisional partners, which may be the ambassador of the same devil.
It represents the loss, but maybe only for those who are lost in any way.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious movie that can be hated and admired, to be angry, changed and surprised.
A experience.
Misterious land movements
The OIEA Nuclear Energy Organization has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country refuses to view this topic until controls are allowed.
On the average night from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli fighting aircraft F-15 I attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located in the east of Eurates; the largest and nearest city, 30 km is Dair as-Saur.
His name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Organization (OIEA), which is a reactor that, when the Syrians viewed, built with aid from North Korea on the cube, hidden in a valle from the river.
According to the U.S. International Intelligence Service of the CIA at the end of April 2008, a flowing reactor is designed under the name of the very suitable nearby El-Kibar for plutonium production, with the construction of nuclear weapons.
Instead, the technique only serves for other purposes than for the 50s.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blue satellite images.
They showed an animation by computer where the reactor components were before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the Norwegian model of the Yongbyon nuclear central.
They also taught photos that showed the building from the nearby or inside.
It was a short time ago that the reactor was in operation, says, but he was not equipped with fuel bars.
Today, three years later of the bomb, it's just more known than that at that time, the enigmas were more than timely.
The previous President of the United States, George W. Bush recently discovered in his memory that before the CIA attack, was absolutely sure that the Syrians had built a reactor in the Kibar, but only saw indications that the country would exist "a nuclear weapons programme".
In Europe, several secret service agents prefer to be more careful and only talk about a "reactor", although they are considered "plausible" the presentation of the CIA.
There are no solid tests, as well as IAEA.
When it was asked to be sure that it was before a reactor, a high diplomat of the United Nations responded in summer in a lapid way that the IAEA had "extensive material to have questions".
The Syrians were very rapidly dismissed from the shoes of the presunte "unused military building" and shooted the land to conscience.
However, in June 2008, an OIEA team under the command of the previous inspector Olli Heinonen found uranium races in the Kibar, which had been produced by people.
Furthermore, the IAEA obtained satellite images on a Member State, commercial sellers at the right time after the attack, which should have a higher information value than the CIA.
However, these photos did not arrive in the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, purchased them in an exclusive manner.
The IAEA cannot therefore verify its authenticity independence.
Syria always understood that he had never had a secret nuclear programme or built any reactor.
The uranium came from Israeli weapons, explained Damaskus.
OIEA rejected it as inverosimil after analysis of particulates.
Since then Damaskus refuses to discuss on this matter, as regards satellite images.
In addition, controllers were prohibited a second inspection in the El-Kibar and the entry into the bombed building.
Israel also keeps a strict silence.
"We will never comment it," Ehud Olmert, first minister in function at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not produced results since June 2008 and "is progressively transformed into a serious problem of credibility for authorities", as a Western high-ranging diplomat corresponds to a place in the IAEA in Vienna, which finally suffers a serious violation against the non-proliferation of atomic weapons.
The IAEA considers three more teams as the key for progress in the clarification, which should be "in functional connection" with the presumed reactor, and others like these are still existing.
Inspectors have not given public knowledge until the time they treat, nor what functions they have or if they seem to be suspected.
According to the Southdeutschen Zeitung, the IAEA has appointed Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayaah, again derived from the nearby cities.
Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these places and found a complex of buildings near Masyaf with satellite images, which is probably one of the suspected objects.
It may be located in or immediately at the side of a military base, Syria for this reason prohibits the entry into the three places of the IAEA.
In Vienna, Syrians fear a record that the United States requested the IAEA to shoot military plants.
Nuclear detectors were warning about the teams thanks to the warnings of the United States secret service.
By satellite photos, the IAEA has indications that material is transferred between the three places and the cube to the east of the Eurorates.
A Western diplomat with high charge in Vienna stated that at least one of the teams may be "related to the fuel production".
But there is no "no indication of sensitive activities", nor uranium enrichment or reconditioning; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is rounded with uranium that is not enriched.
From where the uranium should come and where the plutonium should be later separated for bombs, for these central questions are, in the best cases, pleasing suggestions.
There are no doubts about whether the ruinings, the valuable strokes that can be restored, are found in the three places.
As they disappeared the hundreds of loads of the ground trucks, nobody has information about where the shoes remain.
The OIAE considers unlikely the mining of sal al-Tibni, situated in the few kilometers from El-Kibar to the other part of the Eurorates, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 as an area for radioactive residues.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the previous IAEA Inspector, reported with the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, photos from the orbit show that Syrians made land movements in the three suspected places and removed large containers after the OIEA requested the entry.
It may be occasional but only helps to divide the suspect.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector, the IAEA has used a few months to develop an inspection plan there, which Syrians would allow, to maintain the possible military secret, only the deployment shows the size of the interest of the inspectors.
However, Damaskus also criticizes this proposal.
Western diplomates in Vienna have been calmed for a year ago that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter has not been so urgent, since a couple of months ago, Glyn Davies, a type of ambassador from the United States, strictly called exceptional inspections, one of the most strict means that nuclear authorities have come to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the IAEA, who should propose these inspections, has spoken of "a option to which I am open in the future," but still empty.
This is very strict: For this reason, most of the IAEA Governing Council are needed, and some of the 35 representative countries there are not precisely emphasis on a scale.
On the other hand, how a diplomat reflected, "and what is happening if you don't find anything at the end?"
Love in War’s times
There are problems since Angelina Jolie started in summer with the address of his debble still unnamed.
She himself wrote the guide, a history of love between a bosnia and a serbia.
You don't know much more about this, but this is enough for angry.
The rumor is very persistent, the woman, the musulman, loves her Serbian violator during the war of Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women's associations have rapidly protested, with which at the last time they transferred a few days of wheel planned in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been rolled in Hungary and the powder, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic on the women's organization of victims of war wrote to the United Nations High Commissioner, UNHCR by Jolie and requested a meeting with the actor, informed a Bosnian journal, Jolie is the embassy of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
It is not diplomatic. Women offered him a meeting in Hungary who rejected.
The meeting was placed in Bosnia, said Hasecic.
There are no stories of love in violations fields, and the position of Jolie about victims is sufficiently about the guiding.
His organization in accordance with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has recommended that Jolie as a Ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly wrote Jolie for the scenes?
The Bosnian Culture Ministry, which reads the guion, offered after a strike, and engaged a recording permission in Sarajevo, is not all clear why Jolie was not even all.
The young author who does not pursue political purposes with its film, has been introduced with a lot of efforts in the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the horrible consequences of the war and to vote to all the parties involved.
His content remains precise.
On the network, a second sinpsy of the film that sounds very different: Lovers were together before the beginning of the war and return to meet when she, a Muslim Bosnia, is deported to a Serbian field where he worked as guard.
What it feels very different is the variant "training victim is in love of torturer".
It's sure that the film of Jolie really starts before the war.
The pressure on it, says Jolie, is "injust and based on wrong information."
They can now achieve peace with Hollywood hackers: while the guide continues on the network illegally, as many others previously.
Nothing like far from here
This afternoon ends back to be good for the Irish.
No rasters of suffering
Instead, the home team dominates its customers in Sweden, Finland and the United States.
The fans cry to joy while they turn the high music, shoot the ground with the feet.
The Bailey Club lives in the Swedish Cork, because the players start, and find, pingpong shoes to the bird vacuums from a distance of three meters.
The spectacular name is "Beerpong", and the winner prize is 500 euros more than a flight at Las Vegas for the World Bird Championship in January.
Cyan Tanner is a quiet type, this extreme drink game and the computer discreet actually do not make good mygas.
And the 26-year-old boy is trying to enjoy it, to divide from the fulminant question, which will take him the future.
The difference in Las Vegas is not in its plans, in January will take a personal interview in New Zealand.
"I have a bad presence," says.
"He's very far from home and I don't have any job there."
At least: Her girlfriend waited for him in Auckland, "from a smile made the work of his dreams as a event manager, perhaps it's a good sign," says the young and dream.
Because of the bad perspectives in the home, two of the three brothers of Tanners have already been looking for luck in the foreign.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sidney, his brother Colin currently works as IT adviser in London.
Young people go: There are many families like the Tanners in the island.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in a near future, pronounce the economic experts and the ESRI social research institute of Dublin.
By 2015 there are 200,000 migrants.
A great loss for this small country with only 4,5 million people.
Prognostics are confirmed, there is a migratory wave comparable to which the island suffered in the 80s.
After a decade of progress that brought great well-being to Irish, the melancoly is now expansive.
The economic crisis confunds mostly young, Irish well-formed, for which to now, everything is costing above.
The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in the years of the boom.
Everyone needs to have money in abundance.
But three of each ten men and women under thirty years are in the couple.
In Irish Times, there are letters to the director in mass of youth migrants who wants to say, "In Ireland, everything goes."
"It should have a resurrection against the political and bankers, but whoever can, is going and lose our country and with that to a whole generation."
"The last to close the door."
Leanne Caulfield, a legal student and president of the Irish students' unions, appears a dream future because the government is dedicated only to mountains and no longer offers future perspectives to young people.
"Reduce minimum wages, but they do not have strategies to achieve new jobs", says the 20-year-old girl.
Notes how your partners are going from non-recommendated practices to the following.
Your greater concern, explains, is to have to migrate in four years.
"This idea is triste and depressed."
People like Stephen McLarnon try to see this topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a holiday that offers a service around the subject to work in the foreign area.
"To those who start working, do in the foreign is a great opportunity, the first steps to direct your career," says the manager.
On your website there are photos of a boy who practices surf in Australia and another practitioning snowboard in Canada.
The message is clear: Working in the foreign is not how to do in the galleries, if not deliver freedom and diversity.
Since half years ago, Sean O'Donovan knows how to build something on another place.
Since there was nothing to do for the 29-year engineer, we currently worked with 15 Irish partners in the construction in Germany.
Now, you get up a model shop in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, she goes to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan only sees her patriarch just a few times because he works for more hours to pay a credit for his home in Ireland.
"The situation is a bit crazy," says, "before long ago the first time he stood the ombrole of his house.
"I have money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I'm never so good."
He smile something, and she's going to be through heavy rooms.
The small house is in a elegant residential area with garden care for the houses, in the entrance there are large and cherished cars.
O'Donovan purchased the house together with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100% funded by a credit.
"It was crazy time, I had easy money without many questions," says.
You're afraid to miss the credit?
O'Donovan thinks a rat, serves more warm tea, and says, "I have no children who have to eat and I'm young; if everything comes badly, I can start from zero."
The civil engineer does not like complaints that are often listening to.
"No one must be hungry, our situation is not, with a lot of difference, so dramatic as in the past times in the island," says.
"Bearing a time in the foreign is not the worst thing can happen, perhaps with that we first feel as Irish."
It is ridicule and accounting about his father, that in the last large economic crisis, it was in England.
"After seven years he returned and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes it's a idea.
Let the future dump and simply see how life is on the other hand.
He worked a couple of years in London, and why would he not go well to him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But in these days there is something that is worried about the day: the celebration of his 27th birthday in Dublin.
You're afraid you can degenerate at a disappearing party.
"Singlely, no emotions", says and gives a great trace to his beer.
"Speaking, it sounds very anxious."
"We better call it a party to walk, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
Democratic routine
Democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as well as support for private enterprises.
Crime generates more concern than unemployment.
Furthermore, in most of the region, Brazil is seen as a most influential country than the United States.
These are some of the conclusions of the last survey of the Latinobarometer in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been regularly held since 1995, it is possible to monitor the changes in the region.
In the results of this year's survey, conducted in September and the begins of October, there are two related issues.
The first is the relatively animated humor in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of the attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Democracy support has significantly increased in several countries of the South America coast (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached a average of 6 per cent since 2002, democracy support has increased from 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent in 2005.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy has been restored after a great decline of production last year.
However, only half of the surveys in Mexico and Brazil, the two most popular countries in the area, are convinced democrats, which decreased the regional media (see Graph 2).
About 44 per cent of the surveys in the region were satisfied with the way democracy worked in their country, the same number as the last year, but significantly more than 25 per cent registered in 2001 (graph 3).
Average 34 per cent stated that they trusted in the Congress of their country and 45 per cent in their Government, the same amount as the last year in both cases, but significantly higher in relation to 2003 (17 and 24 per cent respectively).
A decade ago, economic turbulences in Latin America have severely affected democracy.
The fact that it has been maintained during the world financial crisis is likely to be deemed to be a number of Latin American countries that were only affected by a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
Furthermore, the existence of a stronger social security network has contributed to protect the poorest.
(The Economic Commission of the United Nations for Latin America reported this week that the percentage of Latin Americans living in poverty so far as marginally increased in 2009 and that this year has been reduced to 32 per cent.)
However, the state of spirit would be significantly from a country to another (see graph 4).
The good economic performances of Brazil and the popularity of his summer President, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, are reflected in a general sense of progress.
This feeling is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and has increased violent crimes.
The second time since the surveys have been started, more surveyed in Latin America mention the crime, instead of unemployment, such as the worst problem that their country is faced (see graph 5.).
Around 31% claims that, whether they or a neighbor, there has been a victim of crime in the last year, a number which has been reduced from 38% of the last year and is the lower percentage registered since 1995.
The most positive economic performance is reflected in more support for private enterprises and market economy: around 71 per cent of the surveys in the region claim that private enterprises are essential for development, while only 56 per cent in 2007 (see Graph 6).
Another 58% convicted that market economy is the only system that will allow its country to develop, against 47% in the past year.
It is interesting that 62% of the surveys in Venezuela feel the same (and 80% supports private enterprises), although his left President, Hugo Chávez, is exposed to many private companies.
Brazil is a larger leadership in the region, as indicated by 19% of the surveys (before 18% in the last year), followed by the United States (9%, the same number as the last year) and Venezuela (9% against 11% a year ago).
However, the United States is the most influential country of the surveys in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela has such a title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and the Nicaragua.
Elections to the slaughter
No one expected the general elections held on 28 November in Haiti were perfect.
However, they were much worse than the fears of foreigners who tried to help the country get back to their problems.
A number of votes were introduced in the urnes, some voted several times, cut papers in the shops, destroyed election collections and acts of intimidation.
The election collections opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including groups displaced by the earthquake of January, tried to discover where they had to vote.
Some of them, finally, were given for winners.
A twelve of candidates to the presidents, including several of the most popular, declared fraud and requested the cancellation of elections.
Protections, some of them violent, were extended throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the United Nations larger official in Haiti, declared that they were "a relatively good election in many senses".
The observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said, with care, "we do not think that these irregularities, for serious things they are, are invalidly the process".
In other words, the spectacle continues.
The election authority, which, according to its contractors, is compromised with René Preval, the outstanding president, and with his candidate, Jude Celestin, should announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The performance will be carried out in January.
Not all hopes for elections have yet been lost.
The two main candidates of the opposition, Michel Martelly, a raper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former lady, have removed their initial request in which they requested the invalidation of the vote.
But it can still be problems if the election authority declares that Mr Celestin, who only has support, if he has somebody, has passed to the second round.
Bearing in mind that the epidemic of colliera shocks the country and more than a million earthly survivors still live in shops, it is expected to be a great abstention.
At the moment, many Haitians wanted to vote, but they did not have to do so because of the lack of organization.
Additional of 250,000 identity documents, necessary to vote, had not yet been distributed before the elections.
There's a lot in the game.
Aid donors consider that the election of a popular and legitimate government is an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, as it has remained patent, they also think that the Haitians themselves.
Advanced from points to the center
In the weeks that have been overlooked from his husband, Cristina Fernández, President of Argentina, has enjoyed a great sympathy between the public that has increased its population index in 20 points, up to 50 percent, the largest level which has been registered since its election in 2007.
Despite all that it can become a successful campaign for a second mandate in the elections of the year, which will depend on whether the clearly affected Mrs. Fernández leaves the intransigence of her husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And in this regard, the indications are not concluded.
Mr. Kirchner, who was still responsible for the economic policy, even after his wife was chaired as President, had the habit of elaborating budgets that undervalued tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to pay additional income to their discretion.
In the theory, Mrs Fernández's government lost most in the Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has deceived after Kirchner's failure because of a heart attack on October 27.
Some discreptive members of the perronist movement have faced Ms Fernández.
However, after some chaotic meetings, in which a deputy gave him a bridge on the face and other Members accused the sovereign government, the Congress decided to reject the budget of 2011.
"I'm not going to discuss", said the President.
Consequently, the 2010 budget will be applied to the next year, which will provide the President a more larger action margin than the time to expend.
The economy is significantly improved: it probably grows up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11,1 per cent, but many private calculations, in addition to the salary requirements of the sindicals, are about 30 per cent.
Mr. Kirchner, who took the power in 2003 when Argentina was on the edge of the economic failure, made that growth and poverty reduction were its priorities instead of inflation control.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressed the private sector and made that the INDEC, the Statistics Institute, was adapted to the official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernández move these policies now?
He has convoked meetings between the private sector and the leaders of the Union.
In addition, their officials claim that they want to limit payment increases in the year near to 18 per cent.
The economy has been stimulated by the high prices of Argentina's agricultural exports in the world.
However, inflation has limited the impact of growth achieved in 2002.
Perhaps Mrs Fernández is given signs of wanting to restore the financial links of Argentina with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the Government reached an agreement with the bonus holders that had been rejected by a forced restructuring before the debt that Argentina had not been assigned in 2001.
Today, Ms. Fernández seems to be able to celebrate an agreement with the credible governments grouped in the Paris Club, which must be around 6.7 million dollars.
The Kirchners always stressed that this would not imply the FMI's supervision as normal.
However, last month Amado Boudu, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will provide "technological assistance" to develop a new national consumption price index, which seems to be the prelud to the cleaning of INDEC.
It is not clear if President Fernández wants to continue in the policy when he completes its mandate, taking into account that he has no longer his husband.
If so, it will be necessary to win the support of the average class, most of which has been angry of kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their steady holidays in March, the sympathy sun will have been deceived.
If you want to win other elections, you must decide whether you reput or not, with calmity, many of your husband's policies.
Average swallowing by China
The voters of Taiwan are slowly approaching a species of closer unions with the continent.
What does Taiwan think about his big brother on the other side of the stretch?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70 per cent of the eligible, took place on 27 November to elect the chalks and design them from five urban districts, which seems to be a wide evaluation of the President, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma has become a defender of the feelings of the continent, making innovative business links, including a partial free trade agreement, the greatest change in the relationship with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but soon.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) won three of the five chain elections, he did not get the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (PPD), which has been encouraging by total independence from Taiwan, has almost 50% of all votes against 45% of KMT.
If they were the presidents, Mr Ma would be in trouble.
Since its election two years ago, the proportion of votes of its party has reduced around 8%.
For the first time, the PPD posted with KMT in boards.
In the elections, the typical elements of the Taiwan elections were seen, including routine camping trucks and large aglomerations with bandrites and girls of bathing clothes.
Neither did the mysterious attempt to kill rigor.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, KMT's honorary President, was a campaign for one of KMT candidates on the night before the elections.
A man of the multitude shooted the young man directly to the face, shooting him and killing a transhuman.
I wonder if it was not possible to determine whether the man intended to harm Lien or become a candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the PPD leader, the shoot affected the elections, seeming to be suspected about the PPD and caused voters to smile by KMT.
Maybe the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that the matter of the continent was not addressed in itself.
Instead, candidates talked about public accommodation plans and employment.
They usually enjoy their real independence and hate China's military threat.
As a result, KMT is generally avoiding advertising its links to the Government in Peking.
But this time the PPD also avoided encourageing the feeling against China.
It responds to the new conscience that Chinese trade is essential for the economic survival of Taiwan.
On its part, Mr Ma stated that its policy on China was acceptable for most Taiwanians.
It is expected that the Peking Government continues to support them with the trade, in accordance with its strategy to achieve Taiwan ' s relief.
China did not lose time by sending a negotiator to Taiwan to prepare a Summit on the Protection of Investments and Medical Cooperation.
Indeed, I would like to also get political integration, but first is it.
The best will expect the presidential elections of 2012 to this end.
In any case, the PPD has been revended.
Two years ago, a bad situation was found: his former leader, Chen Shui-By, was incarcerated by corruption.
The President urged the explicit independence.
However, under the leadership of Ms. Tsai has emerged a new generation of moderates, and the PPD is striving to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been grately welcomed as a candidate to the Presidency, as well as its Tseng-chang, who complied with the mandate under Chen.
Now your game is doing everything possible by showing that you can also have relationships with Pekin.
Ms. Tsai announced the plans for establishing a group of experts acting as a contact point between the PPD and China, provided that negotiations could be carried out without pre-conditions.
Ms. Tsai says to the Taiwan public that its party represents a "reliable alternative" approach to Mr. Ma in respect of China.
Mr. Chen looks funny for the change.
In a declaration issued from its cell, he stated that the candidates of the PPD would have been better stopped if they insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, which was not submitted to the presidents.
Even without intercept Mr. Chen, the PPD will have difficulties to choose between its possible candidates.
KMT should also conduct awareness review.
The values of Mr Ma have been poor, despite the impressive economic growth; the candidates of KMT did not want to camp with him.
The lack of popularity seems to be mainly the unemployment and the growing differences between rich and poor.
A KMT's porter states that it will restructure your office as well as local teams.
The large exhibition of the PPD suggests that Taiwan's support to approach is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanians consider that economic integration in China is inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a known colonist, "the point of non-return has been crossed."
Noms to the Grammy: Jazz Esperanza Spalding's song is the surprise choice in the Artist Revelation category.
He acts on a President's request, and maybe people will be set in you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bajist and songman who was personally selected by President Obama to act in his Nobel Prize of Peace in 2009, summoned one of the surprises of the Grammys this year with a high-level appointment in the best Artist Revelation category.
Bearing in mind that Spalding has been an appealed figure of the jazz from his 2008 album, "Esperance", the name of what you think, but respects the standards of the Grammys, which should be a artist who has not left the market more than three albums before writeing what "determines the public identity of this artist".
His ambitious album of 2010, "Chamber Music Society", without duty summoned a great progress and, taking into account its light and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great ability with pop influences, funk and Latin ritmos, can at least set a distinction between Spalding and the way towards the success of Norah Jones in 2003, the nearest equivalent for the voters of the Grammys, which have recently been concentrated in the field of jazz for this category.
In the remaining categories, the voters of the Grammy made honour to Vijay Iyer Trio's "History", a exciting and wonderful disk that was one of the favorites last year.
Among the Yeyer's competitors, the saxophonist Veteran James Moody is located with "Moody 4B" and the technicist John Beasley by "Positootly".
Trombone Shorty, a favorite stress in New Orleans and a normal invitation in "Treme" of the HBO, was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which, on the other hand, is significantly clined towards the fusion as in Stanley Clarke's albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber's albums.
Darcy James Argue's Secret Society has obtained a mere recognition in the category of great groups, composing against the large camera jazz of Billy Childs Ensemble and the always arrased Dave Holland's album, whose "Pathways" was a great example of the democratic leadership of the bathist in his band.
Nominations to Grammy Prizes: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey in the best direction of classic albums
The names in the field of classic music for the 53th edition of the Grammy Prizes include a mixture of music and composers throughout the world.
The main appointments were for Michael Daugherty by "Deus Ex Machina", by piano and orchestra, with five movements, and Steve Mackey with "Dreamhouse", a work for three elegant orchestras.
Between the named nameds with the south of California are the Estonian Composer Arvo Pärt for its synfony No.4 "Los Angeles", a part of Los Angeles' Philarmonics and extract in the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer based on Los Avner Dorman is also appointed by its Mandolin Concerto.
Classic music names are distributed in three categories that cover orchest, oper, coral and solo albums.
The classic producer category of the year includes five nameds: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The names for the classic music album are Bruckner by the Royal Concert Gebouw No. 3 and No. 4 of the Royal Orquest; Daugherty by "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Sinfónica Orchestra de Nashville; Steven Mackey by "Dreamhouse" of Boston Modernn Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" of several artists; and the "Requiem" de Verdi de Chicago Orchestra and Chorus.
In the operation category, the names are Berg by "Lulu" of the Royal Opera House's Orchest; Adolf Hasse by "Marc Antonio and Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; and Arthur Sullivan by "L'Amor de Loin" by the German Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin by "The Enchanted Wander" of the Marinsky Theatre and the theatre; and Arthur Sullivan by "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers named a Grammy for contemporary compositions include Pärt by the Synfony No. 4, Daugherty by "Deus Ex Machine", Hans Werner Henze by "Appssionally Plus", Magnus Lindberg by "Graffiti" and Shchedrin by "The Enchanted Wandererer".
The Sinfonia No. 4 of Part was exhibited in the Disney Hall in January 2009 at a meeting registered by the Los Angeles Filarmonic, directed by Esa-Pecca Salonen.
The piece, from about 30 minutes, is "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the old magnificent Oil Mikhail Khodorkovsky, incarcerated in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" is appointed by the instrumental solist action with orcheist.
The composer of Los Angeles wrote the piece of 15 minutes specifically to touch it in Mandoline Avi Avital, which interpreted the concert with the Metropolis Ensemble, based on New York.
"The composite with sounds next and many scales and ritmos from North Africa," Dorman stated in a telephone interview.
Director Peter Boulez, 85 years of age, was appointed in the category of orchestra, by directing the Sinphonica Orchestra of Chicago during a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the named instrumental solists are the pilgrims Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; the organization Paul Jacobs; the violinist Julia Fischer; and the arcist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The names as vocabulary solists are all women this year: Anne Sofie Van Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonov, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mixing category, the above Jessye Norman was appointed by its recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song".
The proposed mixture in Themecule obtains the approval of the management commission
The Mixed project for Temecula has obtained the uniform support of the local management commission after over five hours of public witnesses, often acknowledged.
Criticals attacked the project, saying that it promotes terrorism and sugars.
However, the members of the committee decided on Thursday night that the new religious center respected the local legislation and would be impressive from the ethical point of view.
"Those good people came to show their support, both Christians and Jews or Bahaies, of all religions," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic center of the Teacula Valley, on Thursday morning.
"The truth is that, as a American citizen, I am honoured."
"Demonstrates that the justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimum," adds.
"Solo they're talking very high."
"In this valley there are wonderful people."
The meeting began at the sixth night and was almost up to a half night; most of the time was dedicated to people who intercepted in favour or against the center, almost the same amount in each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper website.
"The United States no longer exists" is read in one of the comments.
"This is another Simon Planet with Ms. Libertad dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The construction plans of Islamic centres have also caused protests in other parts of the country, including near the zero area, the New York area where the attacks occurred on 11 September 2011.
In the Themecula Valley, Ian Mahmoud Harmoush has declared acts of violence.
His congregation of about 135 families last years lived without problems in the Riverside gate, but he wanted a higher and better space than the store that was equipped in a shared property with a water filtering system manufacturer.
The new mixture of 24.943 square feet, with a Mediterranean architecture style, would include two minerals and up to 43 feet.
It would be a surface of 4,32 cels in Nicolas Road, about two miles east of the Chapral Institute.
The opposites can still recurr the project before the municipal Council.
A resistant microbiology to the arsenics highlights the possibility of new forms of life on Earth... or in other places.
The discovery of a strange bacteria that can use the arsenic as one of its nutrients extended the possibility of finding new forms of life on earth and, perhaps, in other planets.
Although researchers found the curiosity bacteria here on the earth, they say that there may be shapes of life without the main elements that were considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"You can grow with fosfor or with arsenic."
"It becomes something very spectacular, although little it is to be a type of life really "aliensa", commented Paul C. W. Davies of the Arizona State University, co-auteur of the report that appears in the online edition of the Wednesday of Science publication.
Since many years, there are six important elements for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, fosfor and azure.
However, researchers have found that the bacteria, found at Mono Lake in California, can continue to grow up after replacement of the arsenix.
"He gives you the most possible" said Ariel D. Anbar from the University of Arizona State, coautor of the report.
According to Anbar, the finding is important for life searching in different planets from the earth, since researchers need to be able to recognise their life, know the aspect of it.
The study focuses on a microbiological discovery on the Earth.
However, the convocation of a press route to discuss, in which the details of the discovery were not distributed, generated a large speculation on the Internet about the possibility that the report indicates the discovery of extraterrestreat life.
He didn't.
What the discovery "you shows is that in other planetary environments, organs could have used other elements to stimulate their biochemical and that the assembly of "stational" elements that we consider may not be so firm for life", commented Charles Cockell, Catholic of Planetary and Space Science Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell did not have a part of the research team.
"This work is renewed because it demonstrates the substitution of a element by another in biochemical and basic biochemical structure", added Cockell.
The discovery was not carried out in case.
Felisa Wolf-Simon of the NASA Astrobiology Institute, which directed the study, focused on the Mono Lake because he presented high arsenic levels.
Archenic and fosfor are similar from the chemical point of view, so that a microbio exposed to both could replace one by one another.
"The arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to the fosfor."
"They can therefore be complicated with the different organs."
"But the arsenic is enough to do so that it does not work as well as the fosfor, so in and, in some way, appeal biochemical machinery," Anbar explains.
The researchers recognised the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing arsenic concentrations, which could be adapted and used to grow.
The microbio grows better with fosfor, but the fact that you can demonstrate that you can live with arsenic in its place is the possibility of existing naturally a form of life that uses arsenics, either in other areas of the earth or in another planet or moon where the arsenic is most common.
Jamie S. Foster, a helper of microbiology at the University of Florida, indicated that the idea that the arsenic can be replaced by the fosfor is not new, but there was never found an example that shows that it works.
Archenic was most common in the first eras of the earth, so researchers speculated that the first way of life could have been used.
"I know that it suggests that there could be other ways to generate life, not only the way life was formed in the ancient Earth," said Foster, who was not part of the Wolf-Simon research team.
The investigation reported the support of the NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Health Institutes.
The robbed dogs were found that lacked in Compton
The two dogs were missing from the four robbeds against the Bellflower Motel, as they said, the officers of Los Angeles' chair sheriff was held on Thursday.
The four competitive dogs, two Asiats and two Corgi Galles Pembroke, disappeared on Tuesday, when someone stole the Chevrolet Express truck in 2006, in which they were passing the night, before the Belflower Motel 6, stated the authorities.
Two of the canines were recovered Thursday night, and the two rest were found afternoon, afternoon, Steve Whithmore, a porter of the sheriff's headquarters' office of Los Angeles.
"The good news is that the dogs are good," Whitmore stated.
They're in a good state.
"He's returned with their legitimate duties."
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in which barria, nor the circumstances of discovery.
"He's conducting a research."
"We don't want to say anything," Whitmore said.
"We're following a pistas."
I couldn't find the dogs, Christina Rickard and David Peek, to make some comment on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas in a refugee of green animals in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's helpers found the truck and the two dogs separated in Compton.
According to the authorities, the Asiats (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month dog) had not suffered.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek intended to show in the competitions of the area this week on behalf of the Japanese dog owners, continued to disappear until Thursday night.
Peek and Rickard, who lived in Redding, were in the city for the ACC/Ecanuba National Championship this weekend and intended to show Trace.
The other dogs were to show them in other competitions planned for the days before the ACC/Ecanuba campionate, as stated by Peek to The Times on Monday.
South California is one of the stops in the round of almost two months that the couple takes part in Canadian competitions.
On Monday, Peek and Rickard did check-in in the motel.
They are normally in motels and look at the exact truck towards the window of your room.
They brought to three other dogs (a boxer cry, a parson Russell territory and a Britishtany, who sleeped with them in the motel room.
But they left the Asiats and Corgis in the bus because they had a very sweet shock and would be more fresh.
They left slightly open vents so that the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard declared the rob of the truck on Tuesday at the sixth morning.
Peek had said that they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the Corgis, with microchips to identify them.
The Thursday was not clear if a reward would be given or not.
Leon is ready to rule again, while MGM's restructuring has the final approval of the court
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally reached green light to start again.
On Thursday, a federal banking judge of New York officially adopted the "pre-weaponed" plan by creditors to remove about $5 million debt, slowing the way the 86-year-old entertainment company focuses on its efforts in production and stereory films and television programs.
The fall of the Thursday confirms that the plan comply with the requirements of the US banking code, so there are no other legal obstacles to MGM retain under the founders of Spigls Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, which will be converted into the main executives of what will be reduced.
Personals will be reduced from 400 to about 320 integrates.
In fact, MGM will not go from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a $500 million scheduled credit instrument to finance the operations and production of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently synchronising the credit, which is contributing by its account to $75 million, and is expected to be financed at average December.
The study restructuring process began in May 2009, when the Moelis and Co. Investment Bank was contracted to provide advisory on the management necessary to order its finances, while fighting to make interest payments for $3,3 million per year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, an ex-president of Enron and expert in recovery of enterprises in Queebra, known for his work in Crispy Kreme Duughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to solve the financial challenges of MGM and to satisfy the more than 140 research creditors, required more time than expected.
After several months of discussion, the parties agreed to put the company to the sale at the end of 2009.
However, the subvention was able to spend a few officers and no one was intended to pay more than $2 billion that were looking for creditors.
Before the spring of this year, he returned to the design table while the MGM team began working in a restructuring plan which, after months of discussion and internal disappearance, was finally supported by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM is officially out of the bankrote in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive multimillionary bonifications for their work.
Moelis and Co., who has already received $1,2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper companys, who have been rebuilding $37,5,000 per month for their company administration services, will receive a $4 million 's succeeding honourary.
Barber and Birnbaum planned to restore the production in MGM, which was only a film this year, and he met a year-year pizzar of seven or eight films that will come up in 2012.
They are also planning to cofinanciate two films based on "El Hobbit", together with Warner Bros.
The study needs to concert a separate loan between 265 and 275 million dollars to finance its part of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who had about 18% of MGM's debt, had tried to correct a study fusion with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to maintain the balance of your budget for gifts
While iPad is the main candidate to be the most wonderful game of this year, maybe followed by the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both may mean a significant meal in your budget for gifts.
Consider that by the price of a iPad you can buy five BMX bikes from 99 dollars each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic salts with accounts, or about 48 sides of the Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your budget for gifts in balance.
Recently I visited three national players, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Walesale Club to see that electronic games could buy less than $80.
It was immediately clear that the Moore Law has been working; the technological game this year probably will be more powerful, costing the same and even a little less compared to the last year.
Furthermore, while there are generally fewer new games with partner web sites, two of the most famous of this type, Webkinz and Club Penuin, have more offers.
And the games stimulated by button piles are growing, as well as players with reloadable batteries.
These are the guys we're after.
(All prices are from Toys "R" You, except that it is otherwise indicated).
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13 dollars, for three years and more) are tissue games from the size of a cobai who sing a note when their barriers are opened.
A apprison equipped to a note, and a second appreciation begins to weapon a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Warning: Once you start to press, you can't stop.
For a dancing song, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
Takeing off the Elmo Live technology of the past year, the animator kitchen of 14 pulses plays shift games like Simom Dice, and can make the moon step, thanks to its innovating legs articulated with locked shoes.
The children who tried the game used Mickey as a dance instructor, although their parents were detained for the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you can remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational games.
He returned (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and more), with a full piece of questions cards designed to convert a passenger in a meeting with an auto-cover or current workshop chair.
If you are glad to give your child your smart phone, here will be three independent alternatives.
MobiGo of VTech (60 dollars from 3 to 8 years of age) is the most precious and easyest to use, presenting a qvalue keyboard; although games do not teach so effectively as Leapster Explorer (70 dollars from 3 to 12 years) is the first important point in Leapster line, with a new and brilliant screen.
No version is compatible with old cards.
iXL of Fisher-Price (90 dollars, from 3 to 7 years) uses a iTunes type system to present games and electronic books, and has a rancher for SD cards that allows to visualize family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (30 dollars, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a game of five blocks only larger than one cell box, each with its LED screen.
The goal is to weaken words by putting the blocks in line before the time ends; it is formidable for an unproved word weapons competition.
It's increasingly the games that have some kind of online connection.
Only based on their presence on games, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your son a online mask in the Penguin Club, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penuin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack ($5,000 to 12 years) which includes a currency with a hidden code.
When you cancel the online code, your child gets enough credits in the Club Penuin store for two items.
These could include swimming poets or a puffle mascotte game.
Hexbug Nano is lightly larger than the skin of his dentist skin, (10 dollars, for 5 years and more) is the last in a microbot line stimulated by button pills.
The false insect moves rapidly over 12 silicone slips that live, in aleatorial addresses.
It's pleasant to make a block lab to see if you can find the output.
It's also duration.
We were able to leave the kitchen table and even pass arat inside our dog's mouth.
A more moderate side of the order maintenance in China
As a urban instructor, Tang Shenbin marked the step in a place of the city, inspecting the nervous people to his office, emiting commands under the voice of military authority.
He wanted the women of Changguan, the police corpulents of China's urban order, feared and disrespected by their powerful measures and their guiding to violence, to communicate a certain impression to a spectacle pugnate.
Fire!
"Attention!"
Show them, shouted, "Why are the beautiful girls!"
Four young girls who only passed with white winters and every green olive oil adjusted to call attention.
Four black skin couples perfectly aligned.
Four elegant shadows placed perfectly above the hair struck with blue and white rays.
"Perhaps, I think you have a normal appearance," said Mr. Tang, sweetly.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to clean the image of the urban inspectors in China.
A city ordered that all new recruitments have a level title.
The province of Guangdong changed the green green color of the uniforms to a presumably more attractive blue.
Whan, in central China, replaced the use of the force by intimidatory sights: in 2009, 50 officials rounded a snack snacks snacks snack, and observed it with the snack snack that was constantly fructuated for a half hour, until the ambulant seller collected its things and marched.
Xindu, a urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen a radical image change.
Since 2003, the district has accompanied its urban police 13 women, expressly elected by their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give you to the police a more sweet side, woman.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to struggle to increase China's imperfect respect for these cities.
And for a good reason, they would argue the critics.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to comply with the city's orders, putting currencies and other administrative penalties.
But the media of Chinese news is routinely a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of the province of Hubei killed a shooting shooting after using their cell to film them while solving a protest against a dishwasher.
Last year, a book for Pekin inspectors was cut and published on the Internet, where it was described how to shoot crimers effectively without blood.
This year, a ambulance seller in Shanghai has suffered brain damage after a rain with five officials.
A full video game of violence, available to download online, presents inspectors trained by the Chinese who attack street salers.
"Chengguan has left a cyclist in the government," was regretted China Daily, a national publication, last year after another controversial on tactics.
The newspaper required "a really meticulous cleaning."
The sceptics say that the current approach is far away from this.
After the district would ask for eight new women ' s recruitments in October, a editor in The Beijing Evening News was asked whether women had real duties or were just a scenic distraction.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both things.
The advertisement of the district requested women from 18 to 22 years of age, with a good figure "and the five harmonious facial races".
They should have a height above the average, more than 1.6 metres or 5 feet, 2 (12.12) pulled.
The retirement to age 26 is binding.
The officials said that the work was physically too slow for women over 25 years.
"Sue image is the important thing," he said a district officer in Rednet.com, a guerrance website.
"Before, the external qualitys of candidates shall determine whether they comply with the requirements such as height, weight, facial races, etc. "
Then the temperation "and the internal qualitys".
Women's chengguans are like flowers, said, and added, "Atherwise they have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, a subdirector of the district administration office, is not concerned to support this description.
But he noted that higher requirements were standard in many Chinese work warnings for both sex.
Then it comes to the demand of harmonious facial races.
If this means being appropriate, it is a matter of debate between Chineses.
Of course, the low or disfigured should not be presented.
"We can't allow a coat person or a joker to work here", said Mr. Zheng.
"It wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who patchs the Baoguang Plaza near a monastery, has 22 years of age, with its colored legs and a slightly curve mouth.
She doesn't believe that the acent in her appearance is sexist, said.
"Do you think I look sexy with this uniform?" he asked with a sadtonic look.
His working partner with today, Xu Yang, 21 years old, said "We should present the image of the city".
They are not opposed to their work at a time, they said, because they have higher carriage ambitions that simply help solders in the carriage where they are supposed to circle their business.
Each morning, the squadron faces more than a twenty-five of ambulant sellers that are launched at foot or in bicycle, trying to sell so many panecilles or tofuel tazes as soon as possible before they are escaped.
"Mr. Wang, you must go."
"We have told you many times," said Mrs. Xu while a soldier lost his car temporaryly shooted by a bicycle with guards of believers.
The officials describe their duties as more monotones than extincts.
"This is more or less the same day," Huang Jing said, 20 years old, who studied marketing in his free hours.
Very rutinary.
One reason is that women officials lack the power of their male boys to confiscate the goods of soldiers.
They can only threaten the offenders to their men's supervisors.
This aims to protect them from the repentant public demonstrations of spirit against bureaucracy, which are common in all parts of China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunan, were shocked after the false shooting that some Changguan officials killed a soldier.
More than a twelve of Changguan police or officials were blessed in the night episode; 14 government vehicles were shocked or taken fire.
By the time Xindu has avoided such violence.
But calm is only guaranteed.
Only two streets of the peaceful Baoguang Plaza, where women's officials patroled that morning, more than 50 people gathered in a hill.
The officials had confiscated a motor that was reparated in the farm instead of in a tank, as required by the regulation.
The moto's duty cryed greatly.
The situation was over 15 minutes before the officials, with bad face, opened steps to their vehicles, and quickly were with the motorcycle and their shopping.
Li Xuedong, a 40-year-old coordinator assigned to the male squadron, remained behind, with its white insigny back to hide his name.
As women officials, coordinators, 40 years older men play a pure support role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to keep an elegant image.
"while we struggle verbally."
"Atimes we struggle physically," Mr. Li said with total nature.
"The majority of the time is the public that begins the fight."
Scientists will not raise charges against Senator Ensign
Senator's lawyers announced the Monday that the fiscals of the Department of Justice had apologized Senator John Ensign of the criminal imprisonment that had resulted from their affairs with an ex-campagne assistant and their efforts to ensure work through lobby for the husband of women.
The decision ended with the most serious legal threat to address Ensign, the Republic of Nevada, which was considered as possible candidate to the Republic of Republic for 2012, until the skandale on its matter had national titles last year and damaged his career.
The Ensign office said that it felt "safely content" for the decision, which came after an investigation of a whole year.
The Senator could still address a disciplinary measure of the Senate Ethics Committee.
The lawyers of Ensign said that the Department of Justice had "informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer a goal of his investigation and that there is no plan to put up charges against him for this issue".
The Department of Justice did not want to comment on this case.
The announcement was a surprise for many attorneys outside the Department of Justice, who said that they seemed to have significant evidence to indicate that Ensign could have been inflicted to violate a federal offence ban on lobby.
Interviews, e-mail and other documents that were distributed first in October 2009 in New York Times showed that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his helpers, to get lucrative work through lobby, to achieve the silence of Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Ms. Hampton once worked as a treasure of Ensign's campaign.
Entsign was in contact with several political patrocinators to find the work to Mr. Hampton and avok on behalf of them after they had contracted Mr. Hampton to make lobby for them, according to the documents and interviews.
As Hamptons had been recently an Assistant of Ensign, it was excluded according to the law to make lobby for his former employer or Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said that the inusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were intimate friends before the business, appeared in disappointment with the name "revolving door lobbying ban", which seeks to limit that former state employees use their connections to make personal business.
From the proof made public, "It seemed to be a first case of conspiration to violate substantially the status of revolving door," said Stanley Brand, a lawyer of Washington, who is specialized in defending customers investigated by the government.
While the officials of the Department of Justice refused to explain the reasonation behind the decision in the case of Ensign, Mr. Brand and other lawyers said that the department had been careful at the time of accepting political processes after several important reviews for its section of public integrity, including the decision of the last year to abandon the processing against the former Senator Ted Stevens, in a manner of wrong conduct.
Federal fiscals "is clearly some cobardes", said Melanie Sloan, Executive Director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a group of defence who brought a number of complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This is basically means that high-range government officials can now suggest that laws do not apply to them," he added.
Paul Coggins, the principal lawyer of Ensign, said in an interview that received a telephone call from a department of the Department of Justice on Monday and another called more on the next day, saying that the Department did not want to take charges against his customer.
The Ensign Defense team had been cooperating with the police in trying to convince them that the Senator, as its office reiterates in a statement, "he did in accordance with the law".
Coggins was refused to explain details of the legal arguments given to the taxers.
"I'm not comfortable to enter into details about my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we think they have taken the right decision," said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to change an investigation in a complaint separated by the Ethioth group, which claims that a payment of $96,000 of the Ensign parents to Hamptons has violated the federal election law.
The election committee said he had no sufficient evidence to demonstrate that money was not more than a gift.
NV Energy is an important company of Nevada who had supported the Senator for a long time, which has been working through lobby thanks to the help that Ensigned to Hampton.
A email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, the head of Ensign's officer John Lopez, communicated with Hampton and said that it was "making" the Interior Ministry on a debate.
He also attended a breakfast with Hampton and another client in Nevada, Allegiant Air, and called the transport secretariat to establish a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had contracted to Hampton to make a lobby.
When the news of the matter appeared during the last year, Ensign asked for forgiveness to his electors and rejected his position as four-leader in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for many months, Ensign told him two weeks ago to the journalists that he planned to be requested for a third mandate in the Senate.
When the voter of Ensign, Jennifer Cooper, announced that Ensign was no longer subject to a criminal investigation, said that the Senator expected that the Ethics Committee would follow the example of the Department of Justice and conclude its investigation.
"The Senator Ensign has desires to continue with its hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada," said.
Cheshire's appeal will focus on Twitter
There was a average twelve of them "chateing" in the lines of the court room.
A minute, they sent reports of the great witness through Twitter.
Finally, the defense said, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process of violation and children affected their beds in a house that was taken to fire.
The Thursday, the widely followed process by Steven J. Hayes, who was sentenced by the murder of three members of a family of Cheshire, Connecticut, is ready to reach an official end, with the tax of the judge of death penalty voted by the jury.
But the lawyers of Mr Hayes have written in the court that declare the arguments of the appeals that may probably be employed to courts for years.
One of the most provocative ones states that the intense reports on the process, including the broad use of Twitter by Massive Information Media Journalists, created "a circle atmosphere", and soon this generalized and immediate saturation with expansive details made public payments an inadequate influence on the jury.
The complaint could force the judges of appeal to address the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the court room.
"In accordance with what I have experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of the new technology in the court room is affecting the rights of the person to have a fair process," said Thomas J. Ullmann, principal lawyer of Mr Hayes' defence.
The first judge Jon C. Blue, the Supreme Court of State, laconally rejected the requests in a failure last week, saying that the media of news were "certified" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been brought by the passion.
But it's probably not the last word on the subject.
For decades, the appeal courts have recognized that the coverage of celebrated cases can generate questions on the imparciality of a process.
In a historical fall of 1966, the United States Supreme Court rejected the condemnation of a Cleveland osteopata, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, said in his decision, in the case of Sheppard vs. Maxwell, who had "a carnaval atmosphere in the process" because of the media.
The crime had been inspired by the television program and the film "Filgitive".
Some lawyers said that the courts of appeal that were reviewed by Mr. Hayes in the middle of the century could feel intrigued by the argument that they might be necessary to control the form of communication from the court rooms, something unimaginable at the time of the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"They have a general concern about the impact of the new media" in high-profile processes, said John J. Donohue III, a professor of Stanford Acts, who studied the death penalty of Connecticut and wrote a report in which it was said arbitraryly.
Professor Donohue said that some judges of appeal could feel intrigued by the idea that restricting immediate communication from the court rooms could make the judges more fair.
The Twitter question is only one of the many themes delineed by Haies lawyers, which will probably be discussed for years, delaying an execution.
The lawyers of the defence also claim that Hayes could have been damaged when the Blue judge rejected them to test the reactions of the potential judges, showing the spilled photos of the crime scene during the selection of the jury.
Some jury said they were horrible by victim photos, Jennifer Hawke-Petit of 48 years and their daughters, Hayley, from 17 and Michaela of 11.
The lawyers of the defence say that they will also question the constitutionality of death penalty and support that the judge had wrongly removed a jury who had criticized the fiscals, and that it had incorrectly been pressed for a stranger for his stranger decision to order the jury to decide during a weekend.
The sworns were not secuted.
But its arguments on the effect of the intense coverage of the process may affect most of the interest.
They were noted in a refusal to the archiving verdict last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates to the Governor and the United States Senate.
They argued that the media were continuously slow to the fire of the emotion on the case.
"The daily aglomeration of the media, cameras and reporters outside the court," the lawyers wrote, "he was never seen here in New Haven and maybe in the whole state."
Your attention to the coverage of Tweeter is controverted.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint on the fact that the immediate news was more important than the reports provided slower, it was a vision that would make that the justice policy on the control of the coverage would be weak in future processes.
However, some lawyers said that the courts of appeal often felt affected by the arguments on adjustment required in the courts because of social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pressing for that complaint.
In his writing, the decision of 1966 of the Supreme Court, which rejected the condemnation of Dr. Sheppard due to the coverage of the process, was referenced to the decision of 1966, and clearly made that the new means would require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the case Sheppard vs. Maxwell of the 21th century."
Can the citizen have a bridge to join the divisions?
After a notable campaign for invective and negativeness, this week has been launched a bit of civilization in Washington.
Is it a pregnancy of a real future bipartidist cooperation or an illusory moment before a rapid turn to the party struggle in the capital?
The Monday meeting between President Obama and the leaders of the Congress had not made any progress in the major issues to be addressed during the coming session.
But they all say, it was at least a short discussion on the differences of the two parties, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to rule, instead of being another empty episode to win party points.
The public meeting of the President ' s Chairman ' s deficit committee was also civilized, despite the political differences persistent among members.
It seems clear that the close interaction for a month has generated mutual respect that overcomes the ideological fraction that is still separated to members.
That is only enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Both parties are now in a test period, and they are mutually outlined to identify signs of cooperativeness and commitment, while trying to assess the limits of public view and the patience of voters for a renewed party war.
The reason for the meeting of Monday and the later evaluations of the same by the participants were made at least demands or accusions.
The philosophysic differences between Obama and the Republicns are too large and are very deeply angry as to suggest any rapid change in the climate that has existed over the past two years.
Where taxes, expenditure, health assistance or social assistance are concerned, both parties are in opposite pools.
In all ways, the election of November has suppressed the humor in Washington, at least short-term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed in the way to say things," said Pete Wehner, a official of Bush administration now in the Public Ethics and Policy Centre.
"They are inevitable after the elections.
The elections delete partial passions, which will then be extented.
That's good."
In some matters, in particular those contained in the agenda of the summer session, the Republics and Democrats have no option to find a solution.
Bush tax reductions arrive at the end of the year, and no one is for this.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all reductions, permanently or temporaryly.
Similarly, it is likely that there is a commitment to enhance unemployment subsidies, probably because the Republicns cannot believe that they are in favour of the reductions of tax for the rich, rejecting the unemployed workers.
After Monday's meeting in the White House, there is more optimism for possible treatment on these topics during the summer session, together with the ratification of the new START Nuclear Disarmament Agreement (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty).
But William Galston from the Brookings Institute warns that the successful cooperation in the outstanding matters of the summer session will not necessarily lead to a continuous bipartidism when the new 112th. Congress meeting in January.
He stated, on the contrary, that it is very likely and even inevitable, which begins a period of disappearance.
"When things to be done are carried out, psychology will turn the situation to a confrontation shortly."
Wehner also expressed scepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civilism can lead to true cooperation.
“I see the majority of what will happen between 2012 and 2012 as a test for the main event in 2012” said.
The reasons are very important to see the Constitution of the new majority of the Republic in the House and the voters of the Tea Party, which decisively contributed to their creation.
More accurately that the Republican leaders have the dangers to exert their position, they know that they must try to comply with their promises to recover the State expenditures and cancel the new health law.
These partial lines are already clearly observed in the initial responses to the recommendations of the Deficit Commission, including the reform of the tax code and the increase in some taxes and age of jubilation, and cost recovery.
Co-presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have been responsible for one of the most difficult works in Washington and, according to their own evaluation, have introduced the issue of deficit in the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the committee of 18 members to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and have been struggling to reach the number near.
The larger resistance is among the employees chosen in the panel, suggesting that in fiscal matters at least a few bases or desires for the commitment.
Galston predicts two stages in the battles between the Republicans of the White House and the Congress.
The first year will happen in the form of partial choosing, when the Republicns challenge Obama on budget, taxes and medical assistance, followed by a period of greater bipartial cooperation.
What would cause the change?
The public view.
There are considerable evidence that, despite the recent election party, a majority of Americans still want to see both parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a dead point, as happened in 1995, both parties will take care of the reaction of people.
Whoever you think you're losing probably will change course and find compromise.
However, this may be a optimistic vision.
The party and polarization are currently larger than the mid-1990s, and it seems to have a larger ideological shock between Obama and Republicns of the Congress that had between President Bill Clinton and the Republicns at the time.
At the same time, both parties' activists come to 2010 as the only prelude to a more transcendental election in 2012.
Since this reality, civilism this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more efforts from both sides to find common points in matters that are still shared.
A United States filtered filtered to Moscow as a paradise of corruption
The city's control is in hands of a "cleptocracy" and leaves a part of the soborns and protector money that had come directly to Kremlin, according to the U.S. Ambassador in Russia in February.
It was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service were handling huge tangent systems, which helps to explain the high cost of life in Moscow.
They recure money not only of legal business but also of organized criminal groups.
Each road from the bureaucracy, which the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "Vertical Authority", takes its part as the money falls on the scale.
The note, sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on Tuesday website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censured.
He was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still the chain of Moscow, and he was guilty of him for a large part of corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev dismissed him in October, but there has been little evidence of cleaning since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who has a major construction company, have systematically rejected corruption accusions over the years, and he has gained several library requests on such accusions.
In September, when in a Russian television channel, they asked you about a documentary that would suggest it was corrupt, he said, "It's a crazy, a patraña, a fastidio."
According to the surveys, Russians believe abrummentally that their society is corrupt.
But it is unlike to find the details explained in detail, since they were in the Ambassaded report, and it is unreasonable that diplomates of a foreign country do so.
"The direct slaves of the city of Moscow with criminality have brought some to call it 'disfunctional', and to claim that the government works more than a clergy than a government," says the note.
" Criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (a term of the criminal world and the mafia which literally means "thecho" or "protection") which is transpaid by the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) and the fiscal office, as well as all sectors of the government of the city of Moscow.
"The analists identified a structure of three levels in the world of Moscow Criminal."
"Luzhkov is on the top."
"SFS, MVD and Military are on the second level."
"Common crimes and corrupt inspectors are finally at the lower level."
"This is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill a empty in some areas, because the city does not provide some services."
The report states that SFS has the money of larger enterprises, and that the police calls on smaller trade.
One source, stated in the report, "explied that the trade duties in Moscow understood that it is best to obtain the protection of MVD and SFS (any of the organized crime groups) because they are not only more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but also protected by law."
"Protection against criminal pandailles is no longer a priority."
The note notes that while the recovery of money is complete, the protection may be irregular; even those who pay are subject to the arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly find their business closed by a pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but he admitted that he has made little progress.
The ambassador's note reports about men taking males, probably full of money in effective, within the same Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medveev must trust in the bureaucratics," said George Satarov, director of the Indian Expert Group in Moscow, in a recent interview.
"But he is a part of this burocracy."
"He does not belong to a political class, because there is no more political class in Russia."
Without the policy, without a opposition, without a separation of powers, it stated that corruption is inevitable.
At the national level, Indem estimates that corruption costs for Russia more than $300 million per year.
In a recent survey on global corruption perceptions carried out by the non-governmental Transparency International, the country was classified in post 154 (the countries are at least corrupted).
The revelation of the U.S. Ambassador, who has not occurred until the night of Moscow, will certainly cause disgusting within the Russian government, and despite Luzhkov can be accusated by the deficiencies of Moscow, it could be an opportunity to argue Cremlin that is solving the problem.
Interviewed for the CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted to a discovery that stated that the American diplomates called it Batman and Medvev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this is related to our interaction, which is an important factor of household policies in this country," said.
"But to be honest with you, we don't suspect that this would have been done with such a angry, with such pressure and, you know, that it would be done so immorally."
Veterans of the Red Jemers obliged to face the past
In a concretely illuminated school, with smooth and discovered walls, the director of the Second School Anlong Veng recorded the man who had built it, the last leader of the Red Jemers Ta Mok.
"There are everybody's safe to Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and worried about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
known as "the Carnicero" for its brutality during the Government of the Red Jewels, the commander remains popular in this remote ex-Rood Jemers in the northwest of Camboya, where he built hospitals, pumps and other infrastructures, and where still thousands of former soldiers of the organization lived.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Jemers retreated to the government, the long-term faithfulness is finally disfellowshipped in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to face publicly those who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a secondary school text book that first teached him the history of the Red Jemers to the children of his former soldiers.
And in July, a United Nations mixed court and Cambodia issued the first sentence of a former member of the Red Jemen, sentenced to the former Chief of the known Tuol Sleng Torture Center, Kaing Khek Iev, who was best known as Duch, to 35 years of prison.
With each of these events, concern has grown between the Veterans of the Red Jemers of Anlong Veng, complicating the efforts for reconciliation and its attempts to reintegre the Cambodian society.
"There's resentment and fear among the former Red Jemers, but they can't do anything," said Chahang Youk, director of the Camboya Documentation Centre, a independent organization that investigates the regime.
"For them, life under the Red Jemers was glorious, but the rule has become a symbol of evil."
"This is generating divisions within the families."
During the Government of the Red Jemers of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, we were executed or died of hunger, disease or work over 1,7 million people.
When the Vietnamites invaded and shooted to the government leading by Pol Pot in 1979, the rest of the regime and their military fled to the border of Camboya with Thailand.
There they started an insurrection that was duration until the last movement was returned in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary directed the war of war from their bases on the mountains and forests of West Camboya, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
However, at the mid-90s, after a peace agreement by the United Nations leaded to the first democratic elections of the country in 1993, the large groups of Red Jewels began to desert to the Government, culminating in the revenues of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died for natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in the nearby Montañas Dangrek.
He died in a prison of Phnom Penh in 2006 while waiting for the process.
Without support of their benefits, the oldest fighters of the Red Jemers slaughtered in the absolute mercy that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel ustalgia by movement.
While some Red Jewels' eleite officials maintained their local administrative positions in changed their weapons, racial soldiers remain the poor and not qualified farmers.
"This people have obtained little benefits after the return," said Sok Leang from the Centre for Justice and Recognition, which offers public forecasts throughout Camboya, including in Anlong Veng.
"They have incorporated the utopic agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They were created without no concept to do business."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who joined the Red Jemers when he was a adolescent in 1974, led in the wild near Anlong Veng before being dedicated to life as a poor farmer in 1998.
"The life with the Red Jemers was good," he said.
"The Mok gave him to eat everyone."
"But now life is hard because we have to autobat us."
The current court of the Red Jemers has also caused concerns here.
At the beginning of the next year, the court is expected to start processing Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Minister of the Red Jewels.
The court ' s mandate is to process the main leaders and those who are more responsible for the crimes, but did not say if he would follow cases other than those four.
This is not so much to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The recent specculation of the media has been focused in Im Chaem, 64 years old, who was a district head in the province of Banteay Meanchey during the Government of the Red Jemers at the end of the 1970s.
In 2007, she told his researchers to the Camboya Documentation Centre that had overlooked the construction of Trapeang Thma charge, a project in which it is thought that thousands of forced workers died.
During a recent afternoon, In Chaem again worked in the fields on wood pilots in a landway way in Anlong Veng's pools.
When the sun rose long shadows about the skin, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Red Jemers.
She stated that if the court would not be submitted by the complainant.
"Camboya is in peace and stable," said.
"If there are more processes, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who was disgusting the Red Jemers in 1978, also warned that there will be instability if the court continues to be more suspected, although the experts and historians ask it.
"Camboya must cover a shoe and smile the past," said.
But face the past is exactly what Cambodia must do to progress, said Chahang Youk, from the documentation center.
"The reconciliation, according to Khmer, is back to join the root pieces," said.
"It's our obligation to meet these root pieces so that we can understand."
The center produced the first text book adopted by the government on the Red Jemers, called "The History of Democratic Kampachea", of 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the secondary school history book of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Red Jemers.
As in the majority of Cambodia, young people from Anlong Veng know little details about the Red Jemers, despite the connection of the city with the regime.
Toque Valeak, 19 years old, said that the new text book helped students to understand a significant part of their history.
But his parents reacted with scepticism when he brought the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the text book and the court," said.
"They have suspects because they are not safe about the number of people who will process the court."
This resistance has made that the reconciliation process is complex and difficult, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the textbook and the court are starting to produce an impact, stated.
In all ways, here the Red Jemers keep a powerful love.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a way with swimming smells and a covered platform tastes leads to a rectangle of black holin covered by a oxided shock of sweet.
The body of Pol Pot was burned here over a lot of neumtics after his death in 1998.
Num Sothea of 31 years of age, a cellular seller on the board of the road, said that he didn't know much about the man he was cremated there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many of the inhabitants of the place come there to pray him," he said.
It was the birthday of Nuom Sothea, and later that day he decided to walk to the place of the last relax of Pol Pot, where he would leave a mature plateau hand with hope of having good luck.
Belarus accepts to reject its uranium reserve for weapons
In a surprising victory for the President Obama's campaign to protect nuclear material throughout the world, the Government of Belarus announced the Sunday that would renumber its high-riched uranium reserve, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The treaty was discovered in a joint statement published after the Minister for Foreign Affairs Hillary Rodham Clinton was meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs Sergei Martynov at the margin of a security summit.
For years, the United States government had tried to convince Belarus that he would reject his uranium highly enriched and seemed that they had arrived to a point without returning the past spring.
But the US officials told you to Washington Post that a couple of operations classified with Belarus in the past two months were carried out to remove 84.82 kg uranium uranium for the arms of a Belarus investigation installation.
This prepared the field for the Monday Agreement to remove the rest of the material, about 227 kg, according to one official, who spoke from the anonymous because of the confidence of the topic.
The agreement seemed to be one of the most important results of the Nuclear Security Summit of 47 nations chaired by Obama in April, excluding Belarus.
And so it was a good achievement to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next Summit in 2012.
"I really felt sweet that they wanted a place in the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
"This demonstrates that this process is working", said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Society, a group that promotes nuclear security.
Clinton said that the agreement is "a very significant and important step" given by Belarus.
In April 2009 Obama promised in Prague to protect all nuclear material in the world in the next four years.
Since then, the United States government has helped six countries to dismiss all its highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A twelve of countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the moment of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, the Belarus President, Alexander Lukashenko, had declared that the nation would never deny its uranium.
"We have preserved the uranium highly enriched ( hundreds of kilograms of what is basically uranium qualified for weapons) and uranium of low enrichment," said Lukashenko at that time.
"This is our matter first... we're not going to manufacture soft bombs, and we're not going to sell them to anyone."
"We use it for research, it's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
The officials said that the first task to remove the uranium of Belarus, in October, was particularly complicated, since the material was slightly radiated.
The officers said that it was loaded in a special train that traveled over 2.000 km to a Russian installation for storage and elimination.
According to the officials, the second operation finished Monday and was held in a flight.
The US Government costed $13 million for tasks, and most of the money was used to provide it to Belarus the installation of uranium low enrichment research, which is not appropriate for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Beneiawski, a employee of the Energy Department who works in the Global Amenaza Reducing, said that "he was coordinated and orchestrated with a very careful care to strengthen confidence" which led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus had at least 40 kilograms of uranium qualified for weapons, as well as hundreds of high-enriched uranium pounds.
Belarus will try to remove its reserve until 2012, according to the joint declaration.
The relationships between Belarus and the United States have been depressed for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's awesome repression of human rights.
But the statement of the Sunday suggested a potential detection.
It was stated that, while the progress in these global security issues was welcomed, the United States and Belarus recognized that more respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue for improving bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens."
The Spanish Government did not put reparations to the CIA flights
The Spanish Government did not repay the CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners with direction to Guantánamo by Spanish territories, as he expressed in a telegram the U.S. Embassy in Madrid.
This reflects the filtered documents (cables) by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, where the first vice-president of the Government, Mary Teresa Fernández de la Vega, requested the Spanish executive to "to demonstrate that they were able to carry out a suitable monitoring on foreign aircrafts that are trailing Spain".
In June 2006, following a report of the Council of Europe in which it was accused of committee in contrary practices to human rights to a twelve countries, including Spain, was held a meeting between the former American Embassy Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The vice-president acknowledged that the Council's report "he had taken place to the Government of Zapatero out of the game" and stressed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De Vega stressed that Spain has no reparations to intellectual flights through Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "dispervented" reports Aguire in a cable.
He also said to the embassy that the Spanish executive "to this matter would give the lowest possible profile, although, in the hand of the judges, the Government had a limited influence capacity."
By its part, in January 2007, the Inspector Vicente González transmitted the Ambassador that he would not try to block the initiative of the judge to request the declaration of documents of the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and of the Department of Defence on the Flights of the CIA.
"This reports do not contain any criminal element or any sensitive information," the U.S.A. explained after talking to the fiscal.
However, the United States reflected their concern for "aparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German fiscals" than for the declarated information of the NIC or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discretely between governments," regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007, in a lunch between the U.S. Ambassador and the Minister of Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, it commented that "if the Spanish judges are rather zealous of their independence and will do what they consider proper," he gave instructions to his collaborators "to avoid comments of retorical inflammade, in an attempt to shine the temperature."
The Ambassador also expresses its concern for the action of the CP in this matter.
"In its pro-American general guideline, our experience suggests that the PP will not question to capitalize any indication that the Government of Zapatero has tolerated or deliberately ignored EU actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the Government of the United States," states.

Populars would win 4 scenes in the Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the towns of Léida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase of votes and deputy experienced in recent autonomy elections, the Catalan PP has the view to generally because it has advanced or not, the perspectives are more positive, since the number of votes that this training has been obtained in these generally doubled to what it receives in the catalans.
Thus, the populations of catalan received 610.473 votes in the overall 2008, while in 2006 autonomy, the number was 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC reached 384.091 votes.
In order to maintain this trend, which has been nutrited of a CFP vote transfer and the fidelization of the PP electorate, analysts of this training have calculated that, if general elections were held, the CPC could pass from 8 to 12 Members in the Congress while the CU would also win four (which has 10) and the CSC would lose nothing less than 9 Members (of 25).
These calculations would be found that the catalan plate is essential for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the people, ERC would lose a deputy - now has three - while the ICV would remain with a Member or would win one.
However, to maintain the electoral calendar, the most immediate quote will be produced in May 2011 with the municipal committees, where the populations can also be decisive in the end of the socialist hegemony in the four province capitals and in their incidence to the deputy of Barcelona, one of the more budgetary administrations - 661 million euros for 2011 -.
As well as popular nationalists, the possibility that the PSC lose the meetings of Barcelona, Tarragona, Leida and Gerona, where socialists would not obtain the majority or possibility of return to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Since the Republican debacle, it would not be clear that this training loses its representation in the Barcellone Consistent – 5 per cent of the votes must be obtained.
The PP has increased its vote numbers in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Leida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they could protagonize the flight in the Tarrakensian capital, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist alcalde, Josep Felix Ballesteros.
In Léida, the PP was only 500 votes from the PSC, whose alcalde, Angel Ross, maintained very good relationships with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, were found in several occasions.
People have also grown in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Cataluña and aims to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
The catalan cell facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaida
Besides the seven detainees in Barcelona, Thailand there were 3
The seven Pakistanians and the Nigerian officials of the Police Information Commissariat in Barcelona formed a historical cell which, directed from Thailand, facilitated passeports to different groups of Al Qaida, including "The Tigres for the Liberation of the Tamil Earth" (LTTE) and "Laskar and Taiwan" (Let), the last author of the Bombay's attacks that caused death to 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Interior has given great importance to these investigations, until the point of ensure that "campai operation" has remained "debilited" the Al Qaida's falsification device at international level, and "as a result of its operational capacity".
The researchers calculate that the cell, in the two years active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were false and then distributed to the groups that integrate the Criminal Galaxie Al Qaida to be able to cross the European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The surprising cell is not the only one that the yihadist network had operated in Europe, so that the investigations have participated in other European police units, in addition to the Thai services, in addition to the Thai police services, so it is not denied that in the EU's territory the next days similar to the development of the night in March in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistans Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Sitikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Batutunde Agunbiade), in Thailand, was developed another with the capture of the Paquisthans Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Syrian Arabian Kijbuming.
These were those who directed from Bangkok the cell in Spain and other European countries.
The catalan network - part of it was shooted in 2009 - was mainly robbered to passport tourists who meet the requirements marked by the "World Islamic World Force".
The documents should be named by men from 25 to 45 years, with a validity of several years and without strike vis.
In the research, no date has been found at the moment to link arrests in Cataluña with Bombay, although the author of this attack, "Laskar and Taiwan," has been one of the groups of shocked passports in Spain and then false in Thailand.
However, it should be reminded that days before this warning was made, from Cataluña were sent through a transfer agency of thousands of dollars that were "inverted" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by the "command" integrants that ended with the life of 106 people.
The police has been insured by a lot of documentation.
The PP requires but is covered by the tax conciert
The leader of the PPC, Alice Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to express it personally to Artur but its conditions to support their investment as President of the Generalitat, identical to those already addressed during the campaign, and that they would be summarised to give priorities to the recovery of the economy and to presum the philosophical adventures, such as the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to propose in the context of its mandate.
The Chairman of the Catalan Peoples heard the meeting of Artur but with the security that he had obtained 18 Members in the elections of the last Sunday, it is more than enough to do, since the candidate of Ciu needs at least one of the training that will exercise the opposition to hold in the investment vote.
A possible intent with the PP depends on the future partnerships that nationalists want to keep in the Congress when general elections are held, but at the time the discussions that these days keep, but with the rest of political leaders are in catalana key.
And with regard to the President of the CP, to support an investment "It's going to cover all sovereign and independent speech", as well as the Economic Concert - similar to the Vasco country - that the Convergent leader intends even to submit referendum.
Both leaders are commonly designed to enhance the political device of a very inflated autonomy administration and to eliminate the tax of events and donations.
The details of the masses investment negotiations will be taken by the PPC, Jord Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But it has already been meeting with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition -, Joan Herrera (ICV) and will do it today with Joan Puigcerkos (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laport (Solidaritat Catalana).
Heritage states that deaths were not by "after of measures"
The officers of the Centre of Olot did not denied that their chairman would kill more than 11 elders
The responsibilities of the heritage La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered yesterday a press rude to emphasize the damage caused to the institution by Joan Vila Dilme, the nurse who was employed there, killed at least once elderly elderly who had been in charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, composed of the reader of the centre, the lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be able to exercise the accused against the deaths" but "the legality and responsibility of us to take the procedural situation of civil responsibilities".
And it is that, in addition to the social depreciation that the entity may suffer because he has not identified the criminal activities of the caster at time, the great threat for the Caritat now covers a substantial compensation that are already calculating the legal representatives of the families of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilme acknowledged that the first crime was retired to August 2009 and that since then has not stopped killing.
The judge already pointed on the car that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - old patients of the heratric - who suspected that in many cases no doctor was able to explore the losses, but that, taking care of the age and pathology of the patients, the telephone transmit was dispatched.
Caritat, through his director, rejected the extremely soon yesterday and pointed out that "the lack of measures could not have been at any time the cause of what happened."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in the case there is no single indication that there has been an imprisoned action by any other person who isn't the same person."
The already baptized as "Angel de la Morte" condemned 11 murders and detailed that the first crime did it on August 29, 2009 to kill a second grandmother.
In this case, the death triggered him by a surdosis of insulin, unlike the first crime that did it by helping the mixture of seated pillars.
The Director of La Caritat points out that it is complicated to control that the centre staff has access to medicines.
Insulin paintings and seat cocktails would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his backs, would be used to facilitate the suffering of internal, to give them death.
But the analysis that are made in the laboratory will be the ones that clear whether Vila was not sworn and seeks a less cruel death for his first victims, or if, on the contrary, he burned them within it, as it has already confessed that he had killed three women between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, it does not give credibility to the manifestations of the caster, nor even to the number of condemned murders, who do not reject that it is higher, and justify their attitude in the various versions that Vila has given in their visits to the judge and in the short sense that it has to change its way to walk after having done, successfully, eight murders.
That is why they say that they are put on the disposal of justice to clarify the range of this event.
The ECB threat
The investors reacted brushly yesterday to the threat of Trichet that warned "the markets should not subsist our reaction capacity".
Peripheral differences have been strongly closed, and the actions of the European banks have increased over 5%.
However, we should not substantiate the ECB's ability to be wrong, and the euro has just pointed out what is a concerning sign.
What has been produced yesterday is own of an illicit market as the slope is recovery but motivated by closing short and very spectacular positions.
The institutional investor will late in losing fear.
A month ago the ECB quoted us today to retire liquidity measures, and it will be to be retracted tomorrow for four times in two years and the remaining ones.
The Federal Bank requested to finish the public debt purchase plan by inefficiency and eliminating all extraordinary liquidity measures and to leave so limited to weekly access.
After the Irish crisis, we expect to extend the current liquidity measures "at least until March" and maintain the quarter substance with limited access to the end of the quarter to ensure the liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that you continue with your purchase program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not comply with the generated expectations will turn the excellent reaction of the markets last and if they are still obliged to remove liquidity measures, that God helps us!
Like at the May meeting they said that they had no goods or predicted the purchase and lost the markets, they could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May the bazuca announced Monday, and the Wednesday said that he had already purchased a lot, causing a new market deployment.
Last night the letter substance to a year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Tesor only issued 500 million to 5,28%, compared to 750 million to 4,81% of the previous substance.
Even in Portugal, 30 basic points falled in the whole curve, reflecting clearly a market feeling change after Trichet's words.
In Ireland, the figures of the Allied and the Bank of Ireland were published.
The estimated figures are about 10,000 million to a short term and 15,000 potential and have up to February to obtain private capital or nationalize.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with stress tests, the figures are excited within the Help Plan and help to reduce incertitude.
However, on March next, the Government will have to get the parliamentary approval of its new budget and has not yet sufficient support, so Ireland is still a focal of incertitude.
Angela Merkel has moderated the ton of his speech to deal with the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on December 14 in which a political commitment is needed to demonstrate that we are an unity and that we all touch the same party.
The problem is that Germany wants to touch Wagner and the rest of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the Chairman had the opportunity to provide the plan of action to take on Friday the Council of Ministers.
Reform of pensions, transparency in autonomy communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privacy, measures to reactivate employment, sound in the ears of investors such as Vivaldi's four stations.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish Bolsa has risen at 4,5%, the double than the rest of the European Bols.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Spain Bank has been rapid and condensed and we have benefited from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key substance of a good to three years that will be benefited by the Trichet effect, so we hope that it will be resolved with strong demand and helped to divide the doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to request a Help Plan would be an auto-inmolation.
We would give us a liquidity line that we don't need, the Tesor has more than 40,000 million in liquidity available the trial than in March, a good types and will close the access to markets without dece.
However, the strategy must continue to be the women of the César, "not to be, it looks like it."
Animal, we can.
The President of Eulen will impede the meeting of Vega Sicilia requested for his children
The time not amazing in the open conflict in the Alvarez family, Eulen's owners and El Year.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will impose, in view of the "null of full right", the courtship of the next January 16, requested by five of its seven children, and in which they will try to make their majority valuation and to be made with the management bodies of the holder of the Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesus David and Maria José are hindering the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their litigation by the control of the group.
The founder of the maintenance of business services to the company does not seem to be prepared to be present in the government bodies of El Janeiro.
His advisory was discovered by five of its seven children who were appointed Administrators at the assembly of shareholders of 18 January of this year and whose impunity is notified in the Mercantil Register.
The judiciary of El Envoy for the next day 16, convocated by the Master of the Mercantil No. 2 of Madrid, has again opened the box of trunes in the area of the Alvarez family.
The court's appeal to establish the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the convocatory of the joint.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Paul, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz, is qualified by David Alvarez as a "desperate resource of the applicants of their five children to, through procedural argument, clearly fraud of law and abuse of law, try to confirm and sanctify the radically null of 18 January," according to its official calls.
This argument will be the basis that, once the joint assembly has been celebrated, it would take its impunity when considering that it is "that is full of right".
The same protagonists, who keep a discreet silence, have already tried to convoke a meeting in June.
In January, the seven children of David Alvarez controlled 100% of the capital in Bodegas Vega Sicilia, including other assets.
However, the founder of the Services Group claims the use of 51 per cent of the capital, according to the family protocols.
This matter is the substantial issue that the judge should decide once the view on the request of impunity, for which there is no date.
Red Bull triunfa in F1 with a secret weapons of Siemens
A software design improvements in real time cars.
Since Red Bull slowed into the World of Formula 1 in 2004, his history in this selection of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into consideration the options of a new school and, despite the falling trayectory from the last time, last November, at the final board of the campaign, all posted by the Ferrari of Ferrando Alonso triumph.
Without prejudice to the ability as a pilot of the finally camp, the German Sebastian Vettel, nor the ability of Renault engine that promoting his car, in the world of the Formula 1 has become the "secrete weapons" that the multinational Siemens has put into the hands of Red Bull to convert it into a winner team.
This is in reality a powerful process simulation software that Germany put on the market in 2007 with a very far away from high automotive competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer instrument has been used to design manufacturer mount chains around the world, energy plants, high precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, simulate faithfully the product or process before building it really, avoiding defects and expenditure.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon's photo cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan’s most famous useful cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for the industrial division of Siemens, explains that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 factor has enabled Red Bull to design and to make effects "in a few hours, almost real time," the changes, changes and improvements that are detected during the carriages and tests.
Russwurm explains that students in 1992 had a average of 10 technicians in their team that were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in vehicles for each time.
In the Red Bull team today, 180 young high-qualification professionals work, which, equipped with powerful computer teams, analyze and project any chance of changes in bolides.
The Siemens guide explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all the elements of the Red Bull bolides, with the exception of the engine, which is from the whole Renault's responsibility.
Materials, fuel, airlines and safety elements are amended.
Changes can be made from the virtual reality of simulator to reality at less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced production systems through high technology laser and high technology autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this technological perfection is the number of $40 million that each form 1 team can pay as maximum for each time to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has mounted the High Technology Fabric to design and produce its bolides in a location of about 50 km from London.
This is two buildings where visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
All that happens there is considered "high secret."
The template for this committee includes 580 people, including their two pilots, the Vettel campion and Mark Webber.
The hero of the Red Bull 1 formula, without doubt, is the recent Sebastian Vetell campaign.
Among the largely technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put to the service of their participation in the circuits, other protagonists whose competition is inestimable and no-notoriality.
The Fabric Technology Chief, Steve Nevey, said that five years ago, could be said that I+D's progress in cars had 50% of the victories and pilots responsible for the rest.
Today, these percentages have varied and technology totally 85% of success, while pilots give 15% of the added value.
Nevey recognises that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by the computer because "that are undeterminable gladiators".
HP will install in two years 20 own shops with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugured last night in Barcelona his first exclusive shop in cooperation are his partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of 20 trade networks between 80 and 100 square meters that multinationals expect to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will combine this initiative with the 16 areas already presented in multimarket centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and The Court of English.
HP Spain's Vice-President, Helena Herrero, set an example of the refined shop in the Great Barcelonese Vía, property of Pont Reyes, who has been working for 30 years.
The North American Group has prepared a plan for 200 brand sales points in Europe in 2013, including 20 Spanish institutions.
The first to open were Bucarest (Rumania) and Belgrado (Serbia) last week, being the third from Barcelona.
Herrero did not want to declare the following openings, although he acknowledged that Madrid could be the next destination.
The Head of Personal Systems also ensured that the shopping philosophy will always be the same, supporting a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and is responsible for the exclusive shopping furniture design (with products that can be touched interactively), which will have an identical image in Europe.
In addition, HP covers the training of establishments personnel.
Helena Herrero refused that it was a Francis system and stressed that the exclusive trade network aims "measuring customer service and pymes in purchase, care, possession, and even packaging".
Barcelona's shop includes a space with a global pioneer program that is responsible for resolving the possible problems of HP computer equipment in guarantee.
A online service connected with a technical center in Maustricht (Netherlands).
"So, in 10 minutes, we can solve problems that may sometimes be late up to two days."
"This system is particularly designed for pymes and users, since large companies have contracted technical assistance services," noted yesterday Helena Herrero.
Sabadell's "robar" a million customers to their rivals in three years
More optimistic than other guidelines, the Delegated Board of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a long year for the bank, but initially discard a new crisis of liquidity and vaccination the end of the passive war.
Nevertheless, it provides a deployment of interest margins which will be tried to compensate in part by committees and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to catch in three years a million special customers, its duty assignment.
Sabadell has found a way to explore the next three years and so can survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will initiate in 2011 a new director plan that will be a three-year-old monitoring.
The objective, in addition to survive without need to return to the public aid of FROB, is to win market share with the caption of a million new customers - 700,000 if they discount those who can get out of the bank, their larger assignment, since until now they had been more than the pymes and companies than the minorist customer.
This year he captured 250,000 private customers and 500,000 companies.
The market share in particular is 3,5%, while in companies over 10%.
Another basis for the 2011-2013 plan is the productivity, or that is the same, of austerity, with the reduction of costs as an objective, and the challenges that the bank will exposure when the results of the year will be presented.
In these days, few banks are engaged in a number of public objectives and objectives since the financial crisis has begun all the plans of the global bank.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year its Optima plan, set four years ago, although it was initially for three, but the market situation has made it wide.
The customers that let them escape the boxes will be their main goal.
In a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 will be a "facile and transcendental year".
In fact, the executive believes that the outcome of the crisis in Spain will be "slow".
In addition, in two or three years, "sweet difficult to create jobs", something essential for the survival of bank business, said.
And although it believes that the passive war - that punishes the margins - is reduced, the price of the risk primes that are paying banks and boxes for their emissions to obtain liquidity are already transferred to the credit price to compensate the fall of the margins.
"The issue of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a factor of credit pressure."
"We have not closed the griff, but the differences are higher," said Guardiola.
Banesto already gave the juvenile orders to its network to limit the long-term credit and undertake the price of differences - see Five Days of 22 and 27 November.
He also acknowledged that the tendency of the bank is now "to go to committees", but "is a competitive framework".
The director plan of Sabadell is based on organic growth, but, as always, the group does not remove corporate operations.
No, it ensures that in Spain "will require larger sizes".
"The year that comes will move everything," she said.
Reaffirms that capital requirements are "softly" and do not reject any Spanish financial entity between red numbers.
He pointed out that the FROB can acquire the market in the fund capture before new recapitulations.
After ensureing that Sabadell can survive in the temporary market closure, it remained important for some Vatican bankers as a new liquidity crisis.
It indicates that it can't be issued, but in contrast to what happened in June, it can be obtained short-term funding through rest, which loves the crisis.
The ECCA discards a second oil of fusion in the boxes
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, discovered yesterday that it was going to produce a oil of shooting boxes and re-ended in the speed with which the sector restructuration is implemented.
When he started the concentration process of the Spanish boxes, there were various entities that ensured that they would not participate in this first stage and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the director-General of the Spanish Confederation Cajas de Ahorros (ECCA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, discovered yesterday that this new oil of operations will be produced.
"I think that the largest part of the fusions has been done, the integration of Cajasol to the Civica Bank group cannot be said that it is a second round, what there are adjustments."
"The majority is completely done; it may be that instead of 17, we go to 13 or 14, but all the great processes have already been done and protected by the Spain Bank, which has also cooperated very much in that", pointed out the guideline.
In statements during a disagreement of the Aragon Guidelines and Executive Association (ADEA), Olavarrieta has expressed that the concentration process is "to the greatest speed possible, and we must be very satisfied of how it will be produced within the periods that it is not now marked in the business plans with the Spanish Bank".
"Over 45 boxes with a average of 28.500 million assets to 17.500 million is a process that does not have a paragon in the history, reduceing the number of entities in a 62% to be much larger to meet Basilea," said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that " there is a number of unfortunate views on the slowness of the process," which demonstrates "a lack of seriousness and sense", because "what the Spanish Bank does is remember that we must be within the period before the end of the year."
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, firmed yesterday that Spain had the most strict financial system of all Europe and "probably" of the world, and assigned to those who put it in the trial screen a "fake of knowledge".
The directive pointed out that, within the current economic countries, "we can be very calm" with the situation of the financial institutions and the rail boxes, a system which has undertaken a "important" concentration process and that "to the best possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish bank was very slowly stopped from stress tests that the ECB realized in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but has established the conditions for the whole Union.
Market pressures have caused a double governance response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has progressed new adjustment measures, from fiscal reductions to pymes, the regulation of private placement agencies or the removal of the 426 euros of help to stop, until the 49% of the AEA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat, and of 30% of the State Lotteries.
Furthermore, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of the ex-president Felipe González, has been urged the critics to the Cancellier Angela Merkel for his responsibility to defeat the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
Before Merkel's position is not a mistake in its communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another turn of tourism in the euro's difficult re-definition process.
And there, Germany has a radically new vision of what should be its future, which shocks to keep the old traditions of a good part of its partners.
In view of European resistances, Germany began to speculate on the three possible results of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by its own, Austria and the Netherlands, between other countries, while the south leaves the monetary area.
The second is the recovery of the framework, although now it seems fictional science, with a very favourable flow of view, is nearly 50% of the population.
Third, a euro reset in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigor, currencies for the transgressors countries, possible suspensions of payments for some of them and the extension of the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so now they do not have apologizes.
First, in 2009, when both the FMI and the European Commission stimulated the deficit, the German Government had a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between the fact that Germany believed that it should be done (Financies and Stabilities Plans in Public Finance), and what they practiced their European partners, including France.
The second in front of this was the central European country when Merkel slowly extended the Greece's salvation decision.
It was already a critical fertility, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public view and public opinion were very against the salvation of Greece.
Finally, in the last October recently, Merkel has a clear position, demanding the reform of the Union treaties, to make it possible for a country to save and, at the same time, to oblig private providers to run in part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as an anti-European, since it has prevented the Irish crisis and all the other.
However, his proposal, although so edulcorated, has been adopted and in the next months, should be attended to the reform process of the Union that could be possible to those measures from 2013.
Germany has brought a red line that doesn't think crossing.
And everyone is saying that, although it is now to take measures with which it may not be very agreed, from that date the euro's old function will have been finished.
2013 will mean the birth of a new currency area, where infractor countries are severely sanctified, can be bound to be declared in payment suspension and, in that case, the private sector will also run in part of the cost.
Germany has noted that we must follow a serious way of growth with high shore and investment rates, consumption moderation, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external sales.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge tangents in payment balance, such as the Spanish growth in the years of the tree, is not just tolerate it.
The invitation is clear.
And we'd do bad in not understanding it.
It is not only to reduce public deficit to 3 per cent in 2013.
What they require is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do in these circumstances is to lie to ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulences make a more tranquility.
And we use the opportunity window they gave us, until spring 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood it as well as its dual exhibition (the promised reforms after the Sunday's meeting with the large businesses and the announcement of new measures) suggested that, despite the critics in Merkel, the thesis that there must be a house order.
But the red line that Germany has brought there is, and it doesn't seem to be moved.
And, among the possibilities that are considered, it cannot be excluded.
So, Germany can always tell us that he had warned us.
Legislative sport and fraud
Treasures like the Alonso and Ramos before the Ajax demonstrate engineer but not want to escape a sanction.
The presumably urged two players of the Real Madrid Real (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the negotiated party on 23 November against Ajax at the Campeon League has caused to write tint rivers about whether such a conduct is or not anti-sport and if, where appropriate, both players should be sanctified by the EUFA.
As you know well, in the absence of a few minutes to end the game (which your team had clearly winned), the two players slowly lost time at the time to get out of the missing feelings to cause the album to show them the second card.
In this way, and as the Real Madrid will already end as a leader of his group, both players will comply with regulatory sanctions the next linguy party, against the Auxerre, and they can pass card cleans to the next stage.
Finally, the EUFA Disciplinary Committee has sanctified two parties to the team trainer, José Mourinho, and with different economic quantities to the players involved.
The provocation of an amazing card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but more frequent in the fútbol world.
It is so extensive that is part of the echos, of the non-Scritical rules, but below, of this sport.
The part of the debate occurred in the reported case should be protagonized by a team of the Real Madrid entity (which is presuming nobleness and honour, and in the past time has been multiplied to its players by similar acts) and the orchestrated dramatization, the opinion, by Mourinho, who adds more episode to its diligent history of historic and provocator technology.
In any case, the debate turns around whether this type of conduct does not expressly prohibit the principles of sports, i.e., if such actions do with law fraud; therefore, they are indeed respectful actions with the sporting regulation, but they seem to have a sense.
The question is to consider the type of damage caused by the sports spirit.
One of the goods that understands the sports spirit is the physical integrity of the other players, aspect that with these actions is not put in danger, i.e., there was no violent game.
Another of those goods to whose clean game is to avoid the team of infractor players being used injustly from the other team, what was not happening.
However, the paradoxical action of the Real Madrid players is that it was not aware of what we normally characterize as a trap or fraud of law, because their violation of the rules was not hidden to try to avoid sanction, but it was exactly the most clear thing to receive the punishment of the arbitrator.
They expected and accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders have been obtained in the intentional deficiencies.
Here it seems to be necessary to note that it is not put in a striking situation, nor benefits in the same party, because of course the result of the action is to leave the own team with less players.
And it is not a useful strategy for the next party, because the club can't contain these players.
The advantage of players will, of course, start the next stage of the Championship Liga without cards that may threaten their participation in a future party.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, because the equipment can be removed to the first changes, and in addition with this action, players comply with a sanction party and pass to the second cycle of cards, where the suspension by cumulation of cards is produced with a less than in the first cycle.
So, to go around, it's not so clear that it's a advantage.
Finally, these actions do not oppose the sporting spirit, which is part of taking strategic decisions that promote the best benefit of what they allow the rules.
In the case of us, the players did not act in order to avoid the application of sanctions (that would be a clear case of law fraud), but were better chosen when they were subject to it.
They took a strategic decision without punishing the punishment or going away from the same.
Although the border between the engine and the fraud of law is difficult, in this case I think it was a clear Engineering case.
Politeics, I think, emerges by two factors: because it was two self-expulsions and how the transmission of the directive to cause them.
The damage caused by the principles of sport for these actions is not both ethical and ethical.
Official offers to catch group shipment scenes in NCB
The calendar dictatorship focuses on the reserves for 16 and 17 days this year.
Proliferation of self-supplements by employees, which want to pay between 20 and 30 euros.
As the tour and lottery, with the arrival of December, they also return to the grouping scenes before Christmas, which continue to exercise oxygen ballon for reconstruction and ocean of Barcelona, but that because of the crisis, they have displaced in an inadequate prices to be able to capture the mayor client: almost everybody wants to cost between 20 and 30 euros in cemetery or eating, they agree to entrepreneurs and associations of the interviewed sector.
To completely complicate accountability, the calendar of this year (the falling Wednesday) has focused on requests in the week of 13 December, with the result until the date of a dinner reserve for days (16 and 17) and only movement for the previous week.
As has happened since 2008, when the flash vacation stage began, many companies have removed the collective dinners for budgetary matter.
In order to avoid the tradition, many workers keep it paying from their own bottle.
Whatever the coyuntura, ones and others require battle prices, it confirms the President of the Gremi de Restauracio de Barcelona, Gaiity Farràs.
The representative of the patron, on the day of today, is not inclined to vaticanize how to be the feasts of this month.
"The people think it's much before booking."
"You want to get out, but you have the warnings in the prices theme," points.
The business will be well "to those who give good quality to good price and with good service," adds, and remembers that customers want to slow a scale with the crisis, so that the franchise around 25 euros has become a majority of the demand.
In a survey in various central institutions, the fall of requests was observed for the night of 17.
The Soteras Group indicates that there is a true boom of applications for that Wednesday, with the intention of expending less than 30 euros, which have responded to adjusting its menus to the countura, with full forms from 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 buildings in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Funda and others), the calendar's peculiarity has made more pre-reserve, even since the beginning of November.
"We made it impossible to keep the same prices in the past year, with menu for all costs from 19.95 to 30 euros," details.
In AN Group, which is abandoned from El Mussol, Attic, Ququ, and to a total of 23 locals, optimums are maintained after detecting an increase of the facturation from the second half and a good, even concentrated, business perspectives for Christmas.
The sources of the group highlight that 18 will also be a hyperactive day at the level of friends groups preceding the partys.
The six group menus have added a shipment with 30 euros or more as a Star Budget and the perception that it is predicted to cost 10 per cent more than the last year in change to require more details, such as cable.
They also see green browns in some enterprises that return to invite their employees and feel that the volume of groups is something greater.
By the Facasarm patron (including institutions such as the Bars Association, Restaurants and Ocio de Barcelona), its vice-president Enric Gomá, trusted in starting see the end of the tunnel and claims that the reservations are "animated" together, although the customers "negociated to the maximum".
Yes, the illusion for the party has not fallen, pays who pays, indicates.
Pakistan's nuclear programme generates great concern in the EU
Islamabad produces atomic weapons to "approximately rhythm than any other country".
Wikileaks filters confirm links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department filtered by the Wikileaks port confirms the great concerns caused by Pakistan's nuclear programme in Washington.
On the basis of the details of the clauses and games offering the content of the discussions and thoughts of the nord-American diplomatic representatives believed in Islamabad, the documents show that cooperation between both countries in the field of atomic security instead of going to grow, "decree", and that the instmething Asian country produces nuclear weapons "a faster ritme than any other country in the world".
The particularity of Pakistan's nuclear programme - that weapons are not assembled, but still stolen by components to defeat their destruction in case of attack - is one of the main reasons for development in Washington.
This lists the embassy in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before visiting the National Security Council, James Jones: "The nearness of some nuclear installations on the territory under the Taliban attack, the smiling dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is contemplated, not only by the United States, but also by Russia as proliferant and reason for guarding.
"Pakistan has had to contract personally with strict religious believers to protect nuclear installations; given the fall of educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunity to recall people working in nuclear or mixed programmes," said the experts Yuri Korolev, the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, at a meeting with their American monkeys.
The newest documentation filtered by the port of Julian Assange is the increasingly smaller cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in nuclear proliferation issues and the high Pakistani rhythm of nuclear weapons production.
A post of the embassy in May, who qualifys the communication with Pakistan, states: "The transparency is often inexistent; the aid offers remain without answer or are discarded."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a official of the National Intelligence for South Asia, notes that "in spite of the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons to a ritmo more rapid than any other country in the world."
The Ambassador Patterson also requests Washington, during a visit from the army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, to let "so clear" to the responsible who said "the Pakistanian army must end with the tactic support for terrorist groups".
To the caza of the Chief of Wikileaks
Obama names a high responsibility for the anti-terrorism fight to avoid new filters.
Interpol issues a red warning in order to follow the movements and find Assange where he is.
All related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complex laberinto where it is difficult to make sure about the facts.
Last night, Interpol issued a red warning to "locate and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, it is not a traditional arrest order.
Furthermore, it is not new, but date of 20 November.
And it must not be considered with the last filter of more than a million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accusions of sexual abuse that Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, ensures that "the police knows where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
It was the 20th day when the international police body was sistered in Lyon (France) said the order to Sweden's request, but he did not reveal it until yesterday, after receiving authorisation from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 Interpol countries have indications to identify or locate Assange "in view of their provisional and extradition arrest."
While the Interpol cannot order the arrest of a red warning person, many of the Member States, as explained by the organization, are considered the called network notes free to carry out a arrest -- which must accompany the national police body – especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, such as the case of Sweden and England, where it is believed that Assange is.
The movement was inflicted by the lawyers of Assange, who published a letter last, claiming that the Wikileaks founder of 39 years of age has been prepared to respond by videoconference to the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the fiscal case, comparing with the Mitic Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's security chief.
"This seems to be a castle, not a legal persecution," says the mix.
While the world seeks it - and from Australia his mother defends the innocence of his son -- Assange remains in unknown stop, but not called.
The Monday gave a interview to the director of the magazine Time through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the department of the United States State Secretariat, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that it was responsible for ordering US diplomates who are spotting in the United Nations by violating international treaties which the United States has signed, it should be dimitted," said.
His opinion was banned yesterday by the Press secretariat of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who qualified "ridical and absurde" the request of division.
"I'm not sure why we should importate the opinion of a type with a web page," said the CNN chain.
Obama himself has been responsible for the antiterrorist fight, Rusell Travers, to prevent new documents fleet.
The intention of President Barack Obama to remain important to Assange contrasts with the views that these days proclaim political and conservatory comments.
Peter King, the congressist who will preside from January to the National Security Committee in the low room, requested the Department of State to examine the possibility of include Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to interfere and funds and to continue to any of them with any contribution or assistance".
Moreover, Tom Flanagan, an adviser of Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to turn back after saying that Assange should "slaughter".
"Obama should make it goal and use a non-floored aircraft or something."
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist Minister, Arkansas' Expeditor and possible candidate to the presidency.
"Whoever is in the Government who filters the information is a tragic fault and anything that is not the execution would be a too pleasant punishment," says in the Fox chain.
Puigcerkos search for peace in ERC with guiding to Carod
The Republic ' s leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcerkos seems to have found the receipt to complete the internal revual in the ERC lines, without the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The Chairman of the party is conscient of his dismissing mask is insufficient for the purposes of exercising Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is now so diluted than his own mentor and that it is absolutely possible to cause the headbreakers that had with other extinct flows.
The left leader will therefore try to win the new critics with rings that allow him to blind up to municipal elections.
To begin, Puigcerkos announced yesterday that the more than 200 national ERC advisers could speak about their continuity in secret.
It's through papers, and not on the hand up.
If the carodists want a certain punishment vote to the President, they can do it without fear of reprise.
In fact, the head of rows wants to avoid the division image as well as the subjection to your person.
In several interviews, he stated that it would not be considered ratified with half of the votes, but added, without needing percentages, that it would not be good as a result "to the Bulgarian".
The next Carod requires the President something more than put his duty to warranty, a rule that is not valuable when Puigcercus controls the maximum organ between conventions.
But when you don't have enough most to force divisions, you will try to agree with the executive a road sheet from here to May.
To that end, they are expected to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that the direction will submit to the vote of the national Council on 18th.
Its intention is to swallow Puigcercus in turn that it promises to extend the September 2011 Congress, something that the copper already gives.
The leader of ERC acknowledged that "polyfony" harms the stability and that its goal is to make that the organization is able to switch the doors towards inside.
In this line, the article that the conseller in functions Josep Huguet stated in his blog.
Bearing in mind the ideologist of Puigcerkos, the holder of the Innovation was given for the fact that the leader will be reflected "a change of various objectives".
And he took five, of which they highlight two.
First, "recommendate" the executive to represent at least 90% of military war, i.e., include new traits from the Afganistan sector in Carod.
The second may be the big news.
Huguet proposes to liquid ERC once the assembly as a functional mechanism.
He therefore proposes a reform of the status that allows the conventions to celebrate through delegates elected by sufragio.
Finally with the assembly model, one exception in the Spanish games system, has been an obsession of the Puigcerkos team, which has already struggled in this regard in the two last congress.
Indeed, the convulsium of 2008 left the load to review the assembly in a specific Status Reform Congress.
This quote continues to continue, since the internal merry in the last few years was conviction to address the matter.
Now, without the critical sectors in the oil, it may be a good time to retook it and try to close it forever.

Maintenance of China objectives to reduce winter gases
The representative of that country in the COP16 ensured that its country had made huge efforts to reduce the carbon skin and detailed that it supported its offer to reduce 40 to 45 per cent of its greenhouse gas emissions in winter.
China maintains its offer to reduce 40 to 45 per cent of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, assured its Wei, representative of that country in the COP16.
In its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), its Wei ensured that its country had made huge efforts to reduce the carbon shoes and to convert to its industry.
In fact, in the past four years, her country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce the emission of winter gases.
However, it was clear that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community in this regard.
He pointed out that the Chinese climate change strategy was divided into four sections: dialogue; capacity construction; institutional construction and pilot support.
All these rubbers have been made progress, including the adoption, last year of a new Energy Law, which collects the objectives proposed for the reduction of gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, the federal authorities have been coordinated with states and local authorities in order to achieve energy slower goals, efficiency energy use and emission reduction.
Furthermore, they have been undertaken or already concluded several multiannual plans, both financed by the Chinese government and by governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned that the United Nations (United Nations), Government and private initiative effective energy use programme was implemented during the past five years and received investments from the United Nations.
A provincial climate change project is also undertaken, another for the change of incanded focus by shockers and one more mixing and adjustment, has detailed.
In the same table, Martin Krol, scientific counsel from the Government of that country on climate change, ensured that China's efforts have been greater than those who are generally considered.
For instance, the emission per captain of winter gases in China is of six tons per person, while in the United States 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution to the contamination.
He has also made unforeseen efforts in energy use, as 20 percent the energy efficiency in the past five years has increased, and it was expected to do more up to 2020.
Appealed to Legal Exilation of Spino: César Nava
The National Director of the PAN declared that the former panist leader is in his right to join the National Order Commission to claim what its right agrees.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vazquez, ensured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barientos was appealed to legality and that the former panist leader is in his right to advise the National Order Commission to claim what its right agrees.
In an interview before the protest taken by Gabino Cué Monteagudo as the ruler of the state, he said, in any case, that Espino's expulsion is a decision adopted on the local area.
"This is an autonome decision of the Sonra Order Commission."
" Mr. Espino has his right to ask, in its case, to the Commission of Order of the National Council, so that it is a decision taken in the field of a competent body," noted.
On the other hand, he stated that it was not time to think in 2012 and that I had never been in the negotiation table an alliance for the presidency candidate.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that national action will be strengthened from the internal election of the next 4 and 5 December, where its successor will be elected.
"This (a alliance in 2012) is a theme that never was in the negotiation table, at least not at least now, was a approach to the local election that was successful and achieved the goal," said.
The panist leader needed that the PAN supported it for 71 years of dialogue, so "not fears the internal competition; the account "we enjoy and strengthened it," acknowledged.
He said that the advice will, without doubt, be able to choose the best or best leader to require national action for the next three years, where he will provide the staff "to whom the Council determines".
"I have that absolute silence and open open, any of the five would be proud to give you the office of the President of the party."
He pronounced that the representative registered the party in the past elections of 4 July will be reflected in the following contents, although "that's still not a time to think in 2012".
"Together it is to join the Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments employed from alliances in Oaxaca, Publa and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observing throughout the country, so that "more hopes, angels are placed in them, and I am sure that Gabino will be at the height of expectations".
On the question of the PRI critics to President Felipe Calderon for his speech within the four years of his government, César Nava called the prisoners to reflect the sex of the former President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the Governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than the Fox and Calderon; they began to defend them; that goes out of the clause," he stated.
He believed that the holder of the Federal Executive may express, such as those who did in his speech in the National Auditor, because there is no censure in the country.
Promote Obama on Twitter reads for undocumented students
"If you agree that to adopt the Dream Act is the appropriate, call your senators and urge them to adopt legislation," tweeted the President of the United States in the social network.
President Barack Obama was summoned today to national mobilization in support of the Dream Act Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal account of the Twitter social network.
"If you agree that to adopt the Dream Act is the appropriate, you call your senators and urge them to adopt legislation," tweeted Obama.
His short message maintains an cybernetic link with a broader document requesting the public to communicate immediately with the senators, since the vote of legislation is imminent.
" With a voice that is expected soon, now is the time to make your voice listens," says.
The message was released after 42 representatives threatened to block the vote of any legislation, unless the extension of the Bush Taxes and the financing of the Government was approved.
This block, announced in a letter signed by the 42 representatives of the Republic, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START Treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
As questioned by the Republicn block to the Dream Act and other projects, the presidential portfolio Robert Gibbs trusted that once the fiscal issue was resolved, a calendar can be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think there's a long time."
"We all match that we have to solve the fiscal matter before the end of the year..."
"I think we can reach an agreement at some time and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," said.
The leader of the most senate democratic majority, Harry Reid, announced the march that he would ask for a "debating vote" for the Dream Act Act, which thus the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted from the next Thursday in the Senate, although it is most likely the next week.
The senatoral version of the Dream Act or the American Suege would legalize some 8000,000 young people who entered in the United States before 16 years of age, have remained in the country for the past five years and entered into a higher education institution or army.
But the parties require 60 votes to approve the initiative, which requires the competition of a Republican pugnad, at the time that partial organizations of the project protagonize a intense scope to ensure the approval of the law.
Democrats, most of which supports the Dream Act, have 58 scans.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson de Nebraska, said that he will vote against, and only a Republican has expressed its support for the law, Richard Lugar de Indiana.
Thus, the Dream Act partys require a number of Republicans to be summarized if other democratics decide to make the initiative wide.
Among the most shocked Republicans are the Senators of Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux of Florida who completed the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch, of Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson in Texas, but have declared that they will not support it again.
Another Republic who supported, John McCain, has not defined its posture at this time.
Although the Representative Chamber has a different version, analists agree that the Dream Act faces the largest obstacles in the Senate.
With literature the finger in the ring
The second tour of the language funerals was a step in which the participants made the gala of the narration
"It's the sex in the language I understand, but... Is the dedo in the ring? What is waiting for me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela inviting to open the second round of the funerals of the language, cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish, and that this occasion used the subtitle of his question (in another feast the redonda table was given to the sex in the language, explained).
The dedo in the language... "Please us in apprehensions", sweetly spent the argentin writer to the public, mostly youth, which was quoted in the International Fear of the Guadalajara Book (FIL) to listen to this moderate table rounded by Marisol Shultz and where they participated in Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela readed a text that gave to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would then define as a great account, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist that is looking for knowing what is the "langa", goes from a doctor, who do not get answers even though they are on the same narrative ice.
The infectologist is convinced: "The patient is not my strong, maybe it's my ring."
Finally, after a frustrated approach to the traumatolog that has stolen the alert in half the pastle, but who discovered it is not a scientific term; it is the psycho-analist who reveals the mystery: "The llaga is the real open, the symbolic is the cycatriz".
The protagonist suffered allied and concluded "of the ring only when he knows that it is the real open and that there is no existence," but he convinced that the funerals and the tramps of the language should go very widespread.
Valenzue her, the writer, joined both.
Nicaraguense Sergio Ramírez also exhibited a delegy narration that referred to Elogio of the Invention, where the fingers in the ring are not called but at a time are discovered.
With magic realism pincels, the account of a famosa famosa, which touched the same clouds, brought back to men who had been far away or reparated the attributes that had lost a sleeve, narration that came to speak later America, the great news that did not miss him from the beginning of their own cronists who counted it and quoted to Bernal Diaz del Castillo who criticized the exceedances of this account by the conquistators.
"Cervaants who invented us to all (the writers) made a bunch of the fingered Witnesses appearing in the stories presented as real, but in another way, they would never have come to tell the history of America with imagination to which she missed him until the potential."
He highlighted, however, "It's the luxury and the embusters who think best" and it is where it converts reality and lie, where it is no longer known that it belongs to a band or another, where the fiction literature reaches its apogeon.
He's actually called the "cervantine tradition".
"For your heritage, we are what it is understood."
At its turn, writer Mayra Montero took and applaudied the variety of interpretations to the invitation of the FIL with its round table The door in the ring.
Cuban-Purricans pointed out the great language of social violence that has traced its country - and shares Latin-American-Product of trafficking and drug sales.
"I think that the good literature, the good poety, the good songs will enclose a taxi compromise that is obviously not predicted," said, after citating the reality of literature, it is the communication and dimension of the commitment between authors and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of this last.
In the night the Spanish poet Luis García Montero closed the Spanish poet, whose intervention also emphasized "of that finger in the language of the scriber compromised".
He considered that in a world who lives on the slow, also in the intellectual costs and in control of the consciences that go into dogmatics, forgetting "what behind each statement there is a small none and behind each refusal there is a small one."
"To be debtors of our thinking and to be debtors of the reality, we need to die: and mature often means put the deed into the ring and smiling those who are much more comfortable thinking of loading, white and black, in established ideas, without mourning, and tormenting also the powers that prefer a world in white and black," said, inviting to recover the sense of writing.
Roman is on his first title
Ruben Omar Romano accounts with three finished snakes, he had shocked in his cart, but he has already been able to reach the decisive series in three times.
With the dule of Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end, there are also two different styles marked by its technicians, who are among themselves with a contrast marked by the results.
Ruben Omar Romano has counted with three finished strikes, he had shocked in his car, but he has already been able to reach the decisive series in three times, although even now it has been white and this is why this occasion is very special for him.
The argentine has finished console with the medaille of the subcampe, a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team has played consecutive finals.
The sanctuary stretch came to his first end as a trainer in the Open Tower 2002, when he took the Morlia's ends, with which the 4-2 before Toluca falled globally; then, in the 2003 Clausura also came to a decisive duty and also lost it with 3-1 globally and was precisely before Rayados.
It was already with Santos Laguna, in the Bicentenary Tornee 2010, once again before the Devils, Rubén has suffered a revenge, since his team ended 2-2 before the shoes after 210 minutes of game, but in the skin of criminality was put into advantage by 3-1 with two opportunities to sell the title for his three players finally falling from 11 steps and suffered the 4-3 tour.
Rubén has already lost two finishs with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, so he doesn't want to run the same luck, seek to get out of the wickedness and to celebrate a title for the first time, although he says the most important thing for him is the institution.
"I want to get out of the camp, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for a affection to which I have to do, and so will come the title for me, but the previous is the most important," commented the timonal when it was questioned about the numbers that he has in contrary to play ends.
Very viable has the previous end, of which it guarantees, has learned very much, "The only teaching we can have is that until the silver arbitre can't celebrate, we are prepared on the gate, the players also, for once before, with two criminals to take it already, we're prepared to get out and I think that this is a teaching, until we can celebrate the party."
Knowing that this series could be defined in criminal tireds, something which does not worried him, because it trusts in its players: "At ever seek to reach the punishment, one seeks to end in regular time, but sometimes there is no need to be prepared, in the previous tour we were prepared, unfortunately made us a bad game of destination, sometimes by nervouss or anxiety to have the title in the hands, but it went to us, that left us something to this end that we would not expect to reach this instance."
Romano has in his hands to stop being a sub-camping technical and to try for the first time the glory that gives the titles.

NASA will announce foreign life
The US Space Agency quoted the press to present tomorrow a finding that will affect the search for living in space.
The National Administration for Aeronautics and Space (NASA) of the United States will bring to know tomorrow, Thursday, a astronomical discovery, which could prove the theory that there is foreign life.
The finding will be presented in a press route on Thursday at 13:00 p.m. in NASA's headquarters at Washington by astrobiology experts, science described as the task to study the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the universe.
In quoting the press, NASA assured that it would present "a finding that will cause an impact on the search for for extraterrestreat life", which caused speculations of experts from other countries.
The discovery could show the theory of existing creatures by our and in hostile environments that were thought inhabitable, and in the table they would consider the possibility that they become intelligent as humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
It seems to be a microbiology found at the fund of the Mono Lake at the Yosemite National Park in California, where it lives in a environment that was thought to be too vulnerable for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
In some way, the creature uses arsenics as a way to survive and of this capacity increases the possibility that similar life may exist in other planets, which do not have our well-being atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these bodies use arsenics in their metabolism, it will be demonstrated that "Yes there is another form of life, a second way of life, different from what we know."
The Space Agency will know the real range of findings at the Sunday Press Conference.
The conference will participate in the geology Pamela Conrad, who studied the possibility of life in March; and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studied Titan (the biggest moon of Saturno), is in the perspective that its chemical is similar to the earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and Opposer Pattern
With reforms to the Organic Law of the Congress, instead of ‘bipartism’, they declare.
The 60 legislation was not installed when in the Congress there was an opposite block, headed by the members of the PT, Convergence and Jesus Manual Patron Montalvo, who declared an independent statement, and the four question were: the arrival of 'bipartidism' to the House.

Corvera Quevedo, detailed that with these institutional reforms the political marginality of the PRI and PAN.
He declared that in the next days they will talk to the representatives of the PAN and PRI to change the scheme, starting out of a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be shocked again by both parties and the opposite coalition was concluded.
"Here it came (the opposite coalition), it is what I see, because we are excluded, from any decision, not even have the political defence to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergence, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patron, there are coincidences and therefore are compliance with a multilateral group.
It cannot be allowed, continued, that the Congress after being monopolic, now being "doopical".
"The spirit is not the spirit to reform the law that has everlasting bipatitism in the Congress."
To begin, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are talking with other partners and partners to be more, the convergent enlarged.
Hezekiel Reynoso Sparza, from the PT, explained that the Congress now became a 'boot' between two, in the allusion to the PAN and PRI.
"Before he was just a party, now they're sharing it between two."
Pattern Montalvo, asked to respect the personality of the deputy, to be given its place in the negotiations tables.
"It is not for quarters agreements, it is possible that we are going to make 9 Members, listening to the five that we see, separated in different fractions, we have decided to unify us to find a place in the negotiation table, which is the subject that in the reform which they made them agreed, we are out and we are not agreed with that reform."

Urgent to attract tourist sites
They regret to tourists' accidents of the foreign tourists for misunderstanding conditions of the Gloria Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlan.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a hunger of the Gloria Sánchez Taboada, the tourism sector Mazatlan asked the authorities to take attention to the areas and sites that are in bad state and design a bad picture of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, Chairman of the Dorada Zona Trader Association, recalled that, in various cases, they claimed that the image of the destination was careful and that the bad thing that tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said the bad state of the streets and banks has affected because tourists come to pass and see the desordem and get back to the nearby business.
"Politicals don't know what it is to close one day a company and have no idea of dinner that is lost, or instead they would not do works in such a way and without the appropriate planning."
The hotel José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the Auditor.
"The municipality will have to take its responsibility and avoid passing again, how to do so I give preventive maintenance and not only fall in the correction," said.
"We are desirable to enjoy a clean city, because not only because of being a tourist area, it must be given the maintenance, but as a people who are worth a clean site to live, and the Howard must change their strategy to keep well the city."
There are other sites that also light disgusting and incomplete, said, such as the Scudo and the Venate of Mazatlan.
"How, to come to the tourist not only depends on the promotion, it must have a good product, a city that has cleanness in its beaches, in its adventures, permanent maintenance in what are the tourist attractives," said.
"The decisive attention has not been given, and this kind of facts makes evidence of something that is novel for everyone, the maintenance does not need."
Raúl Llera Martinez, the Subsecretary of Tourism Promotion, expressed that it was urgent to save Mazatlan’s tourism sites because they are not used in a proper manner and design a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that should be online with the municipality and be priority to have the city on the day, clean, ordered and to be attracted because it is of tourist vocation.
"Happy Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural sites and places that will have to be ordered first, clean and put online to attractive works to make them sweet in the inventary we have to promote the destination."
Request IP results to the Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that Members have the great responsibility to be an example of a better Sinaloa for the various challenges faced.
A dignity and free work legislation between parties and the State Executive claims the business sector of Mazatlan, because there is a convulsionate Sinaloa that faces major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60 legislation, integrated by seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of Convergence and one of the PVEM, which is totally 40 popular representatives.
Among the list of expectations for the new integrators of the State Congress is that they are being conducted by a clean and commitment management with society and with the various sectors that require a responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of partiism or patriarchism are not repeated.
Educator Davalos Zamora, Chairman of the Business Coordinator Council, proposed that the recent 40 deputy members of the State Congress have the great responsibility to be an example of a better Sinaloa for the various challenges faced.
"We hope that Members really exercise their right, free of agreements between parties, because they are habitually doing arrangements to ensure their own interests and become carnaval comparisons of governments and the leaders of the parliamentary fractions."
Thus he spoke that they were certified the engagement to establish the necessary points to go forward to the Governor in turn.
"We are awaiting that they will come to a dignified work and, above all, compromised with society and sectors because they were the synagogueers who gave them the vote of trust in the past elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, President of the Hotels Tres Islands Association, considered that one of the great challenges of the 40 popular representatives was to empower and summon forces in search of the economic growth of the state, as today the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important is that they emphasize economic growth, which generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that will somewhat promote the generation of jobs."
As regards tourism activities, he asked that new legislators give him the weight that he reviewed within the State budget to strengthen the State Tourism Secretariat.
"I have understood that it is the second Secretariat in the state of a lower budget and it is incompliant as an important economic and generator of divisions and investments, and that is directly tasked with the agriculture industry."
In addition to the need for resources to be marked to decent tourist projects and to coad that they are safe to the state and to update the Alcohol Act that have not been able to resolve in previous legislation.
You're looking for a magic king
Munichs, cars and bikes, among other games, are the angel of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of kings will be difficult to enjoy their illusions, since their home is complied with nothing more and nothing less than 12 people and a chick.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, Mary Guadalupe, Isaias, José Juan and Miguel do not lose the hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar give them the games and the clothing they want.
The family lives a humble house of the Salvador Columbia and lives on the day because the father has no fixed job.
"And sometimes we see it hard because my husband does not have a chamboo, but we sell mandarine and pope... I'm already out in the evening with the 'plebes' to sell in the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little.
Adelaida, of 4 years old, wants a munch or a bicycle, while his sister Isabel, 3 years old, would like a barbie munch.
For his part, José Alfredo, a 10-year-old-old, has been striking to have a 'monster' car and his sister Jesus, of eight months of age, to suggest such clothes for a year.
"He said to me (Josea Alfredo), 'I would like this monster', but I said to him, 'I'm seeing a son', 'for I was very sweet," he remembered with the Citemana.
For the older children, who were in school, clothing and calmed, would be the ideal.
Mary Guadalupe, of 11 years old, is the 12th age; Isaiah, of 10 years old, is 10, while Miguel, 8 years old, uses eight.
Joseph Juan, 14 years old, misses his tennis, so a couple of such five or half six would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dream of children of the family Coronado Valenzuela can participate in the campaign If search for a King Mago, giveing a game or effective in the Reception of Northwest.
Catorty detented drug traffickers
Thursday, in Estonia, a decade of persecution was held in the context of the dismantling of a production network and sale of Cannabis.
They have been arrested by 14 persons who will face various accusedness.
Persecutions have been produced in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly where drug production was carried out.
"Around 750 plants of Cannabis, four kilos of hache, money and equipment for production", says Louis-Philippe Ruel, portrait of Quebec Security.
Overall, nine men and three women, including two network leaders, were arrested by Sherbrooke two men.
The detentors had to compare in the Sherbrooke's justice palace in the following hours to their detention.
Cannabis's production accusions, ownership of the purpose of trafficking, compliment and service robbery, could be faced.
These persecutions have been produced after a long investigation that has been longed for about one year.
"The information provided by the public has been given to us in detention," says Mr. Ruel.
In this police operation, about seventy agents of the Quebec Security Security Security Module, Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphremagog police Department participated.
It can be fighting against clandestine migration without problems
The draft legislation of conservators that, according to the Government, should solve the problem of loaded paternes of clanian migrants, which will certainly be faced with a great opposition, since the three opposition partys have announced Mondays that could not support it.
"I think I'm mainly in the Charter."
"I meet me here with a party which has created the granito you're swimming," the Liberal Leader Michael Ignatiff, who was around the deputy after the weekly meeting of the chakers.
Liberians claim that the draft law in their current form, which would allow to hold up until one year to any person who is proven from a identification ship as a transport of Clanian immigrants, is infringing the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom.
The leader of the Quebec Block, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the law project because he pointed out the wrong white.
"We are opposed to and, as it seems, all the opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the Government does," said Mr. Duceppe.
The NPD's criticism on immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected the critics that indicate that its party is not sufficiently strong with the clanian immigrants.
"Neodemocratics agree that measures are taken against the parents of C-35, and that is what we propose with another law draft, Mrs Chow.
“We do not support the conservator's law because it attacks refugees and incarceres children for at least one year," explains Ms. Chow.
The Minister of Immigration, Jason Kenney, has accused the parties of the position to play politically and to be opposed to the will of Canadians.
"The large majority of Canadians say to Members that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations against Canada and treat the country as if they are a felpud."
"If you hope that Canada takes strong measures", says Minister Kenney.
The Government has not announced a vote of confidence on its draft law, which could bring to the country some elections as a result of their rejection.
However, a conservator has informed the QMI Agency that the Government would request a vote to ensure that each deputy who is going to oppose will be explained later before its electors.
The new unit does not achieve unilaterality
Despite the possible establishment of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collapse by Jean Charest, many observers continue to ask for the establishment of a public consultation commission on the subject.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea has not been addressed two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the Department of Investigation of New York since January of the last year.
Metropolis has a permanent unit against corruption since 1870.
Thus, the announcement of the march has shooted by surprise to more than one.
It should be said that, during a permanent Council meeting on the police services of Quebec held on 29 October last, this measure was never discussed, despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough to make the criticism of the Quebequent party addressing the issue of public security, Stephane Bergeron, qualify this advertising as "a chister's conje" and as "the last hour chapped solution".
Minister Dutil has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future unity.
"See the results when we announce it," simply indicates.
"We are aware of this problem."
For the President of CSQ, Rejean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public survey.
"When more it is obsessed by Mr. Charest to avoid the creation of this research commission, more people share our view, i.e., that's something to hide," explains.
"The only way to have a research commission is with Jean Charest's division," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance of the National Public Administration School.
In order to get out of this dead point, it suggests Quebec that it provides a special mandate to the general intervention to carry out a survey on collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the general intervenant," concludes.
It also believes that Quebec could grant the intervenant the same competence as a Commissioner, allowing it to oblige people to witness.
The creation of a permanent square is not the only project in cereals in the Charest Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to improve this type of crime.
This application seems to be taken from the police of the Marteau Operation, which has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that legality is not explicit in this kind of investigations.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed its part that his Homolog of Justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently encouraging to carry out certain amendments on this subject.
During the early 2001 operation related to driving groups, although the Criminal Code was not adjusted, 131 were arrested.
Afterwards, Ottawa emphasized the adoption of the gangsterism Act.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
several water courses are closely monitored because of the strong precipitations that have been registered in several regions of the province from March.
Thursday, a land run in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
As preventive measures, houses have been evacuated.
For the night, another land run in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
He got a car.
From Tuesday to Thursday night, several regions have registered strong precipitations between 40 and 70 miles of rain.
It is also expected to be expected between 20 and 40 miles from now to Thursday evening, according to the region.
The sectors located north of the river and the outdoor Valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 mm of rain.
Since these precipitations are summoned to the nest deshill that has already been cumulated in certain sectors, it is feared that different rivers are discovered.
On Thursday night, the Quebec Civil Security Unit issued warnings for the Uareau and Achigan Rivers in Lanaudière.
The northern rivers, in Saint-Jerome, in the Laurents, and in the Chene, in Lotbinière, have already caused inundations in the past and are under monitoring.
In the Lanaudière region, strong precipitations have caused some lakes in Sainte-Julian, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, the strong rains have draught a provisional bridge.
As prevention measures, ten residences have been evacuated.
In outdoor, the discharge of certain lakes has caused the closure of several ways, in particular in the municipality of Mansfield and Pontefract.
The Civil Security Unit continues to warn and monitor the close situation, as Annik Bouchard stated, the Security Council.
The Quebec's predicting Centre, by its part, issued an advertising Monday by communicating the strong growth of several rivers, particularly the Maskinonge, the Assomption, the Waarwa, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Loup.
Culpan partly to Dupont
The Radiopresenter of Quebec Stéphane Dupont has suffered a certain revue to the Canadian Council of the Television standards (CCNR) for controversial statements regarding social assistance, Haitians and its large language in the radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his CHOI team had the right to express his view, but some statements contained "incomprehensive information on social assistance, an inadequate negative representation of Haitians and Great Language that should not be used in disseminated emissions during the day".
The Council also indicated that the discussions on self-smoking, including the dissemination of the name of two individuals who were suicided, did not violate the radio dissemination codes.
The CCNR had received a number of complaints related to comments made in emissions diffused between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued after a complaint from the Common Force of persons receiving social assistance from Quebec.
The group was deemed that the amounts mentioned in the emission were not correct.
The presentators should report reliable data and not to lie.
With regard to suicide, the submitted Stefan Dupont showed that self-assault was a cobarde act.
Most members of the Committee have concluded that the message transmitted was that self-smoking should not be considered as a solution to the problems of life.
"The majority of the Committee believes that the episodes placed in the interview of "Dupont the Middle" have treated a delicate topic in a fair and appropriate way."
Consequently, any guilt has been rejected in this regard.
The last dispute refers to the statements made after the earthquake of Haiti.
At that time, Stephane Dupont and Jean-Rene Dufort had protagonized a medium-sized confrontation that had caused numerous reactions.
The Chairman of the HOI stated that he had not done any donation to help Haitians because he could not know with safety if the needs would actually receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments are not abused, but that its accumulative effect is an inadequate negative representation of Haitians.
"I fulfilled my three-day suspension there."
"My deputy is clean for a half years," the Chairman declared.
In all decisions, the Committee declares the major language emission.
In any case, the CHI-FM radio chain has cooperated "including more than required".
The consequences will be minimum for the emission, which should, among other things, announce decisions once in higher hearing hours for a period of three days.
A king of the Kung-fu in Montreal
The monsters of origin Nacereddine Zemmal had an extremely peculiar recovery.
The atleta, which is highlighted in "Sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and thai box, goes up to the Tatamis and rings of the world to search for new challenges.
"I stopped practicing marcial arts such as Kig-fu and kickboxing for 12 years in Argelia", explained Zemmal, who lives in the metrópolis since 2008 to progress on the professional level.
"In my case, I find fights in all parts because, for those who do not enjoy the ground game that implies mixed marcial arts, there are little competitions in North America."
The atleta, who works as a security agent and as a employer of the UPS company, recently gave bad news to its rivals, wining two gold medals in the World Amateur Campeonato of the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), held from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotia.
"I winned in the Kickboxing categories full contact and Thai box," explained.
"I'm currently prepared to participate in the Copa del World de San Shou in China."
"I will invite sports who have been finished between the first four posts in the last world campaign in each category."
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, it ended in eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tour in fifth place, but I reached the third place in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"It's interesting that I've been progressing in every competition."
"To this step, I'll be the first time or the year that comes!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a originary discipline from China, where it is enabled to shoot with the pumps and feet, as well as launching the opposers on the ground.
The controversies are originally held on a platform and, less frequently, in a ring.
The most famous pugilist in this kind of fight is the American of Vietnamic origin Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of marcial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal so must keep a competition in his car, it will certainly hear the great tour "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of the Kig-fu.
"This competition is the most notoric and prestigious China," explains the sympathetic boy.
"It is like the equivalent to the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium of Thailand)."
"It's been an incredible experience."
Zemmal wins his first battle, in the semi-finals of its category (80 kg), but lost at the end.
"He who has won me is a real professional," he thinks.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg). "
"The winners of the semi-final are faced at the end of their category."
"The following, the champions of each category are faced to coronate a single camp, the king of the kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without contributions
Hydro-Québec has granted direct contracts for a value of $450 million to engineering companies for Eastman-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
There is a consortium formed by BPR, Dessau, the Group SM and Axor, which has obtained without a submission of the most important contract, the management of the project, a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called Energy Grance, was established in 2004, due to the decision of Hydro-Québec to trust in the private sector, its responsibility to manage this important hydroelectric project of $5,000 million.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Gerance Consortium obtained the winning contract without preceding a public contribution.
For the Party, the resource to enterprises poses a serious ethical problem that threatens competitiveness and causes a higher prices.
"This is a new method of colture and the elimination of competitiveness."
"I mean, people, instead of doing it secretly, do it now openly," said the deputy of the Party on the Sylvain Simard on a press route yesterday.
Before the morning, Mr. Samard planned the question to the National Assembly because, as he states, it does not understand how public interest can be benefited in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied for late, reproaching strongly that a compulsion has been made with this contract.
"I'm going to shut up," protested, defending that the PQ had acted in a "dehony" way and "with lack of strictness".
He pointed out that "the minimum" would be that the PQ would apologize.
Consortium formula is a common practice in the whole world.
Normally it is an alliance with a temporary limit that allows two or several enterprises to group their knowledge to respond to a submission for a complex project.
The Eastman project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the size of works.
The works have already started and will last until 2012.
In all cases, the contract has been granted without playing the competition; a negotiation has been treated.
In addition, the consortium formula has stopped being the exception of the standard in Quebec, including for relatively simple projects.
As published last week Le Devoir, the form of consortiums in the technical advisory sector is subject to an investigation in the Government.
A fast look at the Quebec's commercial record allows to identify more than 200 consorcies, of which some seem to be permanent.
Thus, the company Dessau works in association with most of its main competitors such as CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche and Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are decades of them, leads to a single legal person, i.e., Dessau.
As regards the Consortium Energy Gerance, the Minister Normandeau noted that "the territory of the Bahia James responds to a dynamic of special work and Hydro-Québec specifically answers it since 1970."
The great Chief of the Eastman Project, Real Report, of the Baie James Energy Society (SEBJ) has explained that the project management contract has been directly granted.
"If you respond to a offer and there are few participants, your prices will be higher."
"You have two options: you can contact the sector actors and say them: we're going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement and a good price."
"But the idea is that what is important is not the price, but the competition of people," said Mr. Laport.
The contract granted to Consortium Energy Generance is part of a broad list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Czech Party.
The contracts were granted by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastman-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Dever identified 109 technical advisory contracts from 2002 to March 2010 to companies or filials, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin obtained 22 contracts, Genevar acquired 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without taking account of its participation in energy generation.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, $449,783,344 were assigned to $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has understood that the four companies that form consortium (BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor) are "good known from the Liberal Partie of Quebec".
The Minister of Normandeau has left the PQ also linked to these companies, which are "financing", before needing that it is better for its leaders.
The "Green" label does not inspire confidence
More ecological, but deeply sceptic.
The consumer is only trusted in the actors of sustainable development, as well as in the trade marks or in the environmental certificates to guide its elections.
According to the Barometer of Responsible Consumption, whose first results have been published yesterday, the situation is even worse. Consumer is summarised in a medium-sized universe where it pulls messages that defeat more responsible consumer, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that it even slows its commitment.
Even if it has increased the consumption of products called "socially responsible" in 2010, the chebequens seem to give a very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not believe the environmental commitment of enterprises or the ecologist advertising of them, show the meditation tool developed by the Sherbrooke Observatory of the Consumer responsible University.
Another conclusion: half of consumers doubts the reliability of official certificates to bring fairly called products, as well as the credibility of the products and brands which brings labels indicating that they are "eco-responsibilities", states the Barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6% of the Quebecians are seriously taken to the political talks on this issue.
In any case, the information on responsible consumers seems essential to stimulate this consumption sector, currently supported by nearly a third of the Quebequens consumers.
In fact, the lagunas and the suspicious nature of the information make 46% of consumers decline this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer after the highest price of these products.
Furthermore, a third of the Quebecians say to disfellowship the results of ecological products or services that are trying to sell them.
On the other hand, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, in particular, changed the mark of one or more products to respect their convictions.
61% has given priority to purchase in their barrier shops and has prefered to buy growing food products in its region, notes the Barometer.
More green and responsible (the accounting consumer index has reached 64 points over a maximum of 100 points this year), the Quebec Consumer Homo likes to occupate the position of the reciclage king that tries to reduce its impact on the environment by causing the protection of the fauna.
However, according to the Barometer, this social conscience seems to be from doors (of its car) outside: in 2010, only 28% of the Quebecs indicated that they had used public transport or shared cars to defend their ecological principles.
Furthermore, 39.1 per cent of the participants of this wide investigation, which has finished completing their first edition, supports the use of the bicycle and foot movement.
A loan to the State recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, who has requested to be financially compromised in the recovery of the chines eXcentris complex, accepts the Angus Society and Parallele, to cooperate, but only through a loan.
The Angus Development Society and the Parallele, who expected a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to return to purchase Daniel Langlois the eXcentris cinematographic complex in the boolean Saint-Laurent and returning it to his true cinema vocation, did not obtain what they requested.
The Government has accepted its involvement in the matter, but in its own conditions.
Instead of expected donation, the Quebec Government proposes a loan which would actually be less than the initial expectations; it could be a viable solution in winning conditions, at least in view of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected the past spring a first action plan and a request of 12.8 million, but since then requests have been revised at low level.
The Chairman of the Cultural Business Development Society (SODEC), François Macerola, who was leading to eXcentris, sent a proposal and a plan of action to the Minister of St. Peter.
He sent you a last report a decade ago.
However, SODEC received a counter-proposal from the office on Tuesday.
Parallele and Angus have a period of time until 31 December to respond to the same.
In any case, it seems that the possibility of a State donation should be completely dismissed.
Remember that the Quebec's Customers Association of Quebec's Film Rooms and Complex Customers was opposed to a direct investment from the State to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Cultura must not finance real projects, since it has not been done with other film rooms.
On the other hand, several sector representatives call for considerable economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the officer of the same, has carried out for ten years the load of the author cine in its places of the complex, after funding his own construction, which could justify a derogation by the Council of Tesore.
The lack of rooms for independent films is patent in Montreal and eXcentris had been able to fidelize his customer.
The Angus and the Parallele company, directed by Christian Yaccarini, encourage a private financing campaign, expecting to meet $700,000 to open the road to purchase.
Since spring 2009, just one of these rooms, the Parallele, continues to design films in eXcentris.
The goal of the future purchasers is to reopen the three rooms on 27 February, designing the precious film of Xavier Beauvous "De mans and gods".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not returned to contact Le Devoir and we don't know what they think he and his group of proposals to the low receipt.
The slow of Canada is upset...
The new United States diplomatic cable distributed by WikiLeaks reveals what the United States consider as the complex of Canadians regarding Americans, but reflects both the sense of superiority from these to Canada.
The United States diplomates are surprised that Canadian electors do not think about the United States relations when they are going to vote and believe that the visit of President Obama has helped the conservator government to reach their budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy of Ottawa and Washington, which have been made last night, provide more detailed games than really substantial.
A cable of 22 September 2008, i.e., during the federal election campaign, reports at what point the United States do not go into the issues discussed by political leaders.
This caused a great surprise to the U.S. Ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins offers some explanations on this situation.
"The political leaders want to be condemned by a complex of almost minority inherent to Canadians at the time of addressing daily home issues, instead of leave such election to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign) " , writes.
Consequently, the United States are "the proverbial elefant of this election: all represents, but potentially too dangerous to talk about it".
The embassy has even more problems in understanding this "sorted skin" because the two countries keep intense political and economic relations.
"Logically it thinks that the capacity of a candidate, a party, and, moreover, of the head of a party to manage these essential relations should be a key factor in which electors should think at the time of vote."
This feeling of importance can also be observed by Terry Breese, responsible for business in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Their travel will contribute to the survival of the government during the vote of confidence at the begins of February on the federal budget, by which Canada will first register deficit in the last decade because of a plan for recovery of $30,000 to $40,000," writes Mr. Brese.
There is no indication that the Government had to extend the Parliament before Christmas to avoid the substitution of coalition and the opposition partys condemn their survival to the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another report of January 2008 signed by the Ambassador Wilkins warned to Washington about the more negative image that transmits the diffused dramatic series in the United States CBC.
The Ambassador is concerned about the Border's emission, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which little references are performed to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or even the followers in order to realize energetic interrogations.
Another cable account that, during his first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French Homologo Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to join some of Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner answered that, but he depended "of every case."
At the end of the meeting, they wrote: "The State Secretariat has presented a document on Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old musulman of Canadian origin."
"The Secretariat accepted the revision of the issuer."
Finally, we can recall that the souls have been calendared in relation to the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, an old advisor very close to Stephen Harper, declared in the CBC radio that the responsibilities of this massive flee should be "sixed".
In the United States, Mike Huckabee's eco.
A global plan to renew lighting
Last night, the United Nations has proposed a plan to renew household, commercial and industrial illumination in hundreds of countries to reduce winter gases (GEI) in a quantity that is almost a third of the additional reduction to be implemented to stabilize the climate of the planet before 2020.
This ambitious plan is marked in the whole of concrete projects that the United Nations expects to be adopted in Cancún to compensate the lack of binding reducing commitments in industrialized countries.
According to the previous plan, if the incandescenced bombs, which are still monopolising between 50 and 70% of the market, are replaced by fluocompact bombles or, even better, by the bombs of electronic diods (DEL or "LED" in English), much of the 1.800 million tonnes of GEI issued on the planet to light humans would be avoided.
The lighting is responsible for 8% of the global emissions.
It is equivalent to 70% of the emissions of the planetary automobile park.
In Copenhagen, last year, large embassy countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and other, including Canada, were compromised with voluntary reducing plans that should reduce the global GI emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt of that amount should be decreased to stabilise, before 2020, the increase in temperatures in two centigrated levels to avoid discontrolling.
In incandescence bombs, 95% of energy is dissimped in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluocompact bombs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with new LED bombs, the energy consumption is two times further reduced.
Fluocompact bombs last a average of 6000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bombs, as launched by the manufacturer Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the study of the United Nations), have a life hope of 25,000 hours and consum less energy than an incanded bomb, which allows us to make a idea of the burden that can be achieved with the substitution plan that would be applied in hundreds of countries.
These new bombs can also work with restates and emit very little heat.
Moreover, they do not contain anything of mercury.
several experts have demonstrated their reserves in relation to fluocompact bombs, since they contain mercury and should be removed as dangerous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, except that manufacturers put instructions.
However, the report indicates that the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluocompact bombs, but the carbon thermal centrals, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce electricity that is deleted with incanded bombs.
Only in the United States, these centrals emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the benefits that would provide this international programme to each country.
For example, Indonesia would be shocked by $1,000 per year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, i.e. the equivalent to 3,5 thermal centrals, which would build the cost of 2.500 million.
Cost of Marfill wishfully expects the advertising of the electoral results
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, requested the "immediate " publication of the results of the presidential elections in Costa de Marfil, since they have expired the deadlines.
"The Secretary-General highlights the need for the independent election committee to complete its work and announce the provisional results immediately", he highlights a report of the head of the United Nations.
"He asks all Costa de Marfil parties and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and support any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral committee has left the deadline of Monday to midnight without being published the results, three days from Sunday's scrutiny.
The President of the ECI had commented on the TV that the Committee "continued working" to announce the results.
The Monday has been multiplied in the world the requests that the ECI finally declare the name of the winner of the second back between the summer Laurent Gbagbo and its opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the band of Gbagbo has been cancelled by the Constitutional Council's "fraudulent" votes in the north, in the hands of the ancient rebellion of the new forces (FN) from the fallen state shock of September 2002.
Pascal Afi N'Guessan, director of the campaign of the President of Costa de Marfil, stated that the intimidating manipulation of the electors held by the NF in the north of the country had disappointed the followers of the stakeholder to vote.
Every election could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council accepts the complaints submitted by Gbagbo.
However, the opposites of Gbagbo consider that the highest court in the country is not neutral, since Paul Yao N'Dré, a nearby political partner of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northern man who defeats any relationship with the ancient rebellious, has judged "naceptable" the delay in the publication of the results and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not been so far as to re-evitify the victory.
Their allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and to submit a complaint to the Constitutional Council after preventing the election committee to disseminate the results, would be illegal.
The second turn of the presidency, on Sunday, had to have put the lead to the process of reunification and reconciliation of a shared country for two years.
The United Nations has warned Monday to the Marfil Political Class that could be considered responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had ended on the first turn, on 31 October, with 38% of votes against Alassane Ouattara (32%) who received public support by the former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first place).
The unemployment rate remains stabil in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (OIT), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable in 9.3 per cent in the continental territory (9.7 per cent in taking account of the overseas departments), as indicated in the data corrected with the provisional variations (CVE) published on Thursday.
The number of stops remains at 2.631.000 in the continental France.
The data of the second quarter have been confirmed, 9.3 per cent of the active population in the continental territory and 9.7 per cent of the DOMs.
In one year, the unemployment rate has registered an increase in 0.1 points.
Generally, 3,4 million people in the metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter, but they wanted to work, are or not available in the two weeks to work and find or not jobs.
The situation of young people present in the labour market has continued, with a new increase in the unemployment rate up to 24.2% in France continental (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in a year), 25% including WTO.
During the third quarter, 637.000 young people between 15 and 24 were in the sense of IT.
For its part, a low increase in the parity of advanced persons, up to 6.4% in Continental France (+0.2 points in three months and one year), i.e. 482.000 people over 50 years, counting up to 6.6% with DOMs.
Only a parity has been registered between people of age between 25 and 49 years, with 8.3% in Continental France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in a year) and 8.8% in all France.
The Insean has been published since 2006 without published the rate of the month pair, after a polyemic on its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the EU Statistics Agency, has continued to do it and announced the Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (including WTO) in October after a 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guerini investigated and arrested
Alexandre Guerini, 53 years of age, has been investigated and incarcerated in the prison of Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, in the context of an investigation on public contracts that are presumably fraudulent.
Alexandre Guerini is investigated by abusement of social goods, abuses of funds and public goods, coverage, active corruption, the trafficking of influences and the possession of munitions, as indicated by its lawyer.
"Alexandre Guerini will fight and answer all the questions that the magistrate plans to you, not fantasms."
"It is easy to follow you by a lot of retraceable acts, another is to show them", said the AFP's lawyer, Florence Rault, before the comparison of his customer.
Mr. Guerini, the brother of the PS leader in the Department, Jean-Noël Guerini, had wished to transmit by means of his lawyers to the judge before his comparison, a document to be explained.
Wednesday night, they started investigating and also incarcering one of their neighbors, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr Lucien Simon, the only thing that his client has done has been taking care of the lawyers that should be managed.
As regards the allocation of contracts or the destination of the funds related to their execution, there is nothing to know in this regard, according to the reader Simon.
In the context of this issuer, it is also investigated from Monday Daniel Pinna, the former Director-General of the Services of Abugnana's urban aglomeration services, by distortion of funds and compliance, but has left him in conditional freedom and it is prohibited to meet with the protagonists of the case.
"My customer has able to explain all the facts that you have reproved."
"The instructor has taken into account the explanations and has left him in freedom", explained his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
The Tuesday night, on Thursday, asked four other persons and left them the freedom, under the judicial control of two of them, as indicated by the Adjunct Police, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Joint Director-General of Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), has been accused of "traffic of passive influence and corruption".
Two officials of the Abugnana aglomeration, Michele Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been interrogated by "sustration and abuse of public goods for a person dedicated to the public service" and by "compliance in the abuse of public funds", respectively.
Finally, the partner of Alexandre Guerini, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated by "including the abuse of social goods".
Among those who have faced Mr. Guerini is Stefan Brunengo-Girard, in a paralel case of fraudulent public contracts affected by Córcega.
The investigators suspect that their companies have service to blame the capital of great bandidism.
The investigation is carried out in the framework of several judicial instructions initiated against X in April 2009 after receipt of an anonymical communication, of course fraud in the allocation of public contracts, in particular in the residues sector.
A close source of research notes that the investigations focus on the conditions of allocation and functioning of a seed in La Citatat, which collects Abugnan's waste, as well as other cities of the urban community of Marsella (MPM).
Question Clotilde Kings: Eliseo has exagerated the mediation of Syria
Over ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the destination of Clotilde Reiss, the young French investigator detained in Iran for "spionaje" in France, was warned to the diplomacy and highlighted the deterioration of the relationships between Paris and Teheran.
All under the look at the United States diplomates.
The United States document obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le World reveals some unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how Eliseo has explained its strategy to the United States to give them advice to managing their own "rehenes" crisis in Iran (a small group of senderists).
They show how French responsibilities tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the French youth was not made in exchange by Majid Kakavand's release, an Iranian detained in France and searched for the United States justice for the traffic of materials for the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they revealed the cruel reality of how the French Presidency tried to handle the media to give the idea that the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played a key role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, you didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegraph issued on 12 August 2009 in Paris is the title "Iran: French comments about how to manage cases of rehenses".
Eliseo's advisor for strategic affairs, François Richier, joined by the Director of Quai d'Orsay for the northern African and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, speak with the American diplomatic Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise the United States to do the following to repatriate their own citizens to force in Iran.
"Fromed", they say, "solver continuously" in the media, the words " fundamental human rights", "innocence", "immediate release".
Everything to angry the Iranian regime, careful of his image.
"When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it more often."
Because, once ago, the negotiations attempts for discrete channels, "the silence will not solve anything", the Iranians are "experts in dilatory manuscripts".
Mr Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is “un ordinary Iranian tactic: the take of rehens for the political chamber.”
Advertising that the release of prison of Clotilde Reiss (which will be produced on August 16th, day of refugee in the embassy of France) "this will require submission to Iranians of a large amount of money" (230,000 euros of rewards).
Furthermore, Eliseo anticipates other crisis of rehens, a phenomenon that "this will grow".
Iran could "in a next future to stop another of about 800 French citizens who live in Iran," says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss gets out of prison after twelve days, but is blocked in Iran.
The following information is distributed: the Irani Majid Kakavand, whose extradition requests the United States for illicit traffic for delicate electronic material to Iran, has been placed in Paris for a judge's decision.
The U.S. Embassy, as many observers, doubts this strange match.
For Washington, near the Iranian nationals' material purchase networks for the nuclear programme, Majid Khakavand's excarcelation is a bad news.
Has France accepted a exchange?
Leave the Iranian in change of French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4th, François Richier guarantees that it was not so.
Eliseo, said, is not just "a huge surprised by the judge's decision," but has tried to oppose the same.
"Increased negotiations between the French presidency and the Minister of Justice" (in the time, Michele Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot annul the decision," comments.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "strict" monitoring of French information services.
Eliseo's advisor marks a number of phones, phones, and then informs the US diplomate that the Irani is currently "in some buildings of Paris managed by the Iranian Embassy".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, Eliseo does not slow in efforts, uses communications and "flights" organized in the media to believe that the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influentible" role of "mediator".
The United States observed this activity with certain ironia and confirmed that the manipulation brings its fruits, since several printing articles are transmitted to the French official version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 called "the blitz" of French officials.
What such "gratitude" should be asked to Mr Assad, the embassy in Paris is asked.
"In spite of its full declarations of lovingness, French officials recognize privately that so much have a vague idea of what the Syrians have really done."
The document then deals with the reasons they have brought to Eliseo to give this fiction.
The great communication efforts "in order to validate Sarkozy's opening policy to Syria," believes.
A policy initiated in 2008, which "in view of numerous critical voices in France and the Foreign, has been finished to be premature and dismembered."
By "exagering the Syrian Role", Paris is trying to "to show Syria the joy that can make if it plays a constructive role in the region".
The objective also consists of "single the seed of the discussion between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. Embassy knows it's good source.
On August 11, François Richier trusted him: "We do not know whether the Syrians have done something or not."
"But in all ways, we thanked him."
"It should, at least, cause confusion between Iran."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it in the Eliseo.
In a communication, thanks to the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria who have played a "active paper for the release of our companion."
From midnight, young Koreans can't play online
The Suriname Government will adopt a law called "Cenicienta" which will prevent adolescents to participate online games after the middle of the night by blocking their access, as they have indicated by government responsibilities.
In December, a legislative project will be submitted to Parliament to ask online game companies to block access to these games after midnights to youths of less than 16 years of age, as they have indicated representatives of the Ministry of Cultural and Family.
"My children play all night, and then they are difficult to study in school and bring a normal life during the day."
"We think that this law is necessary to protect your health and their right to dream", stated the AFP Jo Rin, the ministerial responsible for the draft law.
Online games will be again available at 6 mornings.
The companies will have a year to prepare for the implementation of the law, necessary.
The Government is also requested to enterprises that limit the daily access time to these games when young parents request it, he added the responsible.
Furthermore, you will have the disposal of whom you request free computer programs that allow to limit the Internet connection time.
South Korea is one of the most connected countries, and journals regularly news about various facts linked to intensive internet use.
The country is also the uncertain champion of the world competitions of online games.
In November, South Korea obtained four gold medals in the Cyber Games World, where other 58 countries were covered.
World 2018-2022: FIFA designated the organizationing countries
By the torture caused by corruption suspects, the Executive Committee of the FIFA designates the Jeudi to the organizationing countries of the Copas of the World 2018 and 2022, a clear political election where the influence struggles and lobbying can lead to primary on technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the edition of the FIFA competition in 2018 will be held in Europe, traditional disciplinary bastion (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain and Portugal and the Netherlands).
The edition of 2022 will be much more exotic, since the International Federation expects to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a star in the African continent in 2010, or continue its installation in the United States or in the East League (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities that were part of delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the employee of Qatar, the Belgian and the Netherlands Heads of Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) confirms the economic and political interests that are playing in a world.
Thus transactions between pistiers are possible to duration up to the last minute.
On the other hand, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, English, Spanish and Portuguese candidates (2018) and US (2022) have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of vote.
Sunday Times, who is responsible for the remarks leading to the corruption of two members of the EC (Reinald Temparii and Amos Adamu), could have disrupted the opportunities of his country, with the fútbol, which only welcomed the World once, in 1966.
The BBC added milk to the hour on Monday by disseminating a documentation that has shown three influenced members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Liveou.
Suffix to disgust the FIFA and smile the English responsibilities, which have been launched to a intense lobbying in the last few weeks with David Cameron.
The Head of Government expects to revise the shock given successfully by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had achieved in 2005 to London the JJ.O. 2012 organization.
This intense activity, will it be sufficient to recover the light from England before the EC?
It is not clear, since the Spanish-Portugal Dou also has a number of strong points thanks to his stadiums, it is ready to have experience (Mundial of 82 in Spain, JJ.O in Barcelona in 1992, Copa of Europe in Portugal in 2004) and its futbolistic culture.
However, the sovereign economic and financial perspectives of both countries could be cut down their ambitions.
The possible reprises against English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal is the only way to give points to Russia, converted into a weight outer, despite the lagunas in their candidate (stations, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move to Zurich and declared a "unlawful competence in the preparation of the vote" in a direct vote to the accused of the English press against the members of the EC.
"He's getting out of sweet traces, trying to compromise them," said Putin.
For 2022, the United States, who have experience in 1994, seem to be the most logical favorites.
The first world economic power and headquarters of FIFA's main patrocinators, the country seems to have benefited in Japan and South Korea, which have developed a excellent project separately.
However, these new candidates seem to be premature for two countries which have organized together in 2002.
Another risk: the 2026 World Concept of China, fervently desired by the FIFA, would cause Asia to remain without possibilities for 2022.
With Qatar, which has presented its project based on future stages, and Australia, the FIFA would continue to extend to new horizons, but both countries have more risks than sure.
Australia, as Japan and Korea, could also be damaged by the deficiency of the TV rights paid (in fonction of time difference) by European countries, the dorsal shore of the war for the FIFA.
Second mandate: test
The Gaulle had really doubted.
Mitterrand had understood it.
Valery Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not have any doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is less.
One mandate in the Eliseo leads to another.
The current head of State will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
However, the evidence of this is not well combined with the mystery that is usually associated with the presidency.
So it must always appear to be doubtful.
He did one side and to the other.
In 2006, although they did not believe it, the friends of Jacques Chirac claimed that he did not remove a third mandate.
On November 15, in a series ton, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that it would take its decision "in some moment in August 2011".
The fact that you treat the UNMP Members, on Tuesday at the night in Eliseo, the possibility of "two mandates" has caused a certain revolt.
Is this the official announcement of your candidate?
Not much less.
The President indicated that the constitutional reform of 2008 was limited to two the number of five years of mandates.
It simply transmitted the facts, not an advertisement.
It's not the first time you speak of the presidents, with a jocoous ton, in meetings of this type.
"In the worst, or best, of the cases, you will still pass seven years and half with me," was cut in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010, "You don't think I'm not planning what will come after."
Your previous statements do not close to the candidate, nor at least.
They make comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the carriage by the candidature in the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Segolene Royal has taken up the palestra what leads to Nicolas Sarkozy to be sincere.
Moreover, the fact that its candidature in 2012 is clear that it brings many people from the PS to claim that the battle is organized before it was expected.
On the other hand, the bad sonds.
First, the right electors prefer the candidate of François Filon to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion on the subject in the UMP," he immediately reacted and carefully the environment of the Prime Minister.
"If you think you can lose, it's not a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"You will always think you can win", corrects Alain Juppee, resigned before the evidence.
Euro: The ECB is obliged to maintain its purchases of State letters
The last meeting of the European Central Bank's Governing Council (BCE) of the year should allow to specify the conditions of outcome of the crisis or at least advertise the interruption of a large number of non-conventional operations of monetary policy that should be completed at the end of the year.
As a result of the crisis of the European sovereign debt, Frankfurt's emission institution can, without doubt, not be allowed to be such a pertinent if it does not want to deteriorate a more complicated situation today on European obligation markets.
The political cost would be equal to high.
Last night, during a press route, the French Finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, has supported the active role played by the ECB in resolving the debt crisis of the European States.
He did not want to say if he considers that the central bank should do more, for example increase its programme of purchase of State obligations.
"I reserve my opinion for my European partners."
In Brussels, during his hearing to the Commission on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, has not been shown more eloquent about its intentions, indicating only that the State's purchase letters in the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we decided" during the juvenile meeting.
The only one that is clear is that the ECB will keep its main invariable type in 1%, the lower level of his history since May 2009.
In practice, the acquisition of Tresor obligations by the ECB has doubled the last week until reaching about EUR 1.350 million.
In addition, according to the market operators, ironly Icelandic and Portuguese titles would have been purchased again.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have purchased 67.000 million euros since May 2010.
Among the market operators, there is no doubt that the purchase will be followed (see page 29).
Economists do not expect any significant changes in rubber.
Although the loan operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's slaughter, it still performs limited liquidity allocations with benefitous conditions and durations between one week and three months.
Economists expect to extend this device today for a few months.
"I don't think you're going to change considerablely your program."
"If no, it would be the risk to cause new tensions in a short term," says Michael Schubert, economicist of the Commerzbank.
"As more likely to be made a progressive output announced during the first quarter of 2011," warned by the Norbert Bröms, economicist in Sal.
Oppenheim.
With regard to public debt market interventions, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of these obligations to maintain a stable market", adds Norbert Brms.
In view of the importance of the exposure of European banks to the euro area's sovereign debt markets, the emission institution has no choice to maintain its presence in the market.
"The lack of investors in the market must be compensated to any price and act so that it implies a marked decrease of the income assigned by the most fragile States," said a major obligation manager last night.
Because if the types of interest are covered by the clouds, States have more problems to reduce their debt, or even to stabilize it.
This is the price to protect the euro.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi captures the time
After it started the week in a worried way, the situation was slightly improved last night with the refluction of the types of obligations for 10 years.
A recovery of precarious calm.
At the outcome of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, regional Presidents said that they listened to Julio Tremonti to calculate the situation of "insufficient" and that a weekend was expected to be "inconsistent" statements later dismissed by the interested person.
In any case, the difference with the German long-term types had reached the record of 210 basic points and the price of the covery contracts against the risk of heavy (CRQ) was destroyed until 263 points, causing a certain revolt in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that the difference with German types was more than 400 basic points in Spain.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was expressed "deeply worried" by "market turbulences" and for a possible county from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not as Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an economicist in the Hudson Institute.
Indeed, its problem is the lack of growth and the smuggling of income associated with the same, which causes the State to face the risk that it cannot face its financing needs.
The last predictions of Brussels have clearly been a cold water garden for the government.
It is estimated that Italian growth will be at 1,1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the Senate budget is based on a number of 1,3% and 2% respectively.
In these conditions, according to the European Commission, public deficit will represent 4.3 per cent of the GDP the year (for 3.9 per cent expected by the government) and 3,5 per cent in 2012 (any 2,7 per cent).
The latter that new budget provisions could be implemented after the festivals, by an amount of EUR 7.000.
"In the case of necessary, new audience measures should be taken", says the Commissioner of Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
At the time, Italy has supported international institutions.
"The basiss of their economy are in order and their accounts in good state, as we have long said," says Arrigo Sadun, Italian administer in the International Monetary Fund of Italy in the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, no short or long-term debt, because, despite its considerable debt (119,2% of the GDP in 2011, NDLR), the efforts of stabilisation requested in Italy are less than required to other countries," says Pier Carlo Patroan, OECD's economic leader.
The problem of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a censure movement in the House of Members, after which elections could be advanced at the end of March.
In that case, a short period would be opened for decision-making in case of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on the strengthening of crisis combating mechanisms
Christine Lagarde has repeated it last night during a press rule in Paris: "I think we have already shown Sunday, night and day, that Europeans are clearly solid, decided, compromised with the defence of their currency and its monetary area."
Although it was related, the registered relief last night in the types of European States' obligations has encouraged Governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot still talk about a principle of normalization.
The Standard & Poor's Rating Agency announced that it could decrease the debt calculation of Portugal, the most frequently white in the current speculations.
"Comme in May, there is really no political clarity and transparency, which is significantly weak on banking systems", they believe Exane BNP Paris's economics.
Especially because "the political rhythm is much lower than the market rhythm".
Conscious of this heat and the dangers that you hide, European countries intensify the debates to strengthen existing crisis output mechanisms.
The informal consultations between the Ministers of Finance, which are more directly affected and, in general, with their G-20 Homologs are in good way.
This also takes into account the meetings of the European Group and of the Ecofin at the beginning of the week.
The ECB is meeting today.
At the agenda, the type of non-conventional measures to support the euro area countries in the market collision (advises above).
With regard to the European Financial Stabilities Fund (EFF), its Executive Director Klaus Regling has started March in Singapore a recruited by Asia to inform the East League Investers about the crisis news in Europe.
Although the objective of these visits is not to recur funds, it is uncertainly preparing the land.
The first EDF title emissions are expected in the next month.
Last night, a U.S. official representative trusted the Reuters Agency that the United States would support a potential increase in the mobilized funds through a direct IFF ' s direct commitment.
As regards countries in the first line, Portugal and Spain, these are prepared to adopt structural reforms, in particular in the organization of the labour market.
These reforms are subject to audience measures with a more closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to progress on a different way from Greece and Ireland.
Both of them want to avoid demanding international assistance before implementing their budgetary corrections and decideing the structural reforms that are considered necessary for achieving sustainable confidence.
Capital partners of European funds are finally highlighted the available options to accelerate the standardization process of public obligation markets.
On November 24, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the 750,000 million euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not doubt that it would be back to the shopping.
Barclays Capital Economists, a first line actor in the European public debt market, believe that a amount of about 100,000 million euros would be sufficient, preferably, in the form of direct liquidity injection.
There is the instrument for that: the European financial stabilisation mechanism, currently equipped with 60,000 million euros.
An advisory that, without doubt, could, in detail, review the European capitals.
Specially if the market conditions are worse.
Neighborhood and glass: 24 apartments in Narja Warning
Nieves continue to cause movement difficulties, especially in the secondary network in Britain, and may affect various economic activities.
Currently, twenty-five departments are situated in narrow warning because of the risk of nevada and ice training.
You, Eure-et-Loir, Two-Sevres and Vienna have joined the twenty divisions that were already in Naranja warning, ten from midday to midday and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group by night.
According to Meteo France, strong nests affected the northern Gironde and Charentes, although they also slowly nest in the island of France.
2 to 5 cm, at times between 7 and 10 cm, in the departments affected, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm in the parish region.
The departments affected are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Baja Norwegia, France and Lemosin.
Nears are sufficiently strong as to cause movement difficulties and to affect some economic activities, Weather France.
In the Coasts d'Armor, access to different departmental roads was prohibited for weighting vehicles more than 7.5 tonnes, including Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudeac axis.
According to gendarmes, the movement in the secondary network of Britain is complicated, so they recommend that it is not conducted in the case of need and the movement of certain TER vehicles has been prohibited during the day.
During Thursday, school transport was prohibited in Picardia.
There was no specific measure planned for midday night to restrict the movement of weight vehicles.
The prefecture "invites all drivers to lead to the more prudentity on the roads and to adapt their conduct to the situation".
The Civil Aviation Directorate (DGAC) requested the airlines to cancel on Thursday 25 per cent of their flights in the parish Roissy airport and 10 per cent in Orly because of the planned nevadas.
The DGAC recommends aircraft passengers to contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and the Edinburgh, Scotia, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro of the Great Paris: first financial borrowers
Since the debate on the modernisation of transport in the island of France has reached its algide point, thousands of people have been able to spend.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we talked about the 23.000 million for the Grand Paris Metro which should build the Grand Paris Society.
To begin this SGP, the State has announced a fund allocation of EUR 4.000 million.
At the theoretical level, this amount will allow the SGP to obtain prices on the markets to finance a part of its double bucle.
Today, finally, we have the first accounts.
The 2010 Rectificative Finance Act, reviewed in the Finance Commission of the National Assembly this morning, contains the devices for the first part of the money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase in the office tax in the island of France.
The first, according to article 15 of the text of the draft law, is "in benefit of the Grand Paris Public Institute".
In addition, it is fixed in numbers: "The product of this tax is of EUR 117 million per year".
The second is a amendment of a tax on offices that already exists "to modernize it, increase its product and to allow this increase to the Grand Paris Society".
How much would this method be obtained?
Who knows.
No numbers are given in the text.
But it's over 4,000 million.
"The tax resources must be added to the $4,000 million from the allocation of funds that the State will mobilize and grant to the Grand Paris Society as advanced the project," we can read in the explanation of reasons.
The SGP does not surprise this system.
"When income are created (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the 4.000 million later, as we explain."
"The budget will be registered and will be used on the basis of the needs."
The SGP will start receiving 4.000 million in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, where 4.000 million promised are not included in the credit, can cause a slightly fired parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be on December 7th.
Hackers Vendors and Diligent Spies
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it develops a apparent skandale, a scandale that just seems scandale towards the hypocrisy that rise the relationship between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, pronounce deep changes at international level and provides a future dominated by return.
But let's walk.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each employee created by a secret service (independently from the nation to which it belongs) is formed exclusively by printing currency.
The "extraordinary" revelations of the United States on the sexual habitats of Berlusconi so reflect only what has been written for months in any newspapers (except those belonging to Berlin) and Khadafi's left-disciplinary profile has long given ideas to the cabaret artists to create their sketches.
The standard according to which secret expeditors should only be formed by public knowledge news is essential for the dynamic of secret services, not only in this century.
If you visit a library dedicated to the ethics publications, you will see that each work is repeated (for the Grial, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templates or the Rosacruz) exactly what was written in the previous works.
This should not only be the authors of hidden texts who want to do unreceived investigations (or do not know where to find news about the unbelievers), but because those who are dedicated to the ocultism do not only trust in what they already know, which reiterates the one who had already learned.
This is the mechanism of the success of Dan Brown.
The same applies to secret expeditors.
The informator is perceived, as it is persistent (or has little anxiety) the chief of secret services (if I can't be, what I know, the editor of the Liberation), which only considers what can be recognized.
The top secret information about Berlusconi sent the American Embassy from Rome to the Department of State was the same as the newsweek previous week.
Why, then, has such a resurrection caused the revelations of these employees?
On the one hand, they only say what every cultivated person already knows, i.e., that the embassy, at least from the Second World War, and since the Heads of States can be called by phone or cover the aircraft to meet, have lost their diplomatic role and, except some limited representation exercises, have been transformed into sponsor centres.
Any spectator that sees research films knows it perfectly knows, so we only seem that we don't know it for hypocrity.
In any case, the fact of repeating it is publicly violating the duty of hypothesis and gives a bad image of the United States diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker may consult the most powerful secrets of the world's most powerful country is significantly affected by the department of State.
Therefore, the scandale affects both the victims and the "verduges".
But we enter the real nature of what happened.
Anciently, in Orwell’s time, it could be designed to all power as a Big Brother who controlled every loop of his suicide.
Orwell's prophecy has been realized since it was possible to control every movement thanks to the phone, every transaction done, visited hotel, autopsy, the citizen turned into this way into a full victim of the eye of power.
But when it is shown, as now, that even the crypts of the secrets of the power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship stops being unidirective and will be circled.
The power controls each citizen, but every citizen (also the hacker, chosen as the citizens' vendor) can know all the secrets of the power.
How can a power that can no longer be able to keep its secrets?
It is true, as Jeorg Simmel already said, that a real secret is a empty secret (and a empty secret cannot never be discovered); it is also true that any knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually a white secret, without secret, because it comes from the public area; but declare, as WikiLeaks, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to remove all powers.
WikiLeaks did not harm Sarkozy or Merkel, but, and much, Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this damage caused by such a powerful power?
It is obvious that, in the future, States cannot already put any preserved information on the network because it would be like to publish it in a full-route card.
But it is also clear that, with current technologies, it is not expected to keep confidential conversations on phone.
Nothing is more easy than finding if and when a State Chief has moved into a flight and has been in contact with one of the homicide.
How can they keep private and confidential relations in the future?
I know perfectly that, at the moment, my predict is what is fictional science and, therefore, novelly, but I imagine to government agents that are switched in diligences with uncontrolled itinerarys, bringing messages that have been learned of memory or, as much as, hiding some written data in the tacons of their shoes.
These information then remained in one copy, in key locked chains: at the end of the account, the Watergate's sponsoring attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I wrote that technology is currently advanced as a cancer, i.e., to back.
One centuries after the unqualable telegraph has revolutionated communications, the Internet has returned to create a telegraph with cables (Telefonics).
Video channels (analytics) were allowed to cine researchers to study a film step by progressing and backing, discovering all the secrets of the mount, while now the CDs (digital) only allow for progress or backing of chapter, i.e., to large proportions.
With high speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while in flight, with the shipping movements, we need three hours and medium.
Therefore, it is nothing out of the normal way that communication policy and techniques bring us again to horses cars.
A last comment.
Anciently, the press tried to understand what was in secret in the embassy.
Today, the embassy are requesting confidential information to the press.
Climate: France's chaps in their financing promises
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to consider whether the proof of rapidly disblocked financing has been respected (speak start or early) by the developed countries.
And the French shoes have been shocked.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries were committed to providing $3 million between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has committed EUR 7.200 million in three years and France 1.260 million (i.e., 420 million per year).
During the opening of the COP16, the EU has put its best letters on the table to convince its partners that their commitment to fast funding is true: a detailed report on the measures of its Member States, a press route, a great supplementary event, the distribution of brochures...
Transparency results and was appreciated by what is really valuable: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to make the same and the same level of accuracy.
The EU announces that it has released EUR 2.200 million in 2010, which is in the right way to comply with its commitment of 7.200 million in 2012.
But if we study the situation detailedly, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, money must be "new and additional" to ensure that additional efforts are carried out without prejudice to official development assistance.
Unfortunately, it has not been reached an agreement on what means "new and additional".
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, each who chooses the most appropriate reference.
For example, the European Commission has taken as a reference to 2009: international financing is maintained and 150 million are added in three years in the concept of rapid financing.
Other countries have chosen similar references for the year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional."
In other words, it does not refer to the expenditure of previous years or to the total level of official development aid.
In particular, the total amount of France's aid to developing countries can remain stable (or even decreasing), while aims at respecting its commitment to "new and additional funds" ...
Another crucial element, the distribution between donations and loans.
Once again, there is no standard and every one chooses the calculation method.
Some, as France, believe that each euro provided is equal to a donated euro.
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: efforts are not comparable.
Although the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are rewardable (frequently, projects related to the reduction of emissions based on more effective technologies), it is impossible to present an euro that will be recovered as an equivalent to an euro that is given... as so much, it should only be counted for its commitments the cost of the loan for the country granting the loan (i.e. the equivalent to a type of interest).
However, France does not use this reason: "respect" its commitment of 420 million euros makes 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros); consult the EU document to see it in its own eyes.
This is the only Union country that uses so often the loan.
Germany uses it in a 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respects its commitments with a 100% of donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union provides a euro to comply with its commitment, France only provides ten cents and considers that the efforts are comparable.
A good truck!
In summary, in its rapid funding starts, France makes a double abuse: on the time-based action and on the other hand, in relation to the real financial efforts.
Given only 36.1 million euros, it is possible to give the impression that 420 million "new and additional", as he had promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (for it seems to be Bercy who has been occupied from the arbitrage) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (for what the other Member States were to continue to give when they can simply provide?) as in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not tones...
The chapter of pre-financing is a short-term mining in relation to all climate negotiations.
But it could be a larger sand grain in the CMNUCC machinery.
We'll hope that it's not so.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn from this first year of pre-financing.
First, France could advertise a change in its calculation method for 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its commitments and the remaining countries of the European Union.
However, in particular, France could make progress on long-term funding debates (another important chapter that is currently being discussed): we will not be free of the question of the "additional framework" or of the method for computering the loans.
France could change its post to become progressist in this issue as it is with others.
We are therefore the hope of the new Minister of Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, which will come to Cancún in the week that comes.
A surprising announcement on the rapid start of France and its vision of the "additional framework" and the use of loans would contribute to improving the international confidence level necessary to progress in negotiations.
Child pesticides advertising
A 10-year-old child in a day of 81 different chemical substances, according to a study published Monday by the Generations Futures Association (the old movement for the rights and respect for future generations).
The association, who warns that its results "not have a significant statistical value, taking into account the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the treated problem," acquired in Oise and Paris supermarkets between July and September the foods that usually consumpte a child of about ten years in four foods and a tendency day.
These foods taken as a model, which respect the official recommendations (5 parts of fresh fruits and vegetables, three of milk and 1,5 litres of water per day), as well as the golosins, were examined in the laboratorys in search of chemicals, pesticides, weighted metals and other contaminant substances.
The balance of the plate is absorptive: 81 chemical substances, of which 42 classified as possible or likely cancer cancer and five substances classified as safe cancers, as well as 37 substances that can act as endocrin disorders (PE), according to studies of various institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"By though, in practically the totality of cases, the legal limits for each of the chemicals individually are not exceeded, our study clearly shows that the exposure of consumers to pollutant pollutant cancer and/or PE is concerned," says the association.
For the breakfast, mantequilla and milk tea contains only more than a decade of possible cancer waste, and three considered as safe cancers, as well as about 20 wastes that can damage the hormonal system.
The manzana, imported from Brazil, prescribed as tently for the college, contains traces of six chemical substances, including a banned employee in France.
The same applies to the green Jews of Kenya, including food, in which the study has detected traces of a powerless insectified in the EU.
Furthermore, the Russian filet, the lake tsunami and even the bread or the chicle were directed with pesticides and other chemical substances.
In the water of the griff, analysis found the presence of nitrates and cloroforms.
In the dinner, the salmon wheel was the most "nutritive" with 34 chemical residues detected, and even the analysis of the plastic plate used to calendar the food in the microondes was not completely clean.
The final risk generating these "contaminants cocktails" for the consumer "probably underestimate", says the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV) proposed "for the seriousness of the situation" to apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to "the increase in diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study of the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) indicated the presence of 365 different pesticides identified in the fruit and vegetables consumpted in Europe, which were 76 in cereals.
