Brno doesn't like the containers to separate the shoot
In Praga, citizens can separate the drinking packages and in the southern villages of Moravia can be found containers to separate burns on all sides.
And in Brno?
Alliance needs a few minutes to find the respective containers.
I don't want to say that in Brno it's not separated for nothing.
I think that, to be the second largest city of the Republic, supports are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is fully late in the separation of cups, not only because we, the citizens, can only use containers to separate paper, vision and plastic, but especially the number of containers for these waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, to take a PET box in the center to the appropriate container?
It is almost impossible, especially long time and patient requires.
The only place I have found up to now is in the Moravské Beach normåsti, in front of the Power Huse.
If you don't angry with me Mr. Subka and his companions, it seems too little.
It is not necessary to mention that, in other parts, it is not easy to separate the burden.
That's why many of my friends prefer not to separate it.
By vacance
What happens is that containers are far away.
I'm not surprise.
I offered myself, after a party, to take a few glass and plastic bottles.
But in the Kanicova Calle, I saw no red container near.
Happily, I found the right place.
However, the shooting was already removed from the container.
It is still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn't it?!
What happens is that ecology and ethicals seem not too interested in the socialists of Brno.
You prefer to buy you to the city the extralink of hockey, which is hungry to us in the whole Republic, and not buy more containers or offer the separation of other materials so that Brno is cleaner.
I'm glad to compare my hypothesis, after navigating through the Internet a little, with official statistics.
According to the ECO-COM society, Brno is indeed the worst of the whole Jihomoravskī kraj region.
The 'Paroubek' budget left money from the income and illness subsidies
After the left, despite the Government ' s view, funds for farmers or officials may be added, there may be no enough money for the budget, ill-subsidies or for the shore of construction.
But not for the interests of the State or international debt.
This will harm all those ruling in the second half of the year that come, says the Minister of Hacienda Eduard Janota.
When social-democrats and communists imposed the increase in some groups, they believed that the government would potentially request a loan for sensitive, ill-sized costs or subsidies. "It is only to address the problems for the future, it is to put mines", says Janota.
What happens is that, when money is taken, it is necessary to pay more interests and, at some time, the money must be returned.
The State does not have many options to get money.
If it does not reduce social subsidies or State functioning expenditure, taxes must be increased.
To all who have added the left now: the bombs, teachers, farmers.
And later, also your children.
People do not need to worry about the income or subsidies of disease, they will receive them.
But the price to pay will be the increase of the public debt; the year that will not be lacked in the treasure only will be 163,000 million, but more.
Despite the efforts of the Minister Janota, the debt will continue to increase together with interest costs.
The State will need money to cover them and will not be slightly increased on VAT or reduced maternity subsidies, as the Government has done in its package against deficit.
As a result of the displacement of money for some election groups, the year that will be also missed will also be $5 billion to end the construction of cars and railers.
It is mainly the sectors in which the allocation has already been held and where the construction process has already started, which projects cannot be changed and cannot be reduced.
The maximum you can do is keep them, what is not free.
This means the delay or stop of the thirty major constructions; the possibility of reaching European funds is also in danger, warns the transport department of Karel Hanzelka.
SSD proposed a salmonic solution for the reduction of funds: it will obtain money from the switchs from the State dividers, which is mostly ownership, and will add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividing is never safe or is a shock without shock.
The last year, from EECEZ, was intended to the budget of 18.000 million.
Each year, the dividends are liquided by ecological damages, serve to complete the account for rents or serve as a reservation for the prepared restructuring of retail.
In addition, with this truck, according to the EU rules, it increases the real deficit of the budget at 5,7% of the GDP.
The carnaval of money transfers does not end here.
About 3 billion million were obtained from the budget to grant a variety of indemnities to the victims of communism and crime, or for the expenditure of offences, including in the shore of construction.
It is not clear if the State needs these funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose any international dispute, we may have to pay it, Janota.
Afterwards, the Minister has to pay money within the resort or, in the worst cases, to escape the reserve of the government budget.
They are also missing 100 million for the Statni pocladna project (Statni Pocladna), whose price is of two billion and has been already started. You must allow to monitor online in which different authorities are expenditured.
The first stage began in January.
If the Hacienda Minister does not find money on the other hand, the project will have to stop and reach sanctions, warn Janota.
Your future smart phone can work with two operational systems
The US will contain a mobile phone where the user can, by clicking on a key, change between several operational systems.
The plans revealed are voting promisers.
Only clicking a key, you go into a few seconds of Windows Mobile to Android.
Only this possibility is the goal of the United States VMware company, which is focused on the development of the virtualization software for computers.
In your mobile, you can take two user profiles the same time.
They can change between them and share them between home and work.
The two operates at the same time, Mrs. Krishnamurti of the VMware company in the interview for the Computer world magazine.
It was presented in November of the last year, and a few days ago it was shown for the first time.
It will be started in 2012.
The virtualization of smart phones is no longer fiction.
VMware has shown successfully the journalists how the smartphone works with two operational systems.
It was the N800 Nokia, modified with a 128 MB RAM memory, where the systems mentioned, Windows Mobile and Android, work at the same time.
The development of the new technologie for mobile phones is in its support.
The VMware company cooperates with European and American operators to make tests of virtualization of smartphones, and these phones will reach customers during 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains concern hotels
Not only teleskins maintainers in Krkonoše are worried about the swimming clouds.
The lack of snow makes people not book ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in Krkonoše you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including for Nochebuena and Nochevieja.
We have many visitors on our pages.
People look at the offers, check the prices, but it is still scared of booking with commitment.
And if they call us, ask them immediately about our opinion, whether these Navities will have nest or barr," said the maintenant of the Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to pass in Špindlerヴ Mløn a Nochevieya according to their expectations, they should not doubt anymore in reserving the stay.
Those who prefer to burn the money and put the quality of accommodation in second place, may try to wait for more days.
The hotels of Špindleräv Mløn offer all weekly stays for Nochevieja.
I think they will continue to offer, but they will soon fall and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will be sold quickly, estimated Jandur.
Ingotours, a Vrchlabi travel agency, continues to offer free beds for all the winter dates.
Now what's more interesting is the shipment week, which is not yet complete.
The half of the places offered remains free.
This is why we have prepared some last shipping stays," said the director of Ingtours Petr Schiffert.
Vrchlabí’s travel agency can also offer the Nochevieja in Krkronoše, but there are less free places.
The first twenty-five days of February are also very well sold, the remaining winter dates are regularly sold.
This year the interest in winter stays is damaged by the lack of snow in Krkronoše.
People are waiting to see if there will be snow.
No one wants to pass the end of the year in the mountain without snow.
If the skins remain swimming during the week, the date of Christmas will also be exhausted," Schifert believes.
On the contrary, it is a little more easy to take the rooms in the Horizont Hotel in Pec Pod Snśkou; the last year was more difficult.
We're about five percent better.
For Christmas and Christmas, we have the last free places.
The interest increased during the Poland holidays in January and February also is sold well," reported the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
The 80 per cent of Nochevieja stays are already busy in the Omnia hotel, near the central parking in Janské Láznś.
On the contrary, in the latest hotel in Janské Láznś in Christmas, half of the beds is still free.
This January was a great surprise for us, since we found about 60 percent of the occupation capacity.
Feb has been a bit more weak, but as a black cage, the interest in stays in Krkonoše will be safely increased, mentioned Erik Sporysch, the director of the hotel Omnia.
However, at the moment it seems to be the hotels of Krkronoše will pass the sneeping wines waiting for them.
The juvenile must fall the temperatures and, if there are precipitations, the mountains should be nervous.
But afterwards the temperatures will be slow, Jiśí Jakubský of Hradec Kralové, the Hydrometeological Institute of the Czech Republic.
U.S.: Repeating is the mother of wisdom
It is cooke that Barack Obama, the President with the most intelligent man's reputation, as a diligent student in the question, afgane the strategy of his predecessor, which he himself took for the most stupid.
When finally revealed his Afghan approach, expected with anxiety, it was shown that it was a copy of the guide used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only in the same text is used several times the "equivalent to in Iraq," but it was not able to use the title of the Bush declaration of January 2007 for its own declaration: "A new way forward".
He himself, who three years ago, criticized Bush's idea to send new military refugees to Iraq, the country suffering by civil war, and that criticized it as "unresponsive decision and with catastrophic consequences".
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, based on field capital recommendations, was the only possible and successful, so that today nothing is spoken of Iraq in news.
Bush's reputation did not improve, however, objectively left his successor a very much more favourable initial situation than it had to be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama is expected to repeat the miracle.
The field captains returned to ask you to increase the military contingent, especially the chief of the Afghan Operation General Stanley McCristal. He, even in spite of the traditional subordinated relationships, subjected the undecisive shuttleers in the White House to a hard criticism.
He requested 40,000 men to improve the situation.
The President was slaughtered for three months, but there was nothing better to happen, so at least it was inflicted to the General over 10,000 military.
It has made it possible that Europe would promise you more than 5,000, although it was previously counted with at least 10,000.
The most problematic of the entire Obama strategy seems to be its goal, starting to retire the Afghanian troops in 18 months and end this procedure in three years.All the doctrine of Obama generated more questions than the answers he offered.
Many doubt that the increase is the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the frastricted wars in the past years, the society of Iraq is relatively well-organized, and its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: it is impossible to trust anyone and is not fulfilled with any agreement.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, if they are adjusted to change the head every day according to their needs.
The political institutions, although formally established, will continue to be only a people of Potemkin and will remain the patriarchal tribal relations.
Equilibration of interests from different ethnic groups is extremely complicated because of confused relations, even more complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even establishing a state that is "action capability", a minimum goal of all the operation, seems very real.
The horizon of the Obama strategy for voluntaryism.
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to be slow, and now it is at the point of stealing.
Only a Romantic soul, who doesn't know anything of the reality, can believe that militarys sent to the war so that they "return soon to home," they will do a miracle here.
From the political point of view, the date of the retirement of the troops is purely irresponsibility, since the Talibans will consider it as an indirect statement of the US derogation.
The last summit of the OTAN has demonstrated that Europeans are increasingly less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, and they do not want to explain their electors what relationship the security of Germany or Italy is with the war with India Kush.
The other factor, which is rootly able to affect the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to impede, and increased sanctions do not exercise any effect on Iran, the United States must take a difficult decision: try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to find answers exactly when, according to Obama, America starts the triunphal retirement of the armies of Afghanistan.
However, each solution will mean a dramatic revision for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is that there are no three years for the presidential elections and therefore there is still a long time to find another strategy, if this results in a total failure.
Goldman Sachs bank guides will not be re-earned to the bonus
The US Goldman Sachs' executives of the US bank will not receive the bonus in effectiveness this year.
The entity announced it to react to the hard criticism of its salary practices.
The group of 30 guidelines shall receive, instead of money, actions that cannot be sold within a minimum of five years.
Furthermore, actions may be removed in the case of excessive risks.
According to the Reuters Agency, Goldman Sachs became leader in the effort to join bonus in Wall Street with the long-term power.
I believe that Wall Street is fully aware of the longest way to be undertaken, mentioned the former investor banker of the JPMorgan Douglas Elliott entity.
The problem is in details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank had the criticism of almost $17,000 million (approximately $300,000) for bonuss, in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of goods in the entity for this year, according to the Reuters Agency, probably exceeds, despite the today announced measure of $20,000.
High bonuss in the banking sector became, with the arrival of the financial crisis, a delicate topic in policy.
The Great Britain announced the Monday that he plans to write only once, with a tax of 50 per cent, the bonuss for bankers that exceed 25,000 litres (approximately 712.000 CZK) .
France is also preparing similar measures.
Women received the Nobel Prizes in all less physical categories
Five women, which is a record number, received today in Stockholm from King Carlos XVI Gustavo of Sweden the Nobel Prizes of this year, in specialized and literature categories.
In addition to the four sciences, he also set a German writer of Roman origin, Herta Muller among the premises.
The Nobel Medical Prize received him two American Biologists, Elizabeth Indonesia and Carol Greider, as well as his companion Jack Szostak for the research on chromosomes.

This amount in each category is of up to ten million Swedish coronas (approximately 25 million Czech coronas).
In the case of several premiums in each category, the premium shall be paid between themselves.
The most traditionally expected Nobel, the Peace, received it tonight in Oslo, Norway, the US President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he recognized the controversy that he had been premised, since it is at the beginning of his career and also at the head of a country participating in two wars: in Iraq and Afghanistan.
However, to defend its policy, he added that wars are essential in certain situations to achieve peace, although their price is high.
Minister Janota considers the division. Klaus invited him to Castillo
President Vaclav Klaus will receive Tuesday morning to the Minister of Eduard Janota, who is planned to remain in the government, since it is not in accordance with the State budget version for the year coming, adopted on Thursday by the Chamber of Members.
The budget, and may also Janota's stay in the office, will be the topics of its Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the crisis of public finances.
On the quote he informed President Radin Ochvat.
About his stay in the role, Janota wants to negotiate Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the Budgetary Act, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should rule with a deficit of 163,000 million Koreans.
However, the Chamber of Members adopted the left proposals for fund transfer and increased the money for staff loans, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government is not in line with the social-democratic proposals, since it is clearly making a increase in budgetary deficit.
Among the left side and the government, Klaus and the right one, there was a serious conflict of internal policy. As a result of this conflict, the future activities of the fisher bureaux officer, which was agreed in spring by the ODS, ŠSSD and the Green Party.
The critics claim that the budget, in the version adopted by the Chamber of Members, actually liquids the pack of abortion measures that the Government of Fisher is imposed on the driving public debt.
Klaus can but must not sign the State budget law; today he declared during a breakfast with entrepreneurs that politicians had long-term disappointing "the serious problem," namely, "the non-sufficient deficit" of the public facility.
He said he has no longer a good solution today.
Only a strong government, which can be supported in a broader consensus between the political parties, could improve this situation, believe the President.
The leader of ODS Mirec Topolánek mentioned that the budget is amazing and that the government should think about its future existence.
The Vice-President of the ODS, Petr Nečas, said for  yang is the concept of the bureaucratic office with the support of s.S.S., ODS and the Greens, is obviously not already working.
The first minister Fischer reacted and qualified similar words of "forced sense".
The chief of SSD, Jiśí Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit is a huge, prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek. It will overcome the 20 million colonies.
Thursday, SSD said that the adoption of the State budget for the year that was successful.
The people were also content.
Mandala in the new film of Clint Eastwood, interpreted by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that the new film of Hollywood, Invitus: Invencible, reports much about the country, its fight and their victories, although some critics say that the protagonist roles play the American actors.
The story speaks of sports, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The incantable fighter against the racist apartment regime in South Africa and his first black President Nelson Mandela is interpreted in its biography by the American actor of a Oscar, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said Mandela, 91 years old, asked him to interpret him in Eastwood film.
Another important role plays Matt Damon.
I said to her, "When I interpret, I have to have access to you.
The actor of seventy and two years, receiving the prize for his role in the Eastwood Drama over the world of the Millennium Dollar Bay, played the role of the leader of the movement by aboling slavery, who had been slaves, from the President of the United States, and even God in Evan Allpower. But rarely represented someone who still lived and, for many people, is so important as Mandela.
The former South African statist passed 27 years in prison for its activities to end the apartment in the South African Republic.
It was put in freedom in 1990 and for four years became President of the country.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invitus - Invencible is a Latin word and the title of a poem of the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was talking like he
The film is a real history about Nelson Mandela, who joined his forces with the captain of the South African Ruby team, Francois Pienär, to help join the country. Mandela, the new President, knows that after the apartment of his nation, his country remains racial and economically shared.
It believes that it is able to join his people through sport, and therefore it is decided to join Rúby players, which belong worldwide to outsides.
South African team reached the World Copa in 1995.
Freeman worked several years so that Mandela's history comes to the Chineses.
I had no other goal to play this role so that it was the most likely to be real, said Freeman.
Of course, the biggest challenge was talking like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were out of the same area, he had tried to meet with Mandela, dinner with him, be between publishers before his speech.
The most important thing was that I wanted to stretch his hand to Mandela.
I found that when I smell his hand, I received your energy, this is transmitted and had the sense of knowing how you feel, said.
For me, it's important to try to turn me into a different person.
Matt Damon played the role of François Pienär, the captain of the national ruby team, where the white players predominated.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the hard world of ruby.
A great surprise to him was, when he finally met first time with Pienar in his house.
I remember calling the door, he opened and the first thing I told to François Pienär in my life was: "In the film I look much higher."
Despite the obvious differences between the persons of the actors and their real models, and under the management of Eastwood Director Invitus: Invencible received positive reviews and is also talking about ambitions for Oscar.
The criticism of the Daily Variety magazine Todd McCarthy summarised his evaluation with the words: "It was a very good story, a very good film."
In film reviews on the rotentomatoes.com website, Invitus received a hundred percent of positive evaluations.
The secret of the splendor on Norway resolved: Russians tested a missile
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed on Norway.
The Russian Defence Minister has concluded yesterday when acknowledging that near the borders with Norway made evidence of a Baltic intercontinental mix.
The launch again failed. The missile, of type "Bulava" previously intended to be the proud of Russian army, is converting into the pigeons of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimír Putin.
Not even his repeated presence in the tests of the mixel has had the desired effect on the success of test flights.
Bulava, in most cases, has not been flying or an air failure occurred.
In the Russian newspapers, "Bulava" is written as "a missile that doesn't fly".
A missile that doesn't fly, but light.
During the 13th test, there was no problem at the beginning.
At the end of the flight, new technical problems occurred on the device.
The engine probably stood in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulava" was launched from the submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which was flewn on the White Sea.
This type of mixed potentials the launch from a ship that is moved and is switched at once.
Therefore it is likely that the mystery light on Norwegia, caused by an unidentified volunteer object, actually out of the failure "Bulava".
The norwegs equal since the first time did not wake into the treatment of a Russian missile.
Generals this time are defended by claiming that it is not just possible to talk about a failure.
The first two stages of the mixel were slow, and the slaughter took place in the third.
In previous cases, engines were immediately experienced in the first stage.
Although no launch was completely interrupted without errors, according to the management of the Department of Defence only six of the thirty failed.
The success of almost 50 percent filled with optimism to generals and therefore continues to say that "Bulava" will fly without problems and that it will even lead to ten nuclear hyperonic blocks, the total total weight of 1.15 tonnes.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA of Moscow in the 51 years
Legendary Viacheslav Fetisov will return to the 51-year-old age to a professional hockey meeting.
The former world's camp, Olympic camp and winner of the Copa Stanley will help your CSKA Moscú team and may play Wednesday in KHL's duty against San Petersburg.
Fetisov finished his professional career at the age of 40 years in 1998 and currently presided the CSKA.
After Denis Kuyash has been blessed, we need urgently another defender.
Fetisov is constantly practiced and has been committed to help the team.
We only need to solve some formal matters, quoted the AP Agency in Sergei Nemchinov, the trainer of the club of Moscow.
It is still not clear if the return of the famous player will refer to a single game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can bring up the spirit of the other players, mentioned Nemchinov.
According to AP if Fetisov returns to the glass players, it will be converted into the longest professional player of Russian hockey.

Hyundai complied with the requirements of the syndicates. He will cancel all the additional work
The address of the car manufacture in Nošovice agreed with the trade unions to cancel all the additional work.
Only by the frequency supplementary work, the syndicates declared Monday the emergency for swimming.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vanśk, the portable of the Hyundai car manufacture.
The direction, however, wants to agree with the trade unions for this year more Saturday round.
We cannot resign our manufacturing plan because it is essential. That is why we propose voluntary voluntary work for Saturday 19 December, i.e., it is, it will work in two tours, said Vanśk.
According to the Sedmička.cz server, the company offered 400 CZK bonus to employees working on Saturday round.
The bonus will also be paid on Saturday, 28 November.
According to Vaśka, the company decided to change the way to motivate its employees with the additional work offered.
Employees can cover the bonus for additional hours or take a free day on 28 December, i.e., a day of long-term shipfasts, mentioned Vanśk.
In addition, all the employees of the Sunday tours will receive money for travel and food.
Since the supplementary work was the most urgent and problemtic point of comments and complaints of the sindicalists and routineists who stopped the manufacture last week, the address last night decided to immediately cancel all the additional work for December, mentioned Vanśk.
The employees of the car factory were obliged to work over two hours more than eight hours, and this situation was almost every day until last week.
After the signing of the agreement, the syndicates shall cancel the emergency of the slaughter.
Another negotiation between the manufacture direction and the sindicalists must be held on Monday morning.
The chief of the Unions Petr Kuchaś said on Thursday, that if they were bound to comply with the requirements and to sign the document, they are willing to cancel the emergency by sweet.
The situation in the car factory last week was aggravated on Thursday, when about 400 employees spontaneously entered into a shock for the frequent additional work.
They also protested against the bad payment conditions and the smooth.
The address believed that employees had to work for additional hours to meet the requirements and to provide cars.
Syncologists in their statement of emergency by Monday, also required no employees, that the past Wednesdays interrupted the manufacture, were punished in any manner.
As regards supplementary work, trade unions require the minimum reduction of the company.
Furthermore, this year require a reward of 5,000 colonies for this work.
The car factory in Nošovice Hyundai is currently 2,000 employees.
The series manufacture was started last November.
Up to September, about 80,000 cars were produced; its current production potential is of 200,000 cars per year.
Checa discovery: an effective substance until HIV's 'callered' virus
The Czech and German scientist team provides evidence of new compositions to modify HIV propagation in the body
The main advantage of this improved substance is the fact that it is also effective against drugs resistant viruses.
In some cases, this is more important than the fact that the composition is not so effective in a common variant of virus, as well as some accessible medicines already.
AIDS can not be curated until now.
However, the life of patients can be significantly extended by a mixture of medicines that prevent HIV virus replication in the body.
However, your use has many secondary effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely eliminated, anti-resistent viruses will be created; against them, the medicines do not work.
The work of the experts of the three Institutes of the Scientific Academy of the Checa Republic, VšCHT Praga and Haidelberg University shows the possibility of dominating the resistance of the virus.
They have demonstrated that substances called metabolism have an impact on the album, responsible for dissemination of HIV virus.
The metals are composed of bow, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compositions block the propagation of the virus in a different way than all the medicines currently used, and so they can solve resistance problem.
In their work, scientists find new, “measured” composed, prepared by knowing the molecular linking to the virus album.
Metadatabolans have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyeder jaulas composed of bow, hydrogen and carbon atoms are combined by metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
Trailer and resistant virus
HIV proteasis is an album of HIV virus, and is essential for the vital cycle of virus.
Without HIV protection, HIV virus fraction is not produced and it would not be created matures and infected tumors of the virus.
If we stop HIV proteins, we also stop the dissemination of the virus in the patient's body, scientists explain in a press news published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemology at the Scientific Academy of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the Scientific Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compositions, in which two couples of jaulas (see table) are united by a short organic series that continues to be systematically modified.
A little more weak, but more effective
The test of the effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was carried out in probete, as well as against their resistant variants, obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metabolisms in the common enzyme variant is not so strong as in clinically used medicines, but do not lose their effect on resistant variants, in which medicines often do not work.
The mechanism of the unique effect, its other qualitys such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes makes, that metabolisms are interesting for research to propose effective medicines against HIV, says Pavlin  yang is the head of the laboratory of the structural biology in the Institute of organic and biochemical chemicals and the Institut of molecular genetics in the Science Academy.
ODS attacked Fisher, he defends himself
The ODS Mirec Topolánek head said that the budget adopted for the year that comes is "spanned" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, according to him, consider its future existence.
The Declarations of ODS were indicated by the First Minister as strong sentences.
They say the time is left for the analysis.
The Vice-President of the ODS Petr Nečas said that the concept of the bureaucratic office with the support of SSD, ODS and the Green Party is obviously not already working.
According to Nečas, the first minister must decide whether in the room of Members wants to be supported in minority, trying to fight the growing deficit, or if he wants to remain in his position with the support of the left parliamentary.
The attitude of ODS and social democracy towards the problem of public deficit is completely different, warned Nečas.
The camera of Members last night adopted the budget for 2010, however, with the left amended proposals, for more than 12 million colonies.
The Chamber of Members increased the money for state officers, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government reaffirmed the ODS proposals, as the budget deficit was fully increased.
The Czech Republic should rule with the deficit of 163 million colonies.
ODS before the vote went out of the room and thus complied with the Government ' s desire, that the amended budget is better than a provisional budget.
Delusion and inutility
The Minister of Hacienda, Eduard Janota, spoke of disappointment and feeling of inutility; the first Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will return to assess the current situation.
Nevertheless it is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened the division in the case of the amending proposals, the situation could be different.
According to śeskaá TV Janota, he requested a meeting with the first minister.
He signaled, you're thinking of staying in the role.
The reason is that it is for its disappointment for the budget negotiations.
If fisher agrees with another struggle against the budget deficit, according to Nečas in the government, there is nothing to do with the named s.S.SD, which implies the changes in the budget.
The first minister should also clearly say, if the camera approve other laws that increase the deficit, for example, those relating to aid in diseases, residents, or the amendment of the Service Law.
Topolanek: Ministers appointed by ODS are not guilty
It's the matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers appointed by the ODS did nothing bad, underlined Topolánek in the U.S. text news.
He recalled that in several ministers in local posts there are people belonging to the TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if fisher decided to resign the principle of the struggle with the deficit of the public facility, "is absolutely logical and correct, which is supported by the left majority, which is currently in the camera of deputy".
However, it is not possible to contain support and tolerance of ODS members.
I did not think about this, when it is the moment, I will take care of it, said to the journalists in the chamber of Members the Minister of Defence Martin Bartak, which was appointed for the government exactly by the ODS members.
The first Prime Minister Fischer came to a meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
ODS gave a request to the Prime Minister
Nečas stressed that the Sunday in the chamber of Members would probably vote against the amended budget if the first minister did not request the ODS Members to accept the budget.
We do not feel as orphans, we are not small children, reacted to the question, if ODS is not concerned about the absence of the party head in Parliament and in the Czech Republic during the budget negotiations.
I didn't understand that my voice was missing.
On the basis of the mandate, he knew that in the next months, in particular, the slaughter of the chamber and the destruction of all the positive, he reacted to Polandek itself.
According to the new time of trains  yang are driving less trains by almost the same rates
śeské draphy (Ferrocarriles Checos) from 13 December will cancel or restrict some fast and local trains less used and, on the other hand, strengthen some links.
The total enlargement of traffic will be reduced in two percent compared to today's day, after the new time of trains between in force.
Most tariffs include the basic price and customer price will not change.
More opportunities for capital links will win, for example, the inhabitants of the Ostravsko region, draphy for this line will add pendolian unchartery.
The direct train, on the contrary, will not be moved back to Bratislava.
On the Praga line - Pisek - śeské Budåjovice will drift less fast trains, the direct links of Praga - Letohrad will be limited.
In the regions, the largest decrease of the drapy transport is in the Hradec Kralové region, eight per cent in total, the transport will be increased in Prague and the surrounding regions.
Two night trains will also be cancelled in Praga - Tábor - śeské Budæjovice and some fast trains on the Prague line - Pisek - śeské Budšovice will be reduced only a few days of week.
One of the largest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice must change in Lysá nad Labem.
This is the 15th line of the Esko system, around the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrication of Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
The long distance links to the capital will end in the Hlavní Praga station.
✔D will introduce more SC Pendolino links between Praga and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jesenik every two hours.
From 13 December, travellers will not return to Bratislava in Pendolino.
The account for the regional railers of this year: 200 million more than previously
Speed trains are charged and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the demonstrable losses of Drahy will receive the year that comes four million coronas in total as this year. Local trains are managed by the regions, the year that will be paid to eight million colonies in total, and the State will help them almost three million.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more costs.
For fast and local draphy trains have a new 10-year-old contract, until now the contract was always a year.
Drahy is satisfied with the system, and maybe they did not increase the prices of a large majority of the shoes.

For travellers without customer card the price śD Net will increase from 450 coronas to 600 coronas.
The price of eLiška will depend on the distance, until now there was 160 colonies' unique price for travel between any two regional cities.
Philippian armies still stopping more than 50 persons, children were placed in freedom
The army have been in the south of the Philippines, including several students of a primary school and their teachers.
Thus, the AFP Agency, which previously informed only about 65 seconds.
All 17 children detained and a teacher were after eight hours placed in freedom.
The sequence occurred in the South Agusan province.
They say that about 19 armed men use their rehens as a living shock in the flight before the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree on the delivery of the remaining residents.
According to the AFP Agency, weapons belong to the New Popular Armed (NPA), a armed fraction of the Communist Party of Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP Agency, the police had previously persecuted seculars because of violence, whose cause was the adjustment of the accounts between two local families.
In the south of the Philippines in the province of Maguindanao was due to the recent murder, where 57 people died.
Among the victims of the murder of November 23, in relation to the elections of the Governor, were 30 journalists.
For the suspect of the involvement in the murder, they arrested the ruler of this province in the south of Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, a patriarch of an influenced dinasty of the Ampatuans.
In the island of Mindanao also operate Muslim separators.
However, they renewed peace dialogues with the Philippine Government.
The history of RSA refers to the world, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the next days, in the United States, a new film of Hollywood, Clint Eastwood Invitus (the official title isInvitus: Neporaśenī), which captures a part of the biography of the former President of the South African Republic of Nelson Mandela.
The role of the worldly-known fighter against the apartheid is Morgan Freeman, who has chosen for the protagonist role Mandela itself.
The second paper, the legendary campion in rhoby Francoise Pienar, interpreted it Matt Damon.
With the star, the reactions of the critics and the public are born
Direct pressure on that. It's okay, it's okay. Let me see it.
His full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. He was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988, the Sacharov Prize received for the freedom of thinking, in 1993, near Klerk, the Nobel Prize of Peace.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa in the 1994-1999 years.
Great hopes, since it comes to the public at the time, when in the Republic of South Africa they culminate preparations for the world campaign in fotbol, and then the media are stressed by alarming news about the growing racial hate and the discrimination of the inhabitants by the most black dominant.
According to the AP News Agency, the reactions to this new film in RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of the protagonist papers by Hollywood 's little interesting' stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, says that he is proud of the new film.
For many years, I dreamed with the role and was well prepared to play it.
Sometimes I found me in a person with Nelson Mandela, as it says - to cover your energy, he mentioned in an interview after the festival star in Los Angeles.
I think it's good, if we can remember the personality and message of Mandela through the film.
It is a story of the Republic of South Africa, but it refers to the whole world, added.
In the clothing of the National Rurby Team
The film is based on the book of the British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated in the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game born the nation. Return to the South African lawyer of human rights during its first election period.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to join two groups of people, racially and for years separated. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also put the clothes of the South African National Ruby team and entered into the game field. RSA wins the world coffee.
By entering the gram into the clothes, which is considered in RSA as something almost sacred, Mandela won great ovations, especially all of the white public and the recognition of the white people.
The fútbol campion may be able to help people join and form a nation, mentioned the ruby player Chester Williams, the only "nick" in the national team in 1995.
It will still be seen, if it improves the situation in the RSA.
The South Africans, however, are sceptic, as he said in a recent interview for LN, a rumby Christopher Dawson, who fled from his country to Britain.
The campaign started on 11 June 2010.
In Lunsko, a transformer has a value of tens of millions of coronas
The fire stood for morning a transformer of the company śeps in a box of interruptor near the village of Vøškov in Lounsko.
According to Lukáš Marvan, the portion of the bombs in the Usti region, the fire is extensive by six groups.
Before the bombs wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by the fire, but later they changed the opinion and the fire is expansive with a mixture of water, spum and a special extractor material.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the circle of the transformer.
There were no wounds, according to Pavla Mandatov, the company's voice, that it was not in danger of the safe operation of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is of a number of millions of coronas, it will not exactly be possible before the fire is removed.
According to Mandatov, the transformer will be replaced by a new.
During the ten years of the activity of Šeps did not happen anything similar, this type's experiences are sporadic, added.
According to Sona Holingerova Hendrychov, the company slaughter for the northern Chequia, the suppliers of the electric flow had not been cut, and the fire of the electric substance does not affect homes, offices and companies.
A.s. påepsphi on the territory of the Czech Republic as an exclusive maintainer of the distribution system, the electric driving of 400 kV and 220 kV.
Conserves in good state, renews and develop 39 interruptor boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the electrical energy of the distribution system to the distributor system, also maintains the electric driving 4339 miles long.
Jančura will submit a calumnia complaint to three terms of SSD
The owner of the University of Radim Jančura will present a calumnia complaint to three social democratic themes.
This is the Michal Hašek of the Jihomoravskī kraj, Radko Martínek de Pardubickī kraj and the slamm of Olomouckī kraj Martin Tesaśík.
Jančura mentioned it in twenty minutes in Radiośurnal.
The request must be addressed with the firm's efforts, maintaining regional rail transport in some regions.
However, all regions have finished signing long-term contracts with śeské drapy.
All three hormones are attacking us and talking about the fact that we are "we're going to pass the past," but we're only taking the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They claim, that we are more precious than the Drahy, what isn't true. We know the prices of śeské drapy, which were fixed last week.
So there's no other thing to defend us.
It's through the calumnia towards the University Agency, said to Radioæurnal Jančura.
He mentioned the tests of all regions, and it has not taken necessary measures in harmony with European law.
That is why it is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Hašek considers this complaint for the continuation of the mediaal show of Mr Jančura, which serves as a free advertising for his company and for himself.
Of course I'm prepared to defend my good reputation and of my region, and I call the other theme to do it too.
I think that in this case also will be clearly shown that Mr Jančura handle the public in the matter of the regional rail transport and uses false and false arguments, mentioned Hašek.
Jančura announced the last week, which would invest a number of millions of colonies in the advertising, whose aim would be to warn these measures in the regions.
Radiośurnal told him that he would interrupte the campaign after Christmas and want to continue to continue after the new Year.
He needed that the campaign would be taken against corruption as such.
Jančura initiated the campaign after the regions agreed with the Dragy in maintaining regional rail links and the load of about 150 million colonies did not convoke a tender.
According to Jančura’s similar steps, the law and the opinion of the European Court is in deficiency.
Jančura said he was threatened by a Member of SSD because of its criticism of the rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was that if we don't leave it, we can lose bus licenses.
It has been presented as a deputy from SSD, I know, what is the matter, and I will not say his name, said Jančura today for Radioṣṭurnal.
The neumococal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The neumococal vaccine from January will end the habitual habitats.
As the first vaccine must be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, there are opinions that the obligatory vaccine would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccine against neumocotics culminate.
The Medicine Institute is already fixing the maximum vaccines prices, which will be covered by the insurance companies.
The experts have already clearly made it in the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
From January to January the neumococal vaccine can receive children born since 2 August of the last year.
The condition is not receiving any dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started with the vaccine last year or before, they must also cover other doses of the vaccine.
The first dose of the vaccine must be received between the third and the fifth month of age of child.
Last year, the fourth part of the families left volunteerly vacun to their children against the Niumocotics.
The parents, however, paid for a dose of 1600 corones and more.
In order to vaccinate the smaller children, four doses are needed.
Experts generally estimate that insurance companies will cost in vacuums from 300 to 450 000 coronas annually.
Without shock, the treatment will be shocked, which is necessary for non-vacuated children.
Up to now the state has spent about 5000,000 annually invasion of children.
The covered vaccination was started by the named Janota package.
Neumococ is the cause of media otitis, but also of serious infections including meningitis and septicemia.
From neumococal infections in our country each year, 28 children in hospitals are not older than 10 years old.
In addition to the Czech Republic, the neumoccal vaccine covered in children was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be obliged?
However, it appears to be views that this vaccine could be binding in the future.
From January must be covered by the insurance and voluntary companies.
The obligatory vaccine would be better, for example, marked by Rudolf Kalovský, the head of the civilian association Nahlas.
Your association has spread the neumococal vaccines for many years.
Experts at an international conference, in which our association was participated, were not fully satisfied with the fact that we had the voluntary vaccine.
It's not completely ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased to achieve at least this.
I think this is the way we have to do now, mentioned Kalovský.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against neumocotics.
At this time, we did not think about it absolutely, said his Vlastimil Sršeś.
Voluntary vaccine has its devenge, claims doctors
The President of the Odborna pediactor society spoleænost practikæch dætskæch lekaś Hana Cabrnochova acknowledged that the voluntary vaccine has its deventures.
If all children receive the vaccine, it can be reasoned about the reduction of the dose number. "In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, we understand the political decision to have initiated vaccination as voluntary", says Cabrnochov.
Experts expect that from the year older than 80 percent of youth parents will take vacuum against their children.
The neumococal vaccine is also a great change, as the first vaccination in children is covered by healthy companies, not by state.
Insurance companies should cost more money in the profilaxis, so that the treatment is later, explains Cabrnochov.
The doctors will have to buy the vaccines for themselves.
However, the pediactors are worried about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be purchased by the insurance companies and distributed to the doctors, as if the state gives them other vaccines.
Some Members had feared, however, that insurance companies could "have the money of health insurance".
The doctors will therefore have to buy the vaccines and wait until they are paid by the insurance companies.
It is estimated that the pediactors will invest in the vaccines 40 thousand per month, which is a notable amount.
It'll be nothing easy, says Cabrnochov.
The son of a American artist involved "in the rob of a museum"
The son of the renomeed American fantasy artist, Frank Frazetta, has been accused of trying to steal images valued in $20 million (12 million) of his father's museum.
The Pennsylvania police states that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was arrested while he loaded 90 squares in his vehicle and his remolque.
They claim that Frazetta and another man used a scavator to smile in the museum, in the region of the Pocon Mountains.
Fracetta father, 81 years old, is famous for his representation of persons such as Conan the Barbaro and Tarzan.
The Agency of Associated Press reported that the artist was in Florida at the moment of the incident.
AP reported that a non-identified police officer claimed that a family debate could have motivated the young Frazetta.
The Agency reported that the 52-year-old child, Frazatta son, declared to the police that his father had commanded him "in the museum for any means to transfer all tables to a deposit".
The Agency said that Frazetta's father refused to have granted such permission.
Worker Party defends budget increases
Ministers have defended tax increases and expenditure in the pre-budgetary report, against the criticism of opposition, companies and trade unions.
The Conservors said that Alistair Darling "dispersed" was an opportunity to show their seriousness on the recovery of the deficit, delaying the decisions until after the elections.
The Minister of Hacienda also acknowledged hard criticism by harming workers of low and mediumsized income.
Among its main proposals are 0.5 per cent of the social security expenditure and 1 per cent in the public sector ' s salary agreements since 2011.
Co-operation for Social Security
Syndicates regretted that workers with low salary were punished by a recession generated by others, and warned about future "problems".
The increase in the social security expenditure, which will grow around 3 billion libraries per year, has encouraging the business community, which claims that this is a tax on employment, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those who win more than 20,000 £ per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
CLAVES OF THE ANTERIAIR INFORM AUTHORISATION
Social security with an increase of 0.5 per cent, from April 2011
Economy will be more than expected 4,75 % this year
New tax of 50% on banking funds
1 point of expenditure on corporations for small signs was deleted
Taxes for electric vehicles and wind turbines
State pension would increase 2.5 %
According to the estimates of the Hacienda Ministry, a person who wins 30,000 £ will lose 90 £ per year and who won £ 40,000 will lose £ 190 while a person who wins £ 10,000 per year will win £ 110.
The ministers said that their aim to reduce half of the deficit for 2013 involved " difficult decisions", but 60 per cent of the additional tax load would be of 5 per cent of the higher payments.
The Minister of Hacienda, Stephen Timms, refused that tax decreased expenditures and delineed expenditures would be a "a sand grain in the wilderness" compared with what was needed.
"These are large figures. It will allow us to reduce the deficit to half, which is absolutely essential for the next four years," he said to BBC.
Mr. Timms said he had confidence that the economy would grow back to the end of the year.
However, the workshop's prognostics regarding future economic growth, which will affect the amount to request and the rapidity of the deficit, were questioned after the Minister of Hacienda had been obliged to change the first figures.
In its declaration, it stated that the economy would probably be 4,75 % this year, much worse than the reduction of 3,5 % prognosed in April, while the loan application would be 3 billion £ above the previous estimated.
"Opportunity dispersed"
The Conservators, who will start a new campaign to publish the juvenile, warning about "the debt crisis" of the laborist party, said that the projection of securities for $789 million for the next six years was unsubsidible.
The Ministers failed to present a credible plan on the way they returned money, accompanied, "cinically" the difficult options before the elections to be held in June 2010.
"They have not included anything significant about what they will do," said the Minister in the shadow of the Hacienda Ministry, Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do it and have dispersed it."
"All important advertisements will be done after the elections, who wins"
Roger Bootle, Deloite
The laborist party stresses that schools, hospitals and the police of future counterparts will be protected, unlike conservatory proposals, which would seek a greater deficit reduction in the shorter timely deficit.
However, the Democratic Liberals claimed that the money recovered by tax increases and expenditure costs would be used to support the costs of the next year, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that projects would be as "sanecastles".
BBC's political editor, Nick Robinson, said that the time chosen for advertising, such as the increase in inflation of some subsidies by incapacity in April next, mentioned above, would leave the Minister of Hacienda exposed to the accused of electoral manipulations, since the money could only be recovered in the next year.
However, the Labour Party insists that people are providing it most necessary and will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False Budget"
Although the ministers did not publish the expenditure data later to 2011, the economics said that the adjustment of the public expenditure would only be felt in a mid-term term.
The respected Institute of Fiscal Studies stated that Hacienda's Minister's figures have involved substantial recovery in many areas, potentially included in the future transport, higher education, science and defence.
"This is really placing pain for further." said his director, Robert Chote.
"All important advertisements will come after the election, who won't win", added Roger Bootle, economic advisor of the Deloite containers.
"This has been the false report before the budget, and the markets are taking account of this."
The FBI is in charge of the "Americans detention in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the detention in Pakistan of five suspected American men of extremist connections.
The US Embassy in Pakistan told the BBC that men were arrested in a house in Sarhoda, the Eastern Province of Punjab.
FBI said he's investigating whether they're the same men who lost their homes in the state of Virginia, the United States, last month.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United States said that he was also looking for information on men.
Three of them are of Pakistani descendants, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemenite origin.
"If they are North American citizens, of course we will be very interested in the duties for which they have been detained and in what kind of circumstances they are retaining," said the portal Ian Kelly.
The port of the FBI, Katherine Schwi, said that the Agency was in knowledge of the detention and that he was in contact with the families of lost students.
"We're working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and nature of their business there, if indeed they were lost students," said the portavoz.
The Pakistan Ambassador in Washington said men were detained in a house belonging to the boy of one of them.
He said that the house was already in the guard of the local police, and that there were still duties against detention.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Hillary Clinton, refused to comment on detention, informed the Reuters news agency; but he said that the United States had to "work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to eliminate the terrorism infrastructure that continues to be recruited and trained."
The family of the five students declared their disappearance in North Virginia at the end of November.
International Amnistia condemned "abusus" of Iran
Human rights in Iran for the past 20 years have always been equal to disabilities, according to a report of the International Amnesty Group.
The detailed report of the regime 'the models of abuse' before and after the presidential elections held in June.
A man mentioned in the report said they had shooted him and shooted with cigarettes, and another said they threatened him by violating him.
Iran has rejected previous critics of his human rights history.
The officials have said that such critics have a political foundation.
Thousands of arrested persons and the decades killed in Iran after the election held by President Mahmoud Ahmadinjad caused the largest street protests since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Decades of persons have been sentenced, and fiscals claim that at least five persons have been sentenced to death.
The BBC Corresponsal in Teheran, Jon Leyne, who is now in London, says that during protests, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Jamenei, acknowledged some abuse accused, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak's detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance towards the critics, according to our corresponsal.
"Falsa Confidence"
Amnistía International quoted the report of Abraham Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer student, who claimed that he was accused of "working with the Facebook networks" and protesting against the result of elections.
"That often shoot me in the face," according to his words.
"I was kidnapped with cigarettes under the eyes, in the hair, in the head... they brought me up with executing and humiliating me."
Amnistia said that after five days he signed a false conviction, they solved it and left on the street, still blooding and semiconcing.
In August, the presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some detained protesters were tortured to death in prison and others were violated.
Iranian officials refused the accused of violation, but they admitted that there had been abuse.
Amnistya also quoted the case of an former detention, who claimed that they returned to a container together with 75 people over eight weeks in a prison centre in Kahrizak.
Amnistya acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judicial authority had established committees to investigate the deterioration of posts and response of the Government, but said that the mandate and powers of the bodies were confused and the comments of the parliamentary Committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 persons were arrested in the last three weeks to prevent further manifestations.
A ski track was made in the park of the city
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to convert a Bristol's interest site into a competitive track.
The Pista at the park event took 16 semiprofesional and snowboarders that compounded by premiums.
At the top of the pendant in the Brandon Hill park, there was a short salt lamp, front of a track of 100 meters of length.
John Hickman, a four-year-old medical student, said that he had a beautiful view from the top of the track, but he was quite attractive.
It looks under a beautiful view of the lights of the city titilating.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders of the gate, true talent," added.
The premiums were delivered to the best trucks or manipulations carried out on the track.
After the event on Thursday afternoon, the nest will be left.
Let's go!
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a Laico State.
At a time when Swiss voters have requested to prohibit the construction of mines and in which there is a general warning on the subject of Europe, John Bowen, a North American academic, wrote a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of the Islamics (which is actually integrated) in one of the most openly lacks of the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the last work of the author "Why the French don't Like Headcarves" (2006), a elegant and detailed study of a problem that shared and worried the country for a decade and a half years, and whose effects are still understood today.
The last book of Mr Bowen has a broader and ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropolog, you want to know not only what the political and the means about Islam in France are, but what is really happening.
Last months in mixes, schools and institutions that now provide 5-6 million French musulmans as Mr. Bowen is called "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener that plays discussions between teachers and students about questions more interesting.
Should a Muslim marry in a mixed or a junction (or both)?
Should you teach you young musulmans about the evolution and the rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a man not musulman?
Is it legitimate that a Muslim uses a banking system based on interests to obtain hypothesis?
These are apparently global issues, support, things of daily life, which concern the means more than the political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of believers, teachers and intellectuals, not one of them, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an academic and Arab scholar of Islamic Arab born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be a good musulman and a good citizen in a modern laical society.
You can't distribute this argument completely.
The conservators are so doubtful only of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thoughters and activistas that Mr. Bowen interviews have to be disappointed with its honourists of Salafi, the partisans of the Islamic purist Sunni associated with Saudi Arabia, who are currently with a small but influenced presence among the musulmans of Europe.
Bowen believes that the musulman values and the French laics may be compatible.
But adjustment requires mutual concessions.
It questions how far the French political stresses (and the intellectual eleite that so frostly defends the laicsm) are truly compromised with pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims probably have an injusticeful treatment than Catholics, protestants and Jews, who have also had to do their historical commitments with the Latin Republicanism.
More than a growing pragmaticism, it means "a value adjustment".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one has to say, "Yes, but still not."
The world's most desolidating panorama
Arctics are changing more fast and more dramatic than any other habitat of the planet.
The ice that defines it is declining to an alarming speed, bringing with you the life that can't survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fishing have been focused on recently open waters with diplomatic, lawyers and now authors as a result of this.
In "On Thin Ice" (On Thin Ice) Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, draws a natural history of the northern icon, the polar.
Knower of the complicated history and the policy of the ball castle, describes the long tradition of Arctic operators, which gave evidence of valuation infringing the white skin.
The meeting of the almirant Nelson as a valuable 14-year-old chain, fighting only with the extreme of his mosquet, is certainly a mito, but others are true.
The crys, captured while no longer following the bodies of their recent extermined mothers, were arrested and sent to zoological and circles.
A circle presentation at the beginning of the 19th century showed 75 polar bones at the same time.
Even today, zoological rings are generally a millennium part of the area of a saved adult. The climate is almost never appropriate: a polar polar in Singapore is green by the algas that grow in the areas without its snake.

Ellis recures the reports of other writers and historists, and often returns to the threat that the casters present the survival of the species.
While it is prohibited in Norway, the United States and Russia, the killing continues in Groenland and Canada, where helicopters and squimary Indians use high power shoot shuttles to defeat their arrests.
Ironically, it's in the waters toward the north of those two crowd nations where the ice will last more time.
In his new book, "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, an old editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and scattering report about the Arctic Science and a superstar view of how to transform the future of that place.
It is not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographs can correctly explain the speed of change.
It's not because of lack of effort.
The pioneer trips of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the XX century showed indications for the first time about the movement of the ice mass.
Then the cold war submarinos traced a map of the ice swimming shoes that circulated under the ice mass.
Satellite exploitations and the extensive series of sounds mounted in the icebergs are a useful supplement, but resistant people camped on the fridge still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks inside the extraordinary, a reduced world of the flowing system within the arctic ice, formed by salin water chrorrites that are tabled while frozen.
But from the skin on the surface to the shoes of the interior microscopics, they are all condemned once the summer ice is removed, which is believed to happen in some moment between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months, we could be us.
Marines between 6.000 putting coronas in Arlington's tubs
Pf. De'Angello Robinson, 19 years old, traveled seven hours in bus to put a single coron in the tube of a soldier who had never known.
For him and the other Marines that traveled from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, N.C., at the Arlington National Cementary to decourage the tumbs, it was a day to make a honour to men and women who once were on their boards.
In a few months, from where we're shipping, we could be ours, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we are us, I would like someone to do the same for me, so I just tried to show respect.
He was one of more than 6.000 volunteers who gathered on Saturday morning to put coronas in the legs of the veteranes in various sections of the Arlington Cementary.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, Coronas Worcester Company in Harrington, Maine, started the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundreds of tumbs at Arlington Cementary.
In what is already a 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen are traveling every year by stopping in different cities along the road to offer events dedicated to military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also established an ungoverned organization, Wreaths Across America, which extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers put more than 16.000 corones on the crowns of the Arlington Cementary, areas in the Pentagon, tumbs at the National Fayetteville Cementary in Arkansas, the Battery Park in New York City and the Memorial site of United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation gave more than $150,000 to purchase and transport the colonies.
Charleen Hunt, 70 years old from Westminster, said that he traveled to Arlington in honor to his husband, a deceased military carriage.
While his husband was not sepulated in Arlington, Hunt said that this was his way to make a reward to those who sacrificed.
This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops, said.
It's like to visit a family tumb.
The volunteers walked in calied clothes, through the widespread grains and crowns of the cementary.
Volunteers were directed to the older tumbs of the First World War, the Second World War and the Vietnamian war, because they did not receive so many visits as new tumbs, said the organizations.
The atmosphere was joyful while children played and the couples were taken out of the hand, while they took the fresh pipe to the sepulcral lambs.
Each circle corne was a deep green, with a small red lazo acted on the top side.
Nearly there, Section 60, where most veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan's wars were settled, it was virtually quiet.
The United Service Organizations (United Service Association for Soldiers) gave 1.000 colonies to decoration the section, but the atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People cry openly, others prayed, and families and friends supported one another in the glass air.
Some read in a high voice screwed names on stones, while others were swing to see small white and black plates put inside the shooting bar, for those who were still not completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who smile the laughs of their eyes in front of your son's tube.
He took eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the torch of the Sgto sea artillery. David Shane Spicer, who died in battle in July.
Nobody should forget why we're free... my son paid for it, said.
"More after my death, I want someone to remember it."
Cuban officials arrested a contractor of the United States government
The Cuban Government has stopped a contractor of the United States government that distributed mobiles and portable computers in the country, and claimed that the officials of the Department of State were Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Alternatives Inc, with a position in Bethesda.
The company works on customer projects such as the United States International Development Agency and the World Bank.
Consular officials together with the United States Interests Section in Habana are looking for access to the detention, which was arrested on 5 December.
Specific charges have not been made public, although in accordance with the Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be detained for almost anything that is considered as "of danger".
All anti-revolutionary activities, including less and critical protests, include the risk of arrest.
The anti-governmental graphics and speech are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an incredible blogger community, directed by the popular commentary Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how it and her husband are followed and busy by government agents.
Sánchez has requested in several opportunities to leave the country to accept prizes, but the permission has been rejected.
The detention of an American contractor may probably cause tensions between the communist government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been looking for a "low ritm" approach to improving the relationship with the island.
The New York Times was the first to tell the arrest news on Wednesday night.
The new American policy emphasizes that if the Cuban Government takes concrete measures, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition, it will be reciprocal from the United States.
Mobile and portal computers are legal in Cuba, although new products are codified in a country where the average payment of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban Government granted regular citizens the right to purchase mobiles only this year; especially for text messages, since a telephone conversation of 15 minutes would cost the daily payment.
Internet use is extremely limited in the island.
It is available in price hotels and for foreign visitors of the hotel, and in some government establishment, such as universities.
The Cubans who want to connect, often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is limited.
The detention of an American in Cuba is insufficient.
Gloria Berbena, officer of the United States Interests Section in Habana, said that most American citizens in the prison in Cuba are among crimes such as drug trafficking.
Bebena said he couldn't provide more information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly discertified.
A activities in any open society would be legal, such as distributing free mobiles, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the United States's Human Rights Organization, who recently published a hard report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, Cuba," a reference to Raúl Castro's placement as a leader of the country, to replace his sister, Brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the accused are often detained, processed and incarcerated in one day.
He pointed out that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban Government often causes a negative reaction in the United States, just when the two countries began to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials develop a complement to send men to Afghanistan
The Saturday, Pakistani authorities neutralized the brain of a compliment to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill the United States troops, showing that the case can help to develop an extensive network of terrorist reclusters, which calls the Internet for radicalized young people.
The investigators said they were persecuting a mysterious figure, known as Saifullah, who invited men to Pakistan after finding that one of them made comments by approving terrorist attacks on the YouTube video site.
Safullah directed men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in the Pakistani tribe crowd, which is a family place for Qaeda and their terrorist training fields.
But a Pakistani intelligence officer who had been informed about the case, showed the Saturday that Saifullah could not convince the Qaeda's commanders that men weren't part of a CIA compliment to be infiltrated in the terrorist network.
Thus, for several days, it was isolated in the Eastern city of Sargodha, far from the northeastern mountains, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered a part of an incubiered operation.
For this reason, the officer was rejected, who spoke from the anonymous because of the delicateness of the case.
The officer said that men did not change and even were trying to get the appropriate approval to access the Qaeda fields when the Pakistani police arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are interrogated by the FBI, highlights the critical role of the recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps the most important thing, determine who are trusting.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the United States intelligence has been the main priority to treat infiltration of people within the Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, not let those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who could be spacious.
Analysts said that Qaeda analyzes particularly the aspirant American recruitment.
But for the organization, they are a huge appreciation because of their potential to access U.S. objectives and because of the value of propaganda.
But Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst for the NEFA Foundation in the United States, said that terrorist groups have also come to much more careful in recent years with respect to whom they admitted, because the United States Intelligence Agencys have been expertized in their recruitment methods.
If you're trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way to follow the recrutement model what many have already followed? Kohlmann showed.
It has been transformed into a model that is much more based on the web.
Decades of thousands of protest in Copenhagen, demand "climical" action
On Saturday, tens of thousands of demonstrators walked here through the streets requesting negotiators working in the City's Beautiful Centre, more authentic actions for climate.
The protesters said that 100,000 people participated in the event, but the police estimated that the amount was nearer than 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a pugnad of massed activists put small explosives near a group of government buildings in the centre of the city.
In one day in the discussions about the United Nations climate, thousands of activists walked through the city by supporting pancards in English that said "No planet B" and one in Spanish that he declared, "The Earth says "Yes enough."
A number of famous protests joined me, including the Danish and photographic model Helena Christiansen, who said that the Peru journeys, the birth country of his mother, were aware of the anxious matters with which the country must lead because of the impacts of climate changes that are already happening. "
This is part of the reason I have decided to join the great manifestation, to disseminate the word and appeal to the leaders of the world, to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement.
This isn't a easy task, but it's got to do, there is no way to hear it for more time.
The police refused protesters to approach the Bella Center too much, and said that they had arrested 19 persons, mainly because of the use of mass or by bringing cups.
In accordance with the Danish law, those activities are prohibited during manifestations.
According to one witness, who asked not to be identified for being involved in climate discussions, a number of actors with sports mask and black workers put several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, which is near several ministers.
They were through the buildings, said, adding that they started as calls, but they were followed by "a couple of large explosions".
In the centre of conventions, people gathered around the television screens to watch the walk all night.
But protest was not able to spend on the consciousness of key officials like Su Wei, Chief-China negotiator on the climate.
When he was asked if I thought that the manifestation had a constructive impact on international discussions, he responded in English, "here was not so much of the situation."
Then he continued to say in Mandarin, "as the place of meeting is great, I can't hear what happens out."
He pointed out that he depended on the perspective of each person to determine whether the walk was harmful or benefitous.
He said that this shows the attention of the public in general and of different sectors to the climate change.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they affect negotiations, or the freedom of others.
Data of a test reveals persistent racial differences
The Federal Qualification Book last week on mathematics was a very good news for the Capital Division's public schools.
Although the district is still far away from the country's better performance systems, the qualifications free showed that four and eighth degree students had been angry to a faster ritm over the past two years, with regard to the citys of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is recorded in the recent figures of the National Educational Assessment is the continuing difference between African and white students, both at the local and national level.
In the past two years, the average rates of four-grade white students in D.C. increased from 262 to 270 (in a scale of 500), but their African couples increased only three points, from 209 to 212.
Indeed, the income difference increased between 2007 and 2009, 53 and 58 points.
The progress of the Africans of the eighth level remained essentially fixed, lowing a statistically unsigned point, from 245 to 244.
The average white points were not included in the test results, because the sample size was not sufficiently large.
During a six-year extension, the table is no longer alternant.
The difference between white and black students in the district in 2003, when the first ENPE was known in the district, was 60 points from the scale (262 to 202).
Although both groups' points have increased during this period, the difference has only been reduced to 58.
Some educational lawyers in the District expressed concern last week, since the advances held by Dr Michelle A. El Rhee and the Adrian Fenty alcalded M. Fenty (Democrata), were in majority stimulated by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the set by assisting those in the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, showed by Jeff Smith, Executive Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit organization that is lawful for educational equity in the District.
I do not give joy for a difference of two or three points, said the Council's member Kwame R. Brown (Dem. - For accumulation), who has a daughter at the fourth level of the Eaton Eaton.
Brown, a critical Rhee administration style, said that the message of the test points is that the secondary schools of the city have an unexpected need for care.
Clearly they always want to see the positive signs, and I respect it.
But worried is that we are not dedicating nor the time or energy necessary for our media schools.
Rhee said that the Division must continue to find better ways to address the needs of students of low performance.
This autonomy, for example, is trained to some teachers to use a new read-how, the Wilson Reading System, which is directed to students of the higher levels of primary and media school, who did not dominate the early reading foundations in their school courses and are significantly behind their pairs.
The mathematics of each day, a quarter of mathematics from childergarten up to sixth degree, which emphasizes real life games and experiences, which was introduced in the District under the former superintendent Clifford Janey, who believes something about the progress reported by the ENPE last week.
I only think we must continue working to offer the best interventions to students who are below the level, said Rhee.
Others say that ENPE results highlight whether Rhee can continue to increase the overall performance of the system and even providing additional money and resources for schools of low performance, which will be necessary to reduce the difference.
There is a kind of shocked dilema for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who studied urban test points.
The solution of conventional policy is to allocate its administrative resources and reforms to localized schools in the poorest sections of D.C.
Then the goal can generate political impacts against that important chronograph.
But the problem, of course, is that, as other urban supervisors, it is trying to spend on the white and black class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our barrier schools, so that all families, without taking into account where they live, have confidence that their children can access to a excellent public education.
Janey, now overseer of the Newark schools, said in an interview this week that a vital element to end with the performance difference is extending the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district, to competite with autonomy schools.
There must be almost 200 days to have the strength of the change, said Janey, which came to an agreement with the colleague of his teachers last year in a year of 185 days, which is considered a "indicator" to find an increase in the next convention.
Doing from higher education is part of more future
Tourist bus came to the University of Gettusburg with a strong resource.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12 years old, went down and passed for a moment before the white columns, the ladril facades and the smeraled beaches.
The parents of Graciela had only been graduated in a secondary El Salvador school.
Even soon, Graciela himself, who was born in Silver Spring and living in Riverdale, had never put a feet in a university campus.
Even so, when she and the other eighth students of the group explored Gettysburg, where the matrix costs $38,690 per year, its attitude was less the number of impressed invitations than the potential enthusiasms.
Yes, where I'm going to be! He exclaimed Graciela, whom he would like to study, when the guide announced that they had entered the building of sciences.
Cary, really?, thoughtly, when the guide talked about the low percentage of school students.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that children had visited on their trip of three days, and they had already completely absorpted their deliberate message: The question is not whether you're going to the university.
The question is what.
Although there is a growing concern for the large number of Spanish immigrants who leave the secondary school or are pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands that access to the university education they need to access the average class.
In fact, one of the five of these Spanish "second generation" has been graduated in the university, a notable achievement since many of its immigrant parents, especially the Mexicans and Central Americans, entered in the United States without finishing the secondary school.
Their success stories are important, they claim researchers, because they indicate the way to follow a generation that will play a great role in the workforce of the country.
Those who analyze the greater performance say that they often have natural benefits for schools and an innate trend to have success.
Many parents also have high goals for their children and find ways to compensate their lack of familiarity with the United States schools.
However, tutorial programmes can also play an exceptional role to help Graciela and millions of children as it reaches university, especially if efforts are being supported at the time.
Observing the children of low income, whose parents do not have the experience and ability to help them navigate through the system, it is deducted that any intervention at any time will not solve it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davids, who has studied Latin students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from the garden of children to secondary school.
The federal program that financed the turn by Graciela universities is a useful example.
known as GEAR UP, more than $300 million per year provides to local school systems, to implement university preparation programmes, which start when low income students are in the middle school and continue to end the secondary school.
Since 1999, the programme has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent frequencies to university, according to the United States Education Department.
The Ministry of Iraqi Petroleo arrives agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite the concerns of violence and political instability, the Iraqi Government has able to attractive important oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure, during two substances that concluded Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Irak Petroleo Minister with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play a main role in the restoration of Iraq's oil industry, which is mutilated for decades of war and sanctions.
The U.S. companys have been able to cut in only two of the 10 understood skins.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second sub-state, which started Thursday.
The only one who presented a offer lost.
Two American companies reached agreements for swallowing in June.
The poor representation of the U.S. oil oilers in the opening of the Iraqi oil industry was surprised to analysts.
Irak finally opened his doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, there are Asians and Europeans to the head, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Petroleo Forum of Iraq, a online news center.
It's going to pass for a long time before something else is offered in Iraq.
The security concerns, highlighted by massive co-ordinated bombs on March, and the political instability while the United States militarys were removed, probably prevented American oil companies to arise more energyly in Iraq, which has the third important world's crude reserve, declared analists.
The United States undertakings were in some cases degrading, since rivals, in particular Chinese and other government energy companies, have significantly lower labour costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Western Petroleum Inc were the only United States companies that reached agreements with the Ministry.
The main signs of the United States, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who have closed shoots with the Iraqi Petroleo Ministry and provided technical advice in recent years, have been left with the empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts granted this weekend.
The National Petroleo Corporation, the property of the Chinese state, offered more contracts than any other company and achieved major investment in contracts for two main ages.
We know that China is on the way to become a major economic and technological power, expressed the portfolio of the Petroleo Assam Jihad Ministry.
We have confidence that the Chinese company will be on the part of its competitors and will comply with their commitments to Iraq.
Pre-selected companies to submit proposals made offers that were then compared to the barrill subsidiation that the Ministry was ready to pay for increased production above the current levels in each age.
The principal Qaeda planner is apparently murdered in Pakistan
It is believed that a certain attack with American missiles in Pakistan's border with Afghanistan has killed a major Qaeda operation planner this week, and the US anti-terrorism officials said on Wednesday.
To be confirmed, this would be the second mortal attack against a high-range terrorist leader.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arab men who believed that he failed to march when a couple of missiles affected his car, near the city of Miran Shah, in the northern Waziristan Province, according to the sources of the United States and Pakistani officials of the region.
Local authorities said that missiles were launched by an unidentified aircraft, the type operated by the CIA within the illegal tribal zone of Pakistan.
They were conducting a white car, in direction to the Afghan border, when the car had the impact, said a official of the Pakistanian Civil Intelligence Agency, speaking by phone from Miran Shah.
The officer said that the suspected local warriors were shocked at the place and quickly confiscated what remained of the "fully destrued things".
Local authorities were incapable to check the identities of victims, but two American anti-terrorism officials quoted unspecific evidence that Somalia was among the dead.
Somalia was described as a highranging military planner of the Qaeda, which directed the operations of the terrorist group outside the Afghan and Pakistan region.
He was devoted to conspirate throughout the world, said a high official, speaking from the anonymous, quoting the delicate nature of the American aircraft attacks within the Pakistani territory.
In view of its central role, this probably included conspiratory attacks against the United States and Europe.
There was a strategic guide for the superior command of Qaeda and I translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second United States official said that Somalia had been slowly on the Qaeda lines and was well connected to other extremist groups of the region.
It may not be a name known for some Americans, but it does not decrease any way the threat that planned us and our allies, stated the second official.
If his death is confirmed, Somalia would be the second leader of the Qaeda or Talibán leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a warfare in the tribal area, and three other high-range agents.
The ritm of non-piloted aircraft attacks directed by the CIA has decreased from the summer, a average of about six operations per month to two, according to the report of The Long War Journal, a website directed by a non-profit organization.
The reduction may be a improved tactic by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to restrict their vulnerability while they are disappointed by suspected informors, stated the site.
The maximum United Nations sent to Kabul to reject
The largest United Nations sent in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said that he would leave his post in March, ending with a smooth mandate that was damaged by extensive corruption accusions in the Presidential election of Afghanistan supported by the United Nations.
It happens when the Obama administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional American troops to Afghanistan.
The United Nations envoyed that it supports the increase, but it is concerned that the United States chronograph for the military retirement started in 18 months encourages other NATO Governments to remove their forces.
We need to accelerate the preparation of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghanistans so that you can trust in the international community, he pointed out Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also stressed the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian officials who cooperate with the Afghanistan ' s political transition.
The increase in the military sector must be reflected in the civil sector, said.
Eide said he was not demitting, but just fulfiling a promise that made him his family in March 2008, passing only two years in Kabul.
He said that I would like to notify the Secretary
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so there was time to find a replacement.
What I said is it's better you start looking for a successor, showed Eide.
When I came here, there was a vacuum of two months between my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has started to find a replacement, according to United Nations officials.
The officials say that Staffan di Mistura, a Sweden-Italic citizen who recently directed the United Nations mission in Bagdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a French who previously directed United Nations peace missions.
The position of Eide in Afghanistan was tested before his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September to favour President Hamid Karzai in the presidential vote of the country and to cover evidence of massive electoral fraud.
He refused the crimes, but he said that the charges of Galbraith, who was dismissed, "securly damaged the mission, because he had already had a lot of scepticism about international interference" in the election.
He said that I proposed the appointment of a high civil representative to coordinate the efforts of assistance by the United States in Afghanistan.
He also encouraged the United Nations leadership to allow its successor to contract more personnel than the United States and other Western countries, which are granted to the Afghan mission, saying that this would increase their confidence in the right use of their money.
Eide expressed its frustration for the limitations to its powers in Afghanistan, arguing that the gorgeous United Nations contracting regulations had lost their ability to capture talents.
That is how the United Nations rules allowed me to recall only one person since May.
That's catastrophic and it can't continue.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
The Defence Secretary, Robert M. Gates, said on Thursday that world powers will soon put "important additional sanctions" against Iran, because of their failure to put conversations on their nuclear ambitions.
Gates, directed to a group of about 300 American troops in the north of Iraq, during a week of war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, remained important to the perspective of a military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, however, in response to the question of a soldier about the probability of this event.
One of the things I'm worse is that, if we have learned something from Iraq for the last six years, it's the inherent inevitableness of the war.
The Obama administration is considered a package of sanctions directed to Iran ' s military and political eleite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population in general.
I found that it would be necessary for "a package of incentives and desincentives", "to convince the Iranian government that they would be really less safe with nuclear weapons," because "super people will suffer greatly" sanctions.
On Thursday, in a declaration of the White House's port, Robert Gibbs, the Administration joined the European leaders to warn that Iran will face "creasible consequences" if its nuclear programme does not fully respect the indications of the United Nations Security Council and its nuclear control body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that he wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In conversations in Geneva on 1 October, he pointed out that he would return to negotiation on the restriction of its nuclear programme and would accept a substantial part of its enriched uranium reserve, in change of the fuel that is desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has stressed this agreement as a way to build confidence between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
However, since then, Iran seems to have left the attempting agreements, in part, claim the experts, because Iran's command is divided in relation to the possibility of compromise with the United States.
Frenchly, I believe that the long-term of Iran with the international community on some proposals that have actually accepted at the beginning of October has joined the international community, including Russians and Chinese, in a way that they have not been in terms of significant sanctions against Iran, showed Gates.
President Obama has put as a limited date on 31 December to respond to the proposals, before replanting other options, even continuing with what the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Hillary Rodham Clinton, once called "fatal sanctions".
In a statement made in New York, the mission of Iran to the United Nations declared what he called on Thursday "Infunded and basic cards" by some members of the Security Council on nuclear activities of Iran, and said that he was willing to continue with the discussions with the United States and other five world powers, "to achieve a appropriate solution in a long term".
Gates, who was going to return to Washington last Wednesday, was found in the morning with the Premier Irak Nouri Al-Maliki, before flying to the Petrolean Petrolean region, to meet troops in Kirkuk and cured officials in Irbil.
The tensions continue to be high between the curves and the Arab majority of Iraq, in particular regard to borders, property rights and participation.
Gates urged both parties to reduce the potential for conflict to avoid any delay in the United States projects to reduce the number of US troops from 115,000 to 50,000 to the end of August.
Gates also tried to facilitate the currency concern on delaying reduction. The US officials quoted Gates' words to Massoud Barzani, President of the Regional Government of Kurdistan: "We will preserve their security, prosperity and autonomy within a united Iraq.
Let's go. Left. Roger that.
In a Chinese old age, a rumbo change
Wang Weijia and his husband were grown around by propaganda cards that were sermonyed about the fact that "The Mother Earth is too sweet to support more children" and "un baby but means a more tumba".
They learned the lesson so well that when the government officials of Shangai, alarmed by the low birth index and the old population of his city, suddenly changed this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than a child, their reaction was instant and strong: In no way.
We've already given our whole time and energy for a child.
No one remains for a second, said Wang, 31 years old, a human resources administrator with a 8-month son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the policy of a single child in China, creating two generations of notorially rehonored children, the only disgraced children, affected by "picture emperors", has occurred in a demographic crisis in the country.
The average birth index has fallen at 1,8 children per couple, compared to the six of which the policy was effective, according to the Division.
UN demographic, while the number of residents of 60 years is expected to operate more than 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent to 2050, which is very higher than the global average of about 20 per cent.
The desequilibrium is worse in the rich coastal cities with very cult populations like Shangai.
Last year, people of 60 years and more accounted for almost 22 percent of the residents registered in Shangai, while the birth index was less than a coupled child.
Xie Lingli, director of the Committee on Family Planning and Municipal Population of Shangai, has demonstrated that the fetile couples should have children to “assure the proportion of older people and maintain a future lack of work”.
Shangai is at the point of being “an old (not so rich, however) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden” stated.
A gradual alignement
Represented in the Constitution of the country in 1978, the policy of one single son of China may be the most political mandate introduced by the Communist Party until the date.
The couples who violate the policy face a huge amounts, three times their annual wage in some areas, and labour discrimination.
Chinese officials have evaluated the policy for their contribution to avoid critical pressure on their natural resources, while human rights defenders have declared abuses in the imposition of policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced women pregnant to be pregnant with a second child to be subjected to abortion.
In addition, many couples have been aborted according to the gender of feto, leading to a high innatural proportion of men.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually entered their post on the single child policy.
In 2004, more exceptions were made to the rules, including urban residents, ethnic minorities, and cases in which both husband and women are single children, and in 2007 they observed many of their hard lines.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor of the Peking University Demographic Research Institute, said that central government officials have recently discussed even more radical changes, how to allow couples to have two children if one of the couples is a single child.
In July, Shangai became the first Chinese city to launch a aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
At the morning, the cards ordered to the family to have one child were replaced by copy of rules that detailed who would be appropriate to have a second child and how to request a permission.
The city government sent family planning officers and volunteers to visit their couples in their homes and switch pools below the doors.
He has also promised to provide emotional and financial orientation to those who have chosen to have more than a child.
Family planning officials say that the response has been very slow.
Deceptive Response
Although rural officers in the Shangai villages support that they have observed a moderate increase in the requests of couples who want a second child after the campaign launch, the urban districts do not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huanan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five requests per month.
The Shangai officials say that, despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 only exceededs about 165,000, lightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juing, head of the Caolu municipal planning committee in Shanghai, said that the financial consideration is probably the principal reason for which many people do not want more children.
They want to give him the best to your first son, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, of 26, said that they would like to have two children and are legally enabled to do so.
But as many Chineses, they have only the medical and life insurance that the government provides for them.
Without a social protection network, they argue that this option would be irresponsible.
The people in the West are incorrectly the single child's policy as a matter of rights, said Yang, a engineer of the building whose wife is pregnant of seven months of the first child of the couple.
Yeah, they're stealing us the possibility of having more than a child.
But the problem is not only a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples point out psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resources administrator, said he wants a single son because she was also that: "We were the center of our families and we were habituated to all care for us.
We are not habituated to care for others and we really don't want to care for others. "
Chen Sheian, 42 years old, was owner of a translation agency, explained it in a more condensive way.
For parents with two carriages, of a medium class, which reduce the birth index, it stated that it is sufficiently successful to be selfish.
The people between 20 and 30 years growing to see the struggle of their parents during the first days of China's experience with capitalism and did not want that kind of life for themselves, expressed.
Even a single kid requires long time for parents, so.
One mother has to dismiss at least two years of his social life.
Then there are space issues, "that you have to restore your apartment," and the strategic "that you have to have a curriculum prepared for the best guards when the child has 9 months."
Most of your friends are ready to face this once, said Chen, but not two.
Ours are the first generation with the highest level of life, expressed.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
A United Nations group sets a plan to reduce emissions
The United Nations climate conference, characterized until now by deceased posts and mutual recruitments, took a renewed attention on Thursday with the dissemination of a document that provides ambitious reductions in winter gases during the next 40 years with industrialized nations that lead to their shadows, most of the loads in the short terms.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate the greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way to follow.
But it was seen as an important progress in a negotiation that is unexpectedly, with more than 100 world leaders that will arrive to Copenhagen next week.
Developed by a United Nations ad hoc working group, the text does not speak of how much money the poor countries would give him to the poor to address the global and long-term heat.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economies and the main emergency economies would recover their carbon production, and what would be the limit of the global temperature increase that political stresses would be ready to to tolerate.
This gives him a lot of flexibility to the process, said John Coequy, high-representant in Washington for Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who edited the document of six pages, summarised a 180 pages negotiation text to focus on what the highest climate official of the United Nations, Yvo de Boer, described as "the great panorama".
It shows profiles for possible agreement, where industrialized nations would collect their emissions for 2020 between 25 and 45 per cent, compared to the 1990 levels, while the main developing countries would reduce their emissions during the same period between 15 and 30 per cent.
In addition, countries would recover emissions between 50 and 95 per cent to 2050.
The European Union also encouraged discussions on Thursday, promised to provide $3,600 million for the next three years, to help the poorest countries to adapt to the impact of climate change, from inundations and sequences to deforestation.
In all ways, the same kind of verbal artificial fires was presented last week.
The United States special climate envoy Todd Stern rejected the claims requesting binding gas emissions for industrialized countries, compared to volunteers from the main emergency economies, if they were not financed by the developed world.
The Manobra indicated that Obama administration is taking a more harder line with China, in terms of the Bush administration officials only two years ago.
The United States will not make an agreement without that the main developing countries advance and take steps, Stern, who also regrets that the text did not have enough to ensure that the restraints could be checked by external observers.
Stern made his comments a hour after the Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs He Yafei, claimed that the highest climate negotiator in the United States had no "common sense" or was "speakable" because he had said before the week that the United States would not contribute economically to China to address the global recruitment.
With the future economic trayectory of the main powers of the world in play, failure lines have done eruption within the world in the way of development, between the industrial world and the emergential economy.
The present battle is both to save individual economys as well as to save the planet, with China and the United States struggling on their respective obligations, while the poorest nations emphasize that the twenty-first countries of the world are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the most powerful action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate in Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the main powers are discussing on whom should cost the expenditure to limit winter gases, even when vulnerable countries have returned more aggressively to seek to contain the major employers of their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is developed, supported by Ulate, who also works as regional advisor on climate change in Mexico and Central America, for International Conservation.
Some of the most vulnerable countries to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the major participants say that conversations will lead to a political agreement.
The Union of Small States, which has 43 members, has prepared a proposal for a preliminary treaty of 24 pages previously on Thursday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who is heading for international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said that the employment of small islands has "meased political pressure on the whole political process", partly because they are now unified and require emergency economies, such as China and India.
The discussions took a new urgency while delegations focused on the fact that most of the exceptional issues should be addressed before the government heads were going to close a treaty.
High-level officials, such as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Vice-Minister, descended from the flights and flyed to the Bella Center's passengers, at meetings at closed doors and press conferences, to delimite the claims that will be arbited during the next week.
The absolute disorder of the meeting (which 13,000 people are coming and out of the convention centre, the actors touching the guitarra present night spectrums by burning out countries that are selling, and the preliminary proposals of hand instead of mail), poses a challenge.
Intensity only builds: almost all key ministers are here at this time, and Tuesday 60 government chiefs are in Copenhagen.
We are in the main lines, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, Vice-President for the Global Conservation Policy.
Weights are coming.
The first train to 225 km from Greece refines that lunch feeling
At 5:13 of Monday morning, a silver will surround the darkness to indicate a train output that marks a revolution for travels in Britain.
The first high-speed train of the country will reach 225 km/h when it passes as a rail from Ashford, Kent, at the St. Panrcas station in London, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of Transport, will then join the Dame Kelly Holmes, on the board of the first inter-urban service Javelin outside London.
He hopes that the new service finally connects Britain to an international fast, reliable train network and connects the major Midlands, North and Scotia concursions to London.
The disabled areas would become suburbs, business journeys would be overcome, and the change of aircraft and cars would reduce the national carbon emissions, as well as reducing the congestion on roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the decades of thousands of libraries that are needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable struggle of the planning and environmental fears, can still cut the high speed lines of Britain.
High Speed 2 (HS2), a company created in January to provide a study of viability to the Government, will submit his report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, according to the Times.
This will provide you a detailed entry of the next stage planned for the high speed network.
The new line that a London to the Midlands of West will be drawn within a radio of five metres in urban and areas where the environmental impact can be polemic.
In rural areas, the plan will be traced within a radio of 25 meters of a final road.
HS2 is also expected to set three options for a broader high speed network than leading to the north.
Lord Adonis will answer in spring.
The proposed option is a Y configuration, where a single high speed line would reach the Midlands of West.
The line would be divided near Birmingham, with a raw that leads to the west from the Peninses to Manchester and Scotia, and another to the northwest to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle on Tyne.
One line would enter Scozia.
"I think this will be the most beneficial option," said one of the carriage.
Once finished, travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first traject, which would not be inaugured before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a few more than one hour.
The proposals would allow trains to travel to 402 km/h, converting to the British network into the fastest Europe.
The initial route is designed to support trains of 400 mt length, ability to transport 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a line in London-Birmingham.
This means that it would need a London terminal to receive 20,000 passengers per hour.
In view of capital space restrictions, an existing station is expected to be extended to the high speed network.
Railway industry experts believe that only the St. Pancras International station offers this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce if he believes that the scheme should go, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures means that it will not be taken a final decision until a general election.
Even if you start the work, the network should be built in sections.
The trains would initially be obliged to leave the rapid lines by the existing carriages north of Birmingham, maintaining the travel time between London and Scotia over three hours.
This is considered as the crucial point to ensure a change in train flights, a reference point for the rail revolution.
Contributors are faced with the hypothesis by a £75,000 £1,000 of a Conservator
Alan Duncan, the voter of the Conservant Party, accompanied him to the Contributor thousands of libraries a year for the cost of a naranjal that built in the house of his election district.
The party's prison voter, which was degraded by David Cameron, wanting to live "of ration", increased his hypothesis in £75,000 to build a robbery extension in his second house in Rutland.
They enabled him to load the additional interest of the contributor, with hundreds of libraries per month.
The authorities of the House of Communities adopted the requests at their time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who conducted a review of the expenditure of the members. Mr. Duncan said, "It could not be clearer or simpler."
Mr Duncan, one of the most rich members of the Parliament, has a house of two floors in a population in its election district of Rutland and Melton.
The nearby houses have been sold for almost a million libraries.
The low plant includes a kitchen, a room to be and eat, but the honorary office agreed that Mr Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a winter to the house, described in the plans as a "naranjal."
Neighbors described it as "a winter for entertainment".
Mr. Duncan was not requested to make any reference to the increase in the loan, during a recent study of the Committee on Standards and Privileges of the Chamber of the Communities on its previous hypothetical agreements.
Last month, the Committee decided to violate the rules after investigating its expenditure.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a 271.406 library from London to the house of its election district, which was purchased in 1991, the previous year to become deputy.
The detailed documents this week show that Mr. Duncan had requested about 1,400 monthly libraries in hypotecary interests, until March of the last year.
In April, his requests increased more than £1,800 per month.
The type of interest in the Scotia Real Bank, Mr Duncan's Real Bank, did not change at that time, suggesting that the total increase would finance 75,000 libraries.
The standard BRE standard hypertechnical type decreased from 7.94% in December 2007, to 4% in March of this year, which is now present.
The most recent document issued by the Chamber of Communities shows that Mr Duncan continued to request £ 1,250 per month in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his work as President of the opposition of the House in September, after an enclosed reporter filmed him saying that Members had to survive "of reasons" after the expenditure scandale.
"But this is nationalized, you have to live from rations and be treated as m*rda."
He said: "I'll pay my money in my garden and ask a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask much more, but I don't do it. "
The deputy, a Millennium for his old profession as oil trader, was first questioned about its expenditure in May, when he had requested thousands of libraries for his garden, before agreeing with the payment office that "that could be considered too much."
An activista was covered a shock with the shape of the esterlin book symbol in the census by Mr Duncan as a protest, after being discovered that he requested 4,000 libraries for three years.
Tonight, when they asked him about the increase in the hypothesis, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for primary improvements, adopted both by the payment office and later by Legg."
He added: "It is not to elect and deceive or frozen the rules or anything.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to rules, authorized and all.
It couldn't be any clearer or simpler way."
Come to those who have faith, to see the calendar of Brighton's palace's palace
Brighton's palaces have found a new impulse for winter months in a calendar of the interactive advention.
In addition, a alternative religious group that encourages the spiritual exploitation through creativeness, invited 24 persons to decorate their palaces every day in December, using villacs as their subject.
The event started on December 1st, with invitations that were able to see the last palace from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, with full skins and free servicing pockets.
The villas elected until now include Vi Tres Boats, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and The First Christmas, where the palace presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, a 50-year-old Hove TV marketing assistant, is a not-employed clergy of Chichester's Diocese and Beyond's leader.
He said: "We want religion to be more relevant for people, in a society of post-Christianism."
"Why do we expect as a church that people come to a old strange building? I think the Church should come to the people and celebrate in an exciting way.
"The idea of the calendar of the palapa's advenience began as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incrediblely creative and vibrant place and we are trying to prove and represent it through spirituality."
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and the whole world
Decades of thousands of protesters protested this Sabbath in a ambitious and binding agreement to combat global heat, around the world and in Copenhagen, where the police stopped several hundreds of people.
Some thirty thousand people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizations, have dismissed by the helmet of Danish capital in a complaint that the United Nations Conference on Climate Change should reach more later Thursday, which would enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Denmark President of the Climate Conference, the growing climate mobilization throughout the world, represented by these manifestations, contributed to the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen.
The incidents were shortly after the start of the manifestation in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all black clothes, broken shooters with shocks and martilles, reported an AFP journalist.
The anti-disturbic police interfere rapidly and strongly.
The police announced the detention of 600 to 700 people in total, according to it, it was particularly members of the "Nick Blocks", extremely violent groups that had already been held during the UNO Summit in Strasbourg, east of France, in April last year.
Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizations of the manifestation, declared the conditions in which hundreds of warriors were detained, emphasized that a hundred of them "is inmobilized on the street on Saturday night and sit in spite of the intense cold night".
The manifestation, quite peaceful, went out of Parliament and went to the Bella Center, head of the negotiations.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters of the building without trying to enter.
The former South African arzobispo of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, captured a sight with vessels.
Most demonstrators arrived in bus and train in the large European cities, but many Asians, among them, were also presented as some Africans.
About 3.000 people, most with celestial clouds responded to the first concentration in Copenhagen in the morning to the convocatory of the Earth's friends to form "Blue seas" for "justice and climate".
Today, we take the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, the Philippine warrior of the South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't continue to say: There's time, you confirmed the pleasant English Kidjo.
In Africa there are rivers that are seated, water courses that can be walked as ever.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached ecological organizations.
The French deputy José Bové, a figure of the anti-globalization, explained that he came to Copenhagen to “unit climate justice and social justice”: “How the fight against global warming is not opposed to fighting for another world”.
The Pacific Asian region, who gathered many very vulnerable islands to the calentization, gave the initial pointapié to the manifestations.
According to the organizations, some 500,000 people went to the street in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, in most students, shooted red clothes and lighting pumps with legs for sun energy.
In Hong Kong or in Jakarta, as well as in Canada, hundreds of protesters claimed to act strongly against climate change.
In France, the manifestations organized by the "350" network met hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marsella (Sur), Lille (Nord), Burdeos (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, tens of people were concentrated.
The separator Abjasia elected the President, although Georgia declared "fraude"
This Saturday Abjasia, a separate prorrate region of Georgia acknowledged by Moscow for more than one year, elected the President; however, Tbilisi declared "fraude".
Some 131.000 were invited to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 by the control of South Ocean, another Georgian separator region acknowledged by Russia.
The election tables closed at 17 h GMT.
According to Abjasia's electoral committee, the participation was 58% of some hours before closing.

In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216.000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world is considered the part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After its separation of Georgia during the conflict of 1992-1993 ended with several thousands of dead, Abjasia tries to demonstrate through this election that is listed to join the international community.
This process is a stage of our new life, our new era as an independent state, declared the AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claimed to have voted to Bagapch.
It was among the electors who were directed to the election table at a capital school, Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with palmers in the entrance.
The topic of Russian domination is the central topic of the presidential election in this region with solar landscapes at the sea of the Black Sea.
Great tables are shown in Bagapch next to the President and first Russian minister, Dmitri Medveev and Vladimir Putin, in different places of this small territory of 216.000 inhabitants.
In Gali, west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, welcomed the Russian responsibilities that had come to control the development of the scrutiny.
In a short ceremony, he said: We, the people of Abjasia, thanks the support of Moscow, and especially the decision to recognise Abjasia's independence.
I hope that your country is quickly recognised by the United Nations, Alexey Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, urged its vodka vessel.
On his side, the opposition represented in the election by the former vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two entrepreneurs, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as the control of the rail carriage controlled for 10 years in Russia.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, claims that it does not support the current power or opposition.
A majority of 50% more a vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate reachs this abroad, a second turn of two weeks later will be organized.

The allocation of history and geographic is strengthened by the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The National Education Minister, Luc Chatel, declared in an interview that will be transmitted to Sunday's Information (JDD, according to his French sigle), that history and geographic would be "forged" from the reform of secondary education, although it was removed from the obligatory education in the second year of scientific bachelor.
From now to now, all students of the first bachillate will have four weekly hours and the same program for a shared common culture, Chatel states.
For the Minister, "before with hypothesis" because, he says, "the C Rate is no longer a scientific dimension," but "in general, calls to the best students".
The branches of General and Literarian Teaching cannot be sub-Subs of the C, continued to emphasize even: "I have heard that historians or intellectors were disappointed because they had removed history and geography in second technological schools."
A IFOP survey published on Saturday at the Humanity revealed that about seven French (69%) (69%) deprobed the government project to remove the obligatory education of history and geographic in second squad C. Many intellectual and teachers, the left and some of the right-to-left election representatives also criticized this fact.
Instead, the Minister acknowledged that "not speak" was to remove philosophy of the second-based programme C.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of the teaching training, while 16 organizations (auditors and synagogues) called on march to protest against the project, which, according to them, offers the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Moreter 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year will make an admission test that will be aimed at its discipline, and at the end of the year, a appeal test on its capacity to teach, explained the Minister.
They will also make practices in real conditions during the year of M2, then they will be a first year before the school as teachers in practice.
If you do all the proposed practices before the competition, you will already have a great experience faced the school, i.e. more than 300 hours, you added.
Finally, the Minister notes that it will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
He also confirmed the project to remove the school map "before 2012".
In normal school, experts will have 15 minutes to explain convincingly the climate evolution
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen Summit, which has accepted Sabbath on Sunday morning Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Expert Group on the Climate Evolution (GIEC) invited by the normal normal School of Ulm.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel Prize of Peace, inaugured the "Ernelst", a day composed of a series of 15-minute experts, filmed and opened to the public, reported an AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that touchs people and transmits them to know more, explained in the context of the 22-year-old Edouard Hannezzo Conference, one of the organizations of this day called as the students baptized to the fish of the school stake.
We chose about twenty participants between the experts of their discipline and selected them by their carism, it needed.
Besides global calentation, "we can talk to hours, but we can also talk about key goals in a few minutes," said the AFP Jean Jouzel, who was exposed without note, but with the help of graphics against some 50 people.
It is part of our scientific role, underlined the expectation that the public understands that "the Copenhagen Conference is based on a very serious scientific exhibition."
Videos filmed during these conferences will be online on the school website from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is prescribed for February, followed by others to a bimestral ritme.
Delay in payments: disappointment among prison guards, is expected to take action
The prison guards called on Friday to a "general mobilization" to require payment before the end of the year, prizes and additional hours, which was suspended to the budgetary reasons.
The Obrera Pennsylvania (2th of the guards) asked the staff to join the manifestation on Monday on the morning before prisons and "block them" to declare the rob of their own.
The CGT Pennsylvania (third of the Professional Syndicate) calls them to "join in general meetings in different prisons to achieve massive mobilization" because it is the incompliance of payment in December of the "extra-time, night-princes, Sundays and festivals" worked in October.
And the first guard trade, the Federal Autonome Penitenciarian Union (Ufap/Unsa), "convoke general mobilization (...) in order to increase discount and furia".
The Pension Administration Directorate and the Ministry of Justice explain that the extra hours have increased in 2009 and not all have been counted, but they are sure that the salt will be subscribed in January.
At the last hour of the day, the Cancellera informed that Michele Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guards officers to ensure that the payment would be made in the next month.
No doubt of the efforts made by the staff for the operation and modernization of our pension system, writes the Ministry of Justice in this letter.
Requests to the Pension Administration Directorate to immediately implement a set of measures to ensure that this situation generated by a bad evaluation of the number of additional hours is not to be produced in the future.
The payment of December will then be low, except for the staff of the address that enjoys the benefit of the famous primates by functions and objectives, and that "speaks the fault of budgetary requirements", deplored the Ufap/Unsa.
It is a real scandale, said the interregional FO Union of Marsella, announcing its decision to boicote up to a new order "all meetings and convocations".
The staff will not be working on Sundays and Festivals if the month of October is not paid in December, the same will happen with the additional hours, and also the threat to FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.

The Mexican Government's airplane that came to El Salvador to take Zelaya, returned to her place of origin, according to a source of the General Office of Migrations.
To grant you a safe conduct, the Golpist government wanted to force Zelaya to "reunify" and ask political asylum in the foreign.
But the derogated President was rejected because he wanted to come to Mexico as a guest of State.
The Golpist government "he suffered a new torment when he asked me to reject my task (...), they wanted to present my renewal," said Zelaya on Thursday at the radio, where it usually makes statements since the start of the political crisis that takes five months in the Central America country.
Here I can stay ten years, I have my guitarra, adding some agreements to the poster President, refugeed in the Embassy of Brazil from Tegucigalpa for two months and half.

News about Johnny Hallyday 's very positive sound', according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday "sound very positive" confirmed his son David on Wednesday when he came to the Los Angeles airport to meet his hospitalized father since a few days.
News are very positive.
Dad's strong, and it's all very good, he declared the press David Hallyday when he dropped from the flight that took him from Paris short after 13 h (21 h GMT).
The son of the channel, disappointed, assured that it would be translated to the Cedars-Sinai Hospital of Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday invade Monday by a infection resulting from the transaction of discretional heritage on November 26 in Paris.
The music is "in a coma induced since that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to avoid suffering and so able to control her treatment", stated the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been subjected to a coma induced by the doctors of the Hospital Cedars-Sinai of Los Angeles, where he entered Monday for an infection, following a discrete heritage operation on November 26, last November in Paris.
The songant was operated once again on Thursday night because of serious injuries produced by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia was Tuesday on Friday morning at the French lesson of Los Angeles, who attended her daughter Jade, to present a school act, confirmed an AFP photograph.
The Head of Ortopedia and Traumatology of the Hospital of Pitié-Salpereere, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel the Monday to Los Angeles to stay next to the song.
The producer accused Dr. Stephane Delajoux, the neurochirurgian who worked at the song last November in the international private clinic of the Monceau Park in Paris.
And I need to tell you that. I got it.
Los Angeles surgery said they were furious, said Camus.
She's talking about a possible question, said.
Jean-Claude Camus claimed that Johnny Hallyday had traveled too fast to Los Angeles with the authorisation of the Paris surgery.
I talked directly to the doctor and surprised me when she assured me that there was no problem to make the trip, because I was operated two times of discal hernia, accompanied.
Shortly before the RTL embassy, he pointed out that, as the song seemed, the song was "he went without cannace, without anything," after his parish operation.
Dr. Stephane Delajoux is very known in the artistic environment.
He opposed the actress Mary Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in an clinic of Neuilly-sur-Seine where Delajoux worked at that time.
In 2007, I also interrupted the actor Charlotte Gainsburg to reabsorpte a hematome formed by a brain hemorragia.
This is a doctor with bad reputation, condemned by justice in several cases by malapraxis, as well as by fiscal and staff fraud.
Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the Medical Order, accused him of being "unclean man" requested "with regularity" before the Order Council, and is "lone to be recommendable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stefane Delajoux spoke on Thursday through his lawyer David Koubbi.
It indicated that the intervention was "only inconvenient" and that the results of post-operational studies were "normal".
The operation "it couldn't cause morbids, and therefore he did not need drenaje", acknowledged.
In any way, the round of the song, whose health problems are multiplied from the summer, entered into a parençasis.
Uncertainly, turn back on 8 January (Amiiens, NDLR) as I was expected, it seemed to be very ridicule, said Camus.
The UDF association highlights the ton and warns the New Centre on the use of its sig
The UDF association, controlled by the MoDem (Democratic Movement) of François Bayrou, reacted this Wednesday before the trial of the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Publica Official Forces of Acquisition) on the church of the former federal party, inviting him to remove it from all support, I regret it to be asked.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to restore the UDF sigle, since he believed that François Bayrou was not in place to defend his political heritage after having put his hand to the left.
On the other hand, the Minister of Defence, whose party was associated with the UNMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday to the National CN Council.
As supported by its management, he received the support of Mrs Hervé de Charette (ex UMP, current NC) who re-exhibited the property of the UDF brand, as it was the first to register it in the Industrial Property Institute in 2004.
But on Wednesday night, the UDF Association office, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou, who did not want to see it privately, breaked the silence to launch a request to the Minister and the deputy intimidating them to abandon the seat and to transfer them to the brand's own rights, which was sentenced to judicial request.
These last days, you have made many statements in order to propose your political movement to recover UDF, write the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarness del MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Central Alliance.
They also believe that they continue with the use of the name of the movement, the +New Center+ and the slogan +'l'UDF of today'hui+ in their military material and on the submission page, support the letter signers.
As you already know, you have no right to use the sig, explaining the UDF office that requires the NC to "instantly address the name of the UDF of any support, as well as the (su) web site."
She also requests Hervé de Charette "what transfers the property of the (la) mark to the lawyers".
Instead of doing so, justice will be appealed to respect the law and rights of UDF members and warn the signs.
In the letter, they need the UDF "it's a real political movement since 1978" and remember that Morin and his friends "eligned" went in 2007 "to create a new party, as they had already done others in 2002 to create the UMP."
Therefore, the New Centre has no right to use the UDF sequence, according to them.
They also recall that the last UNDF conference voted in 2007 to MoDem for three years and the creation of a office responsible for defending "the material and moral interests" of the movement found by Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
With regard to Hervé de Charette, it continues the office, "when she registered the brand," it was not "leader of the UDF for three years," but the UMP.
Use the absence of the UDF acronyme in a skin and fraudulent way to perform it for your account.
This inscrimination is transformed in crime, which claims, before NC's burning strategy: "We believe that in policy, as in life, it is more honourable to make its own name that is trying to get out of the anonymous by taking fraudulently a name to which it is not right".
Caso Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Barnier will be judged for abuse of weakness
This Friday, the Court of Nanterre decided to judge the artist François-Marie Barnier to determine whether, as he stated, the daughter of the multimillionary Liliane Bettencourt, was used by the state of deficiency of the octogenary to explode it from a part of his happiness.
The 62-year-old photograph, known by his star photos of the spectacle, will be judged on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime of which condemns a maximum penalty of three years of prison and EUR 375,000.
This means that in this case there will be a honourable process of a saga on one of the most rich families of France, in which mother and daughter are disputed on the ends of the cosmetic imperium L'Oreal.
But the Correctional Court No. 15 also ordered Liliane Bettencourt, 87 years old, to be subjected to a medical review due to three medical professionals.
The main and shareholder of the Oreal always refused to submit these reviews, even more than the conditions proposed by the Nantere Office during the investigation.
The doctors designated this Friday should provide a report before 10 March 2010, in which they should consider whether Liliane Bettencourt had suffered weakness states and during which periods.
I think he'll accept.
I'm going to talk to her, she declared the lawyer of Mrs. Bettencourt, Georges Kiejman, when he left the hearing.
For its part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, was congratulated by the Court's decision.
It's a great news (...) The Persistent will show that he (Banier) managed this lady whom we should protect.
Since two years ago, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt initiated criminal action against François-Marie Barnier, photographer and multifacetic artist, accusing him of being used for years of the deficiency of his mother to obtain thousands of euros in gifts, through cheques, life insurance contracts or art works.
For its part, Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to be handled by the photograph, who considered a long-term friend.
On Thursday, while the court considered the outcome of the action taken by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers were, in some cases, a great family condemnation.
In this way, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt took into account three letters that his customer would send (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary in which he said that he was un confidence of the husband of Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the letter of 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "I could explain my daughter that I wrote to Barnier between one and two times a day for 15 years.
From your wedding, I could never again speak to Françoise."
For its part, Nanterre's Fiscality once again considered that the applicant was not in conditions to compare, so much more as a judge of protection had refused, in these last days, to make his request to open an judicial prosecution procedure for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "that has full ability to compare justice, is not under the protection and has no tutor.
No person else can compare in his place," stated the representative of the Public Minister, Marie-Chrsitine Davetigney.
Finally, the Court decided that a sentence would be made on Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers' admissibility.
Revolution or end of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French enterprises, our fight for the development of business intellectuality will have been worth...
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the direction of large enterprises in respect of their assets remembers the position of companies regarding consumers before the marketing revolution: it is that the collaborators joined "values" from above as previously tried to imposing consumers from manufacturing technicians.
By putting the customer in the company's center, the marketing revolution made his place to market conquising strategies, although the authorisation attempt to put products that are not related to customer preference factors are regularly repeated.
Demobilization of employees may end in mortal immoralization.
Suicide in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the point of iceberg of a very general phenomenon that is particularly affected by executives.
This demobilization undertakes seriously the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially of the I+D and, moreover, of business intellectuality.
Indeed, the BI (Business Intelligence) "exiges that all parties involved (...) have a proactive conduct and a prospective vision"; it requires a commitment that is fully opposed to the recommendations of an authorised address.
Therefore, we call on a government revolution, which would be to put collaborators in the centre of the company's concerns as the customer.
Internal opinion surveys have relative use
Do internal opinions such as the questionnaire made by Orange among its assalarians will encourage the government revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- In principle, because I was able to verify that, against a new situation, and after many turns, all enterprises end up essentially... what they always did! B989
- Secondly, because authorism, one of the pathologys of power, grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
- Lastly, because most guidelines have a simple vision of human behavior.
As they come from the large engineering schools, they interpret psychology in a mechanical way.
Adoptan, by intellectual commodity, the ancient conductive theory that the "neurociences" Americans recently reactivated, and that the study Institutes and media widely spread to their edges.
In this way, when suggesting that it is possible to manage the "commands" (sic) of the executive commitment, a recent study of IPSs published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms the directs in a mechanical management post inadequate to the world of today.
identification and measurement of mobilization factors
On the contrary, the revolution required for the good functioning of modern enterprises is to adopt a final vision of human behavior.
You can integrate in all reasons or practices of business management, a fundamental fact: for slaughterers, the engagement with the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to make a part of their dreams, ambitions and projects realized.
Today, only studies from the Motifunctional Analysis are taking this concept of the motivations of employees.
Studies demonstrated that they judge their company based on a default dozen that allows them, through the images that have the company, to evaluate what it offers to achieve their own live projects.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of mobilization factors, business leaders can control, prevent, and anticipate their "social deficiency" and reverse human resources management in place.
In this way, they create a favourable field for organized development of a strong and effective business intellectuality.
The discours of Oslo: by the "just war" Obama receives joy from the right
This Friday, the north American right, satisfied that the Nobel Prize of Peace 2009 has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States, called on the speech that Obama had spoken on Thursday.
The conservators, who had dismissed the delivery of the premium to Obama on 9 October, welcomed the presidency, as well as Sarah Palin, former candidate to the vice-President during the 2008 elections.
She sweet what she said, Mrs. Palin, the main figure of the right side of the Republican party to the U.S. Journal Today, and added that she himself had addressed the topic of the war "also necessary" in its recently published memorys.
In my view, the war is since then the last thing the North Americans want to be obliged to do, but it is necessary.
There's need to stop terrorists.
Obama, who ruled the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, was given, this juvenile in Oslo, to justify the resource to the force, a way to explain its decision to send more than 30,000 soldiers to Afghanistan nine days ago.
Another opposite in Obama, Newt Gingrich, considered that the President had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think that the speech was really good, the former President of the Conference of Representatives was pleased, which, in particular, applies to the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
At times, the conversation was very historic, Gingrich declared, during an interview in the "The Takeaway" radio program.
The former election representative, who some considered a potential candidate to the Republican investment for the presidential elections in 2012, was congratulated by listening to "a left president", when he recalled the members of the Nobel Committee "as they would not be free or could give a prize of peace if the resource to force was not available".
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush's speech and current cronist at Washington Post, Obama proclaimed "a very North American speech".
Besides being presented as "the citizens of the world", as "speak it," "he spoke as a North American President," remembering Europeans "what they live in a safe bubble that they have not created and that they do not much to save it," Gerson stated.
Among the few unbelievable right, a bush's epoch, the former ambassador in the United Nations, John Bolton, qualified the speech of "monoton, pretensive and inspiration" on the website of the National Review Online.
On the left of the President, the Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich warned to see Barack Obama justifying the resource to force.
When we cover the war with the concept of justice, it is easy to justify the mask of innocents, warned.
Nevertheless, the left center press was held to the President.
The Angeles Time, although still believed that Obama received the Nobel prematurely, qualified his speech of "Superproduction" in particular for a speaker known for his talent.
The talk of Oslo "It should be used as a road sheet to guide international decisions in combating conflicts, poverty and oppression", commented the Californian newspaper.
Obama "pronounced the talk it was necessary," the New York Times urged, judging it "which was smiling and constructive."
Carriage transport: three marine negotiations to ensure shipbuilding
After three marine negotiations, the trade partners and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only patronal organization that remained until the end, arrived on Thursday afternoon to an agreement that ends the consignment of the shipment and the threat to shipment.
During the meeting of signs on Thursday night, the transport secretariat, Dominic Bussereau, was "joyed" by the agreement, after several negotiations that began Thursday morning.
After a second conversation night, the negotiators came to the sun of the Wednesday with the hope of signing quickly the text of agreement at last hour of the morning.
Even when three patronal organizations (FNTR, Onestra, OTRE) were retired, giving a port.
However, a six-hour meeting was required for all to agree and to be signed at 18.00 p.m.
The conflict "he had been very harmful for the companies" and "that was afraid to ruin the year end feasts", Bussereau stated.
The text prescribes an increase of 4 per cent for lower wages (in local and regional road transport) and of 2,9 per cent for higher (international transport).
The amount of EUR 8,72 to 9,06 for low salary.
It's not much, but we start with a lot of depreciation, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
In that way, we will give our warrior order that there are no cuts or blocks in the supply centres.
But it can always have some rebellious disconform, she added.
Philippe Grillot, TLF's Chairman, acknowledged that it was “a good agreement”, although it was "that it was difficult to grant increases to high wages, taking into account international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the monthly order of EUR 170 for lower wages and from 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is a common understanding agreement and respects the workers, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognised it as "a historic agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) is "a acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides an increase in the 3 per cent movement expenditure and the celebration of general road transport assemblies in the first half of 2010, which will enable the issue of extraordinary payment and modernization of the collective convention.
Bussereau recalled that "a low of 100 million euros in the patronal loads" was subject to an amendment by the Government in the draft rectification financing law for 2009, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The Government will request the Senate to vote under the same terms.
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to apply, first of all, to companies associated with this organization and, secondly, to the whole professional, where the Minister of Labour makes an extension.
It will be "with the biggest shortness", Bussereau assured.
The opposition of patronal organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR declared that it was a "engnuous negotiation", since the 100 million euros "he had been promised to the sector to compensate part of the CO2 tax."
The Secretariat of the Transport State forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion of a analysis discussed by the parties, but not to oppose those who want to eat sleeve in the next evening of Nochebuena, was regretted by the Onestra.
For the OTRE agreement, "the stability of many SMEs in the sector for the next 12 months".
RER A: Conflicts during the weekend, disconformed syndicates with the RATP proposals
The conflicts in RER A, the largest urban public transport line in France, will continue during the weekend, since on Thursday meeting, 2nd feet between trade unions and the direction of the RATP, there was no agreement and trade unions.
For this important weekend of shipping purchases, the Saturday and Sunday will only take trains between 10:00 and 20:00, due to a train of each two in the central trail ( between Defence and Nation) and a train of each four on the other lines.
The interconnection with the SNFC will be suspended in Nantere Prefecture, which will force passengers to change trains.
The Lafayette Galeria, who expects 200,000 customers every day, was pleased that "RATP is working to provide services to large shops".
The RER Cross from West to East the Paris City.
The RATP tramo comes from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Sint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallé.
This Friday, about one of the two trains rounded in hours, and almost no trains in the valle, as was expected.
Thursday, there was no disorder in the easts thanks to the organization of the peoples of the French island.
Thus, at the floor, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less competitive than normally, especially for the absence of students.
In Boissy-Sint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that "one more premature and medium-spot to reach time".
The Saint-Lazare station was not saturated, indicated the SNCF, which had planned to supervise the order police and forces.
The RER A that operates the SNCF from Cergi-Le-Haut or with the destination to it came or leaves from the Saint-Lazare station to join the metros.
New general assemblies of workers in the garden will take place on Saturday and Sunday. The results will be analyzed, "not satisfactory," according to the trade unions, of a meeting held with the address on Wednesday afternoon.
The Executive Director proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects of REL A: time of work, professional development, etc.
That's not what they want the drivers who claim a first to be, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP also commented on its first proposals, noting that the direction "is not able to solve a problem that the SNCF and the road sector had already solved".
A new meeting of Monday was expected to “a broader analysis on the terms of exercise of the profession” stated the RATP.
What also led to the syndicates to say that the company "not imported users of the weekend."
At the morning, some 150 drivers entered a committee in Paris.
Then the address, which was refused to dialog during the chair, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters".
The conflict could be extended to RER B on Tuesday after the Unity and Independents had presented a previviation.
Syndicates ask for a first of 120 euros (unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, South and Independent) and are demanded to degrad the working conditions on this line with a million daily passengers.
The RER drivers, all in the second degree of their professional carriage, cover up from 2.200 to 2.700 euros and from 600 to 650 euros of priests, by clocks with alternated, Sundays and holiday days.
Turkey's justice dissolves the procured party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court failed on Thursday for the resolution of the country's main procured party, a decision which immediately caused angry manifestations in the Curde Community, South-East of the country and Stambul.
This decision could very complicate the task of the Government, which has just had a hand to the curde community, trying to end up to 25 years of conflict.
The Party of the Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had been converted into the "focus of activities that damaged the independence of the State and its indivisible unity", stated the President of the Court, Hasim Kiliç, four days of discussion.
The decision of the 11 judges was unilateral, although only a majority of seven votes were needed to obtain the dilution, Kiliç indicated that 37 of the leaders of the party, including his President Ahmet Turk and Mrs Aysel Tugluk, are paragraphs of political life for five years.
The judge also announced the end of the parliamentary immunity of which Turk and Tugluk enjoyed, and the confiscation of the goods of the party by the Deputy.
The TPT has 21 banks in Parliament (of 550).
His leaders warned before the verdict that Members would leave Parliament before being a partial parliamentary.
The decision is due to a procedure laid down by the Supreme Court, Abdulrahman Yaligincaya, in 2007, which accused the DTP to obey the "principes" of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which was considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many more countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political escape of PKK rebels.
However, the party ensures that it does not have "organized links" with the PKK, but is refused to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls the Government to negotiate with it.
The Court ' s verdict takes place at the time that the Government holds his hand to the currency community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, so that the currency stops supporting the KFK and thus put the end to the conflict.
The DTP leaders said that a resolution could generate a recruitment of tensions in the Anatolian South, where a large number of manifestations against the terms of detention of the KPK, Abdullah Ecalan, degenerated in conflicts with the police during the last few weeks.
Since the advertisement of justice, thousands of manifestants were gathered against the DTP sites in Diyarbakir, the great county of the South-East in most of their curves.
The Order Forces slaughtered lacrimogens and used water canons, while the manifestants launched Molotov bombs or stones with dogs.
In Istanbul, hundreds of people were also concentrated.
After the verdict, Turkey stated that the decision of justice would "develop distress".
Turkey cannot solve this issue (courda, NDLR) by solving a party, declared the press.
The Government, formed by a party from Islamic movement, also regrets the decision.
First of all, we oppose the closure of parties.
Thus it is not resolved, stated the Minister of Energy, Taner Ylisz.
This Boicote decision completely opened the democratic opening launched by the government, commented on the political analysis Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we can wait for a reaction of the PKK, agreed.
On Thursday, the PKK was a attack that died seven soldiers three days ago in Northern Turkey, one of the most bloody attacks in the last months.
Neves can start suddenly
A really fresh winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
In absolutely, it is something with what he wants to do the impossible life to citizens, commenting on the ESF's maintenance director in winter winter.
But with that, your employees can learn to test and dominate the entire ability of vehicular technology.
Maybe the weekend meteorologists announce it for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take up the snow and ice.
In this case, the EES acts in accordance with a minute plan.
As soon as a nest in Frankfurt and temperatures fall down under zero degree, it takes 20 of the calls we take A with large salt vehicles, Brauburger explains.
For example, the main arteries and adventures such as the New path and Hanauer Landstraße are included.
But also access to the bomber body, public transport routes, peattonal areas, and we take with pendients, such as Atzelbergstraße.
The service of the EES starts around three of the morning
They must cover about 1,040 km, if necessary, within a maximum of 3 hours with humed salt, which will be better adhered.
Thus the FES starts around the three of the lunch: "The ways are free until it starts the traffic of the point hours."
The difficulty is when it begins to rain around 7:30 p.m.
"And we have a problem," comments the director of winter road maintenance, "for then no one is ready to get out of space to the salt vehicles."
Soon, when it is not anymore, it touchs the secondary and private roads, which also belongs to the Council-Beil-Straße.
The last priority has the post and secondary streets.
That's where the smells are generated, Brauburger knows.
At five of the morning, the ESF's childhood has been started, mainly the dangerous and cruise points are deleted.
In general, the EES could not be charged of the totality of bicycle carriages.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which is from 22 to 4:30 p.m. not mostly lost view to the bridges, says Brauburger.
As these are turning back rapidly, the salt vehicle is run as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees.
In case of emergency, the police can also call them.
The coun of the dinosaur
The Tawa halla had the same aspect as many other carnivorous dinosaurs: a animal of two meters long and 1.50 meters of height that would run over the two strong back balls, had a wide head with afilled and curve dents, short arms with shoes in hoz form and a width round.
If the species had lived a couple of million years later, this wouldn't have been something special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these corporal features, reporting Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the juvenile Science magazine.
The species lived around 215 million years ago in which now is New Mexico, which was then located in a sequence area of the supercontinent Pangea in the context.
Tawa opened a new window towards the previous evolution of the dinosaurs, comments Nesbitt.
We show a lot about the genealogical relationships, the propagation and the features of the first dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologs started a scavation in Ghost Ranch in the north of New Mexico in 2006.
Sometimes, we have found a twenty-five of dinosaury bones in a day, this is something without premature for Triasic seats, report Randall Irmis members of the Utah Natural History Museum team.
The investigators quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation, the remains of five specimens were gathered in total.
A discovery confirms the theory of the ancient history of the dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the gods of the Sun of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt is a exceptional lounge: "The dinosaurs of Triasic dinosaury are extremely rare, generally only individual fragments are found".
Other experts in dinosaurs do not share from all such enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but confirms some theories about the ancient history of the dinosaurs, for example, comments Martin Sander from the University of Bonn.
According to the current view flow, dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these first dinosaurs is quite contraverted.
Thus, experts discuss, for example, when the sauors were shared in their three most important geneological languages: the carnivor theopods between the Tyrontsaurus Rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the quarter saadrhopos, known as "low heat" and their parents, and the Ornithishia herbivorous (sulires with bird pelvis) to those who, for example, belong to the species of Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and its colleagues, Tawa hallae is a primitive terrorism.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, comments Nesbitt.
For example, in the Tawa clan, the investigators found an air tank indication, such as those who also have the seeds of the terrors, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags, bird breathing is more efficient than that of the mammals.
In the case of Tawa also found the bones of the vertebral column were apparently filled with a part-time air.
Tawa is the thermopod with the older and primitive air bags, comments Randall Irmis.
Since the intimate line of the later giant sauropods also had light bones and eggs, it was likely that the common preceding of both groups already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migratory halls to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs until now known in South America lived in South America, researchers decree that the sauries had come to it for the first time.
As a result, the three geneological languages were divided into a start and extended from South America by all the rewards of the earth, which then still formed a single earth mass, the supercontinente Pangea.
However, the facts say that the team found together with Tawa finds the rest of the other two teropodes not very attractive.
The three cannot fall from a single parent preceding, they argued the investigators.
We believe that at least three migratory halls were given to North America, comment Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-actor of Science study.
Of course there are opposers.
An older species, Silesaurus, belonging to a group of dinosaurs brothers, lived in the current Poland, comments on the paleontolog of Bonn Martin Sander.
Your opinion could give a distorsionate image, because simply in South America are still maintaining many dinosaurs fossiles, while in other continents there is only something to discover.
The question of how dynamics have been achieved to evolving a relatively rare coalition line of retreats to the dominant earthquakes of the Mexico remains an enigma.
While, in the Triasic, the dinosaurs still shared their vital space with many other retreats, for example, with the elders of the current cocodrils and the pterosauries and many other saurias.
The dinosaurs were expansive throughout the world and developed many new species, while the partnership was extended at the border of the Triasic to the Jurasic.
Successful historys were not eternal
There are two possibilities to explain this change, comes by Martin Sander.
I could have been given a massive extinction to which the dinosaurs survived per case, but the other not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they could win the contractors in the area.
Successful historys are not always eternal.
150 million years later, a fresh meteorite impact of a group of species, which had also developed in the Triasic, and since then had a miserable existence: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the international signatories.
Participants of the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, in California.
Participate from Napoles, Quebec, Edimburgo, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin Bremen.
The police disappearing of the occupied casino at the Goethe University of Frankfurt repercussed throughout the world.
278 professors and Catholics of the University of Goethe, although also of higher education centres throughout Germany, Europe and North America, are solidarized with protest students in Westend Campus.
In a statement amended in German and English, the police disappearing promoted by the Guideline.
Werner Müller-Estler, President of the university, has disappointed last week the building busy by students and teachers in educational shop, because the walls and works of art were covered by propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered of suffering.
The material damage, they judge the signers, does not justify "the violent dissolution of courses organized by the same students and Catholics by a police command".
The disaster represented an "unacceptable attack" to the freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive approach in the vandalism served for "Delegitimation and Criminalization of Protection" and declined the attention of the content.
The Governing Council has refused to enter into the necessary negotiations.
Doctors require immediate retirement of the complaint.
Most occupants have not caused material damage, says.
legitimated Protest
The young ones of the Verdi Union and the German Federation of Sindicatos are also solidarized with students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of a growing concern for the future, comments the national youth secretariat of Verdi, Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Hessen's Hessen Science Minister, however, defended the action of the university and police rector.
We are grateful with the university rector.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, commented on a current Stunde issue on Thursday in the House of the province of Wiesbaden.
We are understanding with the protest, but we are not understanding with vandalism, and Peter Beauth, delegated by the Provincial Parliament by the CDU.
The opinion of opposition factions, the SPD, the Green and the left, is different.
The DDC used the walls sculpted to criminalize protest as pretext, and Janine Wissler (Link).
Instead of studying the arguments and requirements of students, they are disappointed.
Iceland has submitted a motion, in which the Minister of Interior is requested to submit a report on the police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, unacceptable for Western visitors.
Selenogrado, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a strongly guarded site for the secret weapons investigation.
Today, the community of 216.000 inhabitants, located 37 km from the centre of Moscow, is considered as the "Silicon Valley of Russia".
There are important micro and nanoelectronic research centres.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenogrado have contacted Riedberg's Scientific Headquarter in Frankfurt, university institutions and businesses of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
Several visits were held and now, Monday, Selenogrado and Riedberg signed in Frankfurt a "strict cooperation protocol".
The Moscow Vice-alcalde Juri Rosljak and the Head of Selengrado, Anatoly Smirnov, headed by the Russian delegation; Frankfurt stated the Head of Planning Services Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, they will travel to a seminar in Selenogrado representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises of the Natural Science Research Centre.
Scientific exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But also addresses trade relations.
The FIZ companies will have the opportunity to put a foot on the growing Russian market.
In turn, Russian scientific enterprises want to have access to contracts in Germany.
Selenogrado is the headquarters of Russian important companies and research institutions.
For example, the Moscovian Institute of Electronic Technology, the large Sitronics and Rossijskaja Electronic Consortiums.
The community was founded in 1958 as the name "Socialist Planning Ciudad" for arms investigation.
Selenogrado (formally translated as "Green Ciudad") received his name from the forest mountain landscape, where research facilities were placed.
Stuttgart freezes
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 is not put for nothing enough.
For the parties of the project, it is simple and slowly "the new heart of Europe".
The law I know. S21 is much more than the reduction of a rail station, more than a monstery building project, which will lead to the capital of the Banden-Würtemberga region to a decade of unremediate construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 came from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with reels, which ended in the middle of the city, were considered at that time in the 19th century in engineering flights, acting as a fresh of a modern rail traffic, since anciently there was a great amount of time to engage locomotors backwards.
Rodar, stop the journey in seco continuing, but that's how it must be done.
That's why they had to disappear the terminals: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a step station, which is nearly half of the traject of the trans-European operating lines between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; from there the slogan of "European Cores".
The S21 will really be started, although the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with the reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have learned that in the Hexen and Bavara capitals, it is almost unable to implement the reduction.
Evidently, rail terminals do not have any more input and exit problems, since there are reversible locomotors with tractoral units and cars of the driver in both extremes.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new building ICE to Ulm will be already started.
The Federal and Common Politicals have so prepared.
The rail is still, too, because the risks of the major individual infrastructure projects of the Republic are contributing to them, not to the State.
From the urban perspective, the project is still justified to some point.
New urban space is created, with many green areas, probably from the designer's graphics.
S21 is harmful for the rail transport system.
The step station and the fresh support are thought for the transport of persons, which was allocated to the huge typical growth of the 1980s.
In that time the competition of low cost flights was not given.
However, modern transport policy must first be employed to strengthen goods transport, since rail transport is significantly more ecological than road vehicles.
However, our new buildings are good for loading trains because of intense gradients.
More seriously, S21 also affects many other rail rail projects indirectly.
More than six billion euros should be entered in the Zuaves.
It's the official digit.
Experts believe that it is more realistic between 10 and 15 million.
It is certain that in the next decade the money will miss in other crosses and close passages on the network.
In total, sixty larger projects are found on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important ones is the expansion of over 180 kilometers of long riels through the Rin Valley.
Since 1987 the slow-pass trail is built.
It'd be urgent here to shoot the accelerator as it's reasonable.
Lieutenant Colonel Cribbs for you, sir.
The Rin Valley's tram will be the bottle for international goods transport: through the heart of Europe.
The Government considers the sentence on the airport.
The federal government remains in the Wiesbaden' autonomy parliament, if it is going to submit a appeal for the failure of the prohibition of night flights of Hesse's administrative court.
The CDU/FDP coalition seems to have taken expertise on the legal investigation of VGH, more than 400 pages, as the Minister of Economy, Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had founded in this date that, in the case of the construction of the Northwest atterrissage track planned in the Frankfurt airport, the federal state would have to reregulate the prohibition of night flights again.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as stated by the Federal Government, would not be conciliable with the obligatory legal protection of the rude population because of air traffic.
The coalition must be decided until 4 January, if it is to submit the appeal against this sentence.
The opposition criticized this postage and stressed the representatives of the Government to dismiss the appeal for the Administrative Court of the country in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group Torsten Schäfer-Gumbel urged the CDP and the FDP to respect their promises to prohibition of night air traffic, which had done before the elections. Instead, this could be taken as a lack of word.
It's very difficult, if one let him do his word, he said the chief of the green Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP slogan "We do our word."
The Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gumbel's recruitment, which the federal government would try through the driving of law and trucks to get his night flights.
A comprehensive legal investigation would need enough time.
The coalition would not want to act on the basis of a "first fast print".
We need a legally intakeable decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As the opposition represents, it would never have been the statements of its group on the prohibition of night aircraft.
The US banks return the aid provided.
The major US banks slaughtered by the crisis are disabled from their state attacks.
The "Bank of America" only returned the aid provided by the Tarp Bank Receiver Fund of a total of €45,000 million (approximately EUR 30,000).
The Citi Group also plans to return state aid, according to the United States CNBC report.
In this way, institutions intend to be freed from the restrictions that had been taken from the hand with the acceptance of money, such as the limitation of the payment of bonus to the directors and the payment of high rates.
The "Bank of America" had reached about 19 billion net money through convertible goods.
The rest of the sum took it from the box itself, which had a lot of means, among others for the sale of rubbers.
The bank director Kenneth Lewis thanked the US contributions on Wednesday night: the financial injection helped to overcome very difficult times.
The banking house had noted badly the efforts to absorpte the investment bank in the climate of the financial crisis.
The Citi Group also intends to get money on the capital market to be free of its obligations against the state.
The CNBC informed the source of known circles that the US bank could already announce the increase of its capital for $20 million for this Thursday.
A representative of the Citi Group did not want to comment.
In June they had already returned their supports to Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Speed selection
Finally, it was faster than it was thought.
Only two weeks after the Administrative Board of ZDF (German television channel) press the Nikolus Brender head to leave his post, the channel can be presented to a successor.
Tonight the committee intended to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of ZDF primary study in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this by the employee, officially to not anticipate the procedure.
But it was certain that it also influenced the no longer damage to the director of the ZDF Markus Schächter, if this proposal would not be adopted in the administrative council.
Frey, the candidate of Schchachter, needs 9 of the 14 members of the ceremonie.
The result of the vote was not yet specific in the closure of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schacher failed in the administrative council with its proposal to renew the contract of Nikolus Brender for more than five years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's destination was a amazing failure to Schacher, but a failure that could be expected.
Because the majority of the Union in the administrative council had indicated that they would not support Brender at its position for a week before the election.
The opposition against the head of draft was organized by the President of the Hesse Government, Mr. Roland Koch.
He rejected another mandate of the prestigious drafting head with the argument, which under the direction of Brender's reports, ZDF would have lost hearing indexes.
Even soon before elections there were protests because of this, in which the political influence on the ZDF was reflected.
At the end, 35 public specialists had been introduced in the debate, which were qualificated by Koch's path as an unconstitutional.
But I didn't serve anything.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4 in Bingen in August 1957.
He studied political, pedagogy and Romanian philology.
Then he worked in the Southwestfunk employee and in the newspaper "Frankfurter Rundschau".
In 1983, ZDF was changed in principle to the "day newspaper".
The following stations: 1988 to 1990, the personal rapporteur of the editorial head; 1991/92 corresponsal in Washington; until 1998, director and conductor of the math programme "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001, director of the foreign policy of the ZDF; since then, the ZDF study director in capital.
The political party of the Greens announced a constitutional request after Brender's destitution, which was still elected as a journalist of the year by the media magazine "Medium Magazine".
The opposite of Koch in the administrative council, the President of the Government of Renania-Palatinado, explained the last week that the federal states should change the State Convention of the ZDF in such a manner that the proposals for the Director's staff could not be blocked by a majority with political motivation.
A retirement of partial politicians from the ZDF control boards was discarded by Beck.
The likely successor of Brender, Mr. Peter Frey, recommended to the administrative counsel with a intelligent game: he strongly criticized the grace for the destitution of Brender.
Thanks to this periodic independence test both Schächter could appoint it for the head of the edition without losing the face, as the administrative counsel could vote, without defeating the suspect to give him the post to a party sequence.
In the calculations of the Frey Party, all forms of the left liberalians are assigned.
university careers are cut off
Partial efficiency for students: After a year of education-related wheels, the Ministers of Education and Cultural of the Federal States finally ended. In a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Education with university recruiters, both were agreed to try to improve the study conditions in literature and more.
Students in a future should be able to overcome their careers.
For instance, it was agreed to reduce the load of reviews: Basically, each cart module should end with a single review.
Furthermore, it is intended to consider the workload of students, and it is intended to ensure a "real and justified measurement".
Political and universities also want to simplify the recognition of test results between universities inside and outside Germany.
The federal states are committed to more flexiblely confect the structural rules together for Bachelor and Master's carriages.
Regulations of the fellow states that differ from this should not be already existing.
Unexpected reviews
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Cultural and the universities continue to speak about the improvement of the ability to carry out and conclude successfully a car (audibility).
Now the first time it was spoken of a concrete content.
The so-called acknowledging advisory agreed to decrease the amount of reviews: "All modules end with only a review," says in a document of 30 pages, which aims to regulate partly the adoption of university roads.
With the "sensitive reduction of the load of reviews" it is intended to avoid development in a wrong direction, which would sensitively affect studyability, thus explained the director of the Credibility Council, Mr. Reinhold Grimm.
In addition, in a future, "audibility" must be the decisive criteria for the configuration.
The modules and contents should be examined extensively as regards unnecessary restrictions of students in the election.
the courses.
Students would have "the right to get more spaces, which could and promote their own initiative".
These rules would be valid for new carriages, but also in the review of existing carriages.
These should be "reacredited" every five years. But this would mean, that would be late until 2015 to review all the carriages.
The responsibilities of this would be at the level of the country of 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the Credition Board, which is installed by the federal states.
The Ministers of Education and Culture urged the federal states to influence this in the agencys, that the quantity of materials and reviews are not too strict or demanding.
In some federal states, universities and technical schools have already been in line with the ministers to take such measures.
Only now, Renania-Platinada has ensured that additional means for the further development of the Boloni process have been facilitated.
With this money, universities should implement support and student advice programmes, and strengthen review offices and outside.
The federal State and universities intend to have EUR 10 million for these purposes.
At the beginning of 2010, the Government wants to bring to the Parliament a news of university law.
Accordingly, it should be sufficient to review only for the end of a carriage model.
The configuration of the carriage should be more flexible and will also ensure recognition of evaluations in other universities and facilitate accessibility to Master.
To the end of the year it is intended to review all the carriages about its "audibility".
This Thursday, the Government and the opposition again discussed the conditions of study in the federal state.
Apart from the joy, there were also critical decisions.
The joint directive at the federal level of the Juso university groups (socialist youths) was required, that the setting of educational policy should not be performed by the ministers and university adctors.
After the earnings of education, students should now be able to consider.
The President of the university recruiters collection (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, supported students: "We need the experience of students," said the Thursday in a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with which HRK released a joint reform document.
For the University of Education and Science (GEW) the Bonn agreements were not entirely sufficient: the synagogue requires legal law for each student with the title of Bachelor the possibility of access to a later Master's car.
In addition, federal states need to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there are enough studies places for Master with the best possible study conditions. In this way, he informed a member of the GEW, Mr. Andreas Keller.
The federal states need to be fully lessons.
But about a greater access to the master, the Ministers of Education did not comment.
More than one note at the foot about Herta Muller
"Introduction and exit from Germany is almost without control," says the first line of a lirik Werner Söllner's poem in unbalanced idiomatic fragments, in which the experiences of arrival to Germany lived by a deputy who won their freedom, but lost the environment of their language.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked as German and English teacher in Bucarest, and then as a reader in a child book editor, before turning to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner gave him a number of literature prizes, in 1993, he was a director of the Hesse literature in the Mousonturm in Frankfurt University, and since 2002 he was the director of the Hesse literature for the Mousonturm.
God speaks enough on Monday during a meeting in Munich about "Germanian literature in Romania in the shore and the designed shock of his seats of Security"
Visiblely insecure and frustrated, Süllner reads a statement in which he acknowledged the participation as IM in the Roman secret service Securitate against German-rumian writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Womendorfer.
With some of the presents in 1989, Söllner had received the German Language Prize.
The rectification attempts were slowly started at the beginning of 1971.
"That is why I am a person who has not been defended enoughly against the attempts to cause the fear of the Security", ended Söllner.
Lirik Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
At the same time the Nobel literature premium to Herta Muller and its literatory polyemic, unlike the dictatorial domain mechanisms, the literary scene and, in particular, the community of German authors from Romania for a case that proves that abismos and maliciousness of a political system, which is based on control and sponjage.
Werner Söllner is, so it is known until now, not only a author, but also a victim.
In his Securitate IM Walter's presentator, he had played a role, said the literatory scientist Michael Markel after the confesion of Söllner, and highlighted the positive influence of Walter.
He had forgiven or defended it in all the difficult points for him, said Markel.
"I feel the moral need to do this statement," said.
The Declaration of Söllner in this way and against this public was unexpected, the condemnation of an ex-deputy and its work with the Roman secret service, however, is not so surprised.
Germany would have been a comfortable refugee for the Securitate-Spitzel's Spizel, wrote Herta Müller already in July in the "Time" weekly after reading his own poster of 914 pages.
The involvers will certainly have speculated and will have known in some cases, which names were hidden behind Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
Unlike the review of the issuers Stasi with a controlled procedure in Germany, the treatment with the Security control employees is still sufficiently widespread.
A systematic clarification was boicoteed and difficult in the past few years.
A national security advisory (CNSAS), related to the Birthler authority, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the employees since then is more rarassed.
Since 2005, there is a law which regulates the administration of employees.
A interview, after granting the Nobel Literature Prize to Herta Muller, proves that the influence of old members of the Security in Romania is still much large. In this interview an ex-homen of the Teesvar Security spoke dependingly on the condecorated.
"He has psychics." Finally, they just asked her once.
The poority of the power seemed to be able to be shown without turns under the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, there are inevitable questions with the Söllner case, as many times when there are guilty.
Why right now? Who has been damaged to him? The calm reaction of the listeners against the confesion of Söllner lets wait that the continuing of this story will be registered more by the experiences of knowledge and not so for the guilt of guilt and anger.
For the genes of Herta Müller's work, who has accepted the Nobel Prize of literature yesterday, it is more than a simple note on his feet.
The League of Campeones as a guarnition to fill the stomach
When the new trainer of the VfB Futball team of Stuttgart, Christian Gross, composed of a narrow color platform of the supplier of his team, addressed a Mercedes of the Classe C a fourth hour after the average night, was the impression that a member of the outdoor service was elegantly clothing out of a very nice Christmas celebration, where the manufacturer of sportive articles had distributed samples.
The man of the calves had contracted a chofer because he had not yet known the city.
On the other hand, he could also drive the car himself: at the end of accounts, he had no alcohol in game, and he was not joyful to the 55-year-old man.
It was a pleasant velvet, but tomorrow it was going to start again.
The first time I'd start.
In the words of the suicide, which had been contracted only three days ago: "It is true we reach the eights of the end," namely, in the Championship League, thanks to the triumph 3:1 against the Unirea Urziceni of Romania, "but we cannot let us shut up for success: we will have to fight brutally against the decline."
"The much more important task" was expecting you next Sunday, said.
Then, it will be necessary to repeat the success of the "real classs" in the cotidianity of the link.
And remove the weaknesses, which have been clearly proved again, after the three degrees of Marica (5), Trish (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Sound
The final octets of the Campeon League (the parties of 16/17 and 23/24 of February/February/Parts 9/10 and 16/17 of March) shall be issued in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy was remained limited by the fulfiling entry of Babylon’s successor.
Not only in the salvador, which recently inspired them to the unconcerned professionals of Stuttgart confidence in himself, is available to deliver and enjoy the game.
I went with the players and said they had to focus on their strong points, I urged them to be more swimming, explaining the reparator of the souls Gross his reception of the success that so simple sound, but that with the Babbel therapy had no more effect.
He deployed a certain magic, accepted the Babbel's party, Jens Lehmann, "when in the football a new impulse is happening, sometimes things that couldn't be believed."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a few weeks' suspension due to a lesson, continued to become the most local player thanks to his dinamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" resulted from the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way to work the new chief: "He is a man who interferes back, and requires discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
And this is what I had missed, of course, when I was Babylon.
The VfB Stuttgart has not passed the test yet, warn the Sport Guideline Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs any consciousness.
Like Gross, also players and administrators were overlooked the triumph against a weak defence because of the lack of residues and fully refunded from Roman invitations.
They were also winned in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at 1:4 had arrived the triste shock, he thought Khedira.
And the director Horst Heldt warned that although a timely goal was reached, the other was still very far.
We still haven't overcome the problem.
That Heldt had no desire to celebrate in his birthdays number 40, even after the first victory in his seat three months ago, was due to the events of the weekend, which returned to be updated in the form of a television interview, transmitted just before the start of the game, which had granted the port Jens Lehmann.
There are other decisions to take, and not Jens, who had Heldt before Lehmann's hard criticism.
This had reprovated deficiency in the direction to the guidance council, which had decided to change training by the pressure of adolescent fans.
Also that his free day after the games was removed Lehmann as a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness", reputed Heldt, and announced consequences for the viewer.
Probably they will not be friends forever, both quarentons.
But at least, they agreed with all others that without the previous efforts of the replaced trainer team, the spectrum of great game and battle force was not possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a important participation in the success", they said Heldt and Lehmann to the unity; and he also agreed to the man of the plastic males.
World struggle of weight-weight campeonate
Duded in Berna: Kevin Johnsonn once again was caused by the world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and pledges.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended its weighting title in the WBC version.
The judgment of the judges was unique.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko is still a worldwide weight camp.
The 38-year-old camp in the WBC association's version came on Thursday night in Berna to the United States Kevin Johnson by one-time decision (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko was his third successful defense since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was two times a global campaign of WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it couldn't be able to make the wedding that everyone had expected.
Klitschko extended 39 triunfos in 41 professional battles, and two times he had to be able to be slaughtered because of his lesions.
The publisher Johnson had to accept the first break in his battle number 24.
Before about 17,000 spectators in the Arena de Berna, Klitschko, with a 2,02 m station, I wanted to spend the battle over all his left hand.
But Johnson, nine centimeters below, which had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era, was squirting one and another of the shoes of the world campaign, so Klitschko could not decisively bring to its right dangerous goal.
In general, the passive Johnson did too little for a repository, and just tried to pass the rounds.
Although it was caused Klitschko with words and loops, his shoes were only rarely reached to the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who suffered 12 full rounds with Klitschko.
Before the battle, the driver had already produced a certain scandale in the Swiss capital.
I had insulted Klitschko as "Horrible Zombie" which "not knows to do anything."
When he performed the pain, the camp was left to cause the Wednesday to take Johnson's sunlight "to see his eyes".
Fourth triumph after Klitschko return
Also in his fourth battle after his return on October 11, 2008, Klitschko remained invencible.
After a period of almost four years, he arrived at that time to the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and he had restored the "su" cinturon of the WBC, which had before had to deliver without fighting.
That year, he arrived in his defence in the title of Juan Carlos Gómez, Cuba, and in September, Chris Arreola, from the United States.
In this fight I only received a shooting, and I'm in very good physical condition, I had explained Klitschko his rapid return to the ring.
But his dream remains to meet all the four important titles in your family.
Your brother Vladimir is the world camp of WBO and IBF associations.
However, the census belongs to the British David Haye, after it destroyed in November to Nikolai Valujev, 2,13 meters of staturing.
In the past summer, Haye had cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Surely, the company that you're promoting is planning the fight against Klitschko at the Wembley Stadium in London.
The case of Kunduz
The front attack of the opposition: the chief of the green group, Jürgen Trittin, called the Minister of Defense, Gutenberg, because of false information on the matter Kunduz.
The SPD and the links require the explanation of the canciller.
Hamburg/Berlín – After the most recent revelations on the air attack of Kunduz, the opposition revoked the Minister of Defense, Karl-Theodor to Gutenberg (CSU) who had inflicted the causes.
In the emission of news "Tagsview" of Saturday, transmitted by the ARD TV channel, the head of the Green Group, Jürgen Trittin, said that "the scientists didn't say the truth" about the mortal bomb of two chambers.
In one of these cases, normally it is said, "He said lies."
The order to kill would have been given without taking into account the rules of the International Protection Trop for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the NATO report, and he read Mr. Gutenberg, said Trittin.
On Wednesday, it was known that in this attack it was not only tried to destroy the sequestrated trucks, but also to kill two Taliban leaders intentionally.
In the aircraft attack from the United States, requested by the German Commander of Kunduz, the Coronel Klein, in accordance with the NATO research report, died or was led to 142 persons.
The green, the SPD and the left urged the Federal Canceller Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the federal parliament and to clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel must clarify whether an intentional murder strategy is part of the federal government policy, and if the Canciller, the Army and the Information Service have adopted this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and his colleague of the Green Renate Künast.
The government's port, Ulrich Wilhelm, decidedly rejected the criticism.
The cancilearian did not have any influence on the concrete action of the German army in Afghanistan, said.
The Saturday also had questioned about the presentation made by the Ministry on the reasons for the delay of the Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and the Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL information, both were informed to Gutenberg about the transit of the shopping attack.
It was officially said that they had rejected the existence of the NATO reports and hidden delicate details to the Minister.
However, since the surrounding of the two high-range officials, they had even indicated the Ministry of Defence the existence of several reports, including a document of two pages of the Coronel Klein, who was the command, and a report of a field patrol.
However, Wichert would have requested in a letter that explains the matter, reports the newspaper "Frankfurter Generaler Sonntagszeitung".
Until the moment you have not received the answer, it was said.
The Ministry was not expressed on Saturday on the reproachs that it was done, and noted that this would be cleared in the Federal Parliament's research commission, which will be the next Monday.
Honical Municipalities
In the state of monitoring, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of mental diseases and drugs, the limits between imagination and reality are decreased.
When it happens during the dream, it's in order.
When we are accommodated in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we can give us the most sweet imaginations and creations of the fantasy.
However, who experiences dreams like states during the guard, or sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, the majority of times in the Western world is considered as crazy or drugs, or at least as maniacs.
But such images and voices are not only in mental or drug diseases.
The guilt has our imagination: the same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, painting tables or writing newly, at times the limits between dream, looseness and reality are disappeared.
The states of honorably modified conscience can appear in the most different forms, in the best cases we call them visions, and in the worst, lying.
Although the detainees and effects can be distinguished, they can be sent to similar processes the visions of the Mistic Hildegard van Bingen, the psychodelic experiences of the prophet of the New Era Carlos Castañeda, the chamanic possession states, and the psychics and alucinations.
Alucinations or deliriums occur when the balance of neuronal communication substances has been discharged in the brain – all of the dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonine and acetilcolin – and interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
During a squizofrenic psychics, complex alucinations and disappointed thoughts appear very frequently.
Severity has no longer power over him
The relationship between laughter and dream has been occupated with philosophys and doctors since ancient times.
Aristoteles conceived the alucinations as a form of visional dream, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatric, found in 1861 "a grain similarity of the state of luxury with the honourable states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream even was "un psychics, with all disproportionate trainings, and specimens of this."
It is the autumn of 2001 when Henning T. becomes a comic figure.
Your body is of two sizes and scenelessly colored.
Severity has no power on him already, is flowing near the bedroom.
He feels a shock.
Turn from him, figures of demons with balls, with red moods like blood, deforms, recycling the dentists.
They're persecuting him, patheting him with weight and flameful bones, cut it against the walls, he feels pain in the whole body.
Stress and malignous voices come from the walls and the radio.
You can't support them, the voices that are insulting and disappointing.
Henning T. covers two stereo cable cables, snakes to form a shore cloud, and fix them in a shock on the board.
He goes up in a wood and puts the cloud around the skin.
Shut up.
The shoe is shocked.
What a lesson to you!, shouted the voices in a cord that revises the tips, "See to the clinic and make you worried!"
Now, Henning T. has 40 years of age and has experienced six acute psychics, the last two years ago, the first 20 years ago.
The cause that I produced was LSD.
Your diagnosis is psychic squizo-affective-paranoid, also maniaco-depressive, take medicines, against depression, mania, squizofrenia.
You've learned to live with your sickness, three years ago she's married.
In the psychics I experienced the worst and deepest desperation, says.
Alucinations are a cruel reality
Nearly one percent of the population is sick at least once in the life of squizofrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute squizofrenic psychics, most of the times affected can no longer distinguish between the outside world and the internal, and happen in an overwhelming state that can lead to alucinations, delicates of greatness, relationship disorders, or persecution.
Specifically extended voice is heard: voices that will command, comment or dialogue.
Also, optical alucinations are frequent.
The affected one is no longer able to distinguish the importance of what is not it, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, consciousness seems instant of pressures.
Like the dream, psychics also opens the compounds to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest shoes of conscience.
The perception of the reality in psychics is focused on the subject, says the Catholic Thomas Fuchs, head of the clinic of the Hedelberg University Hospital.
The skizofronic is located in the center of the events, everything has a meaning to it.
At the same time, a passive role, as in a dream, feels abrupt by events and cannot organize them actively.
That is why skizofronics are often feeling threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general, it is not possible to adapt the reality to them, alucinations are a cruel reality, dispersing, impossible.
Have experienced a lucination once in life
Instead of a dream, Fuchs says, "the space and sensitive structure of the reality that is under the psychics remain in principle."
Paranoic thoughts and alucinations are supported in the reality, the distance of experience has occurred in reality.
For investigators, there's still an innocent why our brain does horse.
According to Fuchs, exceptional states may lead to any person to lose contact with the reality in a provisional manner.
But not all people develop a psychic.
It seems that there is a genetic provision for skizofrenia, but studies in gemele have demonstrated that genes are also other determining factors.
The investigators suggest that affected ones suffer minimum brain damage.
We suspect that the neuron matureness of the brain is affected in a early stage of development, such as through a viral disease of the mother during pregnancies, explains Fuchs.
But it is still an inconsistent how this changing of the neuron system is produced, which is not absolutely shown for many years.
The influence of the environment also plays an important role – stress or traumatic experience may be the detonants of a psychics when there is already a preceding provision.
Similarly, alucinogen drugs can cause psychics, since they interfere into the brain transmiser system.
When the brain calms
The logo of all this is that psychotic people suffer with their alucinations and take very precious medicines to be delivered from them, while others pay by drugs that allow some to experience, says the Catholic psychology in Erich Kasten, Lübeck.
Increasing an alucination as a pleasant or not often depends on the view point.
Kasten has collected 10 years ago reports on alucinations and visions and has analyzed the results in the book The irreal World in our head (The irreal world in our head), published last year.
Alucinations are among the typical symptoms associated with psychics, but also, surprisingly, many other diseases.
Among them, together with psychical disorders such as personality or depression, often also diseases such as migration, epilepsia, multiple clerrosis, Alzheimer and chronoencephalical traumatisms.
in a surprising way and in certain conditions, the brain of healthy people suffers alucinations.
The alucinations, according to Kasten, consist of memories that are normally repressed.
It appears when the brain areas in which sensitive perceptions are hyperactive or are little slight; when our brain is hot, but also when lacking stimulals.
Drugs can cause this state as well as brain damage or psychics.
But also the restriction of stimulus, stress, love bad or other brain states of exception.
In recent studies, until a third of the questionnaires had experienced a halusination at least once in life.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. had 16 years of age, lived in a small city of Mecklenburg and West Pomerania and attended a secondary school college.
A hurry girl.
If it wasn't by these images and voices.
Sometimes, during the recreation, a boy's torpe with long and darkness leads the word to him.
When she responds to her, the other students look at her, and no one, besides it, hear or see the boy.
They think the girl's a little strange teacher, but Sarah K. knows he's not dreaming.
He's quiet and seeing and listening to that boy, as you see, and listen to the girl sit down in the bank on the side.
You may even feel your presence, at least some moments.
It's a nice feeling, she likes the boy.
Sometimes it's wondering if it's crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of visions are not real and are gone.
By nights, the appearances are alarming.
Let's move out! Everybody up!
When it is in class sometimes can't follow the lesson because the teacher – his eyes and ears – is presenting a new companion, while for the rest explains the mathematical equations in a visible way and hearable.
By nights, the appearances are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room to reach the dream, which often comes late and is low, you don't know to distinguish whether you're riding or dreaming, if the images that you see, the munchs or the girl with bloody cuts in arms and legs, appear in front of their open or closed eyes.
Leave me in peace, cry them to the figures.
Your parents and friends haven't told you anything, they would believe it's crazy.
Thursday 2009, Sarah K. has 20 years of age.
He adopted last year selectivity and lived with her girlfriend.
A year ago the alucinations have disappeared.
Since you've been in contact via the Internet with the psychologist Kasten, you know it's not crazy.
The crazy is also a work of art for desperation.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffers a restriction of stimulus, it is very likely that after a time it begins to have alucinations.
I think the brain is uncovery and it is responsible for the same to seek entertainment.
Sarah K., the only daughter, had little fear of other children and often played alone.
His alucinations began when, with 13 years of age, it was known that the man whose father called his father since he uses the reason is not his biological father.
As visual and acute alucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real and sound pressures, the affected ones like Sarah K. It is difficult to distinguish between visions and reality. "Each experience," Kasten says, "have place in the brain, the reality is designed there.
The alucinations are also images that the brain produce, so they look so real."
Kasten also classifies night fantasies as a form of alucination.
The alucinations of healthy people are not different from the fundamentals of the acute psychics.
Instead of skizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their visions as irreal.
Casten recommends that his patients appreciate their alucinations as a special ability.
Limitation between dream and alucination
in this too well-conscious world, imaginatory experiences are generally pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Catholic in Heidelberg, and Head of the psychiatric and psychotherapy of the hospital Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and pending disease, but also involves something positive and creative – the crazy is a work of desperation.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated the called unirism, a special form of conscience, which is seen as a dream.
Honical alucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person experienced it is real and that later cannot differ from being discovered.
Holiric conscious states occur in extreme situations associated with trauma or disease, such as patients with polyradio-Europeans, who experience a motor paralysis and are fully aware.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of himself or of the world because of a total and permanent motor incapacity, this replaces a real dangerous situation by a own and imaginative world that is disappointed of reality.
A form of limited situation between dream and alucination.
Since a situation in reality is not possible, a world change is produced, although the real situation is still present in imagination.
A intense way to make sense and interpretation to an inadequate situation in itself that our own creation capacity allows us not to spend in nothing of the loss of conscience.
All is real, even later in memory
The artist of art Peter Cornelius Claussen of Zurich describes his honourable experiences in his book of heart change as an action for the salvation of the soul.
It was 49 years old, when his conscience was embarrassed in travels of several days after an operation of the hearts with an inclusive heart transplant, while his body was sentenced to immobility in intensive care station.
Clausen was a world created by the same and visited foreign places of other times: he was posted in bed, a higher man on the board of a sanitation in a train, a robot guarded for his health.
It was seen in the high age of Media, rounded by nobles that produced drugs from blood.
A Greek on a motor followed him in his country of origin, surfed on his hospital bed in the Alpes with fire nest and found him with a mafious Korean.
It gives everything in these imaginative facts, everything is real, even later in the memorys.
For Claussen, these internal trips are fundamentally different than any dream.
Sounding is a different state, so describes your experience.
Instead, the memories of mental travels are, many years later, much more clearer, even in irrelevant details.
More clear and intensive than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilute the horizon of the rest of our cotidian experiences, adds the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, ambitiousism, psychics, alucinations and drug consumption show that it is the internal reproduction of the external reality, even when we are disappointed.
Each change of the state of conscience reiterates the psychologist Kasten, "you can bring to a deformation of what we call reality."
A experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
The snow can come
Burden
Children will be charged by the editorial with 27 years of age
The new editor Kallen has reached a provisional solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in hands of his two children, commented to SPIEGEL.
100% of holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – The editor Hubert Burda sees your company in the hands of your children in the future.
The two children become a heritage of 27 years and have the strong will to enter the company, confirmed Burda, 69 years old, to SPIEGEL.
The details have been adjusted as a precaution measure.
The following question is whether they will participate actively in the company.
Also, if you are trained for that.
One can't put 7.500 workers to its children, if they are not sufficiently trained for it.
That would end with children and with the company.
Burda was aware of the Thursday that will be retired from January of the Presidency of the Joint Directive and Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been appointed his successor.
This member of the Kallen family, from 52 from 1999, is a member of the Burda address.
At the beginning he was responsible for technology.
Later, he was loaded from the treasure, and there was the responsibility of the company's heritage. After the outcome of Jürgen Todengrandfer was also charged by the direct marketing, foreigner, printing and financial marketing.
For the first time, no member of the family takes the copy of the editorial.
Burda’s children have 19 and 17 years, and her son Felix, who now had 42 years of age, died some years ago.
The designation of Kallen also serves, "Save the differences of 10.15 years" according to Burda.
100% of holding will also be in the hands of the family.
With the look at the cases Schickedanz and Schaeffle, Burda showed that the family companies are not safe from the decade: "This has always affected families that have stopped counting by the capital search farm, who have tried badly and thought they could be higher as well as the largest player.
It has never been my strategy.
I've never had the "delirios of greatness", says Burda.
I don't see me as a political precepter of this country, as it was Springer, and I don't want to play with the "Time" in the world's link; these businesses have been too big.
Integral beauty
All that - in the question of beauty and well- you can want, at the extent of your hand.
This seems to have been proposed The English Court, which has just been inaugurated in the commercial center of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and mime of the body.
Spa, situated in the plant, has prestigious signs like Hedonai - which is responsible for laser depilation -; Spaxion, with ethical relaxation and treatment rooms; Luis & Tachi Peluqueros; Marina d'Or, which has a gymnase, or La Western and its natural cosmetic, among others.
There is also a food section, where it highlights the teater, with more than 130 different types of this infusion.
Disfunction of a relaxed massage with your couple while you see the most beautiful views of the capital, or spend the relax area for two hours to mount your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relaxers with a jacuzzi session, masks and taking a chamn copy are some of the possibilities that Spaxion offers.
In total, 250 m2 distributed in 12 rooms for the latest and newest facial, corporal and hydrotherapy treatment.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight celulitis or vibratory platforms.
The gymnase also contain these machines, in addition to virtual trainers that are going to drive the passes of customers, offering them a completely personalized treatment.
Everything begins by introducing your personal key in a tactil screen, located in front of the machine.
Then, several videos show us how to do our exercise table correctly.
Your director ensures that 15 minutes (including heating and extracts) are sufficient to exercise all the muscles of the body.
And, if after exercising our body, we want to pass through the peculiarity, the sign Luis & Tachi has a room where hair recovery rituals, lightness or personality are offered.
Innovation and exclusiveness seem to have been the premises of this urban space, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 from morning to 22:00 of night.
Variated selections
It is about the Christmas and is never more to repay the sights of the stars to adapt them to our party clothes.
The form of the scot, very important to realize the siluet, is one of the variables we must take into account.
There are some suggestions.

Finsa and Barcelona, with electric car
The Finsa Electric Company, together with the Barcelona Jointing, created the LIVE Office.
This is a project to develop and promote electric vehicles in the Catalonia capital.
The LIVE Office (Logistic for Electric Vehicle Installation) will define and coordinate the road sheet for the installation of electric cars in the city and reach agreements around mobility, managing, coordinating, subventions, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project will develop, promote electric vehicle, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Finally, it is intended to stimulate what will be the transport of the future.
3 'Electric citizens'
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the inplantation of electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla are subject to the project.
These are the three cities elected by the Government within the MOVELE Plan to stimulate the installation of the electric vehicle.
The final electricity company has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Cataluña.
This aims to promote technological research and development activities in the Cataluña Autonome Community.
The energy-related activities and, in particular, energy efficiency would be found among them.
It is not the only initiative in which finally participates in the promotion of electric vehicles.
The company participates in standardization groups at European level and has a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a tranquility horizon' for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, is the main exporter sector in the country.
In the presentation of the Economic Report of the Government ' s Chairman for 2009, Zapatero recalled the measures laid down by the Executive Board during the biennium to support the car sector.
"In the Automotive Competitive Plan, today we would have a displacement panorama, to shut some of our main productive plants," explained the President of the Government.
"Thank you to this plan and the disposal of brands to follow in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a horizon of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main exporter sector," added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, including the Integrated Automotive Plan (PIA), allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 assistant companies, mobilizing more than 3,000 million euros.
The Executive Chief explained that this investment was commitmented to develop new models and to modernize existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized the government support measures for the request, in alignment to the 2000E Plan, implemented in collaboration with autonomy communities and automotive brands.
According to the President, this plan has been allowed to reduce the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in Spanish markets by 6% and has promoted a "force increase" of matriculation, which increased "40%" in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
In Madrid, the first edition of the International Travel Salon, a meeting room for engineering professionals and afixed professionals, will be held.
This initiative will be developed during the 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Cristal Pabell of the Camp House of Madrid.
This is a exposure surface of 20,000 square meters, where there will be more than 200 national and international exposures.
It is not only possible to find classic motors and cars, but it will be found in ClassicAuto Madrid articles of all kinds related to the engine world.
Thus, among the publishers of the pavillon, accessors, rechanges, components, textile accessories, supplements, publications, miniatures, etc.
hundreds of articles related to the world of classic engines that will do the deceits of collegeists and curiose collegeists.
Among the participating enterprises will be found Classics of Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Joan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche sale and reconstruction of cars; or Cochera Classics, specialist Mercedes Benz.
External ability tests
In addition, the trade activities of this Salon will be completed with parallel activities: celebration of concentrations, sports exhibitions, skills tests, presentations and competitions.
There will also be evidence of ability with classic cars and motorcycles in a circle enabled outside the phenomenon.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Sustainable sport
Mazda wants to demonstrate that sports are not raised with environmental respect.
Therefore, you have just entered the Mazda3 stop and starting engine system - built as i-Stop -, a device that is at least available at the moment only with the 2.0 gasoline engine with 150 horses.
This second generation of the Mazda3 is highlighted by the good note reached throughout its entirety.
The ends, the closure of the vehicle, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanical, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are overseas in the new Mazda3.
Starting by the conducting position, we confirm that the front bottles present a excellent ergonomic and subjection.
Also, the board of the flight is exquisite.
Following the whole form of the instrument table and the console we see as Mazda has continued to create a future future design, with a large number of bottles and commands and calling colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of which also presents Honda Civic.
We can therefore say that both Japanese Mazda3 and Civic are contrasting with the sovereignty of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to shoot.
Continuing with the room, this Japanese compact presents a more costly habitability for four adults to travel with a higher comfort level.
In all these cases, a wide and regular shape is summarised.
The motor stop and automatic starting system, at least at the moment, is only available with the two-like gas engine and 150 horses and the manual change of six walks.
This engine is an authentic delicia. Overseek by its end, by its reduced rumority, for performances and by reaching content consumption.
And it is that although the most demanded Mazda3 will be the diesel versions, those who do not realize a high number of miles per year should not discard this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for their high driving comfort and for their content.
With regard to the level of equipment, the chosen version for the test is the named Sportve, which includes a larger number of series elements.
Overseas specially the carril change assistant (RVM) that eliminates the dead angle, the treatment and stability controls, the speed control, the sensitive inside spots, the board computer in a large size screen, the equipment sensors, the independent climatector, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17 pulses.
Furthermore, if it was little for your equipment, this version was counted with the Premium Pack, which adds by EUR 1.500: making adaptive bioxenon and BOSE sound system with disk loader, among other elements.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts of the category.
It especially highlights the quality of employed materials, their conduct and high level of equipment.
Furthermore, those who do not realize many km per year can opt this i-Stop version, associated only with gasoline motor 2.0 of 150 horses.
The only inconvenience of this model is its high price, which is between the 21.770 euros of the final Luxury and the 23.270 euros of the tested version - Sports-.
In change of this high number, Mazda3 will offer us a large dose of satisfaction every day.
Low 'premiere'
L. A. covers the red shadow of sensuality of the hand of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars sneaked more than ever in the elegant models like 'sexys' in the star of Nine. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', sophisticated as usual, opted for a dark 'lady'.
The Promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at the e-mail, without even seeing some types of attachments or browsing via the network.
He disappointed his five-minute fame in the United States when the Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
See it on the street is more difficult, truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for youth.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low month quote, less than half of which is paid, for example, by the data plan of iPhone.
Since the success has taken two new devices: one only thought for Twitter, the one with a free life data service as a change in paying six times more by Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday in the Le Web event, is the European version of the invent and its third incarnation.
It's equal to limited than your United States counterparty, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price, from about 12 euros per month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those traveling with smartphones already know what it is to have to stop the data when crossing the border or looking for a WiFi (or a background connection) cafeteria to be able to consult the email.
The idea of a fixed price roaming is incredibly attractive and long ago it would have to be in function.
Yes, some operators have special travel agreements, and travel plans, but in my experience, there is a physician to understand them and a good gift to read the small letter.
Repeated ears from the European Commission for the achievement of acquired roaming tariffs for all Europe have had a perceived effect.
Out of the country of origin there is fear to use the data, and with reason.
That a device like FonPeek (not be wonderful that it takes the name of the Fund when no Wifi) makes this type of tariffs means that the operators start thinking differently and study different proposals with which they love their data network.
Childle is another good example, including book download traffic and other internet consultations.
No contracts and no gates.
It's a connected device and it's paid for it when buying it, not month to month.
And that's what I hope to see some day with FonPeek, a buy option with access to life like that Peek has already in the U.S.
It's not because he's going to buy him.
I'm looking at my phone, thank you.
I hope it is because I think it's a more fair model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this system.
Michelle Fetics Colour
The amarillo is, uncertainly, the favorite tone of the first American woman.
If you have already accompanied Barack Obama's ownership as President of the United States with a clothes and a framework of this color, he has chosen the same to accompany him in the second most important moment of his life: the collection of it in the Nobel Prize of Peace.
Michelle Obama has brought a very similar model in the two occasions: in addition to being a similar - green color with brilliant reflections - the two times the acting was composed of three pieces - vested, each and under the same screen, and swimming with a large round or collar.
So, at first, it seemed that the first woman of the United States followed the star of the Prince of Asturia and had chosen to repeat the vestaurie.
But the screen in which the two clothes are confected makes them very different.
If it is for the ownership of a gross assignment, in Oslo is a third-party with storm.
The supplements have also varied: green shoes of mid-tacon on the other time, and a similar model, but in dodo, now.
And also different is the penite: a collection at this time, melena swings the previous.
75 per cent of labour mothers have had working problems for their mother
Discrimination in work has increased in recent years, especially for women of the youngest generations who want to be mothers.
This shows the study 'Fecundity and Labour Traictory of Women in Spain', developed by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women Institute.
The survey between 9.737 women from 15 to 75 years is not doubtful: 75 per cent of labour mothers had been limited to the opportunities in the work area because of maternity.
The study points out that there are many differences in the start of conviction in a couple and the number of children, based on whether they work or not, and the type of work that they develop.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, work in part-time, or have an unstable job, start before conviting in a couple, leading to the first maternity, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, decline consumption and maternity, and have less descendants.
"Women between 35 and 49 years of age of fixed work have the first child, averagely 3,7 years after the starting of conviction, a number that increased to 4,1 women with fixed jobs has needed more time than their vital trayectory to achieve them, which has led them to put their children's unity and arrival.
Furthermore, the type of work exercises a lot of influence on maternity, even though less on the calendar of the employee," explains the researcher of the CSIC Margarita Delgado.
The level of studies is another of the factors that differ the age of women when we married and have the first valuation.
According to the survey, how large the educational level is, the age of which they are married and who have the first son.
The difference also remains among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group of between 35 and 49 years, the primary and higher studies have been mothers first at 25.1 and 32.1 respectively.
"Another division of women is also established on the basis of their level of study.
While elementary studies are married and have their first son before getting a stable job, the media or higher levels invert this sequence and give priority to obtain a stable work as a condition before marriage and arrival of a child," details Delgado.
Diane Krugler is also worth
Oreal Paris has finished summoning a new name to his enemy list of embassy: Diane Kruger.
From the next year, the German actress will become a image of different brand products, shooting the universal slight of 'for I value it'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux Christmas', one of the most elegant actors of the international panorama, is one of the other famous figures of the Oreal Paris, such as Linda Evangelist, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before it, the latest entering in such a selective club were the actors Evangeline Lilly ('Perdidos') and Freeda Pinto ('Slumdog Millennium').
In the male paragraph, the cosmetic mark also accounts with luxury embassy: Patrick Dempsey ('Anatomy of Grey') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline partner in 'Perdidos').
British Mode Prices
The Britishs have much to say in the mode world.
His highest representatives - designers and models, yesterday and today, were meeting in the annual delivery of their premiums in London, the Royal Court of Justice.
Nobody talked to the quote.
The former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, elected Best Model of the Year.
Manuel Vicent Poker
Manuel Vicent regrets in 'As Poker' (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) a tremendous writer radiographs that have passed through their literary life (and, in other cases, by the other).
It is not in the predictable and fearable genders (biographic, life and work), but looking for something like the novel of illusion of the creator's person.
The trip has its excitations and Vicent does not smell summers or illuminations.
Besides an exquisite enjoyment, the book is a comfortable invitation to read and recreation.
Here I leave you some instantaneous.
About Albert Camus: "In its pages I found that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual cleaning, almost physically, the same that I felt without giving him a name: the joy against the action, the moral without guilty and the innocence without any gods."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nhihilist, a joyful Christian, wrote what he had in the blood, not in the intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a delusive poetic humor, without sense, like the shelter of the cup that I was at the point of killing him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was injured by this woman with a patience that was thirty years old, in which flesh condemned adultery's emotion with the joy of resolving, a spiritual prize that consisted in reaching the heaven through the way of loss."
About James Joseph: "The 'Ulises' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It's one of the eight thousands of meters of universal literature, which must be scattered by the northern wall, from which the best alpinists are once again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a rare guy.
Similarly, sometime he said he was a heritage of a terrain and others that was a son of a black and a cocodrile.
Both dreams were great."

About Virginia Wolf: "The team also brought his depressions.

The case of such a patient and loving man has never been given a neurotic whose literary talent was before his crazy."
About Pio Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos but treat inocular to Cœdès in Baroja?

Cobard aggression
Last week, my mother of some 70 years of age passed through our barrier in the town of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years passed with her and our dogs, a mestious example of race, saved from dog and not more than six kilos of weight and, without medium-spot, propined him two patches that left the ill dog.
Our wrath is massive because we do not find the difference in a free aggression to a small and indefensive animal, which was indefensive.
To this, there is a need to add the sofoco that caused him to a woman who was quiet and that, when he inclined to these individuals, was afraid for their physical integrity, because an energy that attacks a animal is able to do it itself with a woman, a child, an elder, or, finally, with any weaker than he himself.
The event occurred at five of the morning's night for a traditionally quiet barrier.
The dog was crying all day.
Indeed, we made a complaint in a nearly committee, which we doubt that he served for a long time and not to generate subsequent ability, just clarifying that the murdered cobardes were Spanish.
Anger has caused us to declare this fact.
We do not understand that it is happening between youths to consider diverted to be distracted freely to an undefensive animal that gives us love, company and friendship.
We don't know where good education and respect for animals and people have been left.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the castle
Michelin's neumtic manufacturer, with the cooperation of the Spanish Foundation for Vial Security (Fesvial), has started a campaign to promote the use of the castle, mainly among the youngest engineers, today informed both entities.
This initiative seeks to acknowledge the importance of use of the castle, since it is the only protective element that can avoid illnesses in the head, or even death in the case of a accident while it is circled in a motorcycle.
Michelin indicated that this campaign was part of its commitment to the vial security, which "is more than designing and manufacturing more safely products every day" and stated that it also contributes to this target through other actions of pedagogical and informative nature.
This new box for the promotion of use in the motorcycle, under the 'Tobe or not to be', will be the first stage in which cards will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle talents, with the aim of reaching the maximum dissemination.
To finish, Michelin emphasized that vial security is a constant concern for the company, since being a neomatic manufacturer for two road vehicles, one of its main purposes is to develop more safeer products.
Under the sale of light commercials
About two years later, the market of low commercial vehicles began to see something light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9.425 units that were matriculared in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6 per cent in 2008, and, more importantly, the first increase after 22 months of decline, according to the numbers of Anfac manufacturers and Ganhab salers patrol.
The good date, not obvious, should be put it in quaren, since the reference to which comparison is made - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a decline of 60 per cent in respect of the previous year.
The result is that, despite the reputation of the last month, the matriculations accumulated in these 11 months are 40% below the previous year.
Since January 95.853 units have been sold all vehicles composing the chain of the light commercial chairs: turism derivatives, pick up, trucks, light cars and light cars/legal cars.
Nevertheless, the nubarons who have more affected their demand, as even if they are also acquired by particulars, most of the purchases are made by small and medium-sized companies, which pay almost 100 per cent of cases through external funding.
Thus, restrictions with the closed grip of bank credits must be made to other factors such as increase in the balance levels or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
In view of this panorama and different to tourists, the aid for the purchase of 2000E has been lowly served.
They can be accompanied, in addition to particulars, by autonomys and pymes that are going to purchase a light trade of up to 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometer, but the number of operations has been witnessed.
Last night, from Ganhab, they recalled the need for special attention by the administration to these vehicles and also to industrials (cames and buses).
The association of salers pronounced a 2010 similar to the year that ends, for which a fall in sales (tourism and 4x4) is estimated by 19%.
Aid to emergency driving is already binding
As has occurred with the ABS rail antiblock and will pass with ESP stability control, emergency help systems will be a binding element in European cars.
Indeed, it is already in all light commercial vehicles and new matriculation, while for the rest, a deficit period is fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measures imposed by the European Union are aimed to increase the protection of peatants, however, in their way of work, can also help to avoid many colitions in scope.
The assistant to the emergency fresh is to increase the pressure on the fresh in the case of an emergency, which the system detects by the driver's pool.
But this does not always keep that pressure until the end.
According to a study carried out by the manufacturer of bosch car components, the third part of the drivers involved in an accident had not arrived to shoot the fren before the colision and half of them did not use the whole force.
At least 1,100 accidents
Instead, the aid is required to the maximum shipping system by reducing the distance that uses the car to stop.
According to a EU study, if all the cars were equipped with this type of elements, death accidents could be avoided by year to 1,100 involving peatones.
The reduction will be even greater - it will be calculated that one of four lefts would be avoided with damages to people - when the named intellectual systems of emergency french are popularized.
In this case, the vehicle shall be equipped with a system that (with a radar or a camera) detects the obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to slightly acting on the fresh.
If the driver responds, helps you increase the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If you do not react, and although the colision is inevitable, the device exercises the maximum effort to minimize damage.
General motors up to January the plan for Opel
While the workers of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will be started in the first week of April - the 8 most likely day - reported by Javier Ortega, the US manufacturer warned that it will need more time to finish the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, the new President of Europe, is that each of the points of the plan has been previously condemned by the affected party.
This can make the definitive document that will be subjected to workers first and after the Governments of the countries where there are factories is turned to the beginning of 2010.
Instead, since GM, a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the next days.
This is not strange to the Swedish Government has increased the pressure on the US manufacturer to take a decision soon.
GM admits to have contact with some new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who could also try to purchase Volvo, but covers the option of the Dutch manufacturer of sports Skyper, which is supported by the Russian Convergen group.
If there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some assets from Saab to China Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold.
On the flight of Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop their last, and love joya, the Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as a basis and achieved that they was slowing nothing less than 80 kilos, which has left the bag in only 1 275 kilos.

Your behaviour can only be qualified by intakeable.
The weight reduction does not mean that the car does not put the asfalt with apple.
Moreover, it was the contrary: it was time that we did not test a small and light model that, once, I forwarded so much security on the curve step, even to high speeds.

What we ask you. Thanks to your address, as much communication as necessary, what we indicate with our hands on the flight is what the car will do.
And he will do it with a surgical precision.
Lieutenant Colonel Cribbs for you, sir.
The sound of your V6 booxer, with 320 horses (10 more than Boxster S) is very successful and can be strengthened by the 'sport' option and through a system that changes the motor bramide, which is already extraordinary in the Panamara.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, either from stop or in recovery.
The suspensions are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asfalt of the roads we crossed with the Boxster Spyder was quite punished, but the car drew the bags well.
Electronic aid only made an act of presence in the whole trayecto, and that's that in some curves we find glass in amazing and gravity, and that's already in the morning.
Finally, a ultralinker car, the most fun to drive that one can in the market and is something more than a simple change of Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010, with a price of 70.831 euros.

Basconia is a victory in Israel
The Labour Box reached a brilliant triunfo by 82-91 in his visit to the complex Maccabi Electra's Maccabi Electra cancer, although the numerous lows with which the Dusko Ivanovic team was, and thus it was located in the leadership of his group, after the great action of Mirza Teletovic, which was the best of his team (29 evaluation).
The victory team summarized the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov, with large doses of collective implication and work, although he had to suffer until the end to be triggered.
Furthermore, the big axle from the perimeter, with 16 well-known trials, had much to see in the final triunfo.
The party started from face to the blue, which took place from the start by front in the marker.
That the first four canastes of the victorians were from the perimeter had already shocked that they had shooted to the Israeli song with the warm munchs..
English and Teletovic were the main artists of 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second fourth was more than the same, but the alabous team opted by the internal game of Barac and the work of Eliyahu, which was received with pits and applauses in the return to his home, to continue extending its advantage to the relax (34-43).
Teletovic began to emphasize it as the best of your team with 13 points, although the 'minus six' evaluation of Splitter had already been imprisoning that it would not be the best night of Brazil.
But the party, despite being incarcerated in the rest, was not decided, nor much less, and the macabeers wanted to remember the victory that in his song wasn't winning any one, and 'the hand of Elia' opening up to the party.
Eidson and Pnini were decisively contributing to give the 'amarillos' back to the light (50-49).
More Inconvenients
The Ivanovic's, but not much less dead, needed to strike a couple of games with a sweet to cook air, and in those arrived the ametrallator of Mirza Teletovic, who had three almost consecutive triples and the help of English and Ribas returned the marker to a quiet income (54-67), which could maquillate locals at the end of the third fourth (57-67).
The alaves came to leave the skin in the last part and English and San Emetrio (60-75) already warned that they would not let anyone leave what had been done during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best ones of your team were not resigned and tried to keep their team from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter removed by failures, the Ivanovic people did not shoot, defend well, and although the Israelites approached at the final minute (80-85), the party had already slaughtered and the victory escaped from Tel Aviv for the first time.
Lesions impede to fight the Unicaia
The Unicaya was strictly lost in Greece before the Olympics and ced him the leader of the Euroliga Group, in a party marked by the low of the castists, especially in the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The malignant team was not assaulted by the environment of the Pabellion of Peace and friendship, and not by the rival entity, perhaps by the most powerful of Europe and with a great budget.
The game shown in the first fourth was allowed to dream the travellers. A aggressive and three consecutive triples, two of the Omar Cook base and one of Guillem Rubio, disrupted the 12-18, minutes 9.
The Olympics were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaya, although the snake of locals in the internal game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned back to the brander 22-20, minutes 13, at which a shooting action, between the two US bases Beverley and Williams, suffixed the disqualification of both players.
The Greek set started functioning by showing its superiority within both areas, where the low injury of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal faults of Carlos Jimenez, were overlooking the boxers.
Among the internal players and the Lithuania Aero Linas Kleizas, with their triples, increased the benefit 44-32, minutes 19.
An unable remount
The third period was very oppressive with the Olympics, which, despite the 19 losses, was higher, and even the difference of the meeting discussed in Málaga 66-48, minutes 27, which made the group leader.
The Unicaya tried to overcome the absences and the last low of the Skot Pivot, Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all inconvenience, the Unicaja for the direction and trials of Cook, and Lewis' contribution, was left something of hope 66-57, minutes 31.
But it was almost impossible because the Olympics were shocked and given their superiority in centimeters within the area was unfavourable.
The croata pivot Nikola Vujcic was able to restore the average basket 81-62, minutes 37, and the Unicaja was removed, delivering the leading to the Olympics.

Brazil posted to Zelaya's exit
The Brazilian Government has set it time to the remaining of Manuel Zelaya at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The department should leave the diplomatic license until 27 January 2010 when officially concluded its mandate.
Francisco Catunda, embassy embassy in the Honduras capital, confirmed the TV Globo that "Mel" knows that it must go before that date of the embassy, where she remains refugee since 21 September.
"He has conscious that he must be out on January 27, when completed his mandate, he has to find another destination."
The employee also quoted the former mandate, who confirmed his intention to get out of the embassy before the deadline set: "My position is going out as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Government of Brazil," Zelaya stated in the telephone way.
After the elections of November 29 (which was elected by Porfirio Lobo), Zelaya assured that she would remain in the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to find refugees in Brazil.
The operation was finally frustrated by rejecting Zelaya the condition of political asylum to put the Government "de facto" chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After wine and rose days from the spring past in which asset inflation has been the dominant tone in the markets, the incertainty returns to the markets, which should not be surprised since it is their natural status, in a environment where agents take decisions on the future for uncertain nature.
The medicine used by the central banks to stabilize the market was monetating debt with direct purchase of assets and indirectly gives free liquidity bar near zero types so that financial entities purchase assets to discount.
Central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchase of assets has practically completed and, without questioning its hypothetical liquidity policy, they start to earn some sand in the grain as the ECB has done with its asset in the next week.
As a result, investors doubt the capacity of the global economy to maintain economic recovery without so-called measures and we are assisting a reverse of risk prime reduction.
The volatilities of the Bolsas and the differences of the good corporates have returned, although they are still very distant from the paranormal levels reached at the beginning of the year.
States were obliged to socialize private risks and public debt is again affected.
There is again a flight to quality, and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the refugee chosen by investors, resulting in an expansion of the differences in the euro zone countries regarding Germany.
Spain had only been affected by this instability episode, but it came to Standard & Poor's, and he introduced a new review to the lowest calculation of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, something of incertidum is not bad to highlight the moral defenders who tried to re-establish awareness about the responsibilities of the global economic policy by having cut off the destructive effects resulting from the restriction of credit on employment destruction when what would have to do is decrease a new day of Thanksgiving.
Nevertheless, the Dubai's tribal struggle is a tribal struggle among emitteds to recompense the power in emits and Greece.
A government who hides public deficiency, elections and a new government that is cut off.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Duran Barroso.
It does not mean that Ecofin saved Hungary from the incompliance of its external payments at the beginning of the year, which will allow a Member State to comply with its commitments.
What is logical is that the Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and to comply with its citizens with the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we are expected, we were in front of a normalization episode of transitional risk primes, after some exemptions in locked positions, would be within the expected.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt are wide as the good European corporations should not be worried.
If European differences decreased and our continued expansion, it would be an Spanish idiosinclassic risk.
The Standard & Poor's is an anemous. When our advanced indicators are obliged to most studies services to anticipate their recovery scenarios for 2011, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which return to the load of a Japanese scenario for Spanish economy does not give much hope to their warning.
Once again, you have the painting that will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although at the time "prudance, friend of conductor".

The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene last night before the subcommission of the Congress of Members in which the Spain's energy strategy was discussed in the next two decades.
After his intervention, he followed the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press a few paintings of what had been drawn in the subcommission to the closed door.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest $50,000 to 2020 and other 60,000 million between the date and 2030, as long as the nuclear centrals are still open.
Not so, the necessary investments will be not of 60,000 million, but of 95,000 million.
Yes, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade, investment should not be intended to increase the capacity in generation, but in distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020, the issue will be changed and will have to increase power.
It is focused on gas plants and carbon with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energy.
In this case, they consider that they need 18.000 new MWs, that's it, with other "support energy".
Galán, who considers that the Sustainable Economy Act which has just been adopted by the Government is in line with what his company has been claiming, did not want to make blood with the real decree to encourage national carbon consumption, which opposes climate change policy.
In its opinion, there is "a clear long-term position" in this regard, despite the "puntal" measures, as he called the President of Iberdrola.
As a fire, Galán considers that investment decisions, although they are long-term, should be started to take soon and need a stable reward framework to address them.

Australian infrastructure market promises great works and privatizations, but it constitutes a clear income difficulty if it is not through the acquire of a local construction signature.
A strategy that has followed the quotes Hochifica or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which continues to be dependent for the Spanish giants of the sector.
Only ACS has achieved a position on that market through its participation of 30% in Hochific, the propitiate Leighton.

The subterranean shipway, promoted by the Brisbane infrastructure Office and called Northern Link (North-Line), is called to join the Western Toowong's autopista with the circulation route in Kelvin Grove (see map) over 5 km from tunnel. This is the largest action to reduce the constitution of Brisbane's traffic.
The calendar marked by the Administration sets the appeal for summer 2010 and the start of works in December of the next year.
Although this payment step would be opened for traffic in the last months of 2014, the work is not expected to be restored until 2016.

A lot of 63 million to France Télécom to driving the competition
The competitive regulator in France has taxed a amount of EUR 63 million in France Télécom for anti-competitive behaviors in the coal regions belonging to the country.

Gambling Champions has reported 476,4 million to Madrid and Barcea from its origin
The League of Campeones has become a source of income for clubs since she was born in 1992.
As far as Real Madrid and Barcelona have income 476,4 million since then, what makes them into the third and fifth club that more money have winned in competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Gain the EUFA Campeones League offers glory not only. It is also one of the main sources of income of the large clubs.
The competition has thus distributed 5.362.5 million euros to the 105-spain teams (12 of them) who have participated in the event since the tour was established in the 1992/1993 period, according to EUFA data.
The Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have been well stopped from this apartment.
The white club has been the third of the continent that has been more money to participate, and the only, together with the AC Milan, has won three times the trofee.
The catalan, the future campaign and the last winner of the extensive Copa of Europe in 1992, is the fifth of classification.
The list leads to the Manchester United and the Bayern of Munich, the two teams who, as well, had more money to participate in the past Campeon Liga.
And that's it, despite losing both faces to the Barza.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has achieved more money through Champions, although it has achieved more titles than any other (five, Italy, the three of England and the two of Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex payment procedure applied by the EUFA.
For this exercise, the body which is chaired by Michel Platini prescribes 1,090 million by the Champions League.
From this money, the EUFA will dedicate 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs who participated in the pre-classification round (including Madrid Atlantics) has received 2.1 million.
Furthermore, those who had been able to participate were 3.8 million only because they were there, in addition to 550,000 euros for each party that disputes.
There are also bonus to win (800,000 euros) and by empatar (400,000 for each team). The octavofinists will get three million each; eight four-finists, 3.3 million.
The last four million will be borrowed each one.
The campaign will win 9 million, in front of the 5,2 million of the finalist.
Thus, in the context of fixed payments, a club will be income at least 7,1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Barcellona was borrowed to win Europe's Supercopa in August.
But it is also the variable payments, which are intended for 337.8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
Spain is the main ones, and has four allocated places.
The sampling of the previous year is 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the room.
The other party shall be paid according to the number of parties played in the edition of this year.

New tools to break cars
In these days of temporary and accidents, not only win the car tanks.
Each day, thousands of cars that have suffered a empty are removed to a tanner, where a expert must evaluate the damages suffered and what will be the reparatory cost.
No left is equal, and the calculation of the piece costs and the time of work may be a long and complicated work.
Calculate manually the cost of reparation of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including pieces of work, can take two or three hours.
Instead, with the support of the recent computer instruments, the question would be

As a new car goes to the market, these companies turn to work.
It's a very sweet work, because each of the thousands of pieces of the vehicle must be catalogued and introduce its price.
In addition, each model is performed a graphic "intelignant" image where different parts of tourism can be "pinked".
If it is a venture model, the work can be ready in one week if the process is very fast.

In 2005, the Solera Group was $1,000 million in Bolsa, and its actions are now covered by a total of $2.400 million.
Since 2007 it is quoted in the New York Bolsa and is included in the Standard & Poor's reference index.
Only understood by accidental cars
Last October the Solera group purchased Autoonline, a internet platform for sales of cars such as swimming motes or special vehicles.
The operation summarized by 59.5 million euros by 85% of the capital of society, which could be extended to 15% the remaining year.
The objective of purchase was to provide more value services to its customers, with the possibility of access to a large international market.
This evaluation and purchase service is only directed to professionals in the sector, such as assurance companies, experts, retail companies, loans, discounts and professional sales that must be registered before starting operations.
This platform was created in Germany in 1996 and has been managed by more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Among its main markets highlight Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The web is currently counted with more than 1.500 registered salers and 4.000 experts.
3.000 daily advertisements are managed and on the Spanish market are included some 100 new ads every day.
According to the Spanish law, a car whose number of bathrooms has been given lowly can not be moved back, but can be used as some pieces that are not damaged.
The cars with historic value can be given higher even though they have been low after low management.
Budget to pay in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company ensures that the user obtains a budget in only four steps: identify the vehicle, search for the rechange, create budget and generate budget.
The use facility is an essential conditioning for these systems, especially to convince age professionals, which are often more or less reactions to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1.034 vehicles, 666 tourists, 109 all-term motors, 137 motors, 78 cars and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it, you need a computer with Internet connection.
Once the model is identified by its switch number, a real graphic image of the model concerned appears and then the necessary change is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of the work hand, loans or discounts, and then print the budget to deliver the customer.
AudaTaller is not an evaluation tool such as AudaPlus, but better a reference catalogue.
The main difference between both systems is that the payer orientated does not include estimated time of work.
The use cost of this instrument for the loan is EUR 350 per year, which the customer can finance.
The Audatex company currently works so that these images are three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with very good eyes, because it will allow, for example, to select a door and give it back to see the inside face.
