Norwegian Rafisk: Is this the most funny fish of the world?
Norwegians raises the level of five million people's highest standards of life, not only in Europe, but in the world.
Can the secret of the country's success be connected to local workers with some slow fishing?
Take the last time the sweeper choice.
Put these in the midst of a smooth futbol.
Let me leave a week.
Now, one of the big Norwegian sweet smells has a smell of smell.
I'm in the small Fagernes city, about three hours away from Oslo.
There's a slightly sweet, and that smell is always in the air.
Rakfisk is cut down and water - depending on how funny fish you love - it is forecast until one year.
When it is dark and cold, the Norwegians will be assembled here for this most magnificent cemetery.
"Havard Halvarsen" says, "You're a bloom, and then you'll smell a bar, a bar."
People around us eat small fish cups and smell in a lot of drunk.
Havard says, "Those people love aquavit more than Rafisk."
He can kill the smell.
I'm thinking some parts.
If you can escape from swimming under your shock, it's not bad – it's not a little long bus swimming language after.
Rakfisk Norwegian is a very different product of water and slow-scale times in the beaches that fishes are not in the sun of the morning.
Then when it is firm in the depths of the rain, it will be cut out, and – with an untruthful alcohol, it is new.
Only thousands of Norwegians were difficult to get away from countries, mostly flee to the United States.
Now it grows speed by the people -- more than 13 jobs, high-paids, and immigrants from a powerful view system.
Ancient and very long-term people are in the work of Swedish, a more richer than Norwegian.
Rakfisk represents something important, but if Norwegia's past is a little funny, it's a part of life.
Between the most precious food you can eat.
But everything's precious -- you're going to give a small barb or a sandwich £9 ($14).
Norwegia is often not coming to the world news -- and most people like that.
We are requested to talk about the healthy racial name Anders Brevik, who killed men, women and children in the past 77 years.
Instead, it's called "the event of 22 July."
The Norwegians are difficult to believe that in peace countries they can make such an innocence and murder.
Norwegia has now increased one of the largest oil and gas industry from the beginning of 1970s.
Our garson says, "But we are not the only reason why we're so good to be so good."
We are a great people, as you say.
English, most people here are perfect.
We're not too exhibitors, we don't like the slaughter.
In addition to a small percentage of the money from the industry, Norwegian oil is very carefully directed — all of them are a special background for the benefit of the future items.
In the years of the world's global crisis, others slowly swallowed the shoes of the Norwegian shoes.
"We're happy as long as we can shut the light and write the mountain walk," says Anna.
"And raphisk eat," he swears with a peaceful sweet.
I'm standing in the cart, and I'm waiting for something to eat - I'm going to eat enough.
Now, a hamburger is certainly something different and a more awesome.
But the night's more than that sweet fish.
One of the county mechanisms that arrange the Rafish night's dinner, here are the best ladies -- and maybe the most hardest of this is -- they're playing the fish.
There's a living TV connection on a server with the Rakfisk tables.
It's like an Eurovision song.
How many points do you have for the best fish in the mountains?
"We're here, Havard."
The shops, they've got cakes.
A man slows from the sandalists, maybe in the effect of aquavit.
Or maybe you're smiling all these fishes.
The Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto faces the start of difficulty
When the new President of Mexico is ready to pass the Enrique Pena Nieto office, he looks at the difficulties that Will Grant faced with the BBC, and the people's smuggling expectations.
It's particularly bad for Mexico's traffic now.
In the best times of a cities, a variety of major routes from Tuesday has been caused by a variety of people in the streets of caos.
But the purpose is not preventing people to go to work, but preventing protesters to reach the meclis.
On Saturday, the new President of Mexico will take the President of the President of Enrique Pena Nieto and take the task of the national governance.
He's against a bad mission.
In the government of Felipe Calderon, he had a good manner from Mexico's economic opening, but in the control of a drug war which was slaughtered for 60,000 years in the country.
Mr. Pena Nono said this week, the Oval Office of the United States President Barack Obama, "A great word to the Mexican people to reduce the violence."
This is why I'll offer a new security strategy that makes it possible.
Before Mr. Pena Nono's previous political trial was held in the Mexican area before he was deputy with the US President.
The majority of the surrounding groups, growing in this area, the new leadership has been divided.
He's a clear man.
For example, the red Valle del Bravo recalls lovely in the town of Bravo.
Here, those living, they're noting that he lived in the place of his home and that he created my tube.
You can go from the new cars of Mr. Pena Nono's, a great development on a changed strike and all-scale ways.
The plates that move their name are also out of the modern sport center and the influence of the climate change.
"We look at him to bring real and continuous changes," says Mr. Pena Nono's friend and political advisor Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, the local Congress of the PRI party.
In particular, we hope a very interesting and real change from our country from security and economy.
After 81 years of decline, Vicente Fox was deleted in PRI 2000.
The Congress member Olvera admits that it was very waiting for Enrique Pena Nieto for 12 years outside the Chamber of Los Pinos.
And the war rejected the new president of his own personality.
A clear man calls himself with a wonderful country vision.
It's a wonderful state man and a man who knows listening to all.
But this is not the idea that many people have about the former elections.
The city was known as Nezahualcoyotl, who was known as Nezahualcoyotl, couldn't be more focused on the park streets of Valle del Bravo.
A banking area of Mexico City on the top of their cars.
And the problems in the pool are hard and urban.
This year, armies were called to help combat drugs in the parks, and more violently against women.
In the two years we've been killed in a large shooting area, the body of women was slaughtered.
During his judge, Mr. Pena Nono was killed more than 1,000 women in Mexico, and it was more than the city of the city of Juarez, who is known with the murders of the popular women.
He says that women couldn't run sufficiently when they were in the best position of Mr. Pena Nieto.
In the worst way, they are accused of coming from seeing his rule.
In a typical beton house in the coast, Irina Buendia's mother's photos of Mariana Luna is trying to fight with the age of age.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana murdered in 2010.
But he believes his family was killed by a partner.
"When I went home, it was like the body was burned." Senora Buendia.
There was a look that showed that he was struggled, and the death's smuggling began from a long time.
Once his mother tells his story again, she looks down from a picture wall of Mariana, with a word on a word, just.
But that's what he said that this family was completely disfellowshipped.
The local authorities treated me as an old diplomat, a problem, a slaughter.
What they want is that they simply accept and shut their rows.
"But it's not true when there's so strict and illness."
The President of the Pena Ono Saturday comes with the responsibilities of the bird.
For ten thousands of families we passed in six years, he had influenced violent crimes in Mexico and promised to give them a priority during the new President's mission.
The Prime Congress member Olvera says, "It's a President, as I hope. "
But this is the most fearful families of the victims in Neza in the city.
They claimed that Bradley Manning wasn't condemned to deal with bad behavior.
The defenders are trying to turn against the ideas of using Bradley Manning's bad use.
Warning, Manning's staying in the military prison in Virginia.
The Defense Manning wants to close the case with the need to be incarcerated.
There are thousands of secret documents in the army.
On Sunday, the Defenders decided that the army of Bradley Manning, who was accused of the biggest secret material attacks in the United States history, was struggled to condemn some of the ill-treatment claims that he lived in the army.
Ft. Meade Maryland's talk, in the case of Master Ashden Fein Manning, showed that, while the officers remained in Quantico, Virginia, and the weekly visits weren't showing an interview about the bad behavior of their visits.
A day later, when he expressed the murder of Manning's case with the need that he was slaughtered in Celesea and so much punished.
The army arrested in Haziran in 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents when they do a mission in Iraq.
The material was later published by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning's source of information.
In the afternoon, Fein studied the forms of the officers who were filled with Maning after the meeting with Manning since June 2010 to Nisan 2011.
The officers reported the questions to Maning and reported the answers.
When he asked about the forms on the Fein Summit, he reported that the acts made by the Manning gardens were "master" and that all the actions of the test were "so much professional."
The forms don't show a skilled behavior, but the officers ask for the maning's conduct right, Fein.
Manning gave the answer to the questions that they did not store.
Manning said: "If you do not mean that you do not bring anything to you."
He asked why, during the October 2011 meeting, the judge Denise Lind de Manning asked why he was not infringed to investigate the ideas of murdering in the last month.
He answered that the terms of the Manning Meeting were "the prevention of the shift" were discarded.
The army told him to protect himself and others, that the murdering overseer had put him into a sixth stage of a slow state.
"I wanted something to know what I was, and I wanted to get out of the state of the POI... to remove a quality of life from my eyes."
Manning Pershore was arrested in Iraq and was expressed to Kuveyt, about the transfer of about two months before he was transferred to the Marine Base Quantico prison in Virginia in June 2010.
He said he was thinking of the murderer at the Kuviert and heavyly liked there once.
He said he was stressed that he would not let him know what he was in the outside world.
"My dog was buried to Camp Arafjon," said Manning Pershore.
I thought I would die in that coffee.
Manning said, when he went to Quantico, most of the days, at least 21 hours and more than 23 hours, passed in a small cell alone.
Manning said only a bed, a bathroom, a leg, a little clothes and the eyes were given.
He said he was slaughtering in the day, and he was slaughtered in the rules.
Manning always said that he was sleeping out of the cell.
When the guards returned to the night, he said he hadn't seen her face and said he had returned.
The lawyer of Manning was officially entitled to the acts made to Manning in October 2011.
Manning Nisan, 2011, moved to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas military prison.
At the same time, he asked the judge Manning on the Sunday of Persians about a idea that it was difficult to sleep in the Quantico cell at a night, a number of guards and other prisoners were difficult to stop shooting in a morning.
At my number, Manning expressed that he wasn't given the opportunity to strike with the slaughter.
On the next day, the judge told him that he had to take a manning garden's order to take him out of the order, but no one would have ordered to shoot him.
Manning Pershore expressed that it was difficult to sleep on the last night with the encouragement to show that it was not a danger for her.
Manning said he wouldn't hurt himself by using the smuggling lastillas or legs.
Manning declared that the drinking snake, the fingers, and their eyes were taken from the cell.
The lawyers hope that at least the case of the lawyer will decrease the tests of prison and that the military court expected to be executed at the beginning of the next year would be decreased.
He said that the Defense Manning plans to accept the crime in smaller crimes and to fight against a lot of painful crimes.
The holding was planned to continue at the end of this week, and the defenders are waiting to discuss the issue that the situation is guaranteed.
Pentagon Manning indicated that all the maximum rules in Quantico were properly undertaken for the courts.
Those who are opposed to Manning, helping the enemy, publishing the public in a wrong way on the Internet, communicating national defence information, and defect of your records.
If it's the government of all the possessions, it's possible to face an incarceration.
Mexico's identification crisis
Many people say it's difficult to get away from Mexico because of the weakness of the opportunity here.
The Mexicans are on the shift, they remember the difficult times to the Mexicans,
Navarrette says the Mexican Americans are shocking between two worlds.
I was in the area of migration in a nearby street that I did to Mexico City, and I came back to the surprise.
The workshops shown two points: one for the Mexicans, the other for "Extranjeros" for the Germans.
I stopped there for a few seconds, I didn't know where I'm going.
Because I was grown in the centre of California, I was called "Mexicain" throughout my life.
In this ethnic stage, my friends in Boston say they're "Irlands" or my friends in New York say they're "Itlanian".
Then I decided in Mexico.
But it was Mexico.
And my grandfather did not need a stenoa or a stereo.
I was so American.
I'm talking in Spanish, so I'm good to control both sides of a meeting in this language.
But I don't have local words, and I can't be able to save from my American mind.
That's why I got my US passport, and I passed for Extranjeros.
I remembered the president of Mexico this week when I visited the White House to meet Enrique Pena Nono President Obama.
Like two leaders in the day, they have always met: sky, drugs and trade.
Pena Nono and Mexico were encouraging to speak about the growth of Mexico's economics, which is the cause of remaining in Mexico as soon as they were trying to enter the United States now.
The United States and Canada wants to become a partner and to create a trade flower in North America in the way of the European Union.
Pena Nono suggests something specific, but he promised that the Mexican drug cards would continue to fight.
The United States are insufficient and inconsistent.
Most Americans probably did not think that in 1848, the United States did not work in Mexico and their leaders had difficulty to give half of the lands with a delicate difficulty.
But not in minutes, but in some centuries, the Mexicans are all the place.
That's why you're starting to hear the expertise of the American neighbourhood of the United States in Mexico press and elites.
And Montezum's kids go to the war.
And yet, it is more than 35 million mexican Americans who live in the United States that are really difficult for Mexico.
Do you want to talk about the emotions that are insufficient?
There's a lot.
The winners and losses in Mexico have people who have created a country's chance and not created.
The only reason for living in the towns like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that a person in a smooth point, maybe a house or a large house, must be left out of the possibility in Mexico.
And mostly this person sleeps a profile -- ten, less educational, a bad village.
We are their seeds, and We believe them.
It's not Mexico.
And if we live in the American Rule now, we're never going to see what we lived in the good schools and what we've lived as good works, not Mexico.
Our identity may sometimes be undefined, but our loyalty is clear.
It's the United States.
We also realize that most of the Mexican rulers are not loved by us.
This feeling is coherent.
They're seeing us as a reminder of a sweet innovation, and they're looking up to us like we've been a high group not enough in Mexico.
Our Spanishs will never be enough enough, we're not too strong with Mexico.
Our existence is about the complete success in their eyes.
Our family wouldn't have gone if it couldn't work in Mexico.
And now we didn't find ourselves up behind the loss, but we could live good in the United States but yet lost spirits.
When they came to the United States as a legal marriage in Guadalajara, they remembered that they were more common to me who were the Mexicans, and that the Mexican Americans have drinked this because they did not agree between the Mexican and the Mexican Americans.
Despite being an US citizen, he seems to be a part of two countries.
At the same time, most of the Mexican Americans don't feel like the part of them.
We love the Mexican group Los Tigres del Nord and Bruce Springsteen.
You're taking the best ones of the two worlds, but you're not a wreck.
We look like American in Mexico.
We are accepted as Mexico in the United States.
Now, as I learned at the road, some mexican leaders and some of your events want to connect to Diaspora.
They want mexican Americans to show their interest in the United States as a temporary Mexican "actors".
We're hard to say that it's a beautiful country to visit Americans like us, and the political leaders are to strengthen the links with Mexico.
Yeah.
That won't be.
There's too many feelings of emotion.
And most of us are not sure that there is a wonderful country with equality and respect for drug violence and drug violence.
I'm afraid you're alone.
It's just.
At least some Mexican people have not yet been ready to forgive the United States for the behaviour of Mexico for a half-century century ago, then some Mexican Americans have to be acknowledged that they still have been able to maintain the conduct of the family members soon.
Hmm.
Maybe we're a Mexican than I think.
Ancient wars, New Middle East
It may be an unfair basis for the fireful peace between Israel and Hamas.
Can a permanent peace between the Arabs and the Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodcake shows that such hopes are empty.
Among the huge debates of whom it was started, many buildings turned into a chain, more than 140 Philistines and six Israelites to be civilians, and the first time of Gaze, the great city of Israel, Tel Aviv, and the city of St.
However, though the Israelites and the Philistines seemed to have been struggled in ancient battles, they change the Middle East around them.
The Arab garden was cut into the air, and it was arrested by the Philippines and the Israelites.
Maybe this makes their fight more blood than the older.
But there are reasons for thinking that they can't get out of their killer.
Whatever the win is a lost war
It seems it's hard to get it right now.
Even if the fires accepted on November 21 continued, the two sides of the week were forced by the war.
Since 2007, the Islamic movement leaders of Gaze will claim to have been able to retrace the Israelites, despite Gaze's overwhelming.
Although Gaze killed some of the leaders, it couldn't be possible to destroy Israel Hamas.
Of course, the other part of Hamas' Philistines's larger groups in Fatah now wins the more medieval Philippines in Western Sheriff.
Moreover, Hamas's leaders can put out the results of the time.
And when the Islami wins the world in the Arabs, Hamas was strong and rich.
This is the purpose of Turk's resurrected regional power of the most closest Muslim history of Israel, Katar, one of the most rich and most dynamic areas of the cities of the Côte d'Israel.
The joyful Hamas people, a Islamic conspiration around Israel, says that Hezbullah's army party runs to the north of Lebnan, the Islamic slaughter, who was able to send the Fifth Esad to Syria, and that Hamas had threatened the king of the kings.
Besides all, between the Arab countries in the south-east of Israel, the most important and Egyptian countries, the President of Muhammad Musi, changed the lowest level of the region of the Muslim brothers.
In 2011, there was too little time to Hamas, the Mubilik Ombudsman, to direct Egypt for 30 years until the fall of 2011.
Instead, there's a lot more about the cousin and leaders of the Brother Hamas.
In the future diplomacy, Hamas, Israel and America can be defined as an actor that could not be prevented.
At that time, Israel's officers will make the total outcomes.
The soldier was put back to the Hamas box.
Israel's Demir Kubbe proved the value of the anti-fuzzing system, and most of Hamas's smuggles were destroyed.
The Israelites will sleep for a while.
Diplomatically, as far as the United States did, most European countries accused Hamas of starting their last violence.
Besides all, Israel, especially the headquarters of Binyamin Netanyahu, who has not seen the peace process.
Although the rocks from Gazze since 2004 killed Israel from the Israelites, Israel was decreased by the murderers of the Western Sheriff, which continued to extend the Jewish locations that protect the Philippines.
At the Likud party on October 22, Mr. Netanyahu, who joined Abigdor loverman with the more war group.
Why are those liar Philistines being shocked by giving their own states?
If they really control the Western Sheriff, they're not gonna shoot rocks like they did in Gazze?
It is better to keep them behind the wall, and to punish them when we cut their heads.
Maybe the guards win, but they can change the Arab garden accounts.
If Islams win in Egypt and other places are very less loved by Israel, the priorities of the houses are to fight.
Israel's defence race is greater than the assembly of the Arab neighbors.
The starting war with local super power does not help the new Arab governments to improve the economy.
Mr. Murse worked together with Barack Obama to make a good look at Mr. Murse, and maybe they could start something.
The Israelites have to look for a long time.
When the Arab world remains more democratic, the Philippines's detriment rights are a bus in Tel Aviv this week, as an unexpected shooting bus in the regions of Israel under work.
The pressure in the Jewish government is already broken into democracy, and the Arab population grows democracy.
Every few years, the blood missions against Gazze will be reached in a diplomatic bed.
There's a call on the outside on the two sides.
The answers remain the majority of the outside world and those who are in this newspaper: two governments represented the area for security.
In short, you're gonna give some more pressure to foreigners that are difficult.
Now, the Jewish state that has to begin to stop the weapons of Gazze, both Egypt, Turkey and Katar, and Hamas, in 1967, is better convinced that the idea of the land changes and accepting the land with the Mediterranean forces.
Foreign Arabs should be hard to join Hamas and Fatah.
It's more useful to get the orthodox states close to the BM for the creation of a Filistin State.
Mr. Obama plays a role to bring Israel to the table.
At the first time, he wondered to offer his peace plan.
It looks like she wants to get into the White House.
This pain doesn't look like it's a good way.
There's life-free exit in a Middle East America.
This means a peace agreement between Israel and the Philistines.
Cigarette packing laws are in Australia.
Tuberculosis warnings and sick organs are placed in salt green boxes for all roofmarks
Australia's first laws on smoking and smoking in the world have entered into the shuttle, marking logos and colors, generally green swallowing, producing images and sigarettes of sick organs, and children who have been sick.
Different health warnings and displays are the only difference between the packages that is difficult from Saturday's day with the same small letter type.
It's the biggest place for the packing of smoking in this world.
Australia's federal government says that youths are shocking to smoke from the swimming shock.
This is based on research that shows that people are never starting to smoking up to 26 years of age 99%.
"You can see that even when you're very small, you can see that the children are trying to sell the smokes on the markets," for example, the child's works showing that it's a very small age that it's inclined to be the federal health observer, Tanya Plibersek.
Although Australia has the lowest rate of smoking in the world and changes will have a very less effect on the women of many nations, other countries think that they are similar to steps.
They made a hard lob against the laws of the twin industry.
He said that the firms would support the chest trade, and that they would be more clean and more accessible to smoke.
From British American Tobacco Australia, Scott McIntyre said, "It will be the results that are not seriously prevented".
The Chinese and Endonesia will bring more of these products to sell in Australia streets.
Others say that the laws are increased.
A small family company, Zico Import Pty Ltd, has led two months ago the silicon swords, to mask packs from Sandra Ha from Sandra Ha, and the British American Tobacco, the Imperial Tobacco in England, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco Australia, almost slowly lost the laws in the high court.
Zico says he's making more than 6,000 sales and waiting for a new stok.
That's a good job for us.
Foreigners say they are the popularity of social media in the demographic design of potential struggling.
A decade of Australian blood was banned television advertisements and sport sponsors, and the majority of soldiers wanted to hide cigarettes from places.
Australia has banned local companies and website advertising, but it couldn't be able to slow the sea sites.
Becky Freeman, the researcher of a people's health research at Sydney University, said, "If you have left this small window only to identify your products, you're the circle where you need to participate in. "
Freeman's brands indicated that they increased social media on sites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
Is this a civil citizen who really loved Marlboro's cigarettes in the shock of taking videos, or has a marketing company in this?
The British American Tobacco Australian industry said that it was inclined to get out of new rules without marketing.
Indeed, the industrialists in Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Defense had been able to pay for new rules to the Ukrainian industry, which claims that no country in the World Ticaret Organization has been injured in an unjust way, despite the importance of trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is likely to get out in the midst of 2013.
So, the government said he didn't meet other countries who think that they would like to pack it.
The first country in 2001 was Canada, which makes photo warnings difficult.
Now these have been cut into Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine for more than 40 countries.
In England, New Zealand, South Africa and India, there are more laws.
The majority of the people in Australia read from the smoke.
Images don't affect me.
I'm coming to see them.
When he buys a package with all his legs, Victor El Hage said, "Please and put it in place," he said.
If you have to be honest, there's only one reason to leave, that's my little girl.
Sydney said that James Yu's only type of packaging was hard to shoot the ships in the center of Sydney.
Yu said, "I've taken my delivery a hour from the time, now takes four hours."
"I should have been lawful for all things, then, okay, well, we've been finished, we're gonna shut it down," he said, "and we've got the hands out of the air.
It's so bad to be shocked in a world that is always fascinated
When our aircraft lived mechanical difficulties in this Thanksgiving Holiday, I wasn't waiting for five hours when we stayed waiting for another flight.
So I've been so much time to think about it.
I won't lie to you.
Even if we wait for a half-day flights, books, magazines and iPhones are very intensive (I don't even talk about the commercial sales).
But some of those who are not academic, and children's development experts are slow.
They say it's normal for us and our children.
The brain is hard to go to interesting tanks, and maybe it increases creativeness.
And most of us have to imagine the values of the disappointment because we're depending on another screen.
So we need to open warm open to the smell?
Yeah.
And no.
But I'm going back to it.
First, I was thinking that I was a new shock because there was more time like many people.
In Canada, Peter Toohey, who wrote a Greek and Roman history professor at Calgary University, is not likely.
"Indeed, there's a very long history of the slaughter."
There's a Latin wall writing from the first century of Pompeii's walls.
The question is how you're determined to smell.
The problem is that it was identified in many different ways and that it was discussed by Ontario, John D. Eastwood, who is a psicologist at the University of New York in Canada.
After he looked at the research literature and put about 100 individual groups before the idea, Profesor Eastwood and its associators were identified as "not to be incompatible with grateful activity".
He said, "The thing that divides from the poorness is that the person wouldn't be engaged."
He said there's no way to do anything in the midst.
He said, "It's an interesting process with the feeling of slow-mode and time slow."
It's like depression.
But Professor Eastwood, which may be, but often people see the problem in the environment or in the world, said people in depression are seeing the problems of themselves.
Sometimes, we think we're disappointed when we're just a concentration.
Profesor Eastwood and the fellow workers, published in Psychologic Science Reviews on September, marked an old test of a person reading a magazine of a person in the work of the participants.
Some groups heard a high-level and non-related television program in the room, and others heard that it was very low, but the third group had never heard it.
Those who heard the low-level television reported more harder than two other groups, they had had difficulties without concentration, but they did not know why it was reasonable, and they had related to the difficulties.
One of the writers of the work and one of the nervouss at the Guelph University in Ontario, Mark J. Fenske, who tries to take up a hard or intriguing task, said, "It is why it's difficult to defeat the interest.
When you read something hard from the other side, "It can help you not cut your attention from the band of the manufacture.
Indeed, it is possible to enable people to be more physically struggle with this by struggling to be a sign of distress.
"There's showing that the children who have allowed to be moved have learned more than the children who have been able to move, and have more information on them," said Professor Fenske.
We all imagine the difficulty in some points, the late flight, the monotone, a slight movie.
But some people are in a more depressive way than others.
For researchers, in 1980, developing a "Durch Exploration" range.
It's like, "The majority of the things I have to do, and the monoton, and I have a lot of interest in, I don't have to do anything."
Stephen Vodanovich, professor at the University of West Florida, found that the researchers were more slower towards the needs of more and more externity, especially for the girls.
However, generally, there is a very poor group in the age of adolescents.
In 1991, Professor Reed Larson of Human and Social Development at Illinois University tried to communicate about 400 boys and children through the computer through seven eight times a day.
32 percent of men found that they were slow in schools and payments, but 23 percent were not in school.
On the other hand, they told the grandparents that 3 percent of them were cut off.
Professor Larson said that 21 years later, he didn't know that the percentage of disruptions would be lower or lower.
But he said he knew that he wasn't controlled about what they wanted to do.
So I'm back to my first question, is it good for people to be disappointed?
Sometimes no, because investigations are decreasing in a way of declining humans in the physical risks of hair playing, or use in materials.
On the other hand, Professor Vodanovich, who works more than two decades, discusses the connection between philosophs and writers and creators.
Gary Marcus, a psicological professor in the United States, said, "It's the way to tell you that your brain should do something else."
But the brain doesn't know what's going on.
If you're disappointed, and if you're using this energy to steal and eat, it'll be happy.
But if you look at the television, this can be happy in a short-term, but it's not in a long way.
So if you give him an iPad when your kid was shocked, it couldn't be slow, but you can't learn to enjoy or arrange yourself, Prof. Fenske said.
And he said, "This will be transferred to the other.
Your child doesn't learn to enjoy himself alone, but it controls himself more in other areas.
I don't think we really want to be happy.
We shouldn't have been too busy.
Instead, our purpose should be constantly disappointed from stealing the cycle of activity and technologies.
Professor Eastwood's murdered.
"We need to be more depressed, but we want to be connected to an uncomfortable thing," he said.
He said, "It is a way that people have been looking for, and that they may take away the sight of the slow time."
And he said, "If we have been shutting in a silence, it is difficult to find the ways of being endured."
No Senaryo for the New Marihuana Act in Colorado
Anthony Orozco, 19th, opposed to an university of a region in Colorado, a local student and a football player in the nearest area, with a accusation for a number of marihuanas and a snake to drink it.
One day in September, Mr. Orozco said he and his friends were stopped at Lamar, near the Kansas border.
After the police's officer found marihuana in the car, Mr. Orozco took a call for the $100 small crimes, the transportation and the drug tool and was given to the court's history.
"We were treated as a criminal," said Mr. Orozco.
But is that one?
In the uncertain weeks, the question of Colorado's pleasurable use is depending on the question of hundreds of small drug cases in the case of the small number of marihuans.
For centuries of criminal marihuana cases are closed in Washington, who accepted a similar congress.
Police units were 21-year-old and adults in the past weeks, the laws were able to be sentenced to move a small amount to be accepted as legally.
However, in Colorado, the defenders pleaded to carry out the cases of marihuana, and still calls for a court for the reason to move people.
At the same time, a number of new cities from Denver banks have been used to prevent the opening of marihuana’s license in the regions of the West Gulf.
The police chief Daniel J. Oates said, "I don't know what's going on after this."
The editors in Washington are cut off their heads.
And they're looking for the last manufacture, imagination, distribution, and license systems of license to sell.
It's like, or first, that's what the Colorado uses, now, most of them say that it's before the dignity of marihuana in my purpose.
Brian E. Smith, Washington Dictionary of Control at Washington, said, "They have a more regular price, so they will be a better guide."
But Mr. Smith continued to make more than suggesting what's going on.
And he said, "We will not have a real example."
Washington's law, named I-502, will enter into the history of 6th and will leave a year of uncertainty to move.
There are difficult mechanical questions that should be solved in this time, as the license of schools, feet parks, children's parks, or children's care centres in the 1,000 feet feet board, with the licensed marihuana directive "eternal access".
The new research group, Ben Livingston, said, "It could not be more difficult than city areas, especially Seattle's large cities. "
On November 21, a letter sent by a lawyer of 21-year of the city in the head of Oates in Aurora, who would not open up the courts of the small marihuana cases, and the police would stop the crimes of the police.
He said that the head of the Oates police would set up the cities laws and follow the drug trade and salesers again.
Ken Buck's headquarters in the northern Colorado area, represents a larger view.
After playing, the office said that it would continue to follow the cases to move to marihuana as a way to difficulty with most users.
Now, when 119 persons are accused of transporting us or less marihuana, many against other crimes.
Mr. Buck said in one statement, "The case of crimes in the time of our office is difficult."
Even in places like the Red Mesa Area, who rejected the marijuana.
The biggest city in Grand Junction is no longer a case for adults.
Pete Penzinger, the head of the district, supported this decision, but decided not to close the cases that were expected at the same time.
"I don't think I'm going to cut my time out until I continue to apply the blood until you change."
If 55% of those players in Colorado supported each other, it would never be easy to rule the aimed marijuana and bring it into the legal system.
And there is a depth between local authorities on large green trials in the area.
Marihuana's laws representing the Advocate and Marihuana laws, Sean McAlister, the local words of the National Organization of Reforming, are "a cultural barrier".
He said, "They have passed a lot of things in cases of people, so they do not yet accept that it is legal."
As the first areas of marihuana to marihuana are prepared to be national test cases for the legalization of the drugs in Colorado and Washington.
While law enforcement plans for law enforcement, law enforcement and law enforcement are expected to direct the federal government from the government that plans to draw close to marihuana and its production as federal crimes.
The lawful marihuana lawyers hoped that the Department of Justice is retraced.
The federal government, Colorado, Washington and the other 16 sections, allowed most of the high profile arrests of twin marihuana diseases and soldiers.
In the Obama government, the former drug policy investigator Kevin A. Sabet said that drug agents must probably be able to shoot the doors to a small drug torch, but it is likely to prevent their dealing with the new laws of marihuana.
It doesn't expect some federal authorities to move in Colorado.
Even before the election of the day, some local governments accepted the debt of new marihuana banks for a year before they could open up.
Last week, Montrose city in West brought a six-month law, and it's likely to be accepted in the next week.
He said, "We don't want to be licensed for a large federal problem," he said, "We don't want to be brought to us.
We've used a play against the changes of our region.
We're looking at the area that it's in the face of the departure.
There's a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: I was defeated from Oxford
It's just that the students today aren't attacked because of their views.
I can't remember when I didn't imagine to win a place at Oxford University.
In my mind, my father and my large brother had found two pillars of freedom and tolerance in the Greek seed, modern wine, which is the best place of the world.
But I gathered my pieces in two weeks in the Worcester College to read the story at the end of the sequence, and I started the first scenario of my life.
My dad was smiling and smiling.
The friends returned to the wonder.
Evening Standard Day at my room, my license friends' license, said I'm out of my way.
The writer A N. Wilson heard that I was left because I was struggling to drink from a deceased finger.
The reality was less funny.
I'm gone.
Yeah, I run, because I was against systematic sackness and fear.
It's not because I come from a little strange name or from a private school.
Only one reason I was judged, and in five of this word, this was back and barbaric: my father, Merhum Woodrow Wyatt, Margaret Thatcher's high profile discussion and I supported the guards.
You can ask why I opened this.
According to the last reports, the new target centre students are taking from the same judges.
In Oxford, he was struggled against defence students, and hate so much last week, that a group of equals, inflicted people and ethnic minorities requested the same rights.
Corpus Christi College's third inter-classroom (JCR) members were defended by political views "they have been able to have been actively actively, personally attacked, and feeling that they are disappointed."
They want to create a publication in the equivalent committee of the university to publish their views freely.

Oxford University of Protections (OUCA) was shown by Joe Cookie with the Rolls-Royce with silver color team and golden corner baston.
In other universities, the students say that they were treated as a "fatal Church" for their learning payments.
Luke Black, 20, said to the University of Nottingham, President of the United Nations, "it's a left-left division in the universities".
"The people think we're like the Bullingdon Club before we meet us."
In Corpus Christi, historical student Samuel Roberts, who offers the movement to protect the better, 21, says that this is not the money, but Stephanie Cherill, 19, says that the president of the OUCA members of JCR is a torment toward the right-century people.
"This is a threat to the peace of intellectual discussion atmosphere and members."
I was the only personality in the first few weeks in Oxford.
In September 1986, I was awesome in 18-year-old age.
The guard was at the firest time.
Another year ago, he voted to refuse the honor rate of Margaret Thatcher's ex-university for high-education payments.
This atmosphere shocked a stalin shock with fear.
In the first few days of the week, I saw the pain that I was coming when students were socialized with each other and the teachers.
I would have seen that the teachers wouldn't see how they've been shocked with the preaching students.
The Mademoiselle Grevine was brought to the anti-South African Political Training Chambers of the Municipality of the Intelligence, Privacy and Government.
First of the 18th century, it was about me to turn French text into English, and I was not prepared to do it later.
My instructor Harry Pitt said, "Mr. Wyatt, please turn the first paragraph."
I've been struggling here.
Pitt's association with a small man who looked like a skin skin.
"Does the Tahatchers call to learn French or only idiots?"
Other license students were cut off.
My eyes were painful behind my eyes.
"I'll suggest you to get French primary lessons in the past time."
I went back to my room with a painful letter.
That night at the university, I sit on my own head, and then I felt a sweet touch on my side.
This was a second-class student named James, who was known as a OUCA member.
He said, "I know you're a judge."
I'm afraid.
He's aware of all of the suspects because he's guarded.
It's enough bad for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so that's why it's gonna be worse for you.
Most of the preaching class students are like a lack of work party.
Then, in a local bar, I tried to shoot up.
I told Mrs. Thatcher didn't join anything.
This tactic failure proved to be successful.
Ironicly, the first student of the PPE, who was in Eton, said, "You're the daughter of a fascist dog,"
You're clear.
The other students guarded themselves.
I was worried, I was crazy.
Someone asked, "What's the sex with the smugglers?"
They're kidding each other, right?
I felt like the homosexuals would be feeling before they were in the army.
Did I ever have a normal life in Oxford?
Are I gonna be hard to meet with people that have the same idea only in darkness?
I wouldn't go back to the work party and load my natural movements?
It was a three-year-old and a full-speaked brain in my prize.
He's the only open expert in the university was Norman Stone's modern historian professor.

In 1997, Ankara began a professor at the university of IT in Turkey.
He said to me: "You will not be happy there."

I told my father why I hate Oxford and why.
I didn't believe it.
In pain, all the political views were accepted at his time.
He said, "But this is the best place in the world."
They don't do that, it's not among my dreams.
My communist friends always had perfect behaviors.
He began to find a slight eyes.
Give me a chance.
I'm sure it's all a joke.
If you hear me, my heart's broken.
My feelings were slow from my visits to London.
A man who was guarded was a friend of a man shocked up the pressure and rejected his faith.
I decided to do the same.
I confessed the brain of my grandfathers with a horrible shame, and I said to them "the old idiots."
It's a short deal.
My dad was shooting on my carriage.
And then, every week, Murdoch wrote two bridges in the Murdoch publication.
The door was closed.
My name was inside and five minutes after the shooting.
When we went, I prepared a ball, and I got the first train to London.
I never returned.
You can call me a smuggling smell.
However, no one of the 18-year-olds should be worthy of such fear and struggle in a educational body.
The more tragic Oxford is that it's the equality that Oxford's 14-president and that it's not in the back of the day.

We're living the same thing in every violent degree.
We told the authorities, but there's no way.

Every year, we're living in this difficulty.

I'll give you the best, healthy and confidential news in the Governing Journal and in the fairness.com.tr.
First of all, I want to get the switch file that brings a lot of voice in the kitchen.
We'll take these letters in our sections that will continue in the form.

You can't find your answer and send your questions that are specially interested in you to subsequently@currence.com.tr.
I'll be in your heart to answer you in the shortest time.
What's malumenity?
The SSK, who has lost at least 60 per cent of the uncertain age of MALULEN, and who has not been able to live in the SGK, can be able to resolve the security conditions that are counted in the SGK law.
They are also able to lose the power of assembly in situations where they are lost.
Who's going to say it?
I'm writing from the board, my name is Mehmet Gultekin, I have my 920 day insurance, and I have 1460 days insurance with the military debt.
In addition, I'm a bleeding sick.
I'm connecting to our language machine.
I'm still working in a job.
Can I take a month?
- If you're in front of the officer.
You haven't shown when you have been in work at first from the question you mentioned in your problem.
However, let's just tell you how the currency will be connected to you.
The most important conditions set out in the law are to be insured since 10 years and must be the primary day of 1800 days.
In addition, if you have been identified that you lost at least 60 percent of your work force or your work accident or the outcome of cure disease.
But you can't connect monthly because you are a dialytic disease here, you don't need to fill the number of 1800 primary days.
Of course, we don't know how many years you're working.
Your 10 years and the 1800 day you completed together will be connected to you in a month when you're going to make your departure from your work.
The ways to win the right to the currency month
Should anyone be able to connect a month without 1800?
- 1800 days of primary payment must be completed.
However, there is only one instance, and for those who have decided that someone is able to have a continuous care of others, it is connected to a month of safeguarding in the 10-year-old period of safeguarding.
What illness or distress will be made in the sections of our writings to continue to be able to overcome.
The situation of those who are impaired before starting
I'm Ahmet Guller.
While I've moved all the paths in the SGK law, they said you can't take a month before I was sick.
I'm so sweet.
Isn't it wrong?
How do I do?
- Ahmet Bey, you've written all the paths in the Law, but one of the main courses, and the SSK and the Big-cure insurance in the law, requires that the disease of the SSK and the insurance of the Insurance Securities will not be intact before the latter loss of work.
It's not possible to connect a month because you don't move it.
However, you can be able to be able to move the conditions of validity in the age of safeguard.
I have 3980 days. I'm insured for 16 years.
The SGK has been identified by the SGK that was before my department was in the work.
They said you couldn't be able to smell me.
What I'm going to do in this case.
I'm not going to do it.
Can you show the way?
- Yes, you've heard it.
You don't have to be smuggling.
However, according to the SGK law, there is also a cost-related cost.
So there are two situations before October 2008 and later.
If you start working before this history, you can take a month of age at least 15 years of insurance and at least 3600 days of primary time.
This is why we suggest you to find a request for a monthly connecting with the most closest SGK department.
Well, if you had been working after October 2008, then you could have been able to find a safe insurance for at least five years and to take at least 3960 days of age, age and death assurances first.
Is there a condition to get out of work when you start?
I'm still working as a shooter in a job.
When I went to the hospital, the cancer counted me.
I want to be a smuggle.
Do I need to leave the job in this case?
Can't I get out of a month without shut up?
I don't want to stay unclean until you're connected.
- You've heard it right.
You need to be left from work to give you a monthly connection.
But before the month, you have to be able to deal with your SGK law.
However, if you're able, it's connecting you with other conditions.
You don't mean to connect monthly dialysis, you have a risk of staying unfaithful.
It's enough for 1800 days.
When you're going to SGK, you're gonna love SGK's one of the hospitals who have been authorized.
If you bring the health system report from here, the SGK will be assessed in your own health system and your cancer disease will be a reason why you can get your work force loss on 60 per cent of the monthly linking.
However, since you need to fill the 10-year insurance period to connect your month, it will be possible to connect you to you.
So soon, we can say that the insurers who worked in the SGK health system is not skeptic to make the decision of the "unless you have."
But if the insurers are working any work, they could like to ask SGK and the detection of the insurance situation as well as the monthly connection.
This is the case if the smuggle moves and other conditions may be worth for the start of a month.
Should the link-Kur's responsibilities be cut down?
I'm Connect-Kur's security.
I'm stoneing all the conditions.
But they said you wouldn't have to be able to be able to do it because it's a duty.
What should I do.
- I'll read it.
Whoever told you is right.
You didn't write what other conditions are, but if you think you've moved these conditions, it's a difficult law that you pay for the primary debt.
But I can give you a special tea.
I'll suggest you're paying your debt by banks or by the same organizations.
If it's so early than a month, it's gonna take a month and you'll pay for a while in your debt.
These institutions will be easier to debt you to do your moon.
What stage connects?
Well, I worked as the SSK, the Connect-Kur and the Reverend.
Where'd you connect me from the moon when I'm in the moon?
- I'm worthy, the Connect-Corp, the SSK and the office, you're going to have a month of insurance, and the last is connected to SSK, which is the last time you're going to leave your safe job from anywhere, and you'll get switch from the SSK.
SGK reports to the hospital
How can it do the curriculum?
What hospital's health report?
- You're sufficient to implement the social security departments or social security centres that you are dependent on health reports.
The SGK will love you to the military hospitals associated with the Turk Armed Forces, in addition to university hospitals.
However, if you have not been able to have these hospitals, it can also be aware of the complete encouraged hospitals of the Health Department.
Isn't it possible to love a special hospital?
- It's possible, but there are conditions.
In ancient arrangements, the new management of SGK is now agreed with the new management that can be placed in a 01.09.2013, with the 01.09.2013 recording the treatment of the life of risks of patients who have been able to be able to be able to do with a special patient who loved you with the health system, and which you have received here, will also be reported on health reports.
What are the conditions for love?
The SEVK request is sufficient to make it important for 1800 days to make a relationship with the status of safeguards.
The hospital's records of malnutrition will be paid by SGK.
And 10 years of insurance, SGK is looking at this.
In the situation of malnutrition, if a person is likely to be seen, the insurance period of 10 years before securing the security conditions is only sufficient to 1800 days, according to the health system report.
This is why the person's first advisory of the department is only in the 1800 days of detection, and it is likely to be able to take care of SGK.

The tests that were done at the weekend had to stop the sale of many processes.

I was surprised to tell Turkey's first technicians what could be done with the South Pamir sound frequencies.
As sound technologies or sound technology are soon the sound systems about the mind of everyone's music.
So you know that you can prevent the terrorism with the voice of sound technology, that you can act perfectly with the sound frequencies, that you can love the person you want to love yourself, that you can confess a secret or that you can enable the world to smile?
After the finishing of the Mimar Division in the South Pamir, he took a sound engineering diplomat from the SAE college in England, and made it master over sound technology at the University of Middlesex.
The young man's relationship with the Galatasaray technology has also grown in a sound engine in the ITM and has also learned music technologies, audio technologies, performance technologies, electronic music and advanced record technologies.
terrorism sub-limiting message
"What is the sound technology exactly?" is my first question.
"A technologie that can be used in many parts of the world.
Our brain's smells all with electric shoes.
The sound frequencies are a kind of electrical power, energy.
You can make people move with the command you want."
One of the main higher parts of its technology is sub-limital message.
It's putting a message on a frequencies that is mentioned outside the border of the music or song, which can't be identified by the above memory, but it's in high memory.
For example, when a terrorist attack has been taken, Pamir says that it could be a musical publication to that region.
If a message is placed as a "Don't attack" as a channel is changed in the song frequencies, the terrorist will see this message.
You don't understand what you heard, but the golden memory comes to it, and a voice calls him "shooting."
And it is like a message from Allah.
However, in the world and in Turkey, there is certainly law and punishment to use these messages outside the social security.
The South Pamir is a sub-lime message prepared to tell students about the matter at a conference given only once at the Istanbul Technology University.
"After the conference, I listened to the students.
I put a sound frequencies for the music.
I asked the students who didn't smile at the end of the sun.
They said, "It's all that they're so calm."
Pamir says that there are people who have a sublime message in our country "we have been confirmed that some radio channels have done it, but details are still not known.
There's a channel called "Smart Radio" in Germany, a frequency of radical Islamics.
The sub-liminal methods of attacking, religiously containing, computer calling, commands to use drug hair.
The German police and the Turkey police knows that, but they're not able to start with the frequencies."
It also uses such dangerous messages in the music world.
Especially in the songs of some heavy metal groups...
According to these arguments, even a terrorist was destroyed in the aircraft, and he was implemented with sub-liminal commands of the high-known pilots.
Close Mask
Sound technology can also be used in crimes.
In the United States, in particular, the funds of bank shocks are from this science.
For example, when the police's phone phone calls technicians have been able to confirm where the phone's voice person is in the bank, where it is in the room.
A voice metal, tasting, plastic, wall or any other material is different from each other.
It is possible to identify the size of the room that is found in the shape of the sound form, even if the room is the shape of the room, which is the size of the coins.
As a result, the voice of the guilt can be confirmed by what kind of components there are, and how large it is in a room.
There was also a computer program used that Pamir had the designs of a operational building from Tataristan, and he said, "I've calculated where the 175 holar building was placed.
It's not a bad technology, it's $4-5,000."
The sound frequencies are also used in the decoration.
There's a lot of jobs about Pamir's.
He made a arrangement on a restaurant where the workers went out of the top-level moral meetings could not go out of the table.
It's just the ones talking in the kitchen.
Another one on two steps can't hear anything he's talking on the table.
The general system of these arrangements is, "If you want to destroy your sound, you're making it in the same frequency with another sound, and you're turning the sound energy into the river.
But no one could get into the flight if it was not this system.
Because the aircraft's voice is so high that it can't be shocked.
They're going to destroy themselves by they're cutting these voices in the plane.
Even if you open your windows with this system, you can create a peaceful environment away from your home.
The Egyptian piramids were made with a voice?
There's another interesting thing that Pamir did with the first technicians of Turkey.
He made a arrangement that can't hear the sound of music on a open air disk in the month.
It can't get out of the border, and it's able to do it with another sound frequency.
Even in a room, it can be silent after a certain line.
The Pamir's school's sports room and the sport and the concert.
I mean, the twice should be useful.
Because when playing basketball, there's need to be a smuggle, but the concerts must not be shocked.
In the clear concerts the voice of music is only possible with sound technologies.
"We're using frequencies to destroy the sounds that are sweet, and to correct humans' matters, to make the music more cleaner.
MTV's too extensive about this.
It's clearly arranged concerts, and it's heard like stadyo was under the voice."
It's been a test of the Tubitak.
The sound frequencies and the sound frequencies divide two pieces from each other.
There were scientists who claimed that the Egyptian piramids were made with a voice.
They thought that the stones could be removed with the voice.
I ask, "It's not a problem that you can use with bad purposes?"
"I was so afraid when I read the New York University's works from the Internet, or if others read.
He said, "If the good workers, even the good workers, can cause the unbelievable results, if they do not beside the laboratory courses."
"Dualar Arabs"
The South Pamir, who says that he would affect humans in a sense of immorality, explains why: "Why all the voices that his servants hear are communicated to the brain.
Someone hears the sound that's the only concentration, but other voices are communicating to the brain, and they're going to smile.
So the brain's need to disappear, so it's good to walk on the ground, to do natural walks.
I think there should be arrangements for the orders of prostitution in schools.
So students will be concentrated on the voice of the teacher alone and can provide concentration for more long."
Pamir, who says that the sound frequencies believed in prayers or in the Arabs would be effective, shows that Arabs have a very rich frequencies-frequencies swimming side when the voices are in the words, has been organized so slightly.
"But you have to read your prayers, but when I read the Law, I will smile. "
Frequency Love Target
"Is it possible to love people with the sound frequencies?"
The frequencies rate of love that Pamir has given is to move the feelings of a more correct person is: "I think you must find the frequency of the pressure that you want to talk to someone you want to love.
You can influence it by using higher frequencies in this frequency.
For example, let us consider that the person is 300 of the pressure frequency.
And you want to steal a music to make your feelings.
If you're gonna bring the pressure to those who are based on the 300 frequencies of the music that you're playing, it's the ability to influence the person.
Maybe he may love the one who is in that way."
In the world, Pamir, who speaks that sound systems are special to speak more effectively, is very strong as a politician, a scene artist can feel like a great natural substance.
"It's in Japan, she's trying to make a voice that believes that the Mikail's day of preaching is not going to do, but how do you think it's going to be?" Pamir's answer, "I think human voice will be close to the voice because the voice of the people's most influenced voice is close to its own voice."
Indeed, it is a magnificent thing, like a man's breath.
"The gold prices will be loaded."
The Canadian Head Analyst Dan Hrushewsky said that they have worked to reduce their responsibilities by declining the value of the money units, so that the gold prices will continue to be the current level, "Original and safe designer."
In the first half of the world's demand, which was the most winner of the last week, Hrushewsky, China and India, showing that it looks like the prices of lower prices, "China's silence is higher than the India's silence, and the Chinese addicts are a large role in this.
Hrushewsky, who remembers that India's traditionally the largest gold shopper is, says, "I believe you've seen their search accounts now very calm.
People will find a way in this frame."
Hrushewsky is in the direction that they do long-term expenditure to the advisors, saying, "He will continue to serve with the role of being a safe, safe designer.
Many Western government's debt levels are forgotten to be loaded from the "disciplinary exile".
The authorities are working to reduce their responsibilities by declining the value of the money units.
This is why gold prices will be loaded from the current levels."
"Ore in the area of the swimming world is stored in the ability to reduce the price risk."
The World Gold Advisory Director-General Marcus Grubb is an physical feature of being sacred, firm and trusted in golden and more intensive and voluntary financial prices, "If we slow down the extent, it is not to improve the capacity of decreasing the primary developments and the risks of the prices.
He said, "The golden portraits of small quantities, showing the development of the transportation, generally proved that it was better to be done with the uncertainties and prices.
Grubb, marking that golden-energy demand has been laid down in the last 10 years, "to represent the higher and worldwide levels at least 1 percent.
This means that the prices are still very important to grow in golden expansion.
In this area, in the past year, 78 per cent of the culture of gold, and the exhibition of the powerful inputs that are made to the smooth, is the demonstration that you have protected the counter-productor's interests.
"Independence must increase national gold stories to support economic growth."
The Grubb, who answers the largest gold prices of the world to India and China, adds that in the second round of the year's decline in gold prices, the culture of gold, and the demand that was shocked, increased the increase of the smoking smokes in Asia.
Grubb remembered 54 per cent of the complaint in China, and 51 per cent in India.
The Grubb, who made their benefits from the low price of Chinese smokers, was a loading trend, "It would normally be silent from the Musevher's request in the second half of China.
He said, "Well, when the prices of the gold were unexpectedly cut down, he was slow to the demand, and the swimming shooting was slowly lost."
Grubb, in India, has made many predictions to reduce the exits of golden governments, to support the Indian Central Bank's rule and to reduce the outcome of the deficiencies, said: "In the nature of the original demand, it is difficult to meet the applications of the high level of deterioration, and therefore it is to meet the unable channels.
The World High Council believes that India's policies have to be realized as a strategic existence.
Furthermore, the long-term policy objectives were evaluated in a increased national gold stories to support economic growth in the process.
Sustainable Gold Trends
According to the World Gold Council report last week, 856.3 tonnes of global gold requirements were also 508 tonnes of gold in the second area of this year.
In the second area of the year, when countries have an important increase in the demand of the counterparts, in China, 54 per cent, in India, 51 per cent in 38 per cent, and in Eastern East 33 per cent in India.
At the time of the term, the smoking demands in China continued to grow strongly, with the expectations that the prices will increase in the future, in the same proportion of 87 per cent and at 276 tonnes this year's assembly.
In India, although the government has loaded taxes in the first circle, it was 310 tonnes of 71 per cent tonnes in the past year.
A warm Karadenz film: Pool airlines
The doctor in Trabzon.
The players are the favorite, sweet, smiling, smiling, smiling snakes of the village.
Next Free
There's only 400 thousand TL films, there's no replication, a lot of birth and a cup.
In the leadership of the Vice-Chair of the Sinema's Era, the film was "What we want to observe is a real kardinal story."
The cinema of the Aceabat, which is made in the Middle East and completely composed of amateur players, was caused by the movie of the "Tepening Airs of 1980" and the movie was a pleasant look like him.
Forum AVM Cinemaxum was careful to the interests of the galaxy presss in the Sinema.
They signed a wonderful night with the teams, the horons and the cardinal kinds of people who lived in a gallery night.
In the first place of Galaia, Mohammed Balta, President of Trabzon Fevzi, Dr.Orhan Fevzi Officer, Headquarters of Industrial Safety, Ombudsman culture and Tourism Office, Abdul Rauf Ulusoy, President of the Academic Office and many invitations, sponsor companies, national and local representatives.
In the film of Dr. Icemit Eran's scripture, the director Samet Karagasano, the Meeting, the Coral Man, the Selahatting, the Free Saral, the Adem Era, and the Resurrection Era.
In 1980, the Topen Islands today with 61 copy were used in Turkey to make it possible for the first time for the Karadenz race to be better agreed in Turkey.
A star of the tent!
Samet Karahasano is still 18 years old from the head players of the film.
Whatever the name of Samet's player who lives in Trabzon, you're seeing the best.
A amator theater, a code and a loading scene are successfully shooted under the film.
Samet Karahasano, who had the right to the end of his shopping, has opened his call to the boarder's "It's one of the strike players that will be."
It wasn't a dragon!
The issue of Trabzon's Middle Province is the subject of the events in a period of 12 September 1980 nearby:
"Film's head character works in Germany, the young Wikmet's father.
It's one of the greatest dreams of the Wikmet, which is making shepherds in the months, to complete the training and to do a doctor.
Whatever it's not much to read and work.
And when a village is the richest family of Zuleyha, the daughter of Züleyha, is still hard to work.
This love that has been hidden for years is the father of Zuleyha, who has decided to tell his friends to the widows that he had taken to Züleyha with his friends.
Sabri Blue's daughter has other plans.
And it is one of the greatest challenges of the people of the surrounding villages, and they have opened a war against the villages of this temple.
A short metro from the film...
The Senator and Governor of the Galada film explained the 1980s of the Topenian Aviations:
"When we started this movie, our purpose was to make a short film.
But the first spectrums were so interested in social media, that we started to hear the shock to take us a long-term metros.
When we went to Istanbul, they said, "Do you have a great player?"
I said, "We don't have a god, but I have 86 cardinal games that you can't find anywhere."
The films and skins were used very badly, and the Karadenz people were wrongly identified.
You're going to look at the original 86-foot in the movie that you're looking for.
I tried to take a cardinal movie.
I wish others would have taken before me, and we wouldn't have seen a shocked film.
If you weren't telling people wrong, I wouldn't have taken this movie.
We first posted a Turkish subscription on the film.
It's gonna be the first.
We did this because you're better understood.
In addition, we put the English speech scenes in the movie and turned into the cardenz.
When we turned this movie to whom we turned the camera to the player.
It's our first movie.
I'm wrong, I can't do my cylinders."
Don't shoot this warm movie that brings a new cell to the cardinal movies!

The coffee red lake appears in a shape.
He is slaughtered, he is gracious, and the wheat trees are defined.
The pulse is one of the choices for the treatment of the laser and the protection of the sun.
Another is the use of retinoic asylum creams.
These creams must be used for a long time.
It is not an adverse or alergia that can appear during the use.
In this case, it must be continued to be treated.
In order to be family, your parents must be known about premature protection and treatment of Citte Poikloders."
Great in the smoking smoking
In Turkey in the first six months of this year, 10% of the same period, and 4 779 million returned.
In Turkey in the first six months of this year, the smoking rate was 10% less than 4 779 million in 190,000 in the same period.
According to the information provided by the Institute of Alcohol Revision (TAPDK), the use of information on the product of adults in Turkey and the establishment of data on decision-makers and researchers is completed by the Turk Statistics Institute for Adults (KYTA).
According to the research results, in Turkey generally 15 and more age units in 2008, 31.2 percent (16 million people) are using tuberculosis products every day or between 2012, and 13.4% of this rate was decreased to 27.1 million (14.8 million) and was decreased.
41.5 percent of men are using 13.1 percent of women.
The rate of those used by the twin product is 47,9% to 41,5% in the male, and the percentage of women was of 15,2% to 13,1%.
According to the investigation, 10 persons who use the tuberculosis are thinking to leave 6 tobacco.
The rate of those who think to leave the product in a month is 12.9.12 months, and 35.4 per cent of those who planned to leave.
In the review section, the following opinions were placed:
"The net results of the opening of the smoking products are marked that the smoking control laws in Turkey and the National Inspection Programme and the Action Plan are actively implemented.
Thus, from 2008 to 2012, the number of smokes has reduced 2 200 million people, 4.1 per cent of the use of the use of smoking, and the most specific lowest rates of smoking were the price increases of young people as well as less educational people.
According to the 2013 World Health Protection Report, Turkey was the first and the only country that has succeeded with all criteria on the basis of the control of the tuberculosis.
In the report, other countries were striking to follow and imitate Turkey."
The cigarette law continues to demonstrate its effects in the closed areas.
In the first six months of this year, the rate of smoking in the past six months was declined in 10 percent, with a decline of 41.779 million, 190.560 per cent.
In the same period of 2012, this figure was $46,325 million in a 100-millionial level.

Another newness to Android!
The Google patent will make it easier.
And that's the patent of the new interface technologie that uses the work of the shared files with the friends.
It's not very different than Android Beam and Apple Airdrop examples.
The last innovation that's transferred to Google's signature is that it's going to give the user groups instead of a divided partition, and it's going to give the users easy.
The new personality comes to get places on the Android...
That's the first phone in Turkey.
Turkcell also entered the smart phone work.
The manufacture of smart phones will be in Turkey.
T40 name
Turkcell identified the first smart phone in Turkey.
The TCELL design is made in Turkey, and the intelligent phone that will be produced in Turkey on the end of September, T40.
Turkcell General Director Süreya Ciliv said he planned to sell in nine countries in which Turkcell worked.
He said, "T40's part of China will begin to produce in Turkey until the year 2013."
EXPIRATION FYRY
Ciliv, who said they would offer his phone with a suitable price, explained that he would close to the sale of the price.
Ciliv said that a more accessible price from the sale of the computer with the T40 would be given to the market by providing a wise phone to increase the use of data, to increase its costs.
Ciliv, who stated that the T-series were sold from the phones, provided for by Turkcell in 2010, showed that these sales were 500 million libraries.
FYIATIES TO THE LIFE TO THE WORK TO THE LIFE
Turkcell General Director Süreya Ciliv said that T40 would be the properties of the swimmingness, high-resolved sound, sound-resolved and adjustable user drive.
Ciliv said that before T40's price is out to the phone price, the phone's price would be appropriate.
HOME 5 MILYS TO THE WORK GOD GOD
When he said that the President of Tayfun Acarer supported the local production, information technology and communications, he said, "57 per cent of the phones in Turkey.
The average cost of the phones sold by this expansion is $300.
We're looking at $5 billion every year from 15 million every year, and we're worried that it's going to grow up. "
Android operating systems will have 1 GB RAM features.
All the priests were heartless!
The records of students read at the normal medium were renewed as a secondary student
MEB transformed all the schools in Turkey, which we've seen from 4+4+4 in education, as a medium-sized, and immortal environment.
After a year's educational period, it appears that many schools in the re-establishment of the "necessary" processes were signed by a new scene during the works of transformation.
In Turkey this year, the priest's heart and care for all the publishers in the middle of the schools, a scandale of "conciliation" in the Sugar Meram, which was made in the Middle of Konya.
A normal year
The first school of the sugar was around in the head of the last year after the 4+4+4 arrangement.
In school, the system group was seeing a class of 3 and 4 classes with a medium of 6, 7 and 8 classes of students.
The school, which serves as a normal school for one year, was transformed into a medium with the end of 2012-2013 education year.
I believed the school around the heart this year accepted his students as a "Image and students" to school first once this year.
However, in the past fiveth class, students read normally, and this year, these records were automatically renewed as a medium student in the electronic environment.
"Another school that doesn't want."
The brothers who learned the situation, they were a complainant in school.
However, in the case of the instruction of the Millennium Educational Director, the school government said, "the bonds who do not want to continue in the heart of their children can take their record to another medium."
In explanation by the Millennium Educational Directorate, Konya took interesting expressions.
When explaining, "We have become some schools again with the preferences of students and schools, and in Konya's 15 to 20th schools, the priest in Konya was rounded.
Schools are engaged in the e-school system with school codes.
However, the priest's school is removed from the code of the old school in the environment.
The new school code must be opened by students in the system.
These schools, using the new code of the system to make the students in the midst of schools changed, switched up to the medium.
The brothers who want to take their children from these schools and give them to other schools."
