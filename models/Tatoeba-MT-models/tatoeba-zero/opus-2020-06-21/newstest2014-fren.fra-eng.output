Spectacular swimming in "wingsuit" above Bogota
Jhonathan Florez sported a helicopter above Bogota, the colonian capital.
Equipment of a wingsuit (uncombination of ices), it took up at 160 km/h above the famous Sanctuary Monserrate, located over 3,000 meters of height, where many baths were gathered to observe their operating.
A black box in your car?
While the United States road network planners are hard to find the money necessary to repair the decrepitary infrastructure, many of them have a solution in the form of a small black box that is fixed above your car board table.
The devices, which store all thousands of passengers by a automobilist and transmit information to the officials, are at the centre of a conflicted attempt to Washington and the government offices of planning to remane the obsolete financing system of the major American roads.
The sector, in general without interest in planning large axes, has soon produced a strongly animated debate and moved alliances.
Freedoms have joined ecological groups to make pressure so that the Government uses small boxes to keep the trace of thousands you're going through, and eventually from the road on which you circle, then use information to edit a fiscal law project.
The Tea Party's shooted.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concerns on the protection of private life.
And while the members of the Congress are not able to agree to know whether it is necessary to continue, several States have not been expected.
They are looking for how, during the next decade, they can pass into a system that allows the drivers to pay as a result of the number of thousands of parcourus.
Thousands of cars have already locked these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system for an experimental ferry.
This is really essential for our nation.
“It's not like if we had the choice,” said Hasan Ikhrata, Director-General of Southern California Association of Governments, who predicted that the State begins to register thousands of passengers by each California automobilist here 2025.
There will be a change in the way we pay these taxes.
Technology is here to do it.
The pressure is due to the fact that the Highway Trust Fund of the country, funded with the taxes paid by the Americans to the pump, is financially financed.
Americans do not purchase more than before.
Autos can walk more than thousands with a gallon.
The Federal Tax itself, which is 18.4 percent per gallon, has not increased since 20 years.
Political men are reiterate to increase tax, even of 1 percent, while the cost of the essence is higher.
“The essence tax isn't just tensible,” Lee Munnich, a specialist of transport policy at the Minnesota university.
His State has recently installed 500 car trackers to test a mile payment system.
“It would be the longest logical alternative,” he said.
Wonks calls it the use costs for kilometers.
It is not surprising that the idea of citizen-based licenses can help taxes to change conduct practices in order to reduce compressions and gas emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system because they are developing strategies to achieve the objectives of the State ' s ambitious climate heat laws.
But representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), Chairman of the Committee on Transport of the Chamber of Representatives, said that it would also be considered as the long-termest alternative.
Reason foundation's free market partys also appreciate the idea of paying drivers a mile.
"It isn't just a tax in a large black strike", said Adrian Moore, vice-president of the policy at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for their benefits.
The movement is also supported by two former American secretariats on Transport, which, in 2011, urged the Congress to go to the way of payment a mile.
The United States Senate approved a pilot project of $90 million last year, which would have taken about 100,000 cars.
But the Chamber's Chamber's presidency killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing elections that have to pass through thousands every day to make themselves working or in town.
Many States and large cities, however, make progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregon, which mobilized 5000 drivers to conduct the most important experience of the country.
These automobilists spend the state of kilometric costs instead of excise taxes.
Nevada has already conducted a pilot project at the end.
The city of New York is predicting one.
Illinois trys a test on a limited number of trucks.
And coalition I-95, which includes 17 road transport agencies in countries far from the coast of the United States (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), studys how it could implement the change.
The concept is not universal success.
In Nevada, where some 50 volunteers had recently equipped their car with a device, the drivers were concerned that the government could follow their smaller facts and gentles.
“The concerns about Big Brother and such things are a great problem,” said Alauddin Khan, who directs the strategic performance management in the Nevada Transport Department.
It's not something that people want.
From the beginning of the test, the Nevada ACLU warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to transform these devices into entire location devices."
It is not necessary to build an immense and comprehensive technological infrastructure that will be inevitablely expanded in order to keep the registers of human allies and coming daily.
Nevada is part of some States who are now moved to find an approachable technology that would enable the State to know how many thousands of cars are, but without knowing the place or the exact time.
If we can do this, adds Khan, the citizens will be more.
The research of this technology has brought some State agencies to call for a small start-up name of True Mileage.
As a result, the company was not intended to help the automobilists paying taxes to States.
It tried to spend on the car insurance market, where the drivers would pay on the basis of their kilometers.
But the devices that it tests have been further to the major axes planners because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically downloaded by modem.
“The people will be more encouraging to do so if you don't save their speed and don't locate them” said Ryan Morrison, Director-General of True Mileage.
In the pilot programmes of certain States, there were major errors.
There are very fewer means and less intrusive methods to process.
In Oregon, the planners have experienced by offering different automobilists.
They can select a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose not to have any device, preferably to pay a forefat based on the average number of thousands of percorates by all the residents of the State.
Other States hope to sell the concept to disfellowshipping citizens in order to make it more than enough.
In the city of New York, carriers seek to develop a taxing device that would also be equipped to pay station costs, provide “payment payment” and create a set of data on the real speed from other drivers that automobilists could use to avoid insurance.
“The automobilists would be encouraged to participate in the benefits offered by the system” said a document on urban installation.
However, some transport planners are asked whether the whole payment debate is not just a large diversion.
In the Metropolitan Transport Commission on the area of San Francisco, the responsibilities say that the Congress could be very simple to manage the highway Trust Fund's failite by increased the essence taxes.
A supplementary or annual tax could be imposed on hybrid vehicle drivers and on others whose vehicles do not consume much of the essence, so that each pays its fair part.
“There is not necessary to use a radical surgery when we just need aspirine” said Randy Rentschler, director of the Commission's legislation and public affairs.
If so, hundreds of millions of automobilists will be worried about the protection of their private life and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: four inedits in listening
The English musician has not been surprised this year.
From The Next Day in January he accompanied a luxury revision planned for 4 November, with several inedits.
Four have already been embarrassed on the Toile.
The advertising of a new album of David Bowie had left all the pants.
On the day of his 66th anniversary, on January 8, 2013, he said that a new album would be out in March.
After ten years of silence (the last disk, Reality, 2003) and too rare appearances in the public, the English musician proved that we could still be able to count on him to find the pop scene.
A party for his fans
Not the surprises, David Bowie had more than a tour in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke plans to edit this album on 4 November.
For the opportunity, he had a real party for his fans.
This redistribution, titled The Next Day Extra, will be presented in the form of three disks: the original album, unreducted studies sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four clips already published.
The Next Day Extra will contain ten additional titles in relation to the original album: the three parts of the Deluxe edition, five specially dismissed songs for the opportunity, and two remixes.
David Bowie also made the presentations of this beautiful coffet in a video.
It introduced both the disks, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and pockets, a book to share their own impressions, a book with words...
And, especially, he gives a front-good of his new Atomica title, typically in the Venice of The Next Day, with guitars very advanced and a sadly mastered rock electricity.
Indeeds already listened
But Atomica is not the only title to declare his charms.
The Informer, like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the toilet.
The Informer is double-face: an worried intro before a light horse that gradually slows to leave a pop ball.
About Like A Rocket Man, Bowie did he want to make a small reference to the Rocket Man of Elton John, even in Gravity?
With this title added, the songer seems in any case in his element when he has no more feet on earth.
Space Oddity, on the side, was much worse.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie makes a new reference to his strangeness: would he come from another planet?
The rifs to guitar, smiling, give up to leave the Earth.
Bowie is fun in any case to play on the camera with these titles: computer tour, man on the board of a smoke, potential marten...
He dismisses and reveles both, plays to adopt different personalities, as he did it all along his career, in particular with his personalities Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
It was not surprised that he had a mask on his hand in the photo of the campaign The invitation to travel, from the Mark Louis Vuitton, whose new face is incarcerated.
It will appear in one of its advertising spots from 10 November.
The Minister of Defence, Rob Nicholson, insisted on saying that the blessed soldiers were not so-called from the Canadian Army forces, and stressed that a transitional process was followed by all soldiers before their return to civil life.
Mr. Nicholson, attacked by the Liberals and the Neo-Democrats at the Chamber of Communities, assured that before their release, the army members followed a transitional plan in collaboration with their seniors.
All blessed soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civil life and no one of them is released before being ready, or not.
Delegators accused the Government of wanting to economize money by not allowing the blessed militarys - who do not respond to the rule of the "university of the service" of the army that requires that the staff be able to carry out a series of different tasks - to reach the time of 10 years of admissibility for pension benefits.
They, in particular, mentioned two cases reported by the Canadian Press, including the of a free soldier on Friday.
Leader David Hawkins, a London reserve in Ontario, reached the after-traumatic stress syndrome, was released from the army, despite his request to remain more than one year in order to receive an fully indexed retrait.
His case occurred after the captain Glen Kirkland, who declared before a parliamentary committee, last month, that he had been put out before being ready because he did not respond to the university rule of service.
Mr. Hawkins stressed that a soldier could be prepared from, with plans and consultations, but that was completely different than the fact that he wanted to leave the lines.
"I told them that I wasn't ready," he stated at an interview with The Canadian Press Monday.
I asked for months if there was a way I could stay, and they said no.
Since the beginning of the major battles in Afghan, the army shall determine the latitude that it can grant to the blessed soldiers who want to remain in the lines but are not able to fight.
In accordance with the current rules, seriously blessed soldiers have up to three years to restore themselves.
If they do not respond to the criteria for foreign deployment, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data submitted to Parliament last year indicated that among 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 did not reach the duration of service required to obtain pension benefits.
The free-democratic door on the subject of old fighters, Jim Karygiannis, requested the reintegration of the Chief Hawkins, while the neo-democratic Jack Harris requested the immediate end of "the honourous practice".
Disney on tablets to start an animated series
The American Media and Divorce Group Disney decided to privileg tablets to its own television chain for the next outcome of a new series for children.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from 24 November on the watchdisneyjunior.com site or through its application for phones and tablets.
His global launch on the Disney Group Chains is intended only in 2014, details the reported Disney Junior's Division.
The animated design, used for children from 2 to 7 years, tells the adventures of Callie chat, secret of a city of Western America where it has ruled the order with a magic lasso.
Each episode includes two storys of 11 minutes.
"Interaction with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today", commented Albert Cheng, vice-president of the digital products at Disney/ABC Television Group, referred to in the communication.
This type of experience between Disney's efforts to "extend life periods of its series and to build new relationships with the public through digital platforms that are increasingly significant," he added.
A week-end study by Common Sense Media showed a explosion of the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of the years of less than 2 have been used by a tablet or a phone, and 72% of the less than 8 years ago, with respect to 10% and 38% of the two years ago.
Snowden is ready to “co-operate” with Germany on the issue of American Surveillance
Edward Snowden, the accusator of the United States Information Services, said that he was disposed to make witness to the German parliament if the United States National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers on their activities.
The German Deputy Hans-Cristian Strubele met Mr. Snowden in Russia, where he enjoys the right of asylum to discuss his witness in Germany.
In a letter submitted to the media in Berlin on Thursday, Mr. Snowden said: “But the result of my efforts has been very positive, my Government continues to deal with the difference of view as a fleet and seeks to punish the political talk with accusions against which it is impossible to defend himself.”
However, the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he thought that the support of the international community could convince the American Government to abandon the criminal charges against him.
In the context of the complaint issued by the United States Ministry of Justice, it is accused of sponsoring and flight of State goods.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Minister of Germany, declared at Online time: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to German responsibilities, we will make it possible.”
The relationships between the United States and Germany were tested after complaints reported that NSA had been listening to the portable phone of the German chanceler Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the parliamentary group that supervises for foreign secret services, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness “less put it in danger and completely ruin the relationships with the United States”, he had to benefit.
Mr. Stèbele, deputy Vert German, published a photo of him with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit in Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Strubele said that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA consultant, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr. Snowden was witnessing in Germany, he should be able to make sure that it would be “safe” there, he said the deputy.
Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been subjected to a “severe and supported” persecution campaign that had forced him to leave his country.
He said, however, he was encouraged by the world reaction towards “my political expression act”.
The citizens of the whole world, as well as the high-responsibilities, including the United States, believed that the revelation of an unexpected permanent monitoring system was public use.
The letter continues to provide cooperation with the German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved".
Cogeco Cable could soon offer the interactive television
Cogeco Cable members may even have access to applications such as Facebook, Twitter, and lastly video service on Netflix request through their television in a future that doesn't seem so far.
The Cogeco filial reported on Thursday that it was currently subject to preliminary tests of the beta version of this platform with some of its users.
"This will allow us to value more comfortable interfaces as well as more options", explained the President and Chief of the Cogeco Director, Louis Audet, in interview.
Cogeco Câble thus gives the step to its competitors, as Bell, even though the Cogeco filial has not yet been precise in what has been related to this new platform.
"It must be adapted and changed or resisted to change and failed," said Mr. Audet.
The last goal remains to offer tools to our customers not currently access.
Rogers' telecommunications generator already indicated that it could offer Netflix if some technical details, which were not quoted, could be regulated.
In the United States, the popular video services say to be in discussion with some major cable distributors so that its service is available through their dissemination platforms.
The Cogeco and Cogeco Câble also welcomed the announcement made by the Government of Harper at the Throne on 16 October last.
Ottawa wants to force television providers by cable and satellite to offer customers the opportunity to pay card services.
"When we have done nearly two years and half that we say that the idea of forced consumers to purchase important strings, it does not work", said Mr. Audet.
However, it is hoped that the Council's consultations on radiodiffusion and Canadian Telecommunications (CRTC) will be discussed on interesting recommendations.
"It should be exagered from these discussions a new type of reference framework to the definition of our new Canadian cultural policy on television", said Cogeco, p.
The CRTC has consulted the public since last week and should continue with the industry in the next spring.
From the results, Cogeco has recorded a net benefit of 43.8 million to the fourth quarter, or 82 per action.
This is a recule compared to the net benefit of 44.9 million, or 83 per action, of the same period the last year.
The company established in Montreal explains this recurrence by new acquisitions costs.
Cogeco acquired the Atlantic Broadband cottage distributor, established in the United States for 1.36 billion.
It was the first largest acquisition of the company after that who failed to Portugal.
In December, the Montrealaise company also purchased Peer 1 Network Enterprises, an Internet provider established in Vancouver, for a total of 526 million.
In Cogeco's income, they conveyed an increase of 41.5 per cent to the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
They are 1.8 billion for the current financial year.
The net benefit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Câble, was 43.9 million, or 90.
However, Cogeco Cable income made 45% progress to reach 470.4 million.
The company lost 15 237 customers during the fourth quarter.
However, for the 2013 financial year, the number of Cogeco Cable clients is increased by 5546.
Mr. Audet is not worried about seeing the number of flowing customers like that.
For me, it is not the indication of a trend change, does he not observe.
It varies from a quarter to the other with a very living competition.
Cave in bowl products
The chain meat was decepted in bowl-based products boxes, sold by two small British teachers of low price distribution, announced today the food hygiene agency.
Routine tests revealed that the products developed in Romania in January and sold by Home Bargains and Save Quality Chains contain ADN of 1 to 5% higher horses.
"In the case of horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not be presented in the product," explained the British Agency.
A scandale on the presence of horse meat in kitchen plates grew in Europe at the beginning of the year after tests carried out in Ireland.
According to the European Commission's reviews, France was the most touched country by the presence of this type of meat in censed products to contain only bovine.
A collision between two vehicles made four blessed, early Friday, on road 131 in Lanaudière.
Before four hours, a car driving northern direction in Saint-Félix-de-Valois lost his vehicle's management and surrounded a car that arrived in the other direction.
The four occupants of the two vehicles were blessed, but they were not scared of their lives.
The movement was returned to normal at 6 p.m., Friday.
Frontier Airlines intends to pay hand bags
Frontier Airlines intends to pay up to $100 to passengers who carry handbags on his flights.
Frontier Airlines intended to start paying up to $100 for a handbag and $2 for a coffee or a soda, although in its merchant advertising, she indicated that passengers could import the not open chain with them at the distance of the flight.
The new handbag costs relate to bags covered in the top apartment, so the small sacks installed under the seat will always be free.
Frontier stated that it would pay $25 if the costs were paid in advance and $100 if travellers would pay only once at the shipping gate.
The Frontier's talk door, Kate O'Malley stated that the $100 were planned to encourage travellers to pay prior costs.
“We do not want to pay this price” she explained.
Airlines started to pay the first and second payments recorded in 2008.
The passengers who tried to avoid these costs were so much that they could be in the main bags covered in the top divisions, so there was no longer place in these divisions.
These costs are a way to ensure that passengers transport less on board.
O'Malley said that these new costs will not really need to collect money.
It is to understand the most faithful clients of Frontier that it becomes more difficult to find the place in the tops.
The passengers who buy their tickets on the website of the airline will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger who made the chair to a Frontier shipping door could transport a sack free, while the next person in the chair could pay $100 for a similar sack.
O'Malley explained that the site and recording procedures of Frontier are being changed to ensure that passengers know the existence of these costs before reaching the door.
Frontier's handbag costs will not be applied before the summer, although no date has been fixed.
The passengers often care about payments and other costs, but airlines worship them.
They believe that payment maintenance costs are important and that passengers who want this service should pay it.
Many people at Wall Street consider the expense of payments as a sign that proves that airlines make enough money to cover the air journey cost after years of loss.
However, many of them did not touch bag costs.
Spirit Airlines Inc. applied the first hand bag costs three years ago, and the low-cost company Allegiant followed a little later.
The only other tax company is the Hungarian Wizz Air company, announced the consultor to airlines Jay Sorensen, which follows nearly the additional costs.
He estimated, in a December 2011 report, that Spirit’s handbag costs reported $50 million per year.
Sorensen, an elderly framework of Midwest Airlines, recently traveled on Spirit and asked what he would be found at the gate of shuttle at the time that passengers would discover the inhabited shuttle costs of the company.
“I never had seen such a flowing procedure of all my professional career” he would say.
I was waiting for seeing dentist strikes and a shut up at the door.
The aircraft was full, he added, "the passengers are mounted up to the speed of lighting".
Frontier is also made as Spirit and applies $2 for a coffee, a tea, a soda or a fruit juice.
Frontier reported that passengers who take a soda or a fruit juice may import the not open chain with them, and those who take the coffee can be seen freely.
It will always distribute from water freely.
U.S. Airways tried to pay for drinks in 2008 but returned back seven months later after passengers were complained and there were no other large airline company.
The decision of Frontier to pay hand payments when passengers do not buy their ticket directly to the airline is its last effort to encourage customers to go on their website.
Airlines pay online travellers as Orbitz $10 to $25 for each sale ticket.
This encouraged all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly with them instead of addressing to a online travel agency.
However, Frontier has been far away in this area.
In September, she started offering only half thousands of customers who purchased their ticket through a online travel agency.
Mercredi, she reduced the prizes of thousands of 25% on a trip.
Thus, a Frontier trip of 1.000 miles purchased at a online travel agency would allow to win 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to select their seat at advance only if they buy their ticket directly on the Frontier site.
Frontier has a faithful customer in her city of origin, Denver, but its recreational activity and lost money.
The income decreased by 9 per cent and its flight capacity was almost 13 per cent during the first quarter, according to the financial results of her mother society, the Airways Holding Inc.
The Republic tried to restore the financing of Frontier to sell the airline.
NSA puts in question an "indoor error" not the computer pirates for its website's pane
The National Security Agency in the shadow declared that it was a bug that had caused its public site's pane for a few hours, and not hackers like some had claimed it online.
"NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight because of an internal error that has occurred during an update planned," said the NSA.gov sponsoring agency in an email statement.
The problem will be resolved tonight.
The claims that the pane was due to a distributed service denial attack [DSD] are false.
Before this night, the online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been in pane for at least 6 hours, and some users cannot always access the site.
Soon, a NSA's talking port told ABC News that the Agency's sensible internal network was not “not all” compromised.
No classified information is in danger, explained the speaking door.
At least one online hackivityist group has stated to be responsible for the NSA website's browser by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks are intended to enter a target site until the servers are overloaded and the site is shooting.
The cyber-tactic is not very sophisticated, and the attacks are not intended to enter into the system's internal network.
Another secret NSA, a time overnamed “No search Agency” was found under the fire of projectors and was strongly criticized over the last months after a revelation vague on its broad communication monitoring programmes at the national and foreign level, which is part of the secret files of the NSA flying to the Agency and distributed by the former NSA consulting, Edward Snowden.
This growing conflict around the Agency has caused many speculations that the incident of this night was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Delta-Villa now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed its gates in Montreal after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that had the building sold it to promotors that will transform it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Among them, 200 have not always found new jobs.
Delta promises not let his employees fall.
Employees have come to meet employees directly on place, individually met employees to assess their needs.
"This support will continue for the next six months," explains the regional director of the Delta Hotels, Felix Bisson.
Delta closes in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that was owner of this building had choices to do.
If it was re-invested in the building to continue to operate it, there were tens of millions of investments while competition is very feasible, there are many new hotels that appeared in Montreal.
"Ow he sold it to someone else and that's what happened," explains Paul Arsenault, title of the Transit Tourism Chair at the University of Scientific Management of UQAM.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the next months, as Crown Plaza, which will become a residence for older people.
In the meantime, four hotel projects over 600 rooms will see this day two years.
For the Titan PDG, "the Goodyear Amiens' purchase project starts with zero employed"
After cutting the slogan in January for the partial reprise of the Goodyear d'Amens-Noord site, Maurice Taylor, the DG of the American pneumatician Titan, is now prepared to save 333 jobs on the 1 137 of the company.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of Productive Restructuring, had already announced it, Monday 21 October.
After turning back to the shopping project in January, you'll be back today.
You had pronounced violent attacks and insults, speaking of "some workers", which" working three hours" daily, "food" syndicates for the CGT.
We don't understand this time.
Is this to joy Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to make any joy.
Except my wife.
Mr. Montebourg, he is a charming young man who tries to save industrial jobs among the best paid jobs.
If I hurt someone with my words, I'm sorry.
But France also has a high level of tax and unemployment.
Does the truth hurt you?
Working seven hours per day when in other countries we work eight hours with disabilities in France.
In India, China and in full of other countries, there are 10 to 12 hours a day.
But I don't have any prejudices on France.
What I see, it is a plant that produces good agricultural pneumatics, has good equipment, is well situated and has spaces to expand.
Why is Titan so necessary for this plant?
Titan doesn't need to buy this plant.
But with a correct price and competent workers, this is the case to try.
What type of agreement are you expecting between the CGT and Goodyear?
If Goodyear had offered the employees a good start compensation, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now, imagine that Titan buys the fermée in Goodyear.
Since then, Titan could move machines to Poland or to any other countries of the European Union that still has its own currency.
I think Mr. Montebourg knows this.
But he wants to keep the company of friends with at least 333 well paid jobs.
Titan accepts the recruitment of some 1,200 current employees of Goodyear.
So Mr. Montebourg needs a Titan's commitment before trying to bring the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is that the CGT and Goodyear seek an agreement on start compensation for all employees.
Since then, there's no more employees in the plant.
Mr. Montebourg said you were ready to ensure these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm it?
The only number I mentioned to the Minister is 333.
I know he would like a four-year guarantee.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on start compensations.
If all employees accept them, the purchase project of the plant will start with zero employed.
How can we provide job-term guarantees when there is no longer employees on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg reaches that the CGT and Goodyear agree and that Titan purchases the plant, we have the intention of staying in Amiens-Nords over four years.
The benefit of Bombardier lowly, while delivery and aircraft commands return
Bombardier Inc, a Canadian aircraft and aircraft constructor, reported a decline of 15% of his net benefit on Thursday, under pressure of a decline of the commands and delivery of aircraft during the third quarter and contracting problems in its Trains division.
Bombardier, based on Montreal, has no flight test data for all its new CSeries aircraft or information to know whether the aircraft will respect its ambitious calendar for commercial service before September next.
After the inaugural flight of the test flight about a month and half ago, the last was shooted only three times, and then the question was able to know whether the test phase was in good way.
The results have not been at the height of the previsions and the course of actions was 8 per cent to the Toronto Bourse.
Cameron Doerksen, an analysis in the National Financial Bank, has noted on Thursday his notation, passing from "overperformance" to "sector performance" because of the low potential of swallowing the bar during the next quarter or the next two quarters.
“By though the decrease of aircraft delivery has been largely advanced, we are really discovered by the beneficiary margin in the Transport Division” said Cameron Doerksen in a customer note.
We think that Bombardier will register new commands for its CSeries flights and as the test program will advance.
However, if no new command has been announced in the next months, we are waiting for the market to become more sceptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries Aviation family can catapulate it in the lower segment of a current market dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was deleted in March and was entered for the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of closed commands for CSeries aircraft is modest until 177. It seems that potential buyers are expecting to be tested to validate the confirmations of the company on energy efficiency and the potential of economics of the new line aircraft.
At the present time, the company registered a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments with 15 customers and operators.
Peter Beaudoin, President and Chief of the Director, is convinced that Bombardier will reach its goal of 300 orders before the first aircraft's commercial service.
The leaders also confirmed the analysts and the media in Thursday, indicating that the programme was advanced in accordance with the calendar.
“The test air was not remained on the ground as long as planned,” said Mr. Beaudoin at a telephone conference, adding that the air tests and software updates were planned during the time of stopping the air.
Each constructor plans differently.
We decided to process first flights and to preserve an update period, and that's what we did.
This will be reproduced throughout the flight programme.
The second of the five test aircrafts should take place in the coming weeks, the other will follow a few days later, stated the company.
However, analysts are sceptics about the fact that the first customer can fly a CSeries aircraft only 12 months after his inaugural flight.
Bombardier said that it was in evaluation of the income calendar and will provide new information during the next months.

Five years ago, my father was out of the world of living.
At the beginning I hated his death, I talked about him now,
I was so afraid of forgetting or instead I didn't know how I was going to continue to "frequencing".
There is no receipt, a job mode to pass the invisible wall and find them.
Then the signs appeared.
The first time it was the very strong feeling of his presence on the passenger seat while I conducted.
Another time, a slight wake up full night to watch his watch that doesn't leave me, put on the night table.
That's the image of my sorcer father, who joins me in my daily gest.
Our mother left us after his exciting battle against cancer.
It's at least what I thought on the day when I found his empty body, crying on this hospital bed to frozen draps.
Similarly, his funerals were a focalized glass audience around the slight light of the chandels that shocked his shock.
I thought she was gone.
Unfortunately, by small daily or night appearances, a little tired, a little disappointed, she is rapidly returned into my mind, evolving in the flight and as she returned its place in the landscape of my thinking that believed in deluge.
And then she turned away from my own faces that I had not yet seen, massed by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had never lost the person of my mother but just a woman I didn't really know, a woman who incarcerated this person during his stay in life.
When she died, she had perfect life and freed the person I love, and here I found her, full and full.
This distance of my life's way remains the most unexpected and the most beautiful.
It's a privilege to know that loved people never leave us.
I look like my father, "to the door like outside" he seemed to be.
We always told me.
I never believed it at the time.
I had difficult relationships with him until he becomes old, sick.
There, I didn't worry about him anymore and I could love him.
One day, he's dead.
For a long time, he reached me: when I stopped smoking, when I was afraid, when I was worried...
He talked to me, was constantly encouraging me, and he lived in my body.
I saw his hands looking at my hands, and I prepared my body to him.
But it was never undiscrete.
I could have a personal life.
He left me my intimacy.
It's been long after one day he's gone.
Finally, it was comfortable and reasonable to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I don't know anymore who said that deceased people are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents aren't anymore, but I'm constantly feeling close to me.
Each event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always think about it, what did they say?
I'm constantly dreaming of them, maybe not all nights, but several times per week it's sure.
I am often dreaming of the last moments I have to share with them before it is too late, just there is always something that prevents me to achieve this moment.
I often wake up when it comes to me, and I feel deeply the absence of them.
Sometimes some dreams bring me to the contrary and inscribe in my history and effectively, they continue to live and share my life.
The velve of my ecographics where I had to know the sex of my baby, I smile that I wake up, feeling out of bed, my father waited for me on the palette, and he was smiling me, and I was glad that I was waiting for a little boy.
On the afternoon, I felt he had visited me in my sleep to mean that he shared me with joy with what happened to me.
Of course, this was a little boy in my snake.
I like to share this moment with him, and I'm glad to tell you that common memories living after his death.
Five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer suites.
A year ago, she was traveling with my family in Cuba.
It's the shock that his disappearing caused me at the young bacheler I was at the time.
Despite all my debts, I have done enoughly.
But she continues to influence my life, in particular in the moments where I find it difficult, or when I have to take important decisions.
Learning the Arab and interesting me in the Middle East, in order to make it a master in a great school, have not been, with the recule, an anointed choice.
In fact, I often heard her speaking Arab in my childhood, and talking about Marokko, where she lived for decades - before getting France at the time of independence.
The values she has inculked me are always present, but I am going to think how she wants me to act at a given time.
It's the same for my attitudes: I'm trying to be at the height of the generosity and the right of the spirit of those who were a believer fervent.
Now, I feel it as a daily presence, a good soul, a salvator spirit.
I see his eyes put on me.
My mother's been deceased about about nine years ago.
He died after talking to me at the phone.
I have passed through all phases: incomprehension, angry, pain, laughing alone, everywhere, in insolent places, moments incongruous.
Then the time was cut off the punishment.
It's left only the lack of this empty, that's the need for her, to trust me, to make me sure to the crowd of her sweet.
However, she's here, quietly present, she's there and looks at me.
Every morning, I see his worried eyes spend on me, I see the brains that smell his eyes, the skins around the lips that cross cigarettes, the ladders that march the front of the day of concern.
My mother had my face and she looks at me all mornings in my look.
And every morning, I turn the eyes back.
My wife and mother of my 3 children are deceived by a cancer at 43 years of age.
We still feel his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his pain bed, then a little again learned to smile, and pronounced his name is no longer but a comfort.
Well, I'm talking to him in the night's crush when the absence is too bad, she invites himself to my dreams when moral is a little reaching.
We feel behavioured and protected in the difficult times, the time recule makes us realize how she was head of orchester and we try to stay in the way she had brought us.
If a person loved you very strong, the absence can not take it from your heart and memory.
In a certain way, being loved becomes your internal energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 from the suites of a friend cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted on what he thought or what he appreciated.
I couldn't see her inhumanity and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a little boy.
If I have my convictions sometimes different from the race, I always wonder if my actions are in line with his vision of things.
I also had problems in my work for these convictions.
For me, it's impossible to go in a contrary sense, I don't worry about it and I always ask what he's going to think.
I don't know if I adopted his way to be or if I'm just like him, is it genetic?
In any case, he will always be my reference.
It was a little like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk between us.
Bref, he's here every day.
I feel his presence, and this makes me happy.
It's about thirty years that my husband was decreased at 33 years of age.
I had 28 years, and my son was six.
The great punishment that then invaded me was certainly shocked, but he's still close to me.
He's so often "boat" in my dreams so specifically, so he lives that I'm still worried to find out that it was just a dream.
On the other night, he asked me if I was fine, I said not to him, he answered me "I go" but so real that I was washed up in a shooting, angry, and I shocked the cheese lamp over all over, convinced that he was going to arrive.
I'm always living in the same house, and often, I feel observed and I'm back to see if he's not here, I know that it's him and I'm talking to him.
I feel his presence in all parts, and that makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I wouldn't leave this house where we were happy, or his spirit lives with me.
I've been 58 years old, I've always lived alone since his start, he's and will remain the love of my life.
I want to clarify that I'm so-called with a responsibilities, I smell and sing, I'm a grandmother, I'm full of friends, but my heart and my soul belong to him and I never talk to him except with my son, and I will never go to the cemetery.

The cocaine lawyer who informed an drug parrain of a police investigation was imprisoned
Basharat Dita, 42 years old, gave information to Mr. Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret addiction to drugs was not revealed in the great day
He was sentenced to three years of imprisonment by the Liverpool Court of Assis
A large defence lawyer, who had informed a major police investigation parrain, was feared that his secret addiction to the drug was not recovered, was sentenced for three years of prison.
Basharat Dita, 42 years old, gave sensitive information to the sister of the Crime Neil Scarbrough on investigations on his activities related to drug trafficking after being compromised because of his cost of consumption of cocaine.
The lawyer, who was renamed Bash and considered by criminals as a "first importance dossier", was arrested at him in 2011 after police listening operations to Scarborough, which he had represented at a previous procedure in relation to drug trafficking.
Police officers returned Sarborwo, 32 years old, when they put three cocaine sacks in the house of the lawyer in Beijing, in the Lancashire, while he attended a dinner from the Barreau with her brothers.
The surveys revealed that it was a “regular consumer” of this class A drug after tests showed cocaine tracks in his hair, on his portal and credit cards.
During a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain illegal information on the arrest of two men for the Scarborough account, as well as one of his partners.
The four suspects were monitored at the time by the police in the context of an important investigation on the trafficking of heroin and cocaine are carried out in the containers of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
With 32 other men, they were later prisoned after the police got heroin and cocaine for an amount of 1,5 £, and more than 2000,000 £ in species during a series of roots.
Dita, 42 years old, provides information to criminals because he was afraid that his toxicomania was not revealed in great day.
Today, at the Court of Assistants of Liverpool, Dita, who works in the Forbes Solicitors Office in February, has been disgraced after being accused of two guests of infringement in justice after a three-week prosecution.
He acknowledged the ownership of cocaine during a previous hearing.
The lawyer's disappearance occurred after the police, investigating Scarborough, found that he had been regularly in telephone contact with Dita in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and repeated it to the ditta house and put the drugs, pursuant to 60 per cent, under the lawyer's poor in a black golf win.
Shortly after the deposite, Scarborough was regularly contacted with the phone with Dita who was at a dinner at Ewood Park's footstad, pregnant of the University Rovers club.
The lawyer returned to his home, discovered the drug and telephoned in nine times.
The court heard that it was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after tests showed traces of this class A drug in his hair, on his portal and credit cards.
He was arrested later but refused to consume cocaine. He said he had spoken to the presumed drug trafficker because he was his customer and said that their discussions were subject to a “just privacy”.
During his arrest, Dita assembled his portfolio and tried to remove several credit cards, but all of them were inverted and predicted a sample of hair.
When a questionnaire, he stated that he had a office at his home, as well as at his place of work and that customers were called for legal matters.
But the court heard witnesses that he called major drug trade actors, some of whom he had represented, after key arrests for them to tell what the investigators had known.
The Prosecutor Anne Whyte said, “If someone must know that the law is not to be violated, it's a criminal lawyer.”
Mr. Dita is accused of having abuse of his position as a criminal lawyer, and of being too involved in particular customers.
The relationship we speak is not just a drug trafficker, but a drug trafficker that provides drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will certainly be the legal communication because it was his lawyer.
But this went well beyond the regular limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his customer.
He interrupted the police investigation as far as he could allow him to continue its criminal activities.
Mr. Dita did not honor his professional, but he dishonored it.
He was too close to some customers, in particular Scarborough, and left to compromise his independence.
Sayta refused any illicit act and said, "If I was a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I wouldn't have waited for 15 hours, I would have done it immediately."
But after the hearing, the supervisor Lee Halstead of the Lancashire police said, “M. Dita has been a criminal lawyer for himself because he began to employ drugs with criminal organizations.”
His addition to the cocaine has always undertaken it and made it vulnerable to the backwards of the leaders of the organized criminal groups who were responsibilities to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
The lawyers should observe the most strict integrity rules and establish a climate of trust in the public.
Mr. Dita tragic this confidence and tried to open up behind his profession.
Lancashire's serious and organized crime unit conducted the investigation on Mr. Dita, who was accused of the three heads of charge of cocaine ownership and now to engage in justice, witnessing his commitment to continue criminals in justice.
That this case serves for a warning to criminals to know that no one is above the law.
We'll find you and we'll translate you before the courts.
Scarborough himself was prisoned for 14 years after being sentenced to the committee of heroin trafficking, cocaine and cannabis.
30.5 persons involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years of prison for drug trafficking.
On his site, Dita organized a meeting of questions/responses on himself during which he said that his dream job would be a lawyer for representing customers in the death couloir in America, his last invitation to dinner would be Mohammed Ali and the inequality would be what would motivate him to work.

New Collective Appeal Requirements against Saint-Croix Brothers
A new request for collective appeal was made against the Saint-Croix brothers, with regard to sexual aggressions that would be moved this time to the Holy-Joseph orphan, as well as in several orphans, colleagues and schools.
The request was supported on the testimony of the applicant, identified as "J.J.", which had been masturbed in the 1950s, first in Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his professor, Brother Sumis, then by his condemnant, the father Bernard, at the Hour of Saint-Joseph, where he was serving as a messe and where his father worked as a penner.
The first appeal was only three institutions, and when the regulation was announced, many people said to us: "I was there, can I enter me?", tells the lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in the two remedies.
The collective remedies that have been dismissed in particular have to allow the use of punishers of any establishment where drought could be pursued by members of the congregation of Saint-Croix.
At the current time, the appeal gathered the complaints of 25 persons who claimed to have been attacked by the Saint-Croix brothers.
The delegated facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first resource, since many of the entities referred to have closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also stressed that the congregation of Saint-Croix and the hour of Saint-Joseph, which is a separate entity, "they allowed sexual strikes to be perpetrated against children," that they "exercised a moral, religious and psychological strictness on victims" that they were "the knowledge of the perpetrated sexual slaughters and, however, struck them", and that they have "disciplinally and consciously chosen to ignorate the questional."
These last charges are based on letters written by the lawyer of Sainte-Croix Brothers, Me Emile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also by the investigations made in the archives on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, an elderly brother of Sainte-Croix, who publicly condemned the illnesses.
The collective remedies should first be passed to the stage of receibility in the Supreme Court.
Once the Court's admissibility has been granted, the second step is carried out, or the subsequent audits.
In the case of the first appeal, the congregation of Saint-Croix had accepted to resolve the friend before the audits were carried out.

Many opposition to medical assistance to die at the Palilian care congress
The Canadian Congress of Palliative Care, which has been launched this week in Ottawa, occurs a few days after the vote on the principle of the draft legislation on medical assistance to die in Quebec.
It is the opportunity for several Palilian care associations to reaffirm their dealing.
If all sicks had access to effective care to the elimination of their suffering, in addition to their ability to stay at home, very few of them would like to end up in their days, according to a chair door from the Canadian Association of Palliative Care, Maryse Bouvette.
If it was highlighted on palliative care in Canada, the approach of euthanasie would be minimum.
The Chairman of the Palilian Health Network of Quebec also rejected the draft medical assistance law.
If it is adopted, Alberte Dery is concerned about the consequences of the next generations.
"This is the sense of life," she regrets.
The majority of palliative care houses will refuse to help patients to die, according to the Vice-President of the Palliative Care Houses Alliance, Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of the Matthieu-Froment-Savore house in Gatineau, believes that the service would be inutile.
We never ask us, "I want to die, give me a injection."
The Director of the Ontario Palelian Care Association, Rick Firth, believes that the Québec Act Project denied the population with regard to the vocation of palliative care.
He doesn't believe that the Ontario's going out.
On the other hand, the liberal deputy of Gatineau, Stephanie Vallé, claims that the concept of the end of life must be clarified before the draft legislation is adopted.
The Chinese press is circumstance of the controversial media law
“It is an encouraging country and it is legitimate to put the following question: would Parliament prevent the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?” said the newspaper by contesting the draft legislation and demanding that it is unconstitutional.
"This law is dramatic and very punishable, and we refuse it," explained Cyrus Kamau, Director-General of Capital Group – CapitalFM's owner, one of the most independent radio stations and websites in Kenya.
He stated that the new Medium Court will “will be partially because it is a long-term government” and that the restrictions on content and advertising would weaken to Kenya's place in the world economy.
"I hope that the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this draft law and send it to the parliamentary," he added.
According to the newspaper The Star, the new law project will enable the Government to have “the media's maintenance.” The Standard stated to him that the democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya“ had taken a hard cut ” and endorsed the law project that qualified the “dragonian”.
The adoption of the draft law takes place at the same time as a train of measures to strengthen national security in the slaughter of the attack by armed Islamics in the Westgate Trade Center in September last.
The Chinese media raised the angry of the authorities by spread images of video monitoring cameras on which armed armies were deployed on the scene of the attack, with the luxury trade center.
The police chief David Kimaiyo reacted by convoking two journalists and one of the media responsible for interviewing them, although the convocation has been removed from a ride of the media.
In accordance with the new law project, media may be passable to 20 million Chinese shills and journalists to 1 million with the additional risk of being radioized or not received by official printing.
The Court also has the power to enter the goods of a contravenant if it has not paid its amendment.
According to Daily Nation, “a single amendment is sufficient to paralyse most FM stations. ”
He also said that the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as the "animated blogsphere" of Kenya.
Reducing the media in silence, political men know that they can do what they want in any impunity.
"No one will ever know", wrote Mutuma Mathhiu, journalist in The Nation, describeing the Chinese media as a key source of control in public life.
“Freeting to themselves, the political men would put the country in faillite and bring us to chase and college.”
The Chinese legislators were the target of the angry of the population in the past.
In May, they took place against the cuts ordered by the National Commission for Sales and rebuilding their milk payments of approximately 532.000 shills per month exonenated tax – which are among the highest worlds.

As a result of several departures to retreat, maternity or short departments, the pharmaceutical department was strongly deficit in staff.
He missed about 30 per cent of the necessary effects, making this “extremely difficult” financial year, according to the head of the Department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS decided not to employ independent work, which can cost up to three times more cost than a pharmaceutical forced full-time pharmaceutical.
We didn't have any remedies for the dispatch, Mrs. Beaudet explained.
Some of our activities were racionalized or decreased within the parliamental establishment, the time that things are replaced.
It is sure that we have worked strongly to interest our young people [residents in pharmaceuticals] to come and stay here.
There is a concourse of circumstances that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After that period, the year 2013-2014 was clearly easier for the CSSS pharmaceutical department.
On the other hand, three pharmaciens are returning to work after their maternity department and three other pharmacists were built over the last months.
Furthermore, the department's efforts to retain fruit have been made, since the four students currently living in Laval have also decided to remain in the CSSS employment.
Now, it's much better, stressed the pharmacien.
From the end of the financial year, we will have seven new pharmaciens and three maternity returns.
This will therefore be covered by our departures in the past year.
Beliefs always grown
However, the situation remains delicate.
several factors, such as hospital pharmaciens or predominance of young women in the household, make situations such as difficult to prevail in 2012.
For us [the number of effects] is always precaution, because we have a youth environment that is young and employed by many young women, so with pregnancy, we are almost always rolled to three maternity conges when it's okay, has added.
Last year, we had much more and no pharmaciens are available to make replacements, so it was more difficult.
The top 22-year-old model does not begin his cart on the cinema by the small door.
Lars van Trier chose it to incarnate Charlotte Gainsburg young in Nymphomaniac, his next film.
This Egyptian pornographic dragon, in eight chapters, will come out in two sides (the 1th and 8th January 2014), the erotic memories of an increased gender framework since its adolescence.
The likeness of Stacy Martin with his old age is shocked: a brindille silhouette, a ten diaphan and French-English origin.
Unless you forget a certain risk enjoyment: the one who hadn't been able to put noise on the glass paper will be shown in more surfurous situations on large screen.
A extrait of Nymphomaniac made up the temperature on the Toile: Stacy Martin appears in the bed and in full expansion with Shia LaBeouf.
If the producer asked his actors to put them up on the platcard, he had called for professionals of X for the most shocked sex scenes before fusioning all the body digitally: above the ceinture, it is the star; below, the dublure.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsburg, by passing by Nicole Kidman, Lars van Trier, used to put his actors in their latest resets, always for the best.
Stacy Martin hasn't finished talking about her.
A Narbonne CGR room evacuated Thursday night
On Thursday night, the first film meeting was interrupted at the Narbonne CGR Mega, with caution, after sighting shocked by the spectators.
In the meantime, the director of the establishment processed the evacuation of the room and prevented the pomps for a suspected odor.
About 70 people have been out of the meeting.
Persons have been reviewed and a full recognition of the room has not been given.
Small beauty on the background of lacrymogen jet?
Or involuntary incident?
It is always that the direction of the cinema has played the precaution and security of its clients.
The room was availed and everything came back to the order.
The film has been able to restore its rights and customers to find the enjoyment of images.
Only on the screen.
It tries to import 2 kg of cocaine in citrus
On the day of the Halloween, a woman tried to enter the country two pounds of cocaine dismissed in cyclings on Thursday morning at Montreal-Trudeau airport.
It is during the review of passenger bags that drugs could have been detected.
Cocaine was divided in three cytroleles previously lived.
The drug was then transferred to the Office of the Kingdom Gendarmery of Canada (GRC), which took the rest in this investigation.
The Canadian Border Services Agency (ASFC) has not revealed where the woman arrived when she was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, reported Jacqueline Roby, the ASFC's talking port.
What I can tell you is she came to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border services agents at Montreal-Trudeau Airport have conducted 173 drug income, 10 cocaine income for a total of 44 kg.
In 2012, border services officers in the Quebec region conducted a total of 1653 drugs income.
Aircraft against military installations in Syria
According to the Libanon Army, Israeli aircraft was entered in the Lebanese airspace at the beginning of midday, but the shocks took place in the evening.
A short-term air loading SA-8 would have been targeted and destroyed.
This new root of the Tsahal aircraft in Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz) was not confirmed by Israel or Syria.
The radius was launched in low-scale circumstances to those who had occurred on July 5th: at the time, it was also an anonymous American responsible who confirmed a Israeli attack in the CNN, which was able to spend this time by Russia to Damass.
The Israeli responsibilities did not hide their irritation to see Washington reveling the attack, at the risk that President Assad might react.
Ukraine approaches the failite
The Standard & Poor's Rating Agency has been able to sell Ukrainian solvency note, with doubt of the capacity of the former Soviet Republic, in recession for more than one year, to address its financial obligations.
The note of public debt titles of the country is "B-", which focused on the special investment category.
It is assured by a negative perspective, S&P seeing at least a chance on three if it is re-absented from this year.
"It is less likely that the Government's strategy allows sufficient foreign funds to address its high external funding needs", explains the American Agency.
The Agency notes that the changes reserves in Ukraine have decreased 26 per cent from September 2012 to September 2013 and that trend will continue.
This complies with the reimbursement of foreign credits.
These reserves, in which the authorities have granted a major remedie to support local currency, Hryvnia, expenditure, the Agency is more likely to be assessed, which would deal with its external debt.
Kiev also needs liquidity to resolve its gas imports in Russia, which accused it of not paying an account of $882 million.
This advertising is a bad news for the Ukrainian power in a lifetime of tensions with its Russian neighbourhood, furious of the will of Kiev to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was public in the following day of the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had fallen between July and September on the fifth quarter of its contract.
His final end, still relatively modest, has explosed the last few years and S&P estimated 33.5% of GDP, against less than 10% before the crisis 2008-2009.
The country, as a budget deficit, has been claimed for months to assist the International Monetary Fund, which had granted it in 2010 a $15.3 billion, and has not been disbloked for the moment only 3.4 billion.
However, the Fund refuses to pay any new trading as long as the country will not adopt impunity reforms to reduce its deficit, including by increased gas prices to the population.
In the outcome of a new infructuous mission in the country, the IMF realized this week that "the important needs in external funding" were "unvulnerability", as well as "the signs of economic improvement".
However, for the economist Oleksandr Joloud, from the Political Education Center, "we cannot wait for a short-term improvement."
"There is little hope that impopulary reforms are launched in a pre-electoral year", the presidential elections are planned in 2015, reports the expert, interviewed with the AFP.
The only hope is a improvement in international conjunction.
S&P also refers to the "incertitude" linked to the possible signing of a association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which has been provided by Brussels to the release of the opponent Ioulia Timochenko.
"Subscribe the agreement would be positive for long-term trade, but it could have short and medium-term negative consequences related to Russia's response," explained S&P, who fears "commercial restrictions" from Moscow.
Russia, which represents the fourth of the Ukrainian exports, predicted that in the establishment of a free exchange area between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its border controls for imported goods.
Green fire from the United States at the Publicis-Omnicom fusion
Publicists and Omnicom said the Friday did not receive any objection from the American authorities to their fusion, so that the establishment of the first World Publicity Agency was approached.
The fusion actually approaches the second World Agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Group today announced the expiration of the previously announced fusion period of Publicis Group and Omnicom, provided by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended," announces the two groups in a communication.
They indicate that they have also received the necessary authorisations in Canada, India and Turkey after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiration of the period of review provided by the HSR to the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in other courts meet a number of conditions necessary for the realization of the operation.
"The fusion is also conditioned to obtain other regulatory authorisations and the approval of the shareholders of the two groups," they add.
The Congolean army slaughtered the M23 rebels
The Congolese Army (FARDC) announced Tuesday that its units will slaughter the M23 rebels to their bases in the North Kivu borderrophe of Rwanda and Ukraine.
The M23 appears to be struck after being defeated from the northeastern of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (RDC) which it was controlled since the beginning of 20 months ago.
"We're going to continue the M23 and we'll cover it all around where it's hiding because it's criminals," he said to Reuters, Colonel Olivier Hamuli, FARDC's parliamentary.
We must not let them reorganize because they martyrize the congolean people for too long.
The time came to bring peace back.
M23's responsibilities have explained the places under the diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, rebellion political responsibility, stated that those military rebellies wouldn't change their returns to peace talkers.
These recently, according to the ungarn mediators, have again been marched in Kampala between the Kinshasa government and M23.
Accommodations are reported in the collines that dominist Bunagana, the last place in the hands of the insurers to be slaughtered this week, as well as in the neighbors of Runyoni, a colline where M23 rebellion saw in 2012.
In November, the insurances occupied Goma, head of the North Kivu province, benefiting from the escape of the government garnison and the passiveness of the blue ships of Monusco.
The fall of Goma has brought the United Nations Unit Mission, the most important to the world in terms of effectiveness, strengthening its mandate and forming a rapid intervention bride composed of South African, Maleaid and Tansania soldiers.
On his side, the main state of the FARDC was remaned, and the army was passed to the rebellion against M23, making changes in the course of war.
The rythm of progress of the government troops is today without previously existing.
"M23 seems to touch its end," a congolean business experts, Jason Stearns, predicted on his blog Congo Siasa.
It would be historical - it would be the first time that Kinshasa's government succeeded in fighting a major insurrection.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group in Rwanda would be present in the east of the RDC.
United Nations experts accused Rwanda, who fairly noted it, of militaryly supporting M23, which was formed at the department of former congolean military soldiers.
The chief of the British diplomacy, William Hague, invited the Ruanda President Paul Kagame to make evidence of retention, announced a foreign port.
Last week, Kigali had argued the possibility of military repairs after the bus slaughtered in Ruanda.
Mercredi, Bunagana's inhabitants invade the bourgade streets to welcome the entry of the FARDC soldiers.
"We lived a year with the M23 and it seemed to be a day freed by the army," said a people of this limited location in Uganda.
"We lived in the terrific (the M23), we are traumated," added this man.
The Pasteur Institute's tests on a suspected patient to be infected by the coronavirus were negative, announced the Ministry of Health.
He states that "the two cases identified in May 2013 remain the only two cases confirmed in France today."
Thursday, this 43-year-old patient had been suspected of being reached, after being returned from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already produced 50 deaths.
Chevron, the second American oil company, made a decrease of the trimestrial benefits because of the decrease of its raffinage margins, while its production of oil and gas has increased by remaining in relation to the group's goals.
His net benefit of the third quarter has reduced $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per action, against $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per action, a previous year.
Reuters' analysts interviewed with a benefit of $2.71.
The group has produced 2.59 million oil equivalent bars per day during the quarter, increased by 2.52 million bpj products a year ago.
The company is 2.65 million bpj for this year, with an increase of 25% of the production expected from 2017.
The major part of growth in the coming years will come from its liquidated natural gas projects in Australia.
As a result of the cost of these projects, annual investment expenditures increased by $7 billion in two years and should be reached by $36.7 billion in 2013.
The benefits of production activities have slightly reduced the third quarter, while the benefits of stainless activities (from refinance and chemical production) increased from 45 to 380 million dollars.
This decrease of raffining margins touchs the whole sector.
Thus, the main competitor of Chevron, Exxon Mobil, made a net benefit, despite the increase in its production of gas and oil.
School transport: receiving appeal
The School Commission of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) requires from the beginning of the school year of $ 150 for students (a maximum of $300 per family) for students who benefit from school transport to two residents, a service that the organization provides when it is able to do it.
Before the changes made to the last budget, no financial contribution was claimed.
" There is a mediation service that is proposed by the Committee and I was interested," she explained.
According to it, CSRS was invited to a mediation and requested additional time for consideration.
"It's always better talking about it, concerting and finding solutions," Mrs. Lefèvre believes.
The School Commission of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) did not want to comment.
The organization only means that mediation is part of the process during a complaint.
Amberglio around the closet of the hotel-Deu urgences
The fraud carried out for several months by a part of staff and several trade unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, decided on 10 July to "develop the calendar for the implementation of the project, and in particular the date of urgence closer that will not be able to intervene on 4 November".
An officially requested "to run no risks on emergency support in Paris at the beginning of winter" but was also intended to not spend the PS campaign for a few months in the municipalities.
Despite ministerial consignments, the closure should also be effective at that date.
Even if A PHP prefers the term "transformation" or "changing in continuity".
From 4 November, pompiers who were assured about 400,000 annual passengers at the emergency of the Hotel-Gou will all be received to make the 30th cases a day to the emergency of other Paris hospitals.
This date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewal of internates.
In Hotel-Deu, the urgency specialized internals will take place on Monday five general physicians.
With regard to the transfer of internal medical beds, it is programmed for the current month.
"The Emergency Service of Hotel-Deu's Emergencys must close in the shortest time, and for us, it is 4 November," ensures, without delay, Loïc Capron, the President of the PHP Medical Committee (CME), who supports the project of direction.
"On 4 November, there will be no more patients brought by pompiers, only those who come from their own means, " confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical director of the new Hotel-Deu.
"But we will continue to join patients at an emergency level ", heavyly, causing the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on place to transfer serious cases.
Higher urgency doctors will remain on place, and it will also be able to ensure.
But it belongs to the ARS to decide the closure of the emergency accommodation service.
"The things are progressively done," Nicolas Péju answered, the ARS's portal for which, on November 4th, " there will not be changes in terms of service made."
"The Minister has lied to us or we lied to him," the urgent doctor Gerald Kierzek regrets.
Once in July, his head officer of SMUR for having conducted the frode against the reorganization project, it is defined as a "a warning starter" against a "cynical" decision taken by "the medical-administrative technologie."
"They are in leafy and asphysicians that have been renewed less than five years ago," he estimates.
For him, "If the other Paris emergency services could absorpte the overwhelming, there was no problem".
Or they are regularly engraved.
For example, there are also nine hours of waiting at Lariboisière emergency.
At the ARS, 30 "dispatched" patients on several sites are not able to represent a "valanca" in other emergency services, which will also be strengthened by human means.
As in the PHP, the "new hospital model" is defended since October 7 and should continue to welcome 30 000 to 35 000 patients per year.
From the end of the year, liberalist general doctors should also participate in the establishment of an "ambulance care persistent".
"When are we going to ask people to diagnose self-diagnosis?" questions Gérald Kierzek for which "the concept of emergency is harmful" and marks a "medic regression".
It's going to be like for level 3 maternities.
People are not crazy, they're going to go where the best care offer is.
If the minister does not take this Monday, we're going to change brakes, Christophe Prudman, urgency doctor and members of the CGT Health.
We will be more present in the municipal campaign and we will consider a list.
In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, advised UMP of Paris and elected from the fourth rounding, clearly announces that "if the Parisian UMP was for the maintenance of emergency at the Hotel-Deu, this would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if the responsibilities were returned."
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, re-membered on Monday, on France, was pronounced for a moratorium so that there was no closure on November 4th.
If that was the case, she would mark its net deal, emphasize Bruno Julliard, her talking door.
Even though the restructuring of the Hotel-Deu has its legitimacy on the ground, we cannot accept it without an acceptable report scheme to other hospitals.
Obama ends the hearing of the IMF and the World Bank
Barack Obama ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to finish its hearing on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in the context of its information activities, indicated a US responsible, Thursday.
This decision is part of the trial of the White House to re-elect the NSA's listening case after the revelations made by the former analyst Edward Snowden, refugee in Russia.
It is the first time that the oversight of the IMF and the World Bank is mentioned by the Agency for Information since the beginning of the scandale.
Question on the subject, a responsibly of the United States Administration answered: "The United States do not take electronic supervision for the World Bank and the IMF seats to Washington."
Expressed under the box of the anonymat, the supervisor did not specify whether such monitoring was established by the past.
Another official stated that Barack Obama had ordered to stop these practices during the past weeks.
This instruction was provided nearly at the same time as that which ends to the hearing of the General District of One in New York.
In this context, the Senate Commission of Information adopted on Thursday a strengthening of controls on government supervisory programmes but allowed them to continue.
The Committee has established new restrictions on data authorized to collect and imposed a limite of five years for the conservation of these information.
United Nations welcomes the new goals to combat poverty
The United Nations will now work on a new series of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (OMD), which had been established 12 years ago to combat poverty in the world.
Australian diplomates have played a key role in improving the " sustainable development goals" to replace WHOs, which will expire in 2015 before the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development, which began the older in Rio de Janeiro.
They contained in the final draft document, which will be adopted by the world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the sum.
The Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon said that it was now time to “exceive national interests”.
“I am glad that Member States have accepted the process to set up universal sustainable development goals,” he added.
These WHO will support progress made in the Millennium Development Goals and be part of the post-2015 Development Framework.
I will do the maximum to achieve the mandate that Member States have been given to me to achieve our vision of the objectives of sustainable development that support the success of the WHO.
The security concern in Mozambique grows at the same time as conflicts are struck between powerful personalities
At the foot of the Samora Machel Statue, Mozambique's founder Chairman, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to scanne peaceful slogans in a rare public manifestation.
“We want peace to return; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, director-General of an investment company.
She was concerned about the future of her country, and she changed its working clothes against a tee-shirt, which mentions “We want security” in Portugal before reaching the massive people on the place of the Jeudi capital Independence.
During two weeks we were almost every day of the reports of conflict between government forces and Renamo, the worst increased since the peace agreement that has been signed over 20 years ago.
Renamo was then a famous rebellious movement, supported by the Rhodesia ruled by white people, and the Government of South Africa in the context of efforts to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became a party of opposition.
Analysts believe that the country should not be able to turn into an open conflict, but recent events have broken foreign investors and local populations.
The project is significant for the full growth economy, since the discovery of huge offshore gas and carbon gas reserves in the Northwest could affect more than $50 million of investments in the coming years, such as Rio Tinto, Brazil Vale, Eni of Italy and Anadarko in the United States.
Frelimo, the party to power and the main political force since 1975, and Renamo is mutually rejected the responsibility of tension.
Renamo states that the government is originating recently faces and that it has launched a attack against its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional base of Renamo, on October 17.
The murders on the old rebellious rebellious were then degenerated when the government forces attacked Renamo's bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, the Renamo's talking port, according to the Financial Times.
The Government is responsible for the deployment of conflicts, and it is accused of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza tried to minimise the instability concerns.
Mr. Guebuza said Monday to AFP, the French Press Agency, that Mr. Dhlakama would be a "perdidor" who wanted to use "all the forces he remained to try to prove that he could put his decisions to the Government".
Frelimo and Renamo insist to say they both want to avoid war.
But the concern was great after Mr. Mazanga said that Renamo abandoned the peace agreement in 1992.
He said to the FT that he wanted to say that the agreement was no longer respected by the Frelimo.
“We want to take the negotiations again, but with the most serious one” said Mr. Mazanga.
The previous discussions among the parties have not been able to eliminate the tensions provided by a series of conflicts this year.
"There are two great men (Gubuza and Dhlakama) who are not stopping to discuss", explained Joseph Hanlon, a congressor of the open and specialist university of Mozambique.
No one knows to negotiate and no of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who was favorable to electoral reforms, had already said that it would shoot the municipal elections to be held in November.
The presidential and legislative elections are planned next year.
Some comments interpreted the use of the force as the attempt of a sick movement to obtain concessions and a war treasurer from the government.
The part of the suffrages collected by Renamo has stopped declining since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) which was created by an elderly Renamo member, should be obtained more demands for elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza, who should take place at the end of his second mandate in the next year, wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He doesn't want a multipartite democracy, does not want transparent elections, no peace, because he doesn't want to leave the Presidency," said Mr. Mazanga.
Renamo's capacity was not exactly aware, but it has led to a tragic attack on the police committees and vehicles on a major North-South axis.
Most accommodations took place in Sofala province, which is situated in hundreds of miles north of Maputo, but where Beira is the port of mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export carbon.
In June, Rio couldn't use the iron road for about one week after the Renamo threatened to attack the rail line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely scared when we asked if Renamo would react this threat.
Renamo wanted to “advertise the international community that things do not go well to Mozambique” said Mr. Mazanga.
Instability has strengthened the frustrations that the Government has caused, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media society, and many are also concerned about corruption, development lenses, and the recent vague inductions.
“The people believe that the government and the President are responsible for the future of the country, and that it is to find solutions to the problem,” he explained.
Omar Suluana, a demonstrator, said that people only want to want stability.
“No one is concerned about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to restore peace, they want to have free access to roads” he added.
It should be taught for the myths and legends to children like “the models of life,” says the author.
Thor's Legend could show that “the brutal force does not face the subtle Russian weight” while artric legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many mythes would be “too violent, too scandaleous, and in some cases, too obscene to be taught at school”, Crossley-Holland predicted an "minute selection" of works adapted to age.
“I'm incredible that in America, myths and folklore already are part of education” said he.
I enjoy this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that the authors and teachers are “openly doctic” because children ‘decreased completely’, the messages are “sub-limited” in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the English-saxon and wrote The Penuin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: “You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of view.”
Maybe the great difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an adult author who writes for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or ended well, but there is an innocent sense of good and bad.
And it must be underlying ; revealed through a story instead of declared.
The basis is known about what we're shown and that it's not said.
One fighter of the Hamas Armed branch was killed tonight and another blessed by a Israeli shooter in the Gaza flag, learned from medical and safe sources in Gaza.
According to these sources, these activists conducted a supervisory operation between the Palestinian territory and Israel when they were employed by an Israeli blind.
NSA Spinning: United States are "too far," adjoined Kerry
The United States have sometimes been "trop far" in sponsoring, acknowledged the secretariat of the State John Kerry, in the first pollegion of Washington with Europe on the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After 10 days of scandale, revelations and dismisses between the United States and their European partners, it is the first time that an American government responsible has explicitly accepted practices in the interception of the NSA of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I conceive you, as the President did, some of these actions have been too far and we're going to make sure that this happens to the future," said John Kerry at a conference in London on Thursday 31 October by video connection.
In his intervention, in the presence of its British homolog William Hague, the Chief of the United States diplomacy longly justified the practices of information and collection of information through the necessary anti-terrorism fight and prevention against events attacks.
Inviting the attacks of 11 September 2001, Madrid attacks in March 2004 and London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the United States authorities have already spent many expectations projects through the interruption of communications and the collection of information.
"We have in fact prevented aircrafts from falling, that buildings are not explosed and that people were killed because we were able to be able to be aware of these projects," said the American diplomacy manager.
And John Kerry said to the Europeans: "I assure you that in this process of innocent people have not been inflicted."
But we are trying to assemble information.
"And in some cases, it's been too far away in a reasonable way," the State Secretariat, who had already had to express on this international scandale in a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He assured that President Obama was “resolutely to try to clarify and to review these practices so that no one feels wrong”.
But the debate between Americans and Europeans continued to flow this week with new revelations in the press.
According to Washington Post, NSA intercepted hundreds of millions of Google users and Yahoo.
The journal, which quotes documents received at the former NSA Edward Snowden's NSA adviser, claims that the baptized "MUSCULAR" program and conducted with the British NSA Homolog, GCHQ, allows these two agencies to recover data from the optical fibres used by the internet geniers.
In view of one of the documents, some 181 million elements had been collected within the last month of January - methaned on emails, text elements or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would be held outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google denied any connection with these practices.
Since ten days, several large newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy have shown that NSA had intercepted massively the data and communications from the United States and their leaders, including the German chanceler Angela Merkel.
As the angry of European states, and while flights in the American press claimed that the American President was not known for such hearings, Barack Obama refused to express himself on this subject, calling for national security.
On the contrary, General Keith Alexander's patron of the powerful NSA, claimed that his information agency had captured tens of millions of European citizens' communications.
He even sent the ball to European information services that would be introduced from these communications before providing them to the NSA.
This would refer to "military operations" in countries where those State partners co-operate with the United States, and that would not absolutely be seen in Europe, said General Alexander.
And the polemic was extended to Asia, Wednesday.
Indonesia called the Ambassador of Australia, whose mission was accused of being used by the Americans in the context of a wide international spionage network that also caused China's point.
The Paris Saint-Germain receives Lorient without its outstanding master, the Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is blessed, announces the Ligue 1 club in a communication.
The PSG, leader of the Championship before Monaco on the different goals, has spread the list of players held for this 12th match without having 32 years of attack.
The Communicator simply indicates that it is "trained", without clarifying the nature of the wound.
However, he suffered from an inflamation of the left geno in his selection return, at the beginning of the month.
A Ceremony in Memory of Cremated Defunts
The crematorium of Father Lachaise organizes at 11 a.m. a laic ceremony, in memory of all creating defunts in its establishment during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate in Paris, must be attended, and will then explain, at the press conference, his proposals on funeral.
To follow the ceremony, click up.
For their own obsessive obsession, more French people choose creation, instead of inhuming: 53%, according to an Ipsos study carried out on 6 and 7 September at 1009 people instead of 47%.
For the obsessions of a nearby, it is the inverse: the French prefers inhumation (53 per cent against 47%).
If they have the difficulty to lose a child, they're only 15% to choose creation.
In his book La Mort in Cendres, Damien Le Guay, Vice-President of the National Ethics Committee, stresses the "violence" that is the creation, for survivors.
There is, with the creation, "a violence made to the loved body", which will be "reduced to a lot of crowds" in very little time, and not after a decomposition process, which would "comply the phases of decomposition".
There is also "a symbolic violence", which aims at "except of individuality and distinct signs" reduced to the "anonymat" of the cedars.
Why is what is accepted without punishment in some northern and protesting countries still badly living in France?
"For creation is a new fact," Mary-Fredéric Bacqué, Chairman of the Companion of Voratology and author of the book Apprehend the death.
It is not tolerated since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited the attempts to approve it since 1963.
Thanks to the creation, it is for François Michaud-Nerard, Director-General of the Full Services of Paris, to provide a ceremony as well as for which he had been right with inhumanity.
The annual Hipsos survey shows a strong attachment to the ceremony organization.
77% of the French people want for their neighbors to be religious (53%) or civil (24%).
Now, 73 per cent of those chosen for creation want the organization of a ceremony.
66% of the athletes or nonbelievers want it too.
Krematoriums were adapted to this development of society.
"When a decade of years they seek to avoid the violence of a expectation, without doing, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the relief of the cendres," says Mr. Michaud-Nerard.
70% of the institutions are now offering the masters of ceremony, which come, in the presence of the body, to the following ritual: welcome the assembly, calling the defunt, linking it to others, swearing it, giving sense to his death, organizing the audience.
This is the case in the creatorium of Father Lachaise since 1998.
Ceremony masters are often people who have become converted.
There are also ancient Catholic priests.
It is in that context that the Creator of Father Lachaise has organized, since 2010, the day of La Toussaint, a number of memories, laicians and non-religious ceremonys, to which he invites the families of persons who have been created in the year.
For the second consecutive year, one of these ceremonys is re-linked, taking account of those who could not make the movement.
Crematorium has allowed us to relax it.
In La Seyne, the recycling for rats turns to the polemic
In the beginning of the week, a family left his apartment in the Fructidor D2's rhythm of the Fructidor D2 building because of the presence of rats.
In the emergency of the situation, the head of the South Habitat Office proposed, in an exceptional and provisional manner, to relocate the couple and its three children in a new T4.
However, the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case took exaggerated proportions, estimated Joel Canapa, the director of the office.
rats, there's always been in the towns.
The deratization company takes two passes per year, and moreover, we are in charge, at each request of the people.
We have done so, since the end of the winter, 64 interventions.
The neighbourhood is not left to leave, and the rats do not pull in the city.
For the reasons for the protection of the environment and public health, deratization products are four times less effective than through the past, of course, but for two rats, we will not kill a boy.
"We have not sent rats to us," the family father who left his accommodation to install it in the hotel.
Soon we're without sweet and we're waiting for a new accommodation, the same tariff as the older.

Ben Greenman : New York's 16th anniversary Comedy Festival : The New Yorker
It could be said that the city of New York is the place where it was born the stand-up in America: almost 100 years ago, the Vaudeville Frank Fay actor, who took the role of master of ceremony at the theatre palace, on Broadway, began to tell shocks directly before the public, on the tone of the conversation.
Fay's innovation continued over the years, until the New York Comdy Festival was renewed recently.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up Carolines club, the famous celebration of his tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and large theatres.
“The majority of the spectrum heads exploded in Carolines, and have known a great success, until they became too famous to play in a club” said Hirsch.
We have created this festival in order to continue working with them.
The event of this year will see the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of the “State Up for Heroes”, a commodity and musical evening for old fighters, organized at Madison Square Garden, which will be present, among others, Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival took the wideness, as well as the commodity world.
several of the comedians participating in the festival of this year have been conducted by non-traditional circuits, for example, showing spectacles on small TV chains, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll showed his appearance on the front of the scene in a sitcom on a boxed chain (The League) to the theme of the fantasy football, joyfully lacif of the FXX chain, and now his own sketch spectacle on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate participated in the Saturday Night Live emission and was part of the casting series "Parks and Recreation", but she is still more known for its series of viral videos "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians to the unique voice (the superrealist pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the iranic defender of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world.
One of the main attraction factors of the festival this year will be a entertainment: David Steinberg discussed with Larry David.
Steinberg began as stand-up committee, but it has become a cinema and television realist, as well as an informal historic of the comedia.
Between 2005 and 2007, he developed a TV country emission called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
It takes place in the Ville Hotel, in the centre of Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the comic DNA of all Larry's work,” said Steinberg.
He told me that when he was here, sometimes he went down a rule between two buildings and said well, if I lose my whole money, maybe I'd come to live here.
The oil price continues to slow and approach 96$ the bar
The oil price continued to slow on Thursday, while the concerns about the importance of stocks comply with a report showing that the Chinese manufacturer in electricity is being strengthened.
The price of the US reference brute for delivery in December slowed from $14 to $96.24 the bar in the end of the morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on the New York marketing Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, which was left with a decrease of 5,8 per cent for October month.
The abundant offer of bruto oil was pesed on the price in the past weeks.
The American Energy Department indicated that the US supply has increased 4.1 million bars last week.
In five weeks, supply has increased over 25 million bars.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturer sector arrived on Thursday, which shows an increase in the activity, suggest a increase in the demand.
This suggests that China's economic reprise could continue to be recovered after growth has rebonded to 7.8 per cent to the third quarter, after a decrease that had not been known since two decades in the previous quarter.
Bruce Brent, a international reference for the international brutal raffineries already used, lost 26 cents to fall at $108.58 at the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Appeal on the right to abortion to Texas
A Federal Appeal Court re-established in Texas some restrictions to the right to voluntary breast-interruption which had been blocked by a first judge this week.
This judgment means that a legislative text adopted in July in this State and which widely entitled the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
The arrest made by the Call Court means that doctors who practice IVGs will have to have a "admission privacy" to local hospitals.
The privacy of admission is the right of a doctor, in accordance with his membership status of a hospital, to grant a patient in a hospital or medical centre to deliver a diagnosis or treatment.
Defenders of the IVG claim that the content of the law can be translated immediately by a third of the state clinics because these clinics have not been able to obtain this "admission privacy" for their practices.
In total, it would be nearly 22.000 women who would be private of access to these institutions.
On Monday, a first judge had estimated the entry into force of the law that the provisions relating to the accession privacy were anti-constitutive.
But the Officer General of Texas, the Republic of Greg Abbott, who was in charge of the Governor's position, requested the Court of Auditors to cancel the court of first instance that blocked the application of the law.
A plenary hearing on this issue is planned for the month of January.
The New Star has succeeded in force, the hearing side, with 1.3 million TVs behind their telephone post, or 5.6% of the hearing.
But was the spectacle to make you?
Some 10,000 candidates were presented to the hearings of this 10th season to address the jury: Maurane, the wicked Sinclair, the reason for André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, spectators shared their comments.
In view of the exciting finding their favorite programs, many have been deceived.
But why so much deception?
No candidate seems to have been really marked at this first prize.
Like each year, the first hearing emissions have a wide choice of herb songers, for the best and sometimes the worst.
Now, on Twitter, we want a spectacle, emotion, originality, music...
Unfortunately, some have found their account.
They're many to have tried the New Star, and sometimes even to go to the mouth.
Next television screens, success player vocations are still there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to ride.
The court blocks a decision on the NYPD control and struggle policy
A Federal Appeal Court blocked the decision of a judge requesting changes in the New York police department's control and struggle.
The Court of Appeal of the United States (second circle) stated that the decision of the judge Shira Khandlin was suspended until the sentence was taken by the city.
The judge had stated in August that the city had violated the Constitution following its implementation of its programme to control and interrogate citizens.
The city called on its conclusions and corrective orders, including a decision to allocate a supervisor to help the police department to amend its policy and training programme.
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments on the application for suspension.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge had to be dismissed from the case because it had engaged in the code of conduct of judges by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of partiality, partly because of a series of holdings granted to the media and declarations in which it reacted publicly to the critics of the Court.
The judge had stated that police officers were violating civil rights of tens of thousands of people by targeting black and Spanish men in the framework of their control and multitude programme.
She appointed an external supervisor to monitor the changes, including policy reform, training and supervision, and ordered the establishment of a pilot programme to test body cameras in the districts where the most controls are carried out.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the practice to maintain the names and addresses of persons whose case is rejected after a police control.
The hearing of the city's appeal should have been held after 14 March 2014.
The tactic of control and violence was criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This control system has been in a certain form for decades, but the number of registered controls have increased spectacularly under the administration of the independent master Michael Bloomberg, to reach its highest historical level in 2011 with 684 330 controls, which were mainly related to black and Spanish men.
An judicial action was introduced in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and was transformed into collective action.
Participants who have changes in the NYPD's control and compliance programme say they will end in unjust practices, will have more effective police forces and trusts, and can change the way the police departments use the policy.
The opposites say that these changes would minimize the moral of the police without declining criminality, represent money gaspillage, and would not resolve the most largest problem of police pressure forces after the effective police were strongly reduced during the last decade.
The judge stressed that it did not end the practices of control and struggle, which are constitutional, but that it reformed the way the NYPD implemented its controls.
Locationers must go to vote, since each of them pay average $100 per month on the price of the housing that goes in taxes to the Ville.
When the owner pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, it shares this amount between each housing.
We are obliged to increase loans to help us pay new taxes.
To vote, we will send a clear message.
We need to make things changed in the Ville.
All candidates told us that they would attack the scandaleous debt.
We don't have the way to pay us artificial fires to $1000,000, terrains from 4 to 5 million for case...
Let's vote, it's the best way to express you and say that it's enough.
Service End for the Head of the Elysée
In the 500 m2 of the Ellysian kitchen as made after working in ambassadors, the kitchen has severely all levels until it becomes a chief, nine years ago.
He served six French Presidents, from Georges Pompidou to Francescois Holland, passing by Nicolas Sarkozy, including on their vacation places, and eating an incalculable number of larges of this world in a nearly anonymat that is only today at the time of retirement at 60 years.
Man on the open face, degarni and intellectual lights, born on October 24, 1953 at the Holy-Aubin Ferity is the title of a pasture CAP.
His mother was sweet in a Sologne's castle.
"I'm passing from a castle the other!", Ironic Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the hands of the six presidents for which he officialed, but also of their wifes and some of their invited illustrations.
"It's always the head of the State or his companion or wife who chooses the menus," remembers him.
"Ms. Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly to the kitchen," as she had banned women in the Elysée kitchens!
It does not move to heads of State who showed relative indifference to earthquakes, "that are all gourmands", says Bernard Vaussion.
Jacque Chirac certainly had "un little more developed appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the hair, the seats returned empty!
With regard to François Hollande, who rebuild the skin, "It's someone who loves to eat" and "no big-chose he doesn't like".
The current head of the State, who ruled the kilos lost before the presidential campaign, has no "no specific regime application".
Bernard Vaussion also recalls the pressure that was painted on his floors, especially at the dinners of the State at the Elisée: " between 200 and 250 people in about an hour."
The previous night is almost white.
These people wouldn't understand that there are errors.
The former Chief of the Elysée kitchen, who took a drink on Wednesday night with his team, his family and friends, part of a painting in the heart."François Hollande came to welcome me."
He said elogs.
"It's the human side to smile," he says.
The chief will be replaced by his adviser, Guillaume Gomez, 35 years old, which is for his part since 10-7 years to Elisea.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec
A historical house built in 1850 was the shooting of the flames in the Old-Québec Thursday.
The building of four accommodations situated at 15 of the Hebert Street was covered by three alarms at the fire service.
The fire was declared before, but it was high on the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, speaker of the Quebec Protection Service against Firefours, explained that the rapid intervention of the bombs was allowed to avoid the propagation of flames to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this city sector where the buildings are closely built.

The damages were totally limited, even though the water has caused disasters.
An investigation will be carried out to determine the origin, but the shooters disappeared the thesis of a criminal act.

Coulson used the phone pirateage to check a tuyau
The former editor of News of the World Andy Coulson would use "the telephone piratege, monitoring and convergence" to try to confirm a bidon-related link involving the Minister of Interior then in the exercise, Charles Clarke.
The Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC declared before the Court of Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, his “sweet special adviser”.
It was reported to the court that the newspaper was charged by Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, to shoot the Pawlby's vocal box and to “approve her door”, but Coulson also called it and left his vocabulary messages.
"The accused suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of man to stay before the house of people by expecting to surprise them, is the kind of man to love to present the story to people to see what they say," said Mr. Edis.
He said that NotW used three ways to investigate the subjects: telephone pirateage, monitoring and confrontation.
The head editor is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that it is aware of the second, oversight, it cannot be otherwise.
But what's the first thing?
Does he know the phone piratege?
He claims the opposite, but we say, “That is sure that I do. ”
The rumors on a link that implied Clarke were first repeated by the NotW's editing office when a source, testing sexual attraction to Mrs. Pawlby, said that we had said, "Do not lose your time with her, she's with Charles."
A band on which were recorded vocabulary messages on his phone at least three times was entered at the Marcaire house in August 2006.
The investigators also found inputs on the computer of the private detective that concerned Ms. Pawlby and her sister covered in a “Projects” dossier.
During the period in which the detective investigated her, the grandparents of Ms. Pawlby received anonymous calls for information on them, added Mr. Edis.
Among the time, the former reporter, Neville Thurlbeck, and the former reporter James Weatherup, supervised the control of the smaller facts and gentlemen by Mrs. Pawlby.
In a vocal message he left him on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story that we expect to publish tomorrow, which I really like to speak to Charles."
Mr. Edis explained that the involvement of Coulson in the history followed the same scheme as with other important men, such as the former Minister of Interior David Blunkett.
The jury heard the Thursday that Coulson had met Mr. Blunkett about a relationship with a married woman while he himself had the co-defence of Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks did not have complied with others to switch phones from October 3, 2000 to 9 August 2006.
Marcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup agreed to have performed the telephone piratege.

A large part of violence was taken into the Islamic State in Iraq and Levant (IIL), a group affiliated in Al-Qaida (Sunnites extremists), also involved in civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants to fight against Al-Qaida.
Violence is at the centre of entertainment in the United States of Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, which will be received by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting on 12 December 2011.

RDC: Army attacked the last fifth of the rebellion
M23, or a few hundred fighters, was launched around 2000 meters of height over the agricultural collines of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two regions located about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of the North Kivu Province.
"When has not been stopped since this morning, the battles continue, despite the night," reported AFP a Jomba's people, with a phone contact at 12.30 p.m., and as a girl has been blessed by ball in the morning.
"The intensity of faces has reduced a little," he added, "he seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the RDC have retreated a little."
According to this witness who wanted to remain an anonymized, the soldiers had "passed the night" to Jomba before they went to the front for a "ratification operation".
We were very clearly heard behind him of low weapons sweet creaming.
From Bunagana, the fifth political and the last strong place of the rebellion falling mercredi, an AFP journalist could hear a detonation of weapons.
According to a source of the United Nations Mission for the Stabilization of the DRC, the fights have entered "in a final phase", the FARDC had "inclined the positions of the M23 residual to displace them".
Since the revised, Friday, conflicts between the Movement of March 23 (M23) and the army, Monusco does not participate directly in the battle, but provides government forces a determining support in the field of information, observation and planning.
At the end of the midst, several decades of soldiers, well provided in munitions, were mounted in the direction of the front line.
They were armed with calachnikov and shooting lances.
Unfortunately, on the road to Bunagana, a border post with Uganda, military assisted civilians loaded a multi-scale shooting shooting shooting on a nine-FARDC truck, in order to ensure the relief of another shooting in the M23 positions on the collines.
The Congol President Joseph Kabila once again called the rebellion to "demobilize voluntary" by being dissolved by force, but left the Kampala process open, where Kinshasa and M23 discussed since December without result.
Instead, M23's political leaders hope to reach an agreement.
"We have finished the talks, we have remained only in the Uganda mediation to organize the signature," said Roger Lumbala, vice-president of the delegation of M23, without that this information could be immediately confirmed by the government side.
M23 was born by a mutiniary, in April 2012, of former rebellious rebellious, mainly tough, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
United Nations and Kinshasa regularly accused Uganda and Rwanda to support M23, which represents Kigali and Kampala.
North Kivu is one of the most deeply small regions in the RDC, and its subsolar strict mine resources.
In Bunagana, the western border side, where some 5000 refugees were refugees between Monday and Monday according to the United Nations, the return movement to the RDC, which was inclined to the mid-day morning.
"It morning we turned into our fields, but the military told us to turn back," reported the AFP Imelda Nyiranksi A.I.A., around its nine children, whose feeding on the doses.
It is the impression that fire cuts are closer to populations.
At the beginning of the evening, decades of habitats crossed the border, some with a handle on the head, to pass the night in Uganda.
The musical commedia, this scene beast
Classic, sophisticated, popular, English or French, productions and dancings take their sight.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds his voice.
It's a revolution: the French musical is as a kind of success.
Long-term from Paris to Mozart the rock opera, most of the attempts were prevented in the strike.
And successes such as Cabaret or The Miserable took the mystery's autumn.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin to Chatel and Stage Entertainment in Mogador changed the woman.
Today, these two scenes hold the titles as successful tubes.
The first replies, this Christmas, his excellent My Fair Lady, and announces for the next World Creation of "A American in Paris".
In Mogador, "La Belle and the Beast" may be one of the successes of the season.
On the other scenes, musical spectacles such as "1789", "the friends of the Bastille" and the small musical commodities such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" are the disappearance of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Music Historys" and confer to the Chatelet Theater, analyze the reasons of so hardly conquired success.
How are French musical commits evolving?
The offer has diminished.
There is first the musical spectacles that evolve in the degree of producers...
Some use beautiful image projects and a real story as in 1789, the Bastille Amants.
Others make a 15-year-old bond under pretext that can be served nearly anything when Matt Pokora has a shower head.
Then, there are musical commits with the somptuous productions of the Chatelet that make us recovered the Broadway's gold age and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the largest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popularising the angla-shees musical commits of variety by adapting them in French.
Independent French producers have a perceived perception.
But existing projects such as "Rent", "The Baiser of the Women Award" or "The Eve of the Sun" have badly to be financed.
Do we have enough artists like Broadway's songer, play and dance?
In Paris, when we have eight musical spectacles in a season, it's a great year.
We have 200 talent artists that turn projects into projects.
In the United States, as a result of the musical commodity, it's very different.
Youths are formed in many schools.
The jobs are many between regional theatres, tourned, Broadway, off-Broadway...
Consequently, the livement of talents is also the number of posts to be paid.
Why are the province tours so successful?
On the exception of the operation, the province remains the poor parent of the culture in France.
Many theatre parts start to turn, and it is often a bolevard theater for adults and not for youth.
The musical spectacles combine this lack.
These are the same young people who love the telereality and what it produces as ephemer stars...
Propose beautiful young men (which talentous) headed by a musical spectacle, it is the assurance of a rule of these young girls and often their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these spectacles are well held by professionals who respond to questions.
These spectacles are very waiting when they arrive in a province Zenith.
Mayonnaise is mounted to Paris and was disgusted by the Provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the large rooms of France in the same form as in Paris.
A serious blessed in an accident with a fantastic driver on the ring of Brussels
An accident of the road was a serious shock, Thursday morning at 5:30 p.m. on the inner ring of Brussels at Hoeilaart, in the direction of Waterloo.

However, this situation has not caused abuses because the accident had occurred at the height of Howilaart output.
The circulation could therefore be deleted by this output/input of the ring.

RDC: the army prepares a new shooting
Childs played on a carbonized blind that belonged to M23's rebels in Kibumba on October 31, 2013, east of the RDC.
The Congolean army was prepared to sell a new assault against the last M23 rebels' bases near Bunagana, in the east of the RDC.
The aim is to move the M23 of the collines that overlook Bunagana.
Last night, we took Bugina's colline, who overlaps Mbuzi's.
Today, Mbuzi should go away from herself.
It's not gonna stay more than Runyonyi's colline.
"The Chanzu's not very strategic," stated AFP the North Kivu Governor, Julian Paluku.
Mr. Paluku predicted that it would take place in Bunagana.
Five political and the last strong place of the rebellion, this place is located at the Hungarian border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was re-membered by the armed forces of the Democratic Republic of the Merry Congo.
Since a few hundreds of M23 irreducible, a few hundreds of M23 have been launched around 2.000 meters of height on the farm hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and the nearby Jomba’s neighborhood.
To Jomba, a people who had made battles every day afternoon showed that the situation was "called since this morning."
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the battles of the age and were entered.
One girl was blessed by ball, and three other people were blessed, including a grievely evacuated by the FARDCs, added this witness referred to by the AFP.
Since the resurrection of combats between FARDC and rebellion on October 25, the two Belgians gave no balance of losses in human life.
NSA revelations increase the paranoia of enterprises with respect to State surveillance
By a beautiful day of the end of August, a German police helicopter was low-length the British Francfort Consultant, Germany's financial capital.
On the order of the Federal Constitution Protection Office (BfV), the German National Information Agency, his mission was to photograph the Tower of the United States previous post, situated at least 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Federal Bank.
The German media explains that the BfV expected to identify the presence of listenings and that the operation has caused a exchange between the United States and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, the director of American Information Services, reiterated again in September that the United States did not use their foreign information capacity to “flore industrial secrets of foreign enterprises for the account of American companies to increase their international competitiveness or increase their benefits”.
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant, became a denied, he began to declare his unforeseen information treasurer on the secrets of the United States, European governments and business leaders, whether he should believe in the speaker.
Reports, according to which the National Security Agency sponsored the Brazilian Oil Company Petrobras and had access to data detented by American stocking services providers in Cloud, including Google and Yahoo, have ever been raising the paranoia of enterprises in respect of State surveillance.
The revelation that the phone of the German lucky phone Angela Merkel had been cut off, perhaps even for a decade, was the water shooting that cut off the vase.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be seen, business leaders are certainly also potential targets.
Snowden has transparently made intensive cooperation between American Information Services and business services.
I believe it is designed to use these data in their mutual interest.
"Germany must wake up," says Oliver Grün, President of BITMI, who represents the German IT sector SMEs.
German companies believe that the United States represents a risk as important as China when it is industrial and data shooting, according to an investigation published in July by the EC Advisory Office.
However, in all documents declared by Mr. Snowden, nothing indicates that the United States had transmitted industrial secrets of foreign enterprises to American companies.
Political men were concerned about the idea that the EU does not have sufficient IT and Internet capacity and think that it should try to reduce its dependence in the United States.
Business leaders are sceptics in this regard.
A deputy of the German Parliament said that we should create a German Google.
I can just close the eyes and open them slowly...
"This is not the good way to do," says Hasso Plattner, President of the German business software company, SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, there was no need to let her die 20 years ago.
Everything is subventioned in Germany, car carbon, through farmers.
All except the IT industry.
However, the expansion and sophistication of the American Spionage Agencys exposed by Snowden's revelations were a shock for some companies who thought that China was the largest risk of monitoring terms.
There is a great change in the sky-information, since European responsibilities have been aware of the fact that the data preserved in the United States are regulated under the laws of this judicial law and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to an investigation carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, some 10 per cent of the non-American members refused their projects to use an American store services provider in the cloud after the reports on the American Data Exploration Program.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, states: "Our clients put us today a question that they did not have us a year ago: where my data are stored and can you assure me that they will remain physically in this courtship?”
Many German leaders indicate that the last reports are only a confirmation of what they had already known, and that the powerful states want to shoot their most precious secrets and that these data should therefore be regarded at all prices.
It is not surprising that there is economic sponsoring.
I've always been there.
"This is a recursive issue for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the context of the current discussion", says Kurt Bock, director-General of the production company BASF.
Americans sponsor us at the commercial and industrial level as we sponsors, because it is in national interest to defend our enterprises.
Business leaders are generally unlikely to reveal the prevention measures they have established, where this would leave advantages to a rebellion.
The large corporations have been marvelling the message that it is at least unburned to recover a free USB key in a professional room or to leave a portable computer without monitoring in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Audi Car Builder's Administration Board, states that the collection of portable phones before the meetings of the Council, in order to not be used as distance listening devices, is a common practice for years.
Germany's BfV suggests to his leaders to consider using simple portable phones during their foreign journeys because of the risk of reaching smartphones integrity.
The prepayed portable phones are then dropped.
However, we are afraid that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to pirate and monitoring.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their special neck.
“PMEs often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets against unlawful access” warned the BfV in a report.
The United States warns their own companies on economic sponsoring activities carried out by other countries.
The National Assessed Intelligence (NIE) carried out in February by the United States, quoted France, as well as Russia and Israel, which had been sentenced in the second degree of having conducted economic information pirateage acts behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the Administration Board of a German company estimated that when it is economic sponsoring, “Francis are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former director of French Intelligence, stated in an interview this month: “The services are perfectly well known for all countries, even if they cooperate in combating terrorism, sponsoring their partners.”
The parents of a young man in Georgia, who is deceived in insolent circumstances, think that their son was killed.
The parents of a georgian adolescent, whose body was found in a routine struggle in the gymnase of his school, thought that their son was killed, declared the lawyer of the Jeudi family.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta in Georgia, was found on 11 January in a smooth supported behind the grains of his school gymnase.
The investigators of the Lowndes Committee's sheriff concluded that Johnson was deceived in insolent circumstances, but the family of 17-year-old boys contested these conclusions.
"They are absolutely some of their sons who were murdered," said Benjamin Crump, lawyer Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, on FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead like that was indicated in the conclusions of the secretary.
“They think that this deplores all logics, physical laws, and common sense,” added Crump.
They are convinced that these conclusions have been delivered in the only purpose of covering the or the persons responsible for the death of their son.
“They sent their son to school with a carttable, and they were sent to them in a deadly shooting,” he added.
The U.S. Prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that he killed a official investigation on Johnson's death, emphasized that a number of important questions remained without answer.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore was expressed at a press conference after midday.
I'll follow the facts where they're coming.
My goal is to discover the truth.
“I believe there is a sufficient basis” to open an official investigation, said he.
Moore declared journalists that the first autopsie indicated that Johnson was deceived by “postial asphyxie.”
However, a second autopsie identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
"A number of questions still give a response or a confirmation, " notes.
Moore added that if he updates elements of nature to justify a civil or criminal investigation on Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of Lowndes' secretary office was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted it on Thursday.
A trial in South Georgia ordered merry to the authorities to remit all video monitoring records that investigators had reviewed.
The parents of the adolescent said that they hoped that video images contain indexes on the circumstances of his death.
The CDC published allergic advisory in children at schools
Mercredi, the United States Disease Control and Prevention Centre, has published a number of guidelines indicating how children's food allergies are managed at school.
This is the first series of guidelines which the United States government publish, since the number of children in school age suffering from food allergies has strongly slowly slowed.
A 20-year-old child in the United States suffers today of food allergie.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children had increased from 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to sensibilize the educational body and staff to the food allergy in the child and how to treat them in the case of allergic reaction.
He also recommends that schools have an epinephrine stock – the EpiPen autoinjector is the most smoothly used – to react rapidly in cases of potentially deadly analysis.
Legislative assemblies of States recently updated the regulations to allow schools to have more epinephrine.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children with allergic reactions.
The children can say, "I have the impression that something smells me the language", "I've the impression of having a hair on the language" or "I have picotes on the language."
NSA case stressed the total absence of information discussions
How to explain the contradictoral attitude of the French government, which is publicly offered by the U.S. Ambassador of the United States on 21 October, and the other prohibited the surrounding of the territory by the Bolivian presidential aircraft, on the basis of the routine of the presence at its border of Edward Snowden?
According to me, there are two levels of response from the French government.
When François Hollande phone in Barack Obama or Laurent Fabius calls the U.S. Ambassador, they react to a real discovery, which is the extent of the United States surveillance over all communications in France.
Isn't it surprised to read in the world's columns a few weeks between the reprodution of the American diplomatic correspondance and, on the other hand, a condemnation of the Quai of Orsay by the NSA?
Didn't it be like a vague hypocrisy from your side?
The journalism is not a moral position, but the search for the interest and pertinence of information that allows every citizen to make a view.
When WikiLeaks highlights the analysis by the American diplomacy of political intentions or other in the whole world, we will believe that, in view of the American power, this is an important lighting.
When we describe American interception systems against the French diplomacy to the United States, it is in no case to abuse us from this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Have France benefited from information provided by the NSA on terrorist operations for our interests?
Can we take care of the American cooperation?
The introduction of technological instruments that have been very powerful by the United States, but also by France, has been officially justified by combating terrorism.
Furthermore, France and the United States have established procedures for cooperation and exchange of information almost daily and are described as essential.
For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French people through the NSA.
France may, for example, be conducted to transmit all data blocks in the Sahel region to the United States services and, in contrast, has already been said - Americans can provide information to the French people about other regions of the world.
The substantial issue behind this NSA case is not both the capacity or right of countries to be intercepted, so that the question of the total absence of pre-debates, including within the parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter which must be their own, and, finally, the issue of access to freedoms.
What really risks the United States? a degradation of their image?
We're good to condemn them. I don't see how they can be punished.
The risk run by Americans can be double.
The first is when their allies - and it was the recent case - learned that their leaders, sometimes the highest top of their State, were monitored.
This is the case of Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have been endured.
Another effect can be the more economic: more European or South American enterprises, in the light of the revelations, give their confidential data to American providers subject to the U.S. laws, and therefore the NSA imprisonment.
The last element: the broad movement of revelations in the world's entire media, which contributes to the discussion on the practices for the monitoring of information services to almost unnecessary values, could encourage legislators, including the United States, to review the powers they have given to their information services.
Intersexed children parents may choose "Indetermined sex"
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third gender for foods born with ambiguous sexual organs.
The male or woman of new births will not be strictly assigned to birth.
In the new law, parents will not be obliged to declare the sex of their children, allowing them to include a "indetermined" sex or "unspecified" on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the Law was to remove the pressure on the parent's shoes that could take predominant decisions on sexual resignation surgery for their food, and to combat discrimination against intersexed persons.
According to BBC, a intersessional person would have said years later, "I'm not a man or a woman."
I'll remain the patchwork that have created physicians, contusionate and balled.
It is estimated that two thousand children are born each year, not a boy or a girl.
They are intersexed, intersexuality of the seventy-first group of diagnosed diseases such as sexual development disorders, a generic term designated by people with chromosomes or genades (ovales or tests) atypical or normally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersessive.
Sex identification is not always well understood, but most specialists in the United States say that if sex cannot be determined, better use the best information available to allocate it, then waiting and follow child's psychological and physical development before considering a surgical act, where appropriate.
Dr. Jack Drescher, psychiatrist in New York and specialist on sexual identification issues, said that the new German law “that seems to be a good idea. ”
Intersexed children have an ethical dilemma.
“A number of people suffer extremely serious diseases that require surgical acts, but it is not the case of most children,” he added.
It is possible to make sexual assignment without operation and see how identity is developed.
Science that consistes in knowing how a child will develop sexual identity is not very specific.
No one can answer the question of knowing why this happens.
It's like the mystery around homosexual people.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersexual persons as different trans-sexual or transgenual persons, as their status is not related to sex, but instead of their biological constitution, which is not only one man or only one of a woman, but generally both in the same time and not clearly defined as one or another.
These features may be shown in secondary sex characters (e.g. muscular mass, pilotity, petrine and stage), primary sexual characters (e.g. reproductors and sexual organs) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also showed a view of discrimination against intersexed and transparent employees, as well as the extent of acts of harvest and violence and crimes caused by prejudiciary.
Youths in non-compliance have now camps that are specially intended for them.
Australia and Nepal already authorize adults to register male, women or “third sex” on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian Norrie May-Welby became the first person in the world to have been recognized "neutra" after winning his case in call that authorized to keep a "unspecified" sex in life.
German passports will contain a third appointment next to M or F – X for intersequent, according to the Ministry of Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are always subject to disputes, according to a report on France 24.
In 2011, twelve legislators of this extremely Catholic country signed a request to be removed from school books.
The American Catholic Online site also opposed the German law, writeing that “as the world is in a new government where gender is a choice, but where sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are turned into. ”
In Maryland, the mother of a foodstuff also stated on the Baby Zone that she would prefer to be allocated to children to their birth.
“The role of the parents is sufficiently stressing without additional restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your child," she stated on the site for youth parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without men or women were called hermaphrodites, according to the name of the magnificent Greek god who had a double sex.
And it's only a decade of years ago, the medical community would consider the kind as a smuggling, which can be removed and which we can residue.
But now, many are those who return to the ethical foundation of the surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors may be wrong, do not know how a child will resent its sexual resignation when he grows.
“In the midst of the XX century, it was called a psychiatric emergency,” said Drescher.
When they were born, they weren't called the psychiatrist, they were phoned to the surgery.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was launched by Dr. John Money from the University of Johns-Hopkins, who would believe that gender is malleable.
He dedicated the term “Sexual Identity” and supported the social and environmental signals – the way parents are a child- are interacting with the genes and hormones of a child to form it so that it was identified as men or women.
But in a case of 1966, known as John/Joan, his theories held in disputes.
He had advised the parents of a young boy whose penis had been cut in a slaughtered circumcision to put it completely, taking him also the tests, and to remove it as a girl.
"Money presented this as a successful transition case, but it was not the case," said Drescher.
When I was about 15 years old, he came back to a boy and married a woman.
But 38 years old, he killed himself.
Drescher said that some doctors “will repeat this model. ”
But in the 1990s, with the Internet arrival, those who survived to these sex change operations say, “It is not satisfied with the result.”
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer of Montana, who is born with young XY chromosomes but ambiguous sexual organs.
The doctors couldn't really tell if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a "friendly life" as a man.
So a few days after his birth in 1976, Bruce was a surgical abuse of the external body and tests and was higher as a girl.
He was taken women's hormones at the age of 12 years.
“I knew I was not a girl,” he said on ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he had a vaginal opposition.
But depressed and understood that something was not, he asked his medical dossier.
What he found was horrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one never told me.
Bruce is born with a sexual disorder (DDS) which prevented his body to produce sufficient textsterron so that its sexual organs could develop.
After learning the truth, a man came back, after a treatment to the textsterron and took away the hands.
The surgery made it steril.
Today, he defends the cause of others in a organization called Interface Project, which is trying to normalize the perception of intersessional persons.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, director-General of the non-profit organization based in California Advocates for Informed Choice, feared that the German law “invites the labelage and stigmatization.”
" Many activists are concerned that the German law encourages parents to take rapid decisions and give their children a "indetermined" sex.
We are afraid that it encourages the interventions.
We think it'll be better assigning a male or female sex, and waiting.
But we have not seen what the law would give, so we can only advance hypotheses.
Tamar-Mattis stated that his organization supported the Australian law because “he authorizes adults to choose to be recognized under the calling third sex”.
“ adults should be able to take their own decisions on a legal manner” she added.
The German law relates to the assignment of sex to birth.
It is not a battle that young children should lead to that age.
When they grow up, they can take decisions on their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a specialized radiolog in pittsburgh mammographies, whose girl has reached a sexual disorder and who helps thousands of people in a support group, stated that the German law would "responsibly" parents and children.
The daughter of Dr. Baratz, Katie, was born with young chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called a syndrome of complete insensibility to androgens.
Because of the deficiency of his androgyn receptors, Katie developed women's characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ears.
Today, 29 years old, Katie is married and internal in child psychiatrist at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although it is steril, she hopes to have children through adoption services or portable mothers.
“The law leaves a certain latitude to parents that they do not have to take up wealth decisions,” said Baratz.
This allows them to make some tests and understand them, and a time before you enter "bodies" or "woman".
So, everything's okay - you can get your child out and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the joy of being your parents.
You don't have to precipitate for a surgical intervention that is irreversible.
“ This makes children in the heart of the decision and ends the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they fear not to do what they need,” she states.
Finally, the child will decide with which sex he/her feels more likely – and that's something formable.
This allows the child to take the decision for himself.
Letter confidence in the long-term evity of his Government
The President of the Italian Council Enrico Letta considers that his government will hold up until 2015, despite the strong tensions between the left and the right within the coalition, at the approach of the Senate's vote to defeat Silvio Berlusconi from his mandate.
In a daily interview in La Stanmpa, the left center leader said to have "openly intention" to continue to rule with its coalition until the next legislative elections of 2015.
The High Chamber of the Italian Parliament will meet in the current month to decide on the type of the former President of the Council condemned for fiscal fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi is threatening to retire its support to the Government if the Senate, where there are more opposers than parties, proclaims its destitution.
But a part of his camp, regrouped around the National Secretariat of Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continued to support the Government, as the last October, showed his refusal to ceder to Berlusconi's injonctions that wanted to shoot the office.
L.A. Times reports that a U.S. Transport Security Agency agent, TSA, and a suspect was blessed during the exchange of fires.
Pompiers called on the drame places claimed to have responded to a call that made the status of " multiple blessed."
"The order forces are on place", explains the airport on his Twitter account, while television images show people evacuated in ambulances.
"There's been a shooting", stated AFP a talking port of the American Transport Security Agency (TSA).
ABC's local antenna showed a person shipped on a brown card, and a second transported on a rolling shuttle.
The incident took place at 9 p.m. 30 local (12 p.m. to Montreal) at the airport terminal 3, also stated the airport.
Los Angeles Times states that the 2 and 3 levels are in evacuation.
The TSA's speaking port was not able to confirm immediately if one of its employees was blessed.
All flights on arrival and from the airport were suspended.
Israeli army kills a member of Hamas in Gaza-ses
Israeli charts slaughtered a Palestinian Palestinian militant in Hamas and severely damaged another in the south of Gaza's band, which was learned after the sources of health services.
A source of the Hamas explained that battles have been made in this region because Israeli chars have cut off the border and were seen by your slaughter of Palestinian murderers.
The Israeli army was satisfied to speak a "based action" in the nearby zone of a qualified tunnel of "terrorist" by the Jewish State, believed to the border and the discovery was announced in October.
Report: The Obama campaign considered the Biden slaughter for Hillary Clinton
The most closest advisors of President Barack Obama considered to replace the Vice-President Joe Biden by Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most marking event in the very waiting book of the 2012 2012 campaign Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, “Double Down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times obtained a copy of the book to appear, and told Tuesday nights that the close collaborators of the President had conducted “deep work in groups and surveys at the end of 2011” to see whether Biden's eviation could help Obama for his choice while his hopes were adjusted.
According to the corresponding politician Times Jonathan Martin, the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of the high-responsibilities of the campaign and the Black House, namely the former Secretary-General of the House-Blanche Bill Daley, to measure what effect the replacement of the vice-president of the former Clinton State Secretariat could have on the scrutin.
The possibility of exchange is a secret that has been carefully maintained within the Chicago campaign QG and within the Oval Office.
Only a half-twelve of the President's advisers – including Daley, the former leader of Obama Jim Messina's campaign and the former advisors at the House-Blanche David Axelrod and David Plouffe – had known that the change was at the study.
“Double Down” states that Daley was loaded to replace Biden, despite their “troverse personal links” before finally decided on the change when the figures showed that Clinton had had “no clearly improved the possibilities of Obama's success” on the presidential list.
In a meeting with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had effectively planned to replace Biden by Clinton.
“I said I had considered a number of questions, and it was one of them,” said Daley in the newspaper.
Remember that at that time the President was not in the form, and therefore it was said, "Lord, what can we do?"
While Daley qualified the review of “conciliation”, Martin reported to Anderson Cooper of CNN that the election campaign had much invested to discover whether the change would benefit from the election.
"The campaigns do not consum a lot of money for analysis and discussion groups unless they consider seriously take measures", said Martin on AC360.
However, we don't know if Obama was aware of his team's replacement.
Martin told about the CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss' boss was aware of the evental remaning.
Although Daley said he did not think that the President was "he was well known" of the event of the change, the former Secretary-General acknowledged that it was "is possible" that Obama knew.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not respond definitively to the question of knowing whether political analysis were held at the Obama Bureau.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama did not know that the evasion of the presidential list was reviewed.
"That may be," said Martin.
Did you like a flow glass?
A British entrepreneur created the first fluorescent ice to the world on the basis of meduse.
Charlie Francis took part of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminoscent collation.
He had the idea after reading a study on the medications and convinced Chinese scientists to create the brilliant protein chemically.
The glass cream reacts with the language by increasing the protein pH to make it light.
Chris explains that since the glass cream starts to hear when she reacts to the heat of the mouth, it is lighter, more she becomes brilliant.
Charlie, the founder of the “Lick Me I'm Delicius” said, “It's something unbelievable but we are not only at the beginning of production, and 2 g of this thing costs about 200 £.”
The protein we use in the glass reacts with the pH net language.
So when your mouth heats the protein, the pH level increases and the ice becomes lighting.
We tested it over the last months and it seemed to have a chance to share it with all at the time of Halloween because it gives an extraordinary effect.
It's probably the most beautiful glass I've created because the lighting of the medikes is four times more pretty than gold.
So every bull costs me about 140 kg.
But she was so sweet!
The company of Charlie’s experimental trade, based on Bristol, is known for his inhabited glass parfums such as bird, skin, bottle and gold sheet.
But his next creation is even more ambitious.
He added: “I really want to develop an invisible glass.”
It is intrinsically impossible because of the reflexion caused by the glass cristales that are the glass cream, but I think I'll find a way to get there.
The glass uses the fluorescent properties of the meduse synthetised by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a meeting of Tai Chi
The songer Lou Reed died while he performed Taichi's exercises, remarked on Thursday his wife Laurie Anderson in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" and intended for the people of the city of Springs, where the couple had a house.
The artist is deceived last Sunday at 71 years of age.
"He died Sunday morning, when he looked at the trees and performed the famous 21th Taichi move, with his hands of musicians who feed the air," Laurie Anderson wrote.
Lou Reed was master or chi, a Chinese martial art.
The wife of the songer also explains that she had promised her husband, the week before her death, to make it out of the hospital and to bring it to their home of Springs (Long Island).
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in the past few years.
And even if we are citizens, it's our spiritual house.
"I was a prince and a fighter, and I know his songs on pain and beauty of the world will bring to many the wonderful joy of living he had," she added.
Lou Reed had come up in May last year with a heavy snake.
Halloween 2013 : Numbers
When I was small, Halloween was magic.
My sister and I were allowed to eat bons, go to sleep late and degusting to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I've become more pink.
In the last two years, I have not distributed a single bonus and I will certainly not do this year.
But statistics show that I am the gallery sheep when we talk about Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million in fact – will be famous by Halloween this year, expending a total of $6.9 million in bonus, deguise and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I'm waiting with impatience at every Halloween party, that's the trends.
Derogations should be $1.9 billion of expenditure, according to NRF.
This year, inanimated sex objects are furious.
Women no longer need sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods such as pizzas, hamburgers and cards.
For men, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I think that men of Daft Punk's space will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most searching deguizes are the zombies, Batman, the pirates and the whispers.
I think it's not bad to stay traditional.
We've shocked our dogs last year and, my great surprise, they were not the only ones.
Indeed, the Americans will cost $330 million for animals this year, according to the NRF.
It makes a lot of curious dogs in hotdogs.
When it's bonus, we're not glad.
Americans will cost $1.9 million in bonus this year, according to the Nielsen office.
This represents about 272 million kg of Hershey bars, successes, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
It's a super new for the 41 million children who go to the shock of bonbons in their neighborhood, according to the American Trade Division.
In fact, we're going to buy and, we're not talking about stories, consuming 41 million kg of chocolate during Halloween.
May bons are the only thing that we don't want to eat, but almost 16 million kg are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
This represents about 9 billion grains of measuring.
It's a mystery that I have not yet come to elect.
Nothing more represented by Halloween than the houses stolen.
They have the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is actually a real prison), “Whol-O-Screen” and “The House of Shock”.
In fact, there are 1 200 houses officially recognized in the United States, which generated about $500 million income, according to America Haunts, and that includes these forming photos of you in shooting you up that your friends put on Facebook and that you can't get away, and on which a type you like to leave a "sweet head" comment.
Finally, we're talking about cyclings.
Charlie Brown presented us The Grosse Citrouille when we were kids, and sculpting a cycling in the form of swimming, it's like decorating a Christmas tree – that's something that we're doing since we're all small.
Happy for us, the "trend of the baby" has started only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us have sculpted these pools and have not had to sit down.
This year, the Americans will cost about $106 million in cytole, according to the United States Census Office.
The Latin citrus that calmly flying on your home's pork came probably from the island, where 542 million citrus were cultivated this year.
If you're trying to make you notice more, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to sculpte their citrus of 922 kg.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will create an internal deficiency structure ("bad bank") grouping 38 billion books (45 billion euros) of the most risked assets, which will be used to defeat its relationships with London and to accelerate its reprivacy.
The bank wants to reduce from 55% to 70% the percentage of suspicious assets in its budget in the coming two years and hopes that it has been completely cleaned in the three years.
RBS also said that it would include a provision for the depreciation of additional doubts of 4 to 4,5 billion books on the quarter, a writer related to the constitution of the cantoning structure.
RBS also stated that this internal restructuring would free from 10 to 11 billion capital books, thus strengthening its ability to loan.
The bank and London stressed that the "bad bank" would allow to take a trace on the past, and the government was in particular accused of entering RBS.
"We can now go before, we can care for the future and 90% of the assets that are really good banks and build a large bank for the customer and the UK," said the new Director-General Ross McEwan to the press.
Land Rover announces his conversation of a series of rallyes
The internal seats and harnaes have 6 points and a Intercom system.
Among the options, including improved freight, a service provides access to Bowler Works mechanisms, logistical support and the interface of the vehicle between two events.
Drew Bowler's director-General Bowler Motorsport said: “The rallys lovers who join Bowler have changed.”
They are not all experienced, some are looking for exciting and adventure and real access to international events.
We are really happy to offer such a partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we are convinced that this will be a new way to try to various forms of rallys in the United Kingdom and the international and to prepare for the rulers and realities of rallys.
We have had a lot of joy to develop the Defender Challenge vehicle – the championnat will really be palpitant. »
Furthermore, the Defender Challenge will propose a day of training and tests in February and the possibility of participating in events in the northern and Middle East deserts.
The pomps were called to safeguard a lost chiot after resting up to 15 meters above the ground on an instable cornice in a carriage.
Ruby, a Spanish cocker, missed after a accident of the uncertain road
She was recovered three days later by a person who walked in his dog in the carriage
The pompiers have fallen in remembering the long of the false to recover the dog and save her from a certain dead.
A chiot had the opportunity to escape the worst after the pompiers were called to restore it in any safety while it was because of 15 meters above the ground on the instable sail of a false.
Ruby, a 9-month epanic cocker, missed after a dining accident after midnight and survived for three days only before being saved in a martyr carriage.
His owners, Scott Alderson, 25 years old, and her little friend Becky Hall, 20 years old, went to the Flappit Carrera in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thank West Yorkshire's fire and rescue service.
They were desperately looking for their lost dog and launched a call on social network sites after it was gone in the carriage after a accident without seriousness.
On Thursday 14.15, a person at agested view that walked his dog replied Ruby on a cornish in the carriage, involving 15 m above the ground.
A technical relief team of Cleckheaton's pool chamber rose on the places and went down in memory to save Ruby by using a animal civile for transporting it to the top of the false.
The technical assistance specialist Andy Clayton said, “It was in a precautional situation.”
She was in full around the floor, 15 m from the top and 15 m from the ground.
She did not be moved during the savingage – she was healed.
But she's okay now.
She eating bikes after.
It was a very inhabited call.
It's amazing that someone noticed the dog.
The technical assistance specialist Peter Lau said, "Ruby has had a lot of chances to get out of compensation."
She could have been seriously blessed or worse.
Ruby was conducted at the veterinary for a control; its general status was satisfied, made part of the smiling and dishydration.
Mrs. Hall, of Halifax in West Yorkshire, said: “I was terrified by observing the help.”
I didn't think she was there first.
It was surprising to have him again in the arms.
The veterinary said that if she had been too shocked and that she was shocked, she would probably fall.
The bombs were escaped.
What they did was really courageous.
They are so grateful, each of them has been absolutely formable.
Mr. Alderson, from Keighley, added: “We feared that she falls but she didn't move. ”
The bombs were super.
I can't believe she was there.
Mick Jagger said he never draged Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview in an Australian radio emission this week, pop star said that she was a chorist on Jagger's song "The Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said he dinnered with the rock veteran and explained, “he draged me when I was 18 years old. ”
She added, "It was a long time ago, and he was very good."
In a Tuesday, a 70-year-old representative of Jagger said that he had never made progress in Katy Perry.
The representative added: "That may be she confounded with someone else."
Perry was one of the songs to make an appearance during the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, Prism, was the first place of the charts this week.
Industry is the Islamic movement of Turkey
"It was the Islamic Movement of Eastern Turkey based in Central and West Asia," said the Chinese security bodies patron at a Hong Kong television chain, according to a video set on Thursday night on a web site.
Mit Jyanzhu, who is a member of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC), expressed in Tachkent at an official visit in Uzbekistan.
It's the first time that a Chinese responsible designates a special organization after Monday's arrival.
According to the Chinese police, three of the same family of the Xinjiang Islamic dominant region, the border of several Central Asian countries, have prevented their car of sights against the entry of the city prohibited in Peking, in a suicide attack that made two dead and 40 blessed.
The driver of the car, his wife and his mother died in the fire of the car.
The Ethim, who claims to fight for the independence of Eastern Turkey, former name of the Chinese Xinjiang, was classified by the United Nations in 2002 among the organizations affiliated in Al-Qaida.
This movement is often designated by Chinese authorities as responsible for sporadic problems in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan : The expansion of Europe gives the choice to the ECB
Another day, another worried story of independence.
This time we are expected that an independent Scotia would be obliged to join the European free movement area to enable the EU to adhere.
And here we hear passport control historys in Berwick and a border of barbeled sons along the wall of Hadrien.
If it is true that Strathclyde's newspaper indicated the economic events of a larger freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this was not in the largest titles (and it was to prevail).
No one has said that the EU Member States have a large part of their time to comply with their formal rules when it arranges them.
Since Scotia is not part of the Schengen space at the time, a continuing non-compliance of the rules would be a minor consent that Brussels could, in contrast, offer everything she wants to obtain Scocias.
It's therefore a story that is not one.
And so old that she is now fixed: I heard the bobard for the first time that "Independence means the control of passports" over 40 years ago.
However, a interesting point was forgotten in this interpretation of an old powder account.
Why should an independent Scotland follow Europe's instructions, in fact?
Why can you exchange London's game against that of Brussels, in particular now?
This is the actuality of Europe: the great sub-government plan for the unification of Europe is definitely dead.
With the euro crisis, the European project is officially dead.
Through Europe, the parties opposed to the EU or fighting for the abandonment of the euro as a common rate, win from the field.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative Party for Germany, founded only this year and came from no part, gathered almost five million votes during the federal elections of September and issued the Democratic Liberal Party (equivalent to our Democratic Liberals).
There has always been a national opposition to the project to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis marked a tournant.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, associated with the weighted carcasses on national economies through the accession to the single currency, has led to many people to think that the European project was too far.
The euro crisis did not have a great degree to meet national governments with excessive budget deficiencies – that was only true for Greece.
The European system was worse on its members of the changing rates for German exporters – what the German political men want to keep.
Without the possibility of evaluation of the national rate, the Southern Europe countries will face a problem of intrinsic productivity for Germany.
The only means is to make dark cuts in the wages and public expenditures – encouraged by Berlin.
In addition to the current budget and monetary problems, there is a deepest deeply linked to productivity in Europe.
Following the "great" energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason to subsidize French and German energy companies from the consumer energy sector – the European industry pays two times more for electricity and four times more for the gas than the United States.
This is an inconvenience in terms of costs, as we have seen in Grangeouth.
All wages in the world will not prevent the European oil industry to be punished by a good American market gas.
Consequently, the revolt, in particular in France, is one of the major EU men.
After the war, the French political election considered the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on a foot of equality with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport of his political legitimacy and imposed its own economic policy in Europe, letting the French economy go wrong.
Result: The extreme right party of Marine Le Pen, the Anti-European National Force, has come to provide a crucial partial election, returning socialists to the third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the suffrages – an appropriate warning for the British Worklist Party, which reminds him that it cannot take place from the principle that a disclosure of the right will automatically promote the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with his new popularity at the French white work class?
She wants to serve European elections in the next year to create a single and anti-European antimonest block within the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties are good towards these elections, which is very possible, such a block could control the European Parliament for the first time.
This is what I think: very early, the feeling of anti-European and anti-monnae in Europe will join and end by killing the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something more like the 'Europe of the United Nations (Souverans)' freely dedicated by the General of Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could maintain the euro, but France and Southern Europe will find their own duty.
I hope that the United Kingdom takes its distances in relation to this project, and I hope it will make the U.S. sweet eyes.
However, the growing interest of Washington for the Pacific allows to think that Great Britain will be left in Atlantic.
What about Scotia in all this?
We can decide to be a region of the small English (especially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes shipping Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotia could be accompanied by a more free European agreement as we observed our own duty.
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a non-Federal Europe.
Instead, we should insist on Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP Government is – and it is to note – the anti-authority political movement that has been the best success in Europe, since it has reported a speculative majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the proposed dark cuts (and implemented) by the Chairman of the Working Equipment, Alistair Darling, and the conservator/liberal-democratic coalition that has followed.
It would now be ridicule for Scotia to vote for independence if it is to accept the authenticity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Previous Puberty : Search precéding
Studies show that young African and Spanish African girls tend to reach the age of puberty early than young white girls.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent
No evidence is that hormones or other chemical substances are responsible
Experts believe that obedience epidemic may be a pre-puberty deckler
Trend towards early puberty is not even pronounced in boys
CNN Pat Etheridge's former journalist is a specialized journalist in family and health issues in children.
Should a mother be worried if the pubs and powders of her daughter start to smell at 7 or 8 years?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics that held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, Pedo-endocrinologue, explained that these early physical changes are sufficiently common among young Americans and represent a new standard.
“I'm going to take a lot of time to safeguard parents – in general, this does not indicate a rapid evolution towards full puberty,” said Kaplowitz.
Evident development signs, such as swimming pools, arms under the arms and in the pubian area and corporate odors, appear early at the girls.
But there was only a slight advancement from the age of the first rules during the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age was 12 and half, while it was 12 years of twenty-five in 1970.
“After the skin began to grow, at least two or three years before the first rules appear,” said Kaplowitz, also the author of “Airly Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem”.
The time is the most specific test to know how puberty will evolve.
There is a debate on what is the real appearance of puberty, but it is considered as 'precoce' when breast development is accompanied by sugar growth before the age of eight.
In most cases, declining or stopping development – something that a pediator can follow closely.
Faster evolution can justify tests carried out by an endocrinolog to avoid serious problems such as tumors or skists.
There are treatments to delay the appearance of the first rules and to prevent other consequences: premature older skins that can slow growth and a small size of adult age.
Medical and hormonal treatment recommendations are based on child age, development rate, growth rate and affective maturity.
The psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is careful with medications but recognizes that “the fact of controlling puberty can enhance some behavior problems and feeling for young girls to be different from others.”
The other big problem is understandable: parents do not just want their very young girls to have their rules.
“They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle hygien issues,” said Kaplowitz.
“It was a shock,” a woman whose daughter had his first rules for 10 years.
Even if there were signs and we had spoken of rules, it was not emotionally prepared.
She came back from the school angry and buleversed to be the first among his friends.
There are many theories to know the public about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no coherent theory that the hormones contained in milk or other foods, the chemicals present in the environment or the media are responsible.
The kids, like girls, reach their puberty early.
Kaplowitz says that the most credible hypothesis is the of obedience epidemic.
He participated in a study of 6-9-year-old girls who linked the percentage of fat mass to puberty deployment.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influences.
In this country, young African and Spanish girls tend to reach the age of puberty early than young white girls.
There are various explanations.
At the world level, pre-puberty mechanisms seem to be influenced by all, economic conditions in climate, through genes.
Another problem: Despite the child's faces and the youngest pubic area, the tendency towards real pre-puberty is not so pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP Conference stressed the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of powder and pubian pool is common, even in food and all-pets.
“We must be careful about the way we identifie the real appearance of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pedo-and-crinologist who works at the hospital for children in Goryeb in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their caregivers to know how to talk to their children.
“It may mean having a conversation early than planned,” explained Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, your child will react well in general.
The girls whose puberty is soon need to be aware of the fact that, even when it happens early than planned, the process is part of life.
Hommage of the Brothers Coen
"Inside Llewyn Davis" of the Brothers Coen, the Grand Prize of the Last Festival of Cannes, is a nostalgic and sweet film on the Greenwich village of 1961 and the folk music that just started to sleep, before Bob Dylan arrived.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose films were being designed for a retrospective in the French cinematec, stripped the Golden Palme in Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
Unlike Dylan's power, or the triumph Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen, they took their devolvement on the star amount of the American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33 years old, but also on the planetaire pop Justin Timberlake.
In this film, where music is a central personality and the directly interpreted songs, Oscar Isaac reveals a musician and people's player, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves pop for the folk music with a county jubilation.
With regard to Carey Mulligan, she left the rich tours of Daisy Mulligan in "Gatsby the Beauty" for less sweet clothes, a sweet voice when she sang, but she jumped the sweetness to the mine when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" a week tells the tribulations of a people's songer that can't be able to spend and smile with the whole earth.
He accepts the replacements at the foot in the studies.
Without housing, he makes the tour of his friends who still want to receive him.
A documentary air
"Their relationship with success is tortured, which was interested in us: a mix of maliciousness, a man who is not right at the right time, which is not carrierist but integrated, with self-destructive behavior," said Ethan Coen press, coronated with his brother Joel of several Oscars and prices in Cannes.
If Llewyn Davis has not existed, the two cinema fans of folk music built their story about true personalities of the time as Dave Van Ronk, folk musician.
The idea was to show the moment before Greenwich village event, this New York district called to become "the epic of the outer of the folk music that would generate international stars" such as the journalist Elijah Wald, a friend of Van Ronk.
The film then takes documentary allusions, invasive music labels of 33T invaded invented by an unexpected old secretary, musical choices of the age studys and coffees where the channels were produced.
The magic of the Brothers Coen still works in integrating a person's joy that spends on the movie in continuity: a beautiful sweet chat at the eye, a rich companion of Llewyn Davis.
Questioned about the way he composed of his personality, the actor and player Justin Timberlake had "grand in the Tennessee, swimming by the blue and the country".
"My first lessons of music were given me by my grandfather who learned to play the guide," he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if the work is necessary for "to be considered good", "the haard can also launch the career of someone," and "of more today".
As Llewyn Davis, who rejects any compromise on his music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to let us do anything that can prevent us express us."
Gerard of Villiers, the author of "SAS" is dead.
He will never know the word retreat.
The phenomenon of the French edition, Gerard de Villiers, on Thursday 83 years of age, was just publishing his 200th SAS, "The Venice of Cremlin".
In February, New York Times was dedicated to him as "the author of spanning romans that knew it too much."
He was then over ten days in Afghan, the theatre of 198 and 199 opposed by the famous series of spontaneous Romans.
Physically decreased by a very serious cardiac accident in December 2010, it was moved during the trip with a deambulant.
And before Afghan, he was also taken into Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published annually, Gerard de Villiers, born on 8 December 1929 in Paris, would be ignored the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first series, about a half century ago.
"It is doubtful between 120 and 150 million countries confunded," he progressed in March last.
His birman chat on the genocide, in the hall of his great apartment of an avenue Foch on two steps of the Triomphe Arc, the bad eye under his white hair, he mentioned a few of the languages in which the SAS adventures were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japan or Korean.
"On accounting the pirate editions," he added, named a book skin on the low table between bronzes or eviers reported from the 130 armed countries to place their Romans.
For the price of a cigarette package, the reader has the right to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman to the advantageous skin, taking a gun or a shooting gun.
In the meantime, his master of the Seenism (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, Austrian aristocratics argented deceased and contractual agent of the CIA to pay the repairs of the family castle, launchs the traces of all the wicked ones of the earth, communists of the 70s and 80s, then Jihadistes from the 1990s.
A large dose of geopolitical and ecosystem, a few hard sex scenes, a seventh of violence and torture.
"I never had the claim to be a literatory author," explained Gerard of Villiers.
I consider me as a account that writes to divide people to whom I don't send a message.
He worked "as the great war reporters, like the Albert London type, who were going on and returned with real and long investigations".
The father of SAS said "make a kind of geopolitical folliton."
"I'm still my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before you leave," added Gerard of Villiers.
In place, I meet journalists, including AFP, diplomates, people of the services I have known for some 20 or 30 years.
Of course, the number of its SAS are often premonitors: so, a month before the attack of a Syrian command center killed several high-responsibilities, he had told the story in the "The Way of Damas".
In the "Fuss of Benghazi", he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA commanding center in this city, in the face of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he put the murderer of the Egyptian President Anouar El-Sadate in "The Complex of Caire", a year before he arrived.
In October 2012, in "Panic in Bamako" he reported the 4X4 jihadistes columns based on the Malean capital.
I'm not devine, I defended Gerard of Villiers, just doing hypothesis from countries I know well and, in time, some of my hypotheses.
After these travellers in frequent areas, he was installed for a month behind his machine to write IBM to marguerite by 1976 "in all parts have been changing."
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page on the style.
At the walls of his office, AK-47, erotic photos and photos of the author with African warrants.
Regularly embraced for machism by women and racism by human rights organizations, Gerard of Villiers ejected these accusions in two words.
Some women are sexual objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I'm always welcomed in Africa where I account for many readers.
Gerard of Villiers said, "Malko Linge, as all heroes, has no age."
He won't die and he won't go back.
Not more than me.
Aircrafts are shocking about the width of the seats while large commands are on game
The conflict is rare among the large aircraft constructioners about the width of the tourist classe on long-commercies flights, opening the way to an awesome confrontation at the Dubai aircraft salon that takes place for months.
The conflict is on the width of the long-commercies seats proposed to the passengers of the Economic Class – which are not always the most shortest of airlines, but which are essential to increase the efficiency gains in the latest devices presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called the aircraft industry to establish a standard of at least 18 pound seat size (45.72 cm) in economic classes, but its great American Rival Boeing states that this should be the airlines to decide.
The divergent cleared that aircrafts are trying to sell more bi-commerce aircraft versions from their bi-commerce aircraft, and eventually expecting a command record during the event that was launched from 17 to 21 November.
The way the seats will be available to the back of the aircraft – in particular there will be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic performance of the mini-jumbo segment.
Boeing states that its revised "777X" will be able to welcome 406 people in larger seats of over 17 pounds and will be configured with 10 seats per round.
Airbus indicates that the competitive version of its A350 will transport 350 people in rounds of 18 pounds of widely set up in 9.
Aviation genders are often exchanged on technical issues by making publicity in the professional press.
Today, Airbus calls the public directly before the Dubai Airport Hall, where 777X should take the step on its competitors with more than 100 commands.
Recently we could be able to realize what could be the beginning of a new public war with the presentation of the financials of a photo showing three people against the other to the restaurant, titled “Do you accept that?”.
"Boeing proposes long-commerce flights in closer seats than in regional Turbopropulsors aircraft", said John Leahy, Commercial Director of Airbus.
As food habits change, people grow, but the seats in airlines have not radically changed.
Between the beginning of the 1970s, when Boeing's 747 thickness defined the modern long-commerce journey, and the average American weight of 40 to 49 years increased by 10 percent, according to the data of the American Health Department.
The average American tour of the 21th century is 39.7 pounds, according to the American health statistics.
Airbus states that his rival is at a seat concept dated in the 1950s, when the circle of the freshly baptized “Jet set” was more closer.
Airbus adds that she has commanded a study that indicates that an additional shift at the level of the seats will improve the quality of the sleep of 53%.
Boeing contests the Airbus figures on the wide range of seats and claims that it is not the constructors to decide how airlines balanced the ticket price and equipment.
He also said that the study shows that the experience in the chain is not only dependent on the width of the seats.
"There is really to bring suffix to airlines and to allow them to do what they think to do to work well with their activities," says Kent Craver, supported by passenger satisfaction at Boeing.
They don't want to tell them what will allow them to be rewardable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is more to have a certain freedom of movement, but for providers, it is more a question that could affect their results.
Once the conflict is hidden by aircraft commands for an estimated amount of at least 700 million dollars to the market price in the coming decades, sufficiently to deal with the balance of American and European exports.
As Reuters said for the first time in July, the seat configuration is exactly what foods the battle between all the last devices.
Airbus and Boeing return to both a seat in their latest long-coor bicycle models 20% above that of the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER of 365 seats.
The performance announced by Boeing depends on the comparison between the 777X set with 10 ranked seats and a 777 model set in rounds of 9.
The gain in terms of unit costs is low compared to the device set with 10 seats per round currently in service.
"Boeping doing this to make more seats and make its more competitive aircraft in relation to our products," said Kevin Keniston, director of Confort Passager at European Airbus aircraft.
On the other hand, analysts say that the chains set for 10 seats in the existing 777 seats suggest that many passengers are pronounced in favour of a deepest configuration, which may go to pair with less cherish rates.
“A 18-power seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, in the commercial view, the Airbus proposal was motivated by the threat of 77,” said the expert in inner chains Mary Kirby, the founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalogue of providers among which airline companies must choose.
Aviation salers that make the world tour have even a metro with them to check the competitive settings.
While offering comfortable devices, all constructioners also offer aircrafts with strong density settings to low-cost airlines and for regional travels.
Airbus offers a A350 configurationed with 10 seats per round, but indicates that it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for more personalization of the chains by offering larger seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only large modern building, experts say it is unlikely that his call to the aircraft is to establish a size standard for seats, but that it could forget the sale vague of 777X.
Ellison's shareholders are irrelevant by the salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted on the proposal for repayment for the founder and Director-General Larry Ellison, in view of the financial performances of its group.
The vote is not compromising, but it comes to torment the image of Larry Ellison, the third world's fairly slightly shocked over the victory of his ship at the Coupe of America.
Milliarder still has 25% of the capital of the software group that has been co-funded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison had received a negative vote on his repayment.
The Oakle Patron resigned a $1,2 million for the financial year 2013 closed as a result of the bad performance of the group, which lacked its growth goals, but estimated about 77 million of dollars related to stock-options.
His fixed wage is only a symbolic dollar.
Over the whole year 2013, the net benefit of Oracle has progressed in 3,5% while the Bourse rate of 27.5% overcome the S&P-500 index that took 24% at the same time.
The new anti-nicotine vaccine could remove the joy of smoking
Scientists have developed a anti-nicotine vaccine that could remove the joy that it is taken to smoke.
One dose of vaccine was protected by the mouse of nicotine dependence.
Other tests are needed before starting the tests on human being, but Professor Ronald Cristal of Weill Cornell Medical College stated that the first signs were encouraged.
“We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy will help millions of smokers that have tried to stop, slowing all the current market methods, but discover that their addiction is sufficiently strong to overcome these different approaches,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains an inoffensive virus that has been changed to transport genetic information required to design anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus is selectively infected by the heavy cells, which then begins to produce a regular anticorps flow.
Anticorps trace all the nicotine molecules presented in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which prevents the smoke of having its nicotine dose.
In tests, the vaccinated mouse that later was given nicotine continued their activity normally.
But the museums that were not vaccinated “ were cut off” said researchers, marking that nicotine had reached their brain.
Experiences are described in Science Translational Medicine magazine.
Previous vaccines against smoke were inefficient because they contained antibodies.
Injektions should be repeated so frequent that anticorps levels remain high than they were too nervous and less practical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be well less because it transforms the feed cells into anti-corps plants.
Professor Cristal said that if the future human use vaccine was completely safe, children could be administered before they tried to smoke, which would prevent any addiction to nicotine.
But it is more likely that it is used by smokers who want to stop smoking.
“They will know that if they are re-engaged to smoke, they will not enjoy it because of the anti-nicotine vaccine, and that will help them to lose their bad habits” he added.
British Scientists said that the results were interesting but reported that more detailed research was needed.
The Chief of Pakistanian Taliban killed by a drone
The chief of the Pakistanian Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a shock of an American drone in Pakistan, learned at security services.
Hakimullah Mehsud's death has been announced several times in the past.
But responsibilities of the information, the army, and the active movement declared once he had lost life in this frame, which was conducted in the North-Wazisthan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a droid shooting," said a high responsibility for security.
The past, the Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif, moved to London, informed the British Government that discussions were held with the Tehric and Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the movement of Pakistani Taliban.
Tripodi never be influenced by Obeid
The former minister of South New Galles will be subject to an investigation of the State's anti-corruption regulator.
The former Minister of South New Galles Joe Tripodi has refused to change trade bag policy on request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had interests hidden in three goods situated in the government's controlled area.
On Thursday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) extended his investigation to know whether Mr. Obeid had made pressure on several ministers of the State to renew its baths in Circular Quay, where Obeid has two restaurants and a coffee, after their expiration in August 2005, without having a call for offers.
She is now investigating the allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of the secret interest of Mr. Obeid in these properties, following the testimony of the former Adjunct General Secretary-General of Mr. Tripodi, Lynne Ashpole, in July.
During the years of discussions held in 2005, the Government has pressured the bathrooms to make an appeal for offers.
The localists were against and also wanted longer duration.
In 2009, the bags for Circular Quay companies, which reported to Obeid $2.5 million per year, were renewed without calling for offers.
Mr. Tripodi, who was the Minister of Ports of February 2006 to November 2009, was in favour of offers.
But he refused to change his policy on Mr. Obeid's request, who, recognized Mr. Tripodi, claimed to change the government policy in the field of battle.
The transmission of telephone conversations submitted to the ICAC showed the last calls between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a high official who had arrived in the Department of Ports after working under the orders of Mr Obeid to the Fisheries Ministry.
“Is it the issue discussed during these telephone conversations the development of trade baths policy?” asked the advisor Anthony Whealy to Mr Tripodi.
“No,” answered Mr. Tripodi.
I don't remember what we have discussed, but in any case, it wasn't about it.
Of course not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli war flights aimed at Syria, a responsible
Israeli war flights reached a target in the Syrian portal city of Latakia on Wednesday night, confirms a military responsible in Fox News.
The director did not specify what target was, but said that there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian manufacturing mixtures SA-125.
At least two times this year, Israel conducted aircrafts against missile loads in Syria.
Foreign workers in possession of a visa 497 may have to have a "authenticity test"
The Government is currently studying the possibility of establishing a “authenticity” test for foreign workers in possession of a visa 497 while considering extending repression measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied in accordance with a criteria for preventing visa 497 to be used to carry out non-called posts or as a means to make his family and friends in Australia.
A Government's work document was now declared when the deputy, Maxine McKew, denied the government's talk on foreign workers, said that it could violate the neighbouring in Australia.
"The unfair statements on the "foreigners returning to the board of the file" and "earnings for Australians first" are an unpleasant return at the time when trade unions requested a protected market", she stated today to Australia India Institute.
Historically, this means that the work of the Whites should be protected – and I would not be surprised that some countries in the region looked like a shock to this historical art.
The work document stated that 12 measures were previously considered by the former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Brendan O'Connor Immigration, who was in Sri Lanka to meet senior responsibilities to discuss human trafficking, implemented five of the recommended changes, the other are in review.
If the “authenticity” criteria was adopted, a visa applicant could be checked to know "if the job offer is true if the candidate is a relationship or a personal association of the owner or the person concerned within the company that sponsoris it".
The companies could also be obliged to declare the number of visa detentors after some of them, with the intention of sponsoring a small number of workers, have actually been employed hundreds of people.
In the meantime, a 35-year-old sri-lanka assistant would have died of a cardiac crisis after being arrived on a ship transporting asylum demanders to Christmas Island this week.
The folk son of man, who was nine years old, came to Australia with him and found some comfort since the death of his mercy father was with a adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was transferred urgently by the Australian authorities to the Christmas Island hospital, where he was deceived.
A study to multiplie the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotia was launched by the British Government.
The work done by HS2 Ltd lets think that high speed services will start from the opening of Phase 1 in 2026.
Mr Kramer, Minister of Transport, said that the project “the United Kingdom would gather.”
The Scotia Minister of Transport, Keith Brown, said "excited" to work with the British Government on the project.
Phase 1 will take a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated costs of the construction of high speed connection between London and the north of England, which passed from 32.7 md £ to 42.6 Md £.
The British Government, who is in conversation with Scotland, asked HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of the rail capacity and improved the duration of trails for the north of England and Scotia.
This must include the possibility of travel periods between Glasgow and Edimburgh for the best three hours.
The Baron Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is on a really national network that will draw close to the United Kingdom and its cities."
We have the HS2 project as the great advantages that it presents are.
Without him, we are faced with a ability problem of our rail network.
But it is also to develop connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, in order to be better connected with HS2.
The British Secretariat for Scotia, Alistair Carmichael, added: "The advertising today is a good news for Scotia."
For the Scotland government, Keith Brown called Mr. Carmichael to support Scotia's integration in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "The large speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic advantages to Scotia, but it also produces the economic weight of Scotia in the global broad-speed rail network project throughout the Great Britain.
"We are therefore encouraged to work in partnership with the British Government in order to examine the options to bring the high-speed train network to Scotia, creating a benefit for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edimburg line that the Scocian government is already planning.
"I'm unfortunate to read the review report with the British Ministers in the next year, and we will then decide on the next steps."
The rules on the use of electronic board devices remain for now in force in Australia
Australian aircraft passengers will continue to extend their tablets and smartphones during the decoration and aircraft, despite the management of the United States to implement electronic equipment regulations.
The American Federal Aviation Aviation left the door open to the United States transporters to change their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, look at videos or play on their devices during the critical flight phases, provided that they are in a mode.
The passengers can already do so during the largest part of the flight, but many people think they can't access their electronic books during the decoration and aeroplane.
Australian carriers consider the decision that obliges American carriers to carry out an important work to comply with the requirements, but reported that they did not intend to change their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also stated that it reviewed the advertisement, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices during the critical flight phases were always in force in Australia.
“The CASA does not have specific regulations on the use of electronic aircrafts” stated.
The issue is subject to a regulation which imposes aircraft operators to ensure the continuous security and passengers to comply with the security consignments provided by the equipment members.
Virgin, who had already spoken to the CASA about his intention to extend the use of its wheelling system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to a change, but said that it would follow the regulator.
"We would welcome a review of the CASA that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really think that this would improve the customer experience now that we have (of the wheelling system using Wi-Fi technology) on our aircraft," said a talking door.
Qantas said that it was respected for the current rules.
“In accordance with our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during the decoration and aeroplane, and we have no intention to change this,” said she.
The FAA decision shall apply to American airlines.
However, we are always interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will closely examine the FAA's decision and the reasons for it.
For American transporters, the impact of the decision will vary from an airline company to the other and depend on the age of their fleet.
Transporters should demonstrate that their aircrafts can tolerate radio interferences from electronic devices, as well as revision of manuals, training equipment, hand bag transport programs and passenger designs.
“When an airline checked the tolerance of its fleet, it may authorize passengers to use light electronic devices such as tablets, electronic book readers and smartphones at all heights” stated the FAA.
In rare cases of low visibility, the equipment will request passengers to escape their devices during the airline.
The Panel also recommended that the larger devices are covered in any security under the seats or higher divisions during the decoration and aeroplane.
Pia: at least four blessed in a violent bagar
The small town of Pia known an inhabited inhabited inhabited on Thursday night.
Three gendarmery vehicles, two ambulances and a attraction of 30 people according to collected witnesses...
On this day of Halloween, the evening was shocked by Pia, where a strike involving several people cut off the side of the Poste.
Four light blessed ones would at least be regretted.
Warned, the gendarmes came to place to separate the bands and ensure that the blessed are supported.
Singapore's guest priests benefit from the medium classs involving the ceinture
In the winner of Bendemeer's commercial center in Singapour, Janani Amirthalinga offers a bracelet, a bag and a pair of goldy ears to pay the school costs of her girls.
"My husband and I have come to buy a house, so all my money went from there," says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she won $3,000 from Singapore (2,400) per month as a administrator and its husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she says.
Indeed, the request is such in some parts of South Asia – where the incentive of households – that ValueMax, where it has done its transaction, has become the third company of loan credits to be introduced in the Singapore bourne this week.
In the case of Ms. Amirthalinga, it is almost good market as non-profit banking loans.
In general, Singapore grants provide an effective annual interest rate of 17 per cent, just over 15.4 per cent offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local fund sharer with a succursale succursale in the same commercial centre.
However, payment creditors have the advantage of not requesting solvency or payment proof, and the loans can be delocked more quickly than banks.
Thus, millions of people around the region are turning to payment priests while families feel the pressure that increases the lives costs and the overcome of households and consumers.
After five years of solid growth since the global financial crisis, and the good market credit provided by a too laxist monetary policy in advanced economys, the families of low and medium-sized income are turned to payers to gather the difference while their economies know a decline.
This week, the Standard & Poor's Rating Agency mentioned the growing incentive of households, mainly decreasing the increase of hypothetical loans, as a risk factor for Asian bank solving.
She stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore registered the final ratio of brutal domestic households/products in Asia.
Malaisia has a list head of 80 per cent of GDP, while the rate was 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also afraid of the high level of consumption in Thailand, which has just been out of a technical recession this week.
Thursday, data have shown a continuous decline in exports and a decrease of consumer demand.
"The balance is that by increased costs, people in the environment or down [of the wages] are trying to complement their income as they can", says Song Seng Wun, economicist at CIMB, a malaria bank.
The historically high gold prices over the past two years have been understood to make personal effects to touch the value in the species of their hills.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of the items employed in the 200 shops of shipment in the state state are in gold.
People say, "The gold price is high, put the gold chain in the next month, and we will return to the next month."
In Thailand, the largest loan business operator, EasyMoney, has registered an increase of 20% of the number of customers using its business during the last months.
The increase in the loan sector as valueMax, business operator in Bendemeer and 15 other businesses, such as Singapore, requires to be developed not only in neighbouring Malaisia – where it already accounts four boutiques – but also outside Asia, says Yes Lee Ching, its general leadership.
The company will finance them using 60% of the 66% of Singapore's $66 million that she took this week during its introduction in Singapore's bourse.
While some reduced rate creditors have responded to the criticism for the exorbiting interest rates they practice, Mrs. Yes indicates that the income allocation offers not only less higher rates than other prizes, but also that the debt is not directly increased.
"Clients hide the goods they have already, and the fact that monetating their personal goods do not increase household decline," she says.
Income is better accepted socially as a means of obtaining a short-term financing.
Those who are employed in cash prior are not only those who have financial problems.
Singapore's age people are also in the shopping shops on ValueMax to place gold rings or Rolex clocks, which may represent up to 60% of their purchase prices in species.
We're seeing customers of all the company's bags.
"It may be associated people who need short-term employees for trade activities or investments, or small businesses that have need to spend hard caps", adds Ms. Yes.
Sometimes they just need money very fast.
Juvenile pornography pastor accused in New Scotia
A youth pastor in the New Scotia region of Halifax is accused of youth pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, a 30-year-old age, was arrested on Thursday morning after searching in his home and at the Bureau of the National Research Council where he works.
The Baptist Church of Timberlay, where the pastor was opposed, was deeply affected by this new.
In a communication, the church responsibilities indicate that Mr. Hudgins has dismissed his post.
The pastor was released under conditions.
In particular, it should not be communicated with people under 18 years of age and not access to the Internet.
It will compare in the Provincial Court in Halifax in December.
It becomes a Nazi uniform at the supermarket, before being cast
A man who was clothed by a nazi uniform barried from a brazil with the gammated cross was requested to leave an English supermarket, customers who have been complainted to the officer who called the police, announced the winner on Friday.
"We received several customer complaints, so we asked him to leave the store," explained a talk door from the Asda supermarket chain.
The shop called the police to rescue, but "the time that she arrived, he was already gone without saying", she added.
I did the snake when I saw a woman who looked like a buleversed.
People were sweet mouth.
"You don't get this out in the street less you want to get attention," a customer, Rosina Rusin, 60 years old, showed in Cambridge News.
This incident occurred on Thursday, the day of the Halloween Festival, where it was pleasant to be shocked in a monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a channel.
A man from Cambridge returned the responsibility of this act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
"I take a black SS twice a week in Asda," said Paul Dutton, explaining the suffering of "the mental problems".
Safety Plan of $325 for the Tasmanian Health System
The federal government maintains that the $325 million saving plan for the vacuum health system is strictly associated with strict conditions to ensure that the Government of the State does not use the funds.
The Federal Minister of Health of Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth currently takes “urgent measures” to end a crisis caused by the ageing of the insulary state, the high rate of chronic diseases and the contradictions of the system.
The financing, for four years, was decided after government consultations with the independent deputy of Tasmania, Andrew Wilkie.
“The Government has proposed an emergency saving plan that will, as we believe, resolve the unique difficulties to which the State is faced,” said Mrs Plibersek today.
The $325 plan includes a $31 million campaign for non-urgency surgery operations.
2 600 additional operations, including in the field of orthopedic and cataractic surgery, will help to ratify the delay.
Funds are also planned for clinics without giving you in Hobart and Launceston, foreign care, for medical framework training, mental health services and for the deployment of electronic medical files systems in local hospitals.
“These investments respond to the idea that, according to the first line clinics, it is the best way to cure Tasmania's health system,” said Ms. Plibersek.
The Minister stated that the Government of Tasmania would face a strict report preparation and accounting scheme.
The State must maintain current funding levels in order to receive the money from the Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on sectors in which it costs additional funds.
A three-person composition will be established to ensure that the State provides services as effective and efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not be counted for large-scale “less they are followed by a real reform that allows to consolidate the public health system of Tasmania.”
He, however, welcomed the Government to have responded to the request of urgent assistance submitted to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
"I hope that the federal aid plan will greatly contribute to the removal of the public health system of Tasmania from the black list," said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the Government of the State, these additional non-urgence procedures will largely involve recent cuts.
But Peter Dutton thinks today's advertising is a “a solution of happiness.”
“The reason why we are here is that the State working government has retired $430 million from its health system,” he stated on ABC TV.
There can be no State government that shoots almost a half billion dollars and the Commonwealth, which meets $300, and claims that it is a fast day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar from the Safety Plan will be expendied in additional bureaucracy.
The adjustment by Guillaume Nicloux of the Roman of Denis Diderot is a marvelous artistic direction and a minute of time-reconstitution, but it is also more working than it should not be.

Syria has destroyed its capacity to produce chemical weapons, declared the supervisory body
Syria has destroyed the essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gas, declared the International Chemical Weapons Monitoring Organization, while violence in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are stored.
A group of Syrian warriors also declared that more than 120 000 people were killed since the beginning of civil war in the country is nearly three years ago.
The Advertising of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OIAC) was held with a advanced day on the limit date
1 November by the organization based in the Haye ordering Damas to destroy or make "unnecessary" all chemical weapons production units and machines intended to mix toxic gas and to fill munitions.
The completion of what is mainly the initial destruction phase is an important stage of the ambitious calendar to destroy the chemical weapons of Damas from the mid-2014.
With the destruction of the equipment, Syria will no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damas must still start the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is believed that the country has approximately 1,000 tons of chemical products and weapons, including moutard gas and sacred neurotoxic agent.
The announcement was made while the battles were rare in the city of Safira who, according to experts, opened a chimical weapons production unit as well as stocking sites, reported the Syrian Human Rights Observatory based in Britain.
The armed group, following human balance evolution through a network of warriors based in Syria, announced that 120.296 people were dead.
Among them, there were 61 067 civilians, including 6 365 children.
On the side of the Government, 29,954 members of the armed forces of President Bachar el-Assad found the death, 18 678 struggles of the prosecutive forces and 187 of the Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Among the dead, also, 2 202 were deserts and about 5 375 of the opposition fighters, whose number were foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 1000,000 people were dead in the conflict since March 2011.
She has not updated this number since.
About 2 million people had to run the country because of the conflict.
El-Assad's troops are fighting against the rebelles, whose many are linked to groups of Al-Qaida networks in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory stated that there were losses of both sides, but no specification was given.
Battles highlighted the importance of dangers faced by the inspectors responsible for chemical weapons while they have to complete their mission, which is to defeat Syria's toxic army in the middle of a civil war that loss, within a slaughtered period.
A declaration of the IAIC, which works closely with the United Nations, indicated that its team was “a satisfied with having controlled – and destroyed – all the declared critical production and machinery for melange and fulfilment.”
She added that “no other inspection activities were planned for the time”.
Before the week, the inspectors said that they had completed the first step of the verification work, visiting 21 of 23 sites declared by Damas.
They couldn't visit the last two sites because of their concerns on their security, the inspectors indicated.
Thursday, OIAC said that the two sites were, according to Syria, "is abandoned and ... the elements of the chemical weapons programme that they had had been moved to other declared sites, which were inspected."
It was difficult to know first whether Safira's unit was one of the two sites that the OIAC inspectors couldn't visit.
Syria has submitted a comprehensive plan to destroy its chemical weapons, which was approved in the month following the Executive Committee of the IAO.
"I welcome the moral strength and courage you all have proved in the framework of the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization," said the Director-General of the Ahmet Uzumcu organization, in a comment published by the OIAC.
Now in its third year, civil war opposed the Solar Muslim rebels to the Government of El-Assad and its security forces, which are supported by the members of the Alautic Section, a chiite Islamic branch.
On the other hand, the Director of the Syrian Human Rights Observatory stated that there was a strong merry explosion in an aircraft base in the Syrian Coast Province.
The cause of explosion remains unknown, it has added.
Anger caused by the punishment condemned against one of Bali's bomb powders
The survivors and neighbors of the 202 victims killed in Bali's attacks in 2002 reacted with angry against the last conspirators to be translated in justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shocked by a slaughter of execution.
Patek, who passed nearly 10 years of fleet as one of the most seekest men in South Asia, was sentenced to a 20-year prison penalty for his role in the manufacturing of explosive instruments used in attacks.
It could be released 15 years of age under conditional release.
The 45-year-old man was accused of mass murder for the attacks on two night boxes in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which caused 202 people, including 88 Australians, and made many blessed.
It was also recognised by many other chief accused in relation to terrorism, including a wage of expectations for churches in the whole Indonesian awaiting Christmas in 2000.
Prosecutors requested a punishment of perpetuality, so they would have been able to ask for the man, qualified by “Demolition Man” for his reputation of experts in the manufacture of bombs, to be sentenced to death.
The decision renewed criminal memories for June Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost his two ages of 39 years ago, Jane and Jenny, in the destructions conspirated by Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
At the board of the laughs, she said that Patek had to be sentenced to death.
I really think he had to follow the same way as the other men.
“It should be traced before the execution bottle” said Ms. Corteen to the AAP.
I have to live every day without having other kids, nor see my girls.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded in a garage guarded outside, was explosed just after 23.12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar when a mikaze made it shoot with two explosives at least 20 seconds ago.
He sleeped in the coma afternoon of the arrival and remained unconscious for a month, and he is "dead" three times when he was under respiratory assistance.
Mr. Hugues said that Patek had to know the same sort as the three other members of the terrorist Jemaah Islamiyah’s carnage cell – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
In fact, this man would have been sentenced to death before others.
Keep him alive, why there's no reason to keep him alive.
Over 20 years in prison after they killed 202 people and blessed hundreds of others, it's not much.
Patek is the last of Bali bomb pools to be translated in justice.
He was able to avoid being captured for almost 10 years, but finally was arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where the United States will kill the former Chief Al-Qaida, Oussama Ben Laden, less than four months later.
During the proceeding, an FBI agent said that reports of information have revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Ben Laden in order to restore links between the terrorist groups of South-East Asia and Al-Qaida.
“He didn't return,” added Ms. Corteen.
Until recently, he was shocking the chagrin that he could cause to other people.
The great was held in the 10th anniversary of the attacks that will be celebrated later this year and marked by celebrations in Bali and Australia.
“ There will be a lot of crying this year,” said Mrs Corteen.
Patek may, however, call on his condemnation.
FAA: Air passengers can now use aircraft gadgets (but do not pass a call with their portable phone)
Aviation company passengers will be able to use their electronic door devices to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music – but not talking about their portable phone – in accordance with the new very expected guidelines by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not wait for immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be established will vary from an airline company on the other hand, said the FAA Michael Huerta's Administrator at a press conference.
Airlines should prove to the FAA that their aircraft shall comply with the new directives and that they have updated the training manuals of staff members and the rules on the scope of equipment to be in compliance with.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airline companies to expand the use of electronic equipment on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are part of the company that have already been subjected to plans.
“In the light of the plan, we could approve an extensive use of electronic devices very closely” stated the FAA in a statement.
Currently, passengers must exit their smartphones, tablets and other devices as long as the doors of the aircraft are closed.
They are not intended to switch them before the aircraft reaches a height of 10000 feet and the commander gives its green fire.
The passengers are intended to extend their devices when the aircraft is declined before the aircraft is slow and do not slow them until the aircraft is stolen.
In accordance with the new directives, airlines whose airlines are correctly protected from electronic interferences will allow passengers to use their devices during the decoration, aircraft and roofing on the ground, stated the FAA.
Most of the new line aircraft and other aircraft that have been amended so that passengers can use the Wi-Fi to higher heights should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Flight awaitants, was happy of these changes.
“When the new security policy is implemented – and we will work closely with transporters for this – it will be benefitable to all", explained Glading in a statement.
We are frankly encouraging to feel like "sail supervisors" when this matter is.
But it will always be prohibited to connect to Internet to survey, exchange emails and SMS or download data below 10000 feet, said the Agency.
The passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other aircraft devices.
So not always Words With friends, the online online game Scrabble play in which Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he was issued with a great sound of an American Airlines aircraft after he refused to end his device while the device was guarded at the door.
And the largest devices like the portable computers should always be cut because they could hurt someone if they fly through the chain.
The swimming phones will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory power on portable phones belongs to the Federal Communications of the Commission and not to the FAA.
The FAA may put forth the prohibition of certain electronic devices during the decoration and aeroplane
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transport Security Board, National Transport Expert on CBS News, said that the portable phones were always considered as a risk.
"Portable phones are really a problem, not only because they could eventually create interferences with navigation instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could destroy mobile telephone fronts if they are used on board," said Rosenker.
A industrial advisory committee established by the FAA to consider the problem recommended the last month that the Government authorizes a broader use of personal electronic devices.
The weak pressure on the FAA has been strengthened over the past few years to reduce their use restrictions.
Detractors such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argued that there is no valid reason for security for these bans.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to apply, since the use of devices has become an opinion.
Some studies show that at least one third of the passengers are forgotten to escape their devices, or delegate.
FAA began to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996, following interference reports with navigation and communication instruments when passengers transported FM radio, high-tech gadget.
New line aircrafts depend more on electrical systems than previous aircraft generations, but are also designed to resist electronic interferences and approved by the FAA.
Airlines allow their passengers to use Wi-Fi in crossing heights for several years.
Adjusted aircrafts to welcome Wi-Fi systems are also better at interferences.
The wide majority of line aircrafts should allow more electronic equipment to be used under the new directives, said Huerta.
Electronic devices today are generally employed from radio transmissions of very lower power than the previous generations of devices.
Electronic book readers, for example, simply escape minimum transmissions when a page is turned.
But transmissions are stronger when the teleching devices are money or send data.
Amazon.com is part of those who make pressure for the absorption of restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, corporation leaders launched a line aircraft of children's e-book readers and flyed to see if there were problems, but there was nothing there was.
This inspired members of the FAA Advisory Committee of Emotions on the question of whether the use of devices present or not a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he thought that the interferences from devices were real, even though the risk was minimum.
Other members of the Committee said that there are only anecdotic reports from pilots that indicate that the devices can interfere with the aircraft systems and that most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA authorizes pilots to request passengers to cover their instruments during low visibility conditions.
A group of the travel industry welcomed changes, calling them fullly sensitive arrangements for technological travellers.
“We are happy that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passager experience is not incompatible with security,” said Roger Dow, President and director of the United States Travel Association.
A helitarized bird in a North Sea platform was released in nature
A bird helitarized after being found on a pet platform in the North Sea, was left in nature.
A helicopter on the edge of a helicopter in the direction of Abderen last month before it was led on foot by the SPCA Scotland in its Safety Center of Alloa.
The Director of the Centre, Colin Seddon, said: “This water ring was probably a winter migrator who came from Northern Europe and found himself in the midst of violent winds in the North Sea.”
It seems to be successful to find refugees on the oil platform.
He added: "He was not able to go again, so we were contacted to provide our help."
The water rail was in good health when he was left.
Is the European election ready to do business with the Great Britain?
The Business for British campaign was launched in April with the promise of joining companies and to define what the rich and job creators want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we have commanded the most wide and complete investigation to the British business leaders and asked them what they thought of the Great Britain, the enterprises and the EU.
YouGov has interviewed more than 1,000 enterprises, overall representatives of all enterprises, sectors and regions of Great Britain.
The conclusions of the investigation will be a surprise for many.
We have found that the vast majority of enterprises are now trying to export outside Europe, concentrating on countries modernized and developed while EU States are stamping.
They want to see the Government to give a priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil instead of entering themselves in the long and archae of European institutional archanics.
When their opinions are requested on specific political points – from the regulation of monopolies to the products laws – most business leaders believe that the control of these key skills should return to Westminster's hands.
The unique market has occurred in a general miscontinent, and the companies say that the cost of the Brussels Regulation is disproportionate for the benefits of the European trade area – 40% of the major companies, traditionally the most pro-Europeans, are even agreed.
Finally, and even more, our investigation with business leaders showed that a major majority wanted to see Great Britain to continue initiatives to change the treaty and development of a relationship with the EU on trade and non-political basis.
This conclusion, which is found in all large groups and enterprises of all sizes, shows that the company's world insists on a “important change” which gives power to the United Kingdom.
The commitments are high – to change the treaty and better represent the interests of the Great Britain will allow 16 per cent of votes to maintain the country in the EU during a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt only one moment: this investigation shows that British enterprises support this plan to renewal the terms of the Great Britain's accession to the EU.
It also shows that enterprises hope that renegociation will be a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of return to the United Kingdom hands.
It is possible, and more necessary, to better represent the interests of the British companies, as the euro area is involved in the way of a more closer economic and fiscal unity.
The priority is to be the employment and growth in Britain and, as the conclusions of our survey shown, this means re-empty on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels regulatory approach.
United States on Halloween Colour
In the United States, President Obama did not derogate to the tradition of Halloween.
With his wife, last night, he distributed friandies to hundreds of invited children in the gardens of the White House to Washington.
Last year, Halloween's festivities on the coast were cancelled because of the Sandy's transition.
Thus, this year, the feasts have been cut off.
In New York, thousands of habitual people participated in the parade organized in the district of Greenwich village.
Everyone's overwhelming, tells one of the participants, Andrea.
I was finally able to put the cost that I had planned last year.
We're funny as a bitch, adds Rhonda.
People are happy.
That's a good kid, it's cool.
We really need that.
Halloween is a country party celebrated at the Toussaint velve, mainly in the Anglo-Sexons countries.
Alexei Miler of Gazprom states that Bulgaria's gas inaugures a new era of gas
The beginning of the South Stream gas construction in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said the Director of Gazprom.
“A historical event has been today: the construction began in the Bulgarist part of South Stream, the most important project in Europe,” explained Alexei Miller, Director-General of Gazprom, in a Jeudi statement.
This project is a key element of energy security in the whole European continent.
South Stream should allow to diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
A contractial difference between Gazprom and Ukraine's homologue, where the largest part of the Russian gas intended for Europe, increases the risk level in relation to conventional routes, adds the Director.
Miller added that the direct joinment to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "forever".
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream's gas at a reduced tariff since the whole project will be made in service in 2015.
Gazprom stated that the construction should be started in other countries that are in the end of the year.
The gas was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion meters of natural gas cubes.
Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reservation
The island of Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve, announced Tuesday the Tahiti News, taking a radio of Australian Radio.
This island, on the east of the Gambier Archive (France Polynesia), is the last British territory of South Pacific, Middle East between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory measures 47 km2, if three other small islands are counted near.
He is British since his occupation in 1790 by the Mutinites of the Bounty, the episode of the English Sea history that took place to three Hollywood adjustments.
Some decades of inhabitants, most of the mutins of the Bounty, are still living in Pitcairn, and their income depends on 95% of London's generosity.
The Island Council voted unilaterally for the establishment of a marine reserve around the small archipel, or 836.000 km2 corresponding to its exclusive economic area.
A member of the island's master went to London to ask Great Britain to validize this request.
Mike Warren, the master of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be the first step towards more financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the English Governor of Pitcairn, resident in New Zealand, and by the British Government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanctify these 836.000 km2, however, provided that there are means of monitoring, which is not the case.
There is no airport to Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or several aircraft in the area's supervision, and there is no port where military supervision ships are placed.
With regard to France, it must already conduct a very costly aircraft and maritime monitoring of 5 million km2 from the French Polynesia ZEE, nearby Pitcairn.

Life Prison for an elderly Chinese Vice-German
An elderly gouvernant of the province of Jilin, in the northeastern of China, was sentenced to the Tuesday for corruption.
Excluding the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of having touched more than 19 million yuans of pot-de-vin, reporting Chinese official media.
Between 1995 and 2001, the Head of Governing Body, who was also the President of the Jilin Bank, helped enterprises and responsible for obtaining contracts, loans or promotions in the exchange of money or gifts, declared the first intermediate Court of Peking on his microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took its functions in March last, made a national priority to combat corruption, estimating that the phenomenon was a threat to the existence of the Communist Party.
If the Head of State has promised that justice would be so intriguing with the powerful "tyres" with the "mouchs" - the sub-altern officials - only one of the high-rang responsibilities were sentenced, among those of the former parent of Petrochina.
The most recent case was the of the former head of the PCC in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after having experienced the highest functions in the State.
But the Government has not expressed its intention to reform the corruption system by creating, for example, an independent body of the party.
Two employees of the ICOC accused of sexual aggressions resulted from the complaints made against Jonathan Lord at a reign Commission's hearing.
Two employees in the Southern New Galles MICA were accused of sexual aggression against children following complaints against Caringbah's educator, Jonathan Lord, in 2011, at a Royal Commission's hearing on children's sexual abuse.
But in its opening statement before the Commission, ICO stated that “he had never had treated a problem of sexual aggression against children in his organization.”
The Director-General Phillip Hare was interviewed about two cases: an employee of the ICOC was accused of infringements regarding child pornography and a physical education monitor of MICA Caringbah Hall was accused of sexual aggression on children in the centre where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare declared to Gail Furness, a lawyer to the Commission, that he had known the first case but that he was not aware of the second.
He also acknowledged that the declaration of opening of the ICOC was incomprehensible by emphasising, “extern controls of the ICOC have been carried out and reported that children's security was an absolute priority for the organization.”
It was shown to the Commission that the ICOC had been informed that it had received the worst appreciation of four institutions in a auditing quality of the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who began working at the age of 21, acknowledged that staff management had failed with the Lord's recruitment and that he was obliged to check that employees knew they had to report any violation of the child security policy.
Before the year, Lord was sentenced for sexual aggressions on 12 boys for the two years in which he worked at the MYCA.
He was sentenced to a sentence of 6 years of minimum prison.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that the MYCA had an cultural problem preventing the staff of reporting the lack of Lord towards child security.
The staff members demonstrated that they had observed some lacks, including the fact that the Lord remained alone with the children, he watched them in private, sent them on his genuine, said that he loved them and let them play with his portable phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was covered by Lord and asked for children's protection training because she was worried about her behavior, said that she had found the responsibility of the services responsible for the childhood of the ICO Caringbah, Jacques Barnat, who would call Lord “a very intimidating and difficulty approaching the most time”.
The Director-General said he rejected the witnesses of the staff that they were reiterate to report these losses to their higher heerarchic.
Instead of that, he said that the friendly relationships they had interviewed with the Lord broke their judgment, and that they did not report his actions.
Mr. Hare stated that he had expressed his view of the Council of New York and South Galles, saying that, for the organization, the lesson of “the incident Jonathan Lord” should not refer to “the signal” by the staff, and the Council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to sign staff of confidential agreements, short after the complaints were issued, was taken by the Director-General of the ICOC Child Services Office, Liam Whitley.
He stated that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of the evidence elements but that it was a “except of zeal” and that it was not implemented.
The MYCA of New Galles in South was not a safe organization for children at the time that Jonathan Lord had been employed there, namely, between 2009 and 2011, declared the expert on sexual violence on children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of the Griffith university before the Commission.
He stated that there were “severe problems” in recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was held until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would take the opportunity to come back to the Prime Minister, but recognizes that his return is little likely.
In a meeting last night marking the fifth anniversary of his arrival at the end of his mandate, the 59-year-old man has known his opinion on various national policies.
Since his starting in June 2007, after a decade to the head of the country, Mr. Blair was widely prevented of discussing the British policy, limiting its comments to foreign affairs and its special role in the Quarter for the peace process in the Middle East.
When he was asked if he would like to restore the position of Prime Minister, Mr Blair would have answered, according to London's Standard Event: "Yes, of course, but it may probably happen, so..."
When many experts in such manifestations were gathered in Cardiff to address the Chamber's troop of the year, they knew that competition would be rude.
But nobody expected to win Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old child.
Not yet at the school and only a few months after having made his first weapons, the full-peak and the Shetland Toffee poney triggered during the three tours with a great facility and returned the first price, left the other 30 adult competitors behind them.
The two unreasonable – which are the same size – were welcomed for the presentation, attitude and style during the annual concours, which took place at the Sunnybank Headquarter in Rudry near Cardiff.
He was present against men and women in melting melons, and he had his plate box on the side a little detracted way to develop his 2-year-old Toffee poney around the piste.
Fenton was welcomed by the judges for his natural qualities of low-common drying for a child of his age.
And Tofee received very good notes for his presentation and personality.
Fenton had Toffee in gift for his threeth anniversary on March last and went from his shetland poney every day.
His mother Donna, a 30-year-old, declared: “Fenton and Toffee do a excellent two.”
They were presented against and against all, but both cut the gold cut and the rosette.
It was only the second time he would converse with Toffee and we were stupid with joy he won.
On the scene, people who didn't know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to make photo with him.
This young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in the south of the Galles country, follows the traces of his tea Sharon Howells, who has participated in strike competition for over 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, "It was electricity in the air and everyone encouraged it and applauded it."
He passed all the length of the current track and even if he seemed to be all small, he made a wonderful work.
Fenton is crazy of animals – he loves the horses, tractors and the rural world and has two pools.
By the way he began, he will certainly participate in the manifestation of the Chair of the year – and I am sure he will make a good performance.
A speaking door of the this annual manifestation said: "Fenton has only 3 years but he knows how to conduct his poney."
They're a good team.
The judges noted that Fenton and Toffee had well presented and how they deployed on the track.
They're looking for an effective team work between the poney and the dinner – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he was very proud.
A Chinese newspaper who launched a call “I will be remaned”
A Chinese journal that launched a first page call for the release of an accused journalist of propagation will be remaned, says a press regulator.
The New Express based in Guangzhou published a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later acknowledged the television that he had accepted powers of Vienna to produce stories about a semi-public society.
Now, the New Express will be on a “complete remanipulation” said the regulator.
The "remaning" order is of the Guangdon administration for Press and Edition, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several wrong articles on the Zoomlion company between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The edition of New Express was disorganized,” said the regulator in a statement.
He stated that he had decided to “impose a administrative sanction in Chen Yongzhou by removing his press card.”
He also ordered to the Yangcheng Evening News Group to take full remanence of New Express, and recommended that he takes an investigation on the persons responsible at New Express and immediately restore the journal leadership team.
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express on the financial irregularities presumed by a manufacturer of chanter manufacturers called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper once again published a first call for his release, writeing that he supported his journalism.
But then Mr. Chen appeared on a public television chain where he agreed to have published false stories against money.
“In this case, I weighed Zoomlion as well as the media industry and its ability to win public trust,” he stated to the CCTV public television network.
I did it mainly because I run after money and celebration.
I took account of my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's excuses, New Express published his apologists in the first page, writeing that he had not correctly verified his articles.
Many important suspects have recently made old television.
Specialists say that people are systematically binding to do their older people, despite a change in the law that has been voted early in the year banning the authorities to force anyone to infringe themselves.
Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft in "indisponibility"
Toulon, the door is on the road.
The radioactive vapeur fleet detected on one of the two nuclear chauffers of Charles de Galle in mid-October and when the ship was in the sea, it was "the dangers for marineers", but it is not uncompensed for the marine.
The Royale is in effect to confirm the "indisponibility" of the ship until the Middle November, "the time to take the correction measures that are imposing" on the reactor.
On the other hand, the DCNS company, a defence specialist, ensures that his teams and Areva's teams, covered in the Var for the opportunity, "actually intervention on the aircraft."
This is for them, inter alia, to change a pump on the defective chauffage.
"All is implemented so that the Charles de Gulle can make its planned deployment at the end of 2013", explains the DCNS.
And the National Marine shall certify that "no matters of the ship's activity programme" to nuclear propulsion.
Remember that the Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft is a intermediate period of six months.
He had appeared from Toulon at the mid-October for training.
This, in particular, is to qualify young chase pilots.
A "aviary request", circled in the reactor's reactor's confinement space, was then produced on the amiral ship of the French fleet.
According to the National Marine, the equipment has not been exposed to possible radio contamination.
For more than one year, I am even seeing a strong miscontinent from the people I meet: a monstrual re-evaluation of their properties, tax delay, permission costs of all kinds, administrative costs to end it.
Bref, unlimited syphony of our pockets.
Millions of disadvantaged dollars could be paid to allow a very respectful tax of those paying.
Any money eligible to contributions reduces their freedom of consumption and contributes to their advancement.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major enterprises, it is not worthy of the expenditure and the maintenance of bottles: a deficit cultural centre, a strong subvention to the city of energy, etc.
If these installations are not rewardable, they are sold to the private company or are demolizable.
It is also worth noting the expropriation of several properties to welcome a major industry that has never come.
However, I give an honourable reference to the transformation of the old Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but to what costs for tax payers?
This is not the public markets to invest in such companies, but the private sector based on the request of consumers.
Citizens have been happy to learn that fish lakes and Piles will continue to supply the potable water city.
After the department of all industries (grand water consumptors) and the large decline of the population, water use has significantly decreased throughout the territory.
Unlike the gaspiller, the city will never miss water and severe regulations about its use could be greatly frozen.
Summary, it is easy to realize great things with the money of others.
I would've been horrible to defend such a balance.
With a brutal debt of more than 200 million dollars, this city is even no longer able to buy a store without pass by a payment regulation.
We are managed for more than 40 years by cravated with beautiful diplomas for most and I don't think that a smooth lift makes worse.
Discovering a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own fertile way
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug traffic between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems, has been found.
The United States authorities described the tunnel of 4 feet per 3 feet as one of the most sophisticated passages they have never seen.
The tunnel, zigzagant on an equivalent length near six long football fields, connects traps near Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, in the United States.
The area controls indefinible trails, which allows to easily dismiss the drug cars.
The tunnel was closed before drugs were resurrected while passing unexpectedly, the authorities declared.
The authorities took 8.5 tonnes of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the tunnel’s discovery, according to the judicial records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as heatings, were accused of possession of marijuana and cocaine with intended to sell.
They seek a sentence of ten years of imprisonment if they are sentenced.
In Nogales, in Arizona, trafikers operate of large subterranean draining channels.
The tunnel is the eighth important passage found in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered after the marijuana collection in the centre of Mexico in October, so that it is a challenge for drug cartels that must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of about 700 meters of fertile roads from the kitchen of a house of Tijuana and went up to two San Diego's trap.
The British police will deliver an extradition mandate against Assange
The British police today delivered an extradition mandate against the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who refugeed at the Ecuador Embassy in London and requested political asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that she had issued a “remixing opinion” against Australia of 40 years, requesting him to submit to a police committee, adding that if he did not, it would be possible to be arrested.
Assange could be extracted in Sweden after the complaints of sexual crime, after having cut out all possible ways under the British law after the Supreme Court has invalided the call that he had undertaken against its extradition at the beginning of the month.
Having disappointed that Stockholm authorises his transfer to the United States, he found refugee to the Ecuador Embassy in London on 19 June, requesting that South America's political asylum country.
Scotland Yard had “a sentence against a 40-year-old man who requested him to submit to a police officer at the date and time of his choice” said a speaker.
It continues to free the conditions of its freedom under warranty.
The Ambassador refused to comment on the release of the opinion by the police.
She was afraid to be extracted from Sweden to the United States where it could be accused of spontaneity, after reporting more than 2500,000 American diplomatic cable on the WikiLeaks website against secret information.
How biometria is going to invade our lives
Find the passwords to tapper to access your smartphone or pay his purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers foretold a future where we will be recognised by the biometric telephone capteurs and computers.
Bernard Didier, Adjoint Director of Morpho, even thinks that "the century will be biometric."
Only biometria will enable a person to identification of transactions in such transversal and transnational universe as Internet.
The organizations for the protection of private life confirm this rule for biometria, but are worried about it.
Only in 2011 and in France, the National Commission for Intelligence and Freedom has authorized 774 operating recognition systems, the form of the veinous hand or network in businesses, administrations, cantines...
"All worlds will soon be identified, whereeverever and whereeverever," said Justin Brookman, responsible for the private life of consumers within the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology), in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, at ones and pessimism, among others?
Biometria will support new techniques, which will allow new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most useful biometric data are digital presses, the hand coverer and the ventilative network of palms or dogs.
But each of these technicians has its contractuality.
"For example, some people working in the beton have very sweet dents and their loads are illegal," says Philippe Robin, technical director of the identity field in Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection, as well as the verification of the veinous network and the back of the hand requires a voluntary and specific management of people.
This is both a security - it is not possible to capture these data to their use - and a inconvenience: the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore take time.
Consequently, research is conducted since twenty years on other approaches, such as the recognition of the face or the leave (the colored part of the eye).
As a result, these techniques are operational, by increasing the specification of the sensors and the calculation capacity of the computers required for data analysis.
The accuracy of facial recognition has been multiplied by ten in the past five years, calculated by Cyrille Bataller, Director of Acccession Laboratory in Europe.
With our help, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have developed automatic border posts using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a face or a movement.
"Actually, we have research on the recognition of the voice or how to walk through sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment," says Sidhar Iiengar, Director of Security Research in Intel Labs.
A unique and unfaithful marker, DNA also produces hopes and concerns.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered as the last biometric data", confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, director of study, innovation and perspective in the CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very costly.
NEC proposes a valuable cost of $90,000 to analyze DNA samples on the place of a crime and at an hour.
Biometric uses are distributed in two groups: identification (reconciliation of one person among other) and authentication (see ensure that the person is the one he intends to be).
The identification was addressed to the delivery of identity papers until now: the biometric elements (impressed, photo, walking) have to be addressed with the information that the State has on all already established citizens.
This allows us to ensure that someone does not try to use the identity of someone else.
This comparation principle may have other applications.
NEC thus proposes the recognition of VIP in the entry of a hotel or a shop.
"We will recover the images of the monitor cameras and compare them to the photos of the festivals freely circulating on the Internet", explains Dany Nassif, responsible for NEC France, the commercial development for biometric identification solutions.
Another use: take in photo a quidan that makes the cheese in a store, follows its progress thanks to facial recognition and calculate the time of wait.
Authentication was related to physical access (frontiers, protected places, cantines...) or logical (opening of a computer).
If you've been added, recently, the presence control.
"A biometric point avoids the phenomenon of the companion that points for another," says Cyrille Bataller of Acccessure.
However, the authentication will also refer to transactions, in particular those carried out from Internet connected devices.
In Japan, it is already possible to retire the money to some distributors by introducing his card and sharing his hand on a biometric reader: this gest replaces the fraction of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneve-d'Ascq and Angoloulêm by Natural Security Company in partnership with banks and teachers of the great distribution: at the time of paying shop with his banking card, the customer does not cover his code, but introduces its duty in a changing machine.
The experimentation is planned for six months.
If it is concluded, biometric readers could soon arrive in French traders.
Tracks to recur users
There are three ways to make the seducing biometrie in the eyes of the great public.
The first is to explain that it can win from time.
"If, through biometria, a customer remains in slowly thirty seconds, it's appreciative," explains the director of a large surface.
The second is offering customs services: in some years, a vocal server will recognise your voice and propose options on measure.
And, finally, safeguarding the precautions taken to protect the databases.
"Digital presses are stored on a first server; identities of persons are on a second basis: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a high-secure bottle, which is blocked if you try to move it", says Philip Robin of Thales.
But, in need of deep studies, it is impossible to know if these talks really convince users.
The specialists of the protection of private life, they continue to worry.
"The progress of facial recognition, the multiplication of monitor cameras and the large number of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, are worried about the worst: a generalized oversight," said Andrew Patrick, Commissioner for Privacy Life Protection in Canada.
A driver runing 210 km/h with a warm wood among the feet saw a swimming quarter of 1 000 £
An automobilist saw an amendment of 1 000 £ to run at 210 km/h with a warm wood put in balance between his feet.
Andrew Howie, 35 years of age, has been conducting his Mercedes Benz on the A120 higher of Braintree on May 27th.
When the police stopped it, they found the wood to take between his feet.
In the Court of First Instance of Colchester, Howie acknowledged the infringement of conduct without caution and the required attention.
The seven points retired on his permission led to a 6-month delay.
Howie has also been sentenced to pay costs resulting from 90 £ and a surtax for victims of 100 £.
A tax on foreign real estate owners to cut the ball in London
The Treasury has providingly encrypted the measurement of capital profit tax but expected a final decision by Mr. Osborne, which, in the 2012 budget, registered a duty duty of 7 per cent for properties that cost more than 2 m2 and annual costs for buyers who choose to hold properties within a company instead of individual title.
The duty of timbre is already applicable to residential properties of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea rounds, and is 708 £ for the fiscal year 2012/13, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Galles country, Scotia, Northwest, Northwest, and the New Yorkshire and Humber region.
Mr. Cooke said: "In addition to the increase in the right to smooth on the properties of great value and the introduction of the anti-evitation law, it is very difficult to advance that large value properties are subject to independence on the effects of the obsolete housing tax system."
"But this change could make foreign investors reciprocal to the idea to buy propertys in London or current reciprocal owners to the idea of sell", he added.
Prestitive immobiliary – 5 to 10% of the highest prices of the immobilier market – in the prosper sector situated in the south-west of London that escaped from Fulham in Wimbledon has increased 11,8% in the last year.
The prices in the centre of London show a regular growth in the year of 5,6 per cent but were elected by a full-scale internal market, the south-west of the city, the north (7,4%) and the east (6,5%), according to Savills studies.
Scientists come to light the way the movements of a dog are linked to their humor.
Recent studies have revealed that the happy dogs have increased their hair to the right (of the point of view of the dog) while the nervous dogs removed it more to the left.
But now scientists say that dogs can detect these subtle differences and answer it.
Professor Georgio Vallortigar, a neuroscientist of the Trent university, said: “All knows that, in the man, the left side and the right side of the brain, in a different way, are involved in the stimulations that develop positive or negative emotions.”
Here, we tried to see what he was in other species.
He added that, as in humans, the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and the seversa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the movement of other dogs disordered chair, researchers followed animals in viewing films where other dogs were.
They measured the heart frequency of animals and analyzed their conduct.
It will not be necessary for a long time before we understand why their cheese is sometimes on the one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigar explained: "We presented the dogs of other dogs – or a naturalist version or silhouette to avoid any other confusion factor – and we could trace the shooting movement and present it as more left or right. "
When the animals saw a dog without expression to remove the cheese to the right (of the point of view of the dog that removes the cheese), they remained perfectly widespread.
But when they repeated a chain was mainly to the left (only once from the dog view that removes the cheese), their heart frequencies accelerated and had anxious appearance.
Professor Vallortigar said he did not think the dogs were communicated with them through these movements.
Instead of thinking that dogs know by experience the movements they should or should not worry.
He added: "If you meet several times other dogs and if you notice that, most of the time, their rain movement to a side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react according to this experience."
The researchers indicate that the results could enable owners, veterinary and closing to better appreciate the emotions of their animals.
The Canin Comporting Expert John Bradshaw, professor invited to the University of Veterinary Sciences, explained that this was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team of Lincoln's university found that dogs turn the head to the left when they looked at a aggressive dog and right when it was a joyful dog.
And in another scientific study carried out by the University of Victoria in Canada, he stated: "Dogs went easier to a dog when the dog moved to the left than to the right, instead of getting anxious, the contrary to what is found in the Italian study."
He stated that differences could come from the fact that dogs participating in various studies did not consider completely the animals of films or dogs as dogs.
An study on how dogs react to true dogs might be useful, explained.
“ Although many elements mentioned in different mammals indicate that the both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, a lot of details must still be specified – and do not make the dogs exceptions” said it.
However, given the facility with which their behaviors can be registered, it will be certainly not long before we understood why their cheese sometimes moves from one side and sometimes from the other.
Arctic Monkeys reports a concert in Glasgow because of Alex Turner's disease
The Arctic Monkeys rock group reported a concert in Glasgow after diagnosing a laringite to his songer.
Sheffield's group was to take place on Thursday in the concert room The Hydro in the center-ville.
However, his laringite forced the songer Alex Turner to reprogramme the spectacle.
The announcement was made after the group was forced to report a concert at the Burmingham LG Area on Thursday.

Pape François names his first cardinals in February
The pape François calls new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on 22 February, announced the Vatican Thursday.
Cardinals are the men of the highest church placed in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who else it, so François will call his first group of men who will choose in definitive way their successor.
There are 201 cardinals at the current time.
However, while a cardinal reached the age of 80, it can't be involved in the election of a pape – so it returns to a group of 120 'cardinal electioners'.
In a declaration announcing the new, the father of Federico Lombardi, a Vatican's speaking port, said that a meeting with all existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony during which eve will be higher to the dignity of cardinal, known under the name of constitution.
"Pape François decided to communicate his decision to convoke the composition of February in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings that require the participation of the cardinals from different parts of the world", said Lombardi.
Jack Valero des Catholic Voix declared that from February this time the number of electoral cardinals would probably decrease.
He stated that a pape was generally appointed both cardinals that it had to be required so that the number of electoral cardinals reached 120 and more than 80 years older cardinals.
The composite of the next year will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pape François in March of this year, Valero said.
At the time there is a kind of tendency to privilegle Europe and in particular Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope would name the cardinals of the rest of the world to restore the balance," he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
Cardinals will also be selected since François has formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinal groups of the whole world to consider the ways to reform the church.
Before, the pape decided all of it.
“Actually, François has chosen these eight cardinals to help them,” explained Valero.
He added that he was “tot as far as possible” that Francois requested the career advice.
But we have never known such a situation – it is totally new.
Valero stated that the papas were generally raised by the Hebrews representing large communities at the corner of cardinal, but Francois was “complete of surprises – so we don’t know who he would call. ”
GM recalls some of its new collections in the United States to repair the seat record
General Motors Co recalls nearly 19000 of its new pickups Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 to solve a problem with inclinable files manually, according to a weekend statement from the United States vehicle security regulations.
In some pickups, the seats were able to present a defect at the level of the inclination mechanism.
Consequently, dossiers do not respect federal vehicle security standards for head support.
“If the vehicle is covered by the back, the head support may not be properly protected by passengers, thus increased the risk of wounds”, according to the statement shown on the site of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
Remember models were built between 1 August and 10 September.
The GM pickup launched in June and represents the most important launch of vehicles for the United States first car manufacturer since his facility and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the owners of the default during the first hour of October.
NHTSA could not consider the information letter to the owners because of the arrest of 16 days of government activities, which increased the growth of vehicle sales in October.
The sales of Silverado and Sierra, which were resigned for the 2014 model, increased around 20% during the first 10 months of the year, said GM vendredi.
In October, GM sold 42 660 pickups Silverado and 16 503 pickups Sierra.
The GM's actions rated by 1.4 per cent to reach $37.47 at New York's bus on Thursday after midday.
A worker dies slowly under beton blocks
A construction worker is dead in several decades of beton blocks, Thursday before midday, in Montreal.
The dragon occurred at 11 a.m. on the Marquette Street, near the Beaubien Street intersection, in the rounding of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
Indeed, work on foundations had been deployed in this place for a certain time.
A mitoian foundation wall came to be struck over the past days.
The accident occurred at the time the victim came to arrive on the chain to restore his tools.
I passed in the car, and I saw the wall run with a big cloud cloud, said Sylvain Jean, who remains near the channel.
I'm disabled and I'm going to get out of the big bricks that cut him out.
We only saw a part of his two, that's so bad.
According to the authorities, the victim is a age man in the 50th working for a coffee company.
Reanimation manuals were tested by emergency services but without success.
The man hasn't survived his serious wounds.
An Inspector of the Committee on Health and Labour Safety was deployed on the places to investigate the circumstances of this drama.
The cry of disappointment of a Obama elector
I voted two times for President Obama, believed in the possibility of change
He said that Obama has made huge efforts made by the Delegated Party
Obstructionalism does not apologize the difficulties of the Obamacare site, nor the drones attacks
The 2008 Obama campaign remembered what could happen
Nathaniel P. Morris is a doctor of second year at the Harvard Medical Faculty.
I'm reading a painful book in these days.
It's a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the death of the second year of doctor and give me hope back.
He's called The Audacy to Win and it's the memories of the Presidential campaign of Barack Obama in 2008.
When I finished the medical accounts of my patients the night and I sleep, this book brings me back to the time that policies inspired millions of people and where the talks could cut you out.
The election ended by a scratch victory, and the presenters of the newspapers took the time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My friends cryed joy, and my parents stood all the newspapers they found.
A young visionary team was advanced to the White House and the nation was ready to change.
During the transition period of Obama before his function in 2008, he had 82 per cent of favourable opinions.
And then I'll close the book.
The return to the present is a hard wave, it's like coming out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, which are like far-remember memories, a tragic memory of the possibilities of the past.
The change has actually been made in the years that have followed the first time when I voted.
It had nothing to see with what I had imagined.
I put Obama's great achievements, from the pass of the Affordable Care Act (the law on approaching care) to the end of our army, passing through the end of the "nor did I see" and Oussama Ben Laden's murder.
In addition, I believe that the partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the field of immigration reforms, public health care, and Guantanamo's closure, among other things.
But after I maintained the Obama administration faced my couples and colleagues, I am not able to explain.
I am on the border of the political desire.
The Republican obstruction cannot explain the appeal of foreign leaders, nor the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the private life of the Americans, nor the accused of the accusators that reveal the wicked government.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Aulangi, an American citizen, without proceedings, nor the escape of public funding and the oversight of authorised expenditure during the presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report that says that the efforts of the White House to reduce the silence media are the "agressive... since the administration of Nixon".
And more recently, she cannot apologize the impossibility of designing a simple web site over three years after the Affordable Care Act was ratified.
I don't know if that's what I expected.
If I was 18 years old, I was supposed to understand that government could oppose the political campaigns previously.
Of course, the election function is not predictable because the political party of opposition and the events that happen, like Newton's masker, affects our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have recorded above seem to be largely the choice of the administration.
That's what I'm worried.
I again voted to Obama in 2012, but not because I was encouraging by his candidate.
Mitt Romney presented a confused and unrefined alternative that seemed to not allow its policies or positions to determine.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second mandate, was free of the pressure of future elections, would hold the promises that we had heard for so long.
However, while the rate of favourable opinions slowed by 45 % this week, it is still more difficult to return to 2008 through that book.
It makes me desire the many promises that have been engaged.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama has lost huge losses in the benefit of Clinton to the Pennsylvania's Primary.
At a sub-Campaña meeting, he said to his team that they should go back on the good way and remain faithful for their causes.
“I want us to renew our talents,” he said.
We need to remember who we are.
We are here five years later, Mr President, and I am no longer agreed with you.
The views expressed in this comment are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
Thursday, at 15 hours, a violent collision between a motor and a car resulted in Retinne Street in Fleron.
The motive, Jonathan, 26 years old, from Fleron, wasn't shipping.
Despite the rapid intervention of aid, it is deceived at this border collision.
Clive Palmer claims that Mr Tony Abbott had a conflict of interest in the parental congestion system.
Mr. Clive Palmer advanced that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has an interesting conflict on the parental assembly system because his daughters could be pregnant and benefited from this system.
The magnite of the mining extraction, which contests the payment of a carbon tax of a amount of $6 million, valided this argument to try to escape the issues related to a possible conflict.
Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial at the time of decided whether carbon and mining taxes should be removed.
But Mr. Palmer said that only ministers could have an interest conflict and indicated that the girls of Mr. Abbott were ready to personally benefit from these policies.
"He will have an important conflict of interest when he works on paying the parent's seat, because if one of its girls is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in the fact that she obtains or not a fellowship," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after its election, the election committee officially stated that Mr. Palmer had returned the Sunshine Coast Sea of Fairfax by 53 votes after recompense.
Mr. Palmer has advanced the idea of remaning the suffix system to accelerate the process.
The girls of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote was completed?
“We need a better system” he said.
Why couldn't we have a system in which you can enter, enter your coordinates in a computer, vote immediately and have the result at 6 p.m?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of paper crayons to mark votes.
Is it to be able to remove the result if someone isn't agreed?
From today, having a paper card seems to be extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has studied the possible options for electronic vote and recently published a joint review document with the New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59 years old, stated that his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take its new functions “a very seriously. ”
The exercise of public functions is an issue of public service.
“We are not looking for rewards, except for the reward of the history, because we must serve the community at a critical moment” he added.
The Wildlife Conservation Society of New York identified a new species of boss dauphine along the northern coasts of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, scientist mission at the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Animals and Good Marins (OCEAMM) returns to the Express on this discovery and explains the long process for the identification of new species.
Does the discovery of this new type of boss dauphine you have to be shocked?
It's a good news, but it doesn't really matter me.
If in the past, species have been described and identified on Morphological, Anatomic and Geographical basis, today, the development of new tools such as genetics allow us to improve our knowledge in sciences of the classification of species.
Moreover, these progress in genetic and molecular biology is not impossible to make the classification or possession of a species to a kind, a family, or even a order.
At the beginning of the 19th century, morphologists classified animals, based on morphological differences among species.
Today, some of these classifications are made due to the progress of genetic progress.
Similarly, two very nearly morphological species have been distinguished by genetics.
This is the case of the new species that have been identified.
For decades, the scientific community acknowledged two species belonging to this sub-familiar family: the Pacific boss dauphines and the Atlantic forest balls.
Recent analysis allowed to distinguish four species.
Why is this a discovery of importance as the Wildlife Conservation Society stated?
From a view of conservation, it is essential to know these genetic differences in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability.
If this population was already known for a long time by researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, only present at this place.
As a result, if a massive mortality problem caused by viral or accidental epidemia is in the region, we might have caused the extinction of a species instead of a local disappearance of a population of a more widely dispersed species on the Earth.
This loss of genetic patrimonie would be much more difficult.
A species is considered threatened or extinction in fonction of the number of existing individuals on Earth, i.e. stocks, and the possibility that it has to restore from neighbour stocks.
For the species of Chinese Sousa, whose population of the newly discovered species, its stock is automatically lower, making it vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located above the food chain.
They live in homogene habitats, in which there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This gene breast limits the creation of new species.
Instead, the most fertile ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can generate the creation of new species in the end.
We need to know that the marine environment is the least known environment.
It is preferable to send robots on Mars, to know what lives in the sea of the Mariannes, just 11 miles (11 km) from the surface of the sea.
More money are expendied in life research on other planets than in marine research and it is much time that it changes.
RBS suspends two traders on the market
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two tradeers from its market department of changes according to two close sources of the file, which shows once again that the overall survey of the regulators on debt market manipulations began to bring its fruits.
Some of the largest banks in the world, including UBS, Barclays, German Bank and RBS, confirmed that they cooperate with regulators in the context of the most important financial surveys in the world, where $5,3 billion are handling every day.
The two traders are the first employees of RBS to be suspended in the framework of the enlargement of the Libor interbanking rates scheduled.
The bank, which refused to comment on the suspensions, confirmed that the regulators received requests for information.
“The current investigation on this case continues and we will work fully with the FCA and the other regulators” said a representative of the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, nearly sources of the dossier declared that RBS had transmitted instantaneous e-mails and messages, sent to and by an older trade, to the British Regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and would have been suspended from his European accounting post for debts at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, who was responsible for the European accounting trade in Citi this week, was launched this week, while Matt Gardiner, buying higher deals at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
No of these traders did not condemn any accused.
The dossier of Mr. Usher included immediately sent messages to and by banking employees at Barclays and Citi Group, added sources near the folder.
UBS explained this week that she had intended to take action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma said that he was investigating the survey of change market manipulations in a number of Swiss banks.
In the world, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the United States Justice Department and the Monetary Authority of Hong Kong – examined the claims made on bankingers that would be heard to handle change market rates.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Swiss Credit also initiated internal investigations or receive requests for regulator information, reported close sources of the file.
Banks strike the immediate messages and e-mails sent for years to find cases of reprehensible acts.
The news regarding these investigations has been the marketers in a sector which has been one of the largest growth engines of investment banking units over the past few years, but has been sent in question this year because of the low volatility of debts that limit the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankingers tried to minimise the case by saying that it is almost impossible to handle the widely liquid market of changes, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader stated that, despite the high volume of daily change transactions, liquidity fractions between trade platforms and use of more frequently by banks of their own internal platforms “to explain that it is possible to start having an impact on the market in a few costs”.
The new occurred on the same day when the Swiss Credit announced that a trader worked in the office of London's negotiated funds had been sent to the London Bourse this week after it had caused a loss of $6 million in the end of the last year.
The bank quickly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with regulators.
“We are convinced that the trader has acted alone and that the case has been managed,” said a representative of the Switzerland Credit.
The investigation on Master Rob Ford has been shocked, supports a lawyer
After the police was confirmed that you had put your hand on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford fuming crack, My Clayton Ruby has never seen a "bacalized investigation".
My Ruby said to believe in the Canadian Press that the police had "notified or minimised" evidence against the master.
On Thursday, the police arrested Rob Ford's occasional friend and chauffeur, Alexander Lisi, aged 35, and accused of extorsion about the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in contact with the master.
The police has also observed the man who releases collapses to Rob Ford, indicating new court documents.
My Ruby was able to "inexplicable" the fact that the police had never struck Rob Ford or his home vehicle, or put on listening to her phone, supporting that the police leader Bill Blair chose to do not act against the master.
In accordance with the law, the police, who had been witnessing of suspected transactions in own hands, would have been very well able to intercepte the vehicle of Rob Ford, stop the master, and to investigate, even without mandate.
She could also request an instantaneous investigation mandate, if necessary.
The police leader did not comment, but Mark Pugash's talking port qualificated the proposal of Me Ruby of "blood and unexpected tendencies" to take place with media in a case that does not matter.
In the press conference, Mr. Blair stated that there was nothing in this video that could be "reasonable reasons" that could be carried out by a criminal accused against the master.
The European Bourses at Middle Session except London
On the exception of London, the major European Bourses evolve in low-seventh, slowly slowly by some news of deceasing companies, while Wall-Street is expected to increase.
In addition, investors remain careful because they believe that the American Federal Reserve could renew its quantitative absorption policy as expected.
In turn, after advertising an inflation to 0.7% for the whole euro area, the idea was spread among the market actors that the European Central Bank (ECB) could enlarge its monetary policy.
The futures of Wall Street are to preserve an opening of American actions, after two consequent reply meetings.
In values, Renault (-4.63%) records the strongest replica of the CAC 40, plotted by warning on the result of his Nissan Motor partner on Thursday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6,26%) marks the worst performance of the EuroFirst300, after having also published results in lowing this morning, and announced the creation in the internal structure of a bad bank ("bad bank") which groups 38 billion of risked asset books.
On the other hand, Vodafone (+2.45%) is headed by EuroFirst300 hair in response to a press information that wants to study an OPA possible.
On the market of changes, the speculations on the development of the ECB's monetary policy will be good train, such as John Hardy, Strategy at Saxo Bank.
The only mandate of the ECB was always on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reasons to act at the meeting of the next week.
We are expecting a strong decline of the euro.
In this context, the euro continues to respond to the US currency and has touched a lower of two weeks to $1,3517.
The same concepts support the euro area's compulsory market.
The Supreme Court valids the Obama Health System reform law
A great victory for the administration of Obama: the Supreme American Court today stated that the reform law of the system of health ratified by Obama was constitutional.
By 5 votes against 4, the judges valided the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Abordable Care Act, which requires citizens to subscribe a health insurance in 2014, with the desire to pay a amendment, and stated that it was constitutional in accordance with the Government's tax power.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, was raised to the four most liberal members of the Court, while the judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed their inconvenience.
The Court also valided the other sections of the Act of 2 700 pages, and also considered that the provisions of the Health System reform law, which claims that the level of liability in Medicaid should be subject to the loss of all federal fundings of the programme, was coherent in accordance with the Constitution.
The procedure to block the law was undertaken by 26 States and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All the major Republican candidates in the presidential election during the primary 2012, including the named Mitt Romney, were fairly opposed to the law.
Vibrant Hommage returned to old fighters in Menton
In the heart of the Trabourhood, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, the Thursday after midday, a wealth to soldiers and disfellowships of all wars.
The Deputy Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities were put in two of the three military carriages of the cemetery.
Acrobacy between Palestinians and Israeli borders of Gaza
Four fighters in Hamas were killed, and five Israeli soldiers blessed on Thursday 31 October 2013 at night at a violent slaughter in the border between Gaza and Israel, the most serious incident in the Palestinian territory for a year.
The only electrical center of the Gaza flag stopped working on Thursday, 1 November after the evacuation of its fuel stocks, announced the Palestinian Energy Authority.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam, Khaled Abou Bakr, and another framework of the Hamas Army branch Rabieh Barikeh, was killed by a chart bus torch at an incursion of the Israeli army in the east of Khan Younes, in the south of the Gaza flag, according to local medical sources.
Two other local officials of the Brigade Al-Qassam, Mohammed al-Qasas and Mohammed Daoud found death when a Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same region.
They were found later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters conducted a supervision operation in the border zone between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack against a tunnel raised by the Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, a Israeli chart and a blind bulldozer made a incursion of a hundred meters inside the territory before they were then retired.
The resistance was a half hour, according to witnesses.
In a communication, a Hamas's chairman, Sami Abou Zouhri, hampered the four "heroes" and claimed that Israeli soldiers had found death during the confrontation.
Hamas welcomes the heroes of Al-Qassam who have fallen by defending the territory in the incursion of the sionist employee in Khan Younes.
several enemy were killed and blessed during the operation.
"The Hamas ensures that Gaza will be a hell for the busy", threatened the door.
On the other hand, the Israeli army stated that the target of its operation was at the start of a large tunnel in the Israeli territory from the Palestinian slave, discovered on October 7 and intended, according to the army, to "terrorism activities".
Hamas returned to the use of tunnels to fight against Israel, saying that the purpose was to remove Israeli soldiers to exchange them against Palestinian prisoners.
The operation aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, explained an Israeli military communication.
During the operation, Hamas deployed a explosive launch for the forces of Tsahal (Israel army) and blessed five soldiers.
Israeli attack in the northern Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of the use of the terrorist tunnel for attacks against Israeli civilians," said also the army Peter Lerner's speaking port.
Furthermore, Israel has attacked a military base in the Northwest of Syria for a loading of missiles for the Chile Libanese Hezbollah movement, reported on Thursday 31 October the Al-Arabia Satellite Chamber.
A US responsible confirmed a "Israel flag" but did not give details about the target.
"In the past, targets were transferred to Hezbollah", he was pleased to add.
The responsibilities of the Israeli government refused to confirm any information regarding such a attack.
Concerning the "exclused sources" that she did not appoint, the Saudi capital chain stated that "the bomb was able to load air missiles in Hezbollah in Lebanon," referring to the powerful libanese movement that fight against rebellion sides of the Syrian forces.
Before, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, had made several marvelous explosions in a air defence base in Sonar Jabllé, near Lattaquia, on the Syrian coast.
This organization was not able to identify the origin of the explosions on a network of militants and medical sources.
Back to black and white for Mary Chouinard, who presents in Dane Dane his two new group choreographys: the first inspired incredible and poems of Henri Michaux, the second insufficient by the famous Gymnopedies of Satie.
A evening that allows to see all the capture of Chouinard, art to tics and black sight.
A white screen set of background walls.
On the skin, even white, in the imnse space that is the Houseneuve Theater, is advanced, profile, end as a line and black clothing, a body.
On the screen, an enclosure of Henri Michaux is designed.
The body, simple tract, take his shape.
And this is the form of the entire room: an enfilade of physical designs.
The dancers, totally black clothes, only hands and faces discovered, are waiting from each side of the game area, shoot when the next graph appears, the incarnant, and are currently ressorted.
This black and white game of Henri Michaux is made in swimming in single groups, in unitsson groups (a mass that makes it alone), in a large group of 12 single groups where each one performs its sign.
It is thinking of "First Gloire", where, alone, Chouinard performed a series of choreographical tasks written on cartoons, put online on the front scene.
It's the same principle, PowerPoint version.
Here, music is strong, percussions and electric guides.
Energy is high, rythm is always fast.
There will be a castle when Carol Prieur will fly under the dance mass, to deliver, micro in hand, without sovereignty or retention, a part of the poem of Michaux, monocord and monotone in the cry, and continue to dance.
And the music to divide, and the sequence of getting back.
This sound and energy discharge, long, if it can, end by smelling and smelling.
As it also makes the regularity of visual rythm.
There are some beautiful flashs - the creation of images has always been a strength in Chouinard - such as these hairs that swim or black tissue that long the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
The choregraph, instead of going to meet Michaux's work, was imposed, with its tics.
Result: The bodys appear to be flat in front of drawings.
Michaux's crowds, such as the forms of Geestalt, open a larger and giant imagination than dance, more porous.
Only the end, in negative, with its dancers touched by a stroboscopic light and the white signs in a suddenly black theatre, touchs the magic.
The public loved, the accommodation was warm.
The Gymnopedias, after the contract, are more rich.
The scene is part of green, dancers and a plan are recovery of tissue, such as furniture in a timely house.
On the piano, dancers were relaxed to play partitions.
They're inadequate music addresses, touching, giving a real fragility.
On the scene, pass the couples, in loved duties, very sensitive, even erotic.
Group work, small transitions, assemblies that move, shooting, the writing is less binary.
Bouffons appear, also the families of Chouinard, wooding the red nest, in loved women's paradise very polarized.
Love is carnassessors, flighters or players.
The shoe, the rise and the small crys are beautifully transposed the archaic, thanks and strikes of the body in coit, the beings that are found.
But the room takes his real fleet after the salvation.
A cloud comes to scene when the public leaves.
There, all are allowed: the fourth wall falls, the explored universes are superpowered, the cooking dancers, down among the spectrums, blowing, smoking, circumcising, playing applauses codes, cutting the snake in a sacredly calculated disorder that remains sensitive.
The joy and fool overcome, and it's the art of Chouinard, here, to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are the object of judiciary progress on Nortel patents
The group that has thousands of former Nortel patents has engaged in a juvenile prosecution of patents against portable phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that he has coffeed at the shuttle during the sale of patents that took place after the Northern Failite.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired the Northern Patents for 4,5 Md$, has sent complaints against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent violations before the United States Assistance Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly detained by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of having violed seven patents.
Patents contain technologies that allow advertising in relation to terms of Internet research, indicated the conclusions of the process, which is the goal of Google.
It was not possible to join the representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture phones that operate under the Google Android exploitation system, which frees feroce competition to Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made a initial offer of $900 for Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offer to several times, finally proposing $4.4 md.
After losing the Nortel patents faced at Rockstar, Google purchased the Motorola Mobility suite for an amount of $12,5 md, a part market based on the motorola patent library.
“Blessing failed in his attempt to acquire the patents concerned during the decades, Google has violed and continued to violate these patents,” reported the conclusions of the case.
Rockstar claims the most important damages and interests against Google, since it claims that Google patent violation is obtained, according to the complainant.
Exploration of a house in Gesves: a defect water heating from the explosion
The grandmother would have taken a cigarette at a gas fleet.
The explosion of a apartment in Gesves, which made two seriously wounds on Friday morning, a mother of 52 years and his 5-year-old boys, was due to a gas fleet from a defectuous water heating, indicated the replacement of the king's supplier on Friday night.
The expert covered on place by the parquet ensures that the origin of the explosion is totally accidental.
The grandmother had a cigarette while there was a smoke and gas accumulation.
The vital prognosis of the two victims is always undertaken.
The grandmother was designed by the exploitation and is shockly burned.
The little boy, who stayed at his grandfather and his companion, was on his side and was slowly burned.
"The two victims were entered and long-termly conditioned on place before they were taken to the Liège CHU, she was helicoptère to him in ambulance," explained the bogmester José Paulet, descending to the places.
Traumated, the grandfather was on the floor at the time of the explosion.
He was able to join the shooting squeeze by the remaining scaled scaled while the back wall of the house was totally destroyed.
The grandfather and locator of the neighbouring house, fragilized by the explosion, were registered by the President of the CPAS.
The pompiers of Andenna and Namur and the Arches police are involved.
The civil protection of Crisis has established the two buildings.
Egypt requested the first President freely chosen to preserve serment
Mohamed Morsi has prepared the investor serum, but it is unlikely that his triomphe day marks the end of the political conflicts in Egypt.
The Islamic Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a "new Egyptian" as he prepared the presidency's investment slaughter, thus became the first freely elected and successive President in Hosni Moubarak, who was taken from the power 16 months ago.
In his investment to the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mr. Morsi also became the first Islamic president freely elected from the Arab world and the fifth Head of Egypt since the monarchie was 60 years ago.
He was fully prepared before the 18 judges in black robbery of the Court whose building was built in the border of the Nil to look like a Egyptian temple.
“We'll be able to spend the next morning, a new Egyptian, and a second Republic,” said President Morsi during the solemn ceremony distributed directly on public television.
“Actually, the Egyptian people has put the foundations of a new life – the absolute freedom, a real democracy and stability – explained Mr. Morsi, a 60-year technician in the United States, is a Muslim Brothers, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years as an illegal and hardly repressed organization of successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police were watching the building when Mr. Morsi arrived short after 11 hours, local hours, following a small convoi.
Only hundreds of supporters were gathered before the Court to blame the new President, and, starting a rapid President of the years of Moubarak, movement was only slowly interrupted in order to allow the transition of his convocation to the very frequent streets connecting the city to the South Banks.
Considered as the "Health Rail" of the Muslim Brothers, his prestigious staff has been considerablely strengthened since his victory and sales talk during which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only of Islamic brothers but all those who want to end the work that was endeavoured during the 2011 raising up against President Moubarak.
"Egypte is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state", said Mohamed Morsi, in a blue and red cost, addressing judges present in the boise room where he has prepared softly.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to the University of Caire where he announced his investment speech.
He was officially welcomed by a military fan who played the national symne when he was put to you.
Marshall Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
At his arrival, he was welcomed by the song "The people and the army, the hand in the hand" shocked by thousands of people assembled in the great university's assembly.
Founded in 1908 and former Latin education base, the University of Cair became a fifth of Islamic students groups in the 1970s.
Mr. Morsi made a symbolic slaughter on the Tahrir place, where he went to the submission that ended the Moubarak's authorisation regime last year, and he pleaded to restore the Presidential powers that the Military Council, who replaced the former President, has deposed it.
But by accepting officially prior to the Court, instead of the Parliament as it is to use, it slows to the will of the army by showing that the fight against power has not been completed.
Mr. Morsi's talk on the Tahrir place was accompanied by spectacular popular gentlemen.
The shutdown in the United States slowed the increase in the auto market
The closure for 16 days of most federal administrations has led to the growth of car sales in the United States in October, showing the numbers published by the constructors, five of the six main performances that have been less than expected.
The three major Detroit constructioners show a two-digit growth in October 2012, but only General Motors did better than expected.
The analysts predicted in average 15.4 million in annualized rythm and corrected seasonal variations, but the market was established in 15.3 million according to the estimates of Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley's analyst.
In a note to the bank clients, he believes that this slow fresh cut is first explained by the 'shutdown' government and his impact on the feeling of consumer during the first fince of the month'.
However, GM has made a progress of nearly 16% of its sales last month to 226 402 vehicles, against 211 563 expected by the consensus.

Toyota and Nissan also show the sales lower than the consensus, despite hairs in a year of 8.8 per cent and 14.2 per cent respectively.
In the New York Bourse, GM action wined 1.4% to 16.35 GMT while Ford was 1,1%.

Do you think travel agencies belong to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to turn the trend.
The company revised its net benefits previsions to increase and expect record results by the vacants of Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel agency is now expected to achieve a sub-jacent benefit in the whole year between $325 and $340 before taxes, against a previous prevision of $305 to $315.
If the current previsions are reached, it will be 12 to 17 % of growth compared to the benefit of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
The Director-General, Graham Turner, stated that Flight Centre had performed 8 per cent of benefits in the first half and that the second half of the seventh had started into force, in particular as regards travels other than business travels in Australia and the United Kingdom.
“After the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present are rewardable, and several of them are good to achieve record results on the whole year before the deduction of interests and taxes,” he stated.
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally countries who generated the greatest benefits.
In Australia, the travel sector has rebonded during the second half, which allowed to compensate a home market of business travels in low-low.
Similarly in the United Kingdom, the Flight Centre's travel sector has registered good results while business customers have less expenditure.
His subsidiary in the United States has recovered losses during the first half of the seasonal request and had to benefit from the whole year for the third time.
Flight Centre's actions increased 3 percent to reach $38.20 last.
Unbelievers shoot on a hotel near the Caire pyramids
Unbelieved people opened the fire this Friday on a hotel near the Cairo piramids in Egypt without doing victims, resulting in a slight appearance with licensed employees.
The assaulters took the fleet, specificated the door of the Interior Ministry, the police officer Abdel Latif.
This attack happens when Egypt has almost no tourist received since the army decreed the Islamic President Mohamed Morsi early July and repressed the manifestations of his party.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, orthographs and gramms
In the context of English literature course, students must study at least one part of Shakespeare, a Roman of the 19th century, a Roman and a modern British fiction work in 1914.
The review will also present "new texts" to encourage more diversified reading.
A combinating literature and English language course will be deleted.
From 2015, students will have to pass an independent language GCSE and will be strongly encouraged to choose separated qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education must tomorrow publish its new English and mathematic programmes – the first materials to undermine radical review.
It will make changes in other fundamental materials in the next year.
In addition, Ofqual, the Review Regulatory Office, will declare a remaning of the GCSE structure, with a new and less currency system.
Expressed during the summer, Michael Gove, the Minister of Education, said that there was a “wide consensus about the need to reform our review system to restore public confidence”, insisting on the fact that the GCSE would be “the more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous”.
Studies show that English schools have less time to maths (116 hours per year or 3 hours per week) than most of the other countries.
Comparedly, Australian schools propose a average of 143 hours per year, and Singapore students make it about 138 hours.
Although there is no formal obligation to dedicate more hours of employment to maths, close sources of the coalition government indicated that the GCSE of deep maths – as well as the most important accorded materials in international classes – would likely encourage schools to ensure more time of course.
The programme will emphasize the “the problems of the real world”, including the financial mathematics.
This judgment means that a legislative text adopted in July in this State and which extends widely the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.

The former Head of Gestapo entered in a Jewish cemetery
Muller, who disappeared at the end of the Second World War without ever finding his trace, was actually entered into a common being of a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, claiming the leader of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in the image.
Muller hasn't survived at the end of the war.
"On body was entered in 1945 in a common era of the Jewish cemetery of Berlin-Mitte," he was assured at a large-scale day, supporting archiving documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, would respond to one of the great emblems of the African-Guerre.
The German secret services, the BND, were assured as well as during the summer of 1949, Müller was located in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Image.
Secret services were entirely wrong.
"In August 1945, the Muller's body was found in a provisional tomb near the former Ministry of the Reich Aviation by a command," says Mr. Tuchel.
He was taking a general uniform.
"In the left pocket, in particular, his service status with a photo," he continued.
Image also published a document of the Mitta rounding board in Berlin, showing that it was entered in the Jewish crowd of the neighborhood.
The President of the Central Council of the Jews, Dieter Graumann, declared that revelation.
One of the most brutal nazi sadicals is entered into a Jewish cemetery, it is an enormousness of bad guest.
"There is a large number of victims' memory, and it was insured in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is part of the important personalities of the Third Reich who have never been captured.
He participates in the Wannsee Conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final resolution" and was, in particular, under its orders Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logist" of the exclusion of Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

He walks in the bowl, the jungle and crosss rivers to provide free medical assistance
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in the villages of Cameroun
Dr. Bwelle and his team are almost all their weekends to see hundreds of patients
There are no many doctors in this West Africa country, at least 1 to 50,000 people.
Get here or through your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the 10 other heroes, for the election "The Year's Heroes".
This person will receive $25,000 to continue its extraordinary work.
By 21 years of age, Georges Bwelle looked at his sick father to change the periods of conscience and inconsciousness and become in hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was blessed in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroun.
At first, he had only a fallen arm, but he contracted a infection that propaved up to his brain, creating a hematome that he was going to bring the sequels the rest of his life.
“ There was no neurochirurg in Cameroun” said Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought it to the foreign if we had enough money.
Instead of that, Dr. Bwelle has been able to join his father in clinics and hospitals to obtain any treatment that he could benefit.
“It's not easy,” adds Mr. Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5:00, run to the hospital to be the first, and you are not the first.
There are many patients.
People can die because they're waiting too long.
The situation has not been much changed since the death of Dr. Bwelle's father in 2002.
In Cameroon there is only 1 doctor for 50,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
For comparison, the relationship to the United States is 1 doctor for 413 people.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Camerounais could not pay the consultation.
Two persons of five in the country live under the poority level, and almost three four of the country ' s health expenditure are carried out in the private sector.
“The only problem they have, is poverty” explained Dr. Bwelle.
And because of poverty, they cannot benefit from life.
After he saw his father and so much of his companions suffering, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team practiced more than 700 surgery acts freely during the last year.
It has become a doctor itself, working as a vascular surgery at the Central Hospital of Yaundé.
He created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which takes place in rural areas during the weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his voluntary group have helped about 32.000 people.
Almost all sales, with a thirty-five people, are covered in folgonnets after they have established the medical material on the roof and crossing difficult lands to become in the villages who have the most need for help.
The chance is not always following them.
They were able to push vehicles to cross rivers or swimming tracks.
But when they arrive, they are received in heroes: the community organizes a festival, song and dance and offers them the best available accommodations.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bwelle – with its great dream and outstanding energy – is more joyful to join the festivals.
On the next morning, the team starts to receive hundreds of patients.
“We receive 500 visits,” said Mr. Bwelle.
They sometimes live at 60 km from the village, and they come to foot.
In this hospital, various health cares are produced.
Many people receive treatment against poverty, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmissible diseases.
Others may receive skins, a couple of lunets collected or a free birth certificate – a document required to go to school, but many of the poor families cannot just be allowed to buy it.
Tonight, the practical team of simple surgery acts under local anesthesia.
Operations are generally practiced in a school, a mature or a house; after the intervention, the patient is up and returned to the wake room to leave his place to the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the electric group, the operation room and the sterilization of the material, Dr. Bwelle and its volunteers work until the first hour of Sunday.
It's an extraordinary rythm, but village musicians are generally helping the team to remain motivated.
“They thrown around the night to keep us wake up so that we can continue to work,” explained Mr. Bwelle.
Sunday, the team returns to town, fatigue and proud of the work she did.
The group, composed of Camerounian doctors and physician students, practiced 700 surgical acts freely during the last year, and knows that their presence can make the difference for those with whom they are helping.
One man explained that the free operation he had been subjected to the treatment of a hernie would allow him to work again.
"This will change my future and my family's future," said the man.
In addition to living in this indoor hospital and working as hospital surgery, Dr. Bwelle also works the night in private medical offices around Yaoundé.
This is the second job, it explains, which finances to 60% of its association; the remaining is covered by private donations.
"I don't know when it's there," said Katie O'Malley, a doctor student in the second year of the University of Drexel in Philadelphia, and volunteered in the group of Dr. Bwelle.
It is still in the hospital or in trying to find money for its association to be able to conduct these campaigns.
For physician students and nurse students like Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions, is an opportunity to learn on the ground that they do not have homes.
“We could participate in operations to help blend the blood or pass the instruments to Dr. Bwelle” explained Ms. O'Malley.
It's not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are a doctor in the second year.
Voluntary students generally pay their travel to Cameroun, and often arrive with collected medical material.
But once in Yaoundé, their pension, their transport and education are supported by Dr. Bwelle.
"He's a hero, there's no doubt," said Katie O'Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Camrounian people is not close to extermination.
For Dr Bwelle, relatively constant workload is not a difficulty.
Help others to live happy by holding the promise he promised to his father is something that brings him a great joy.
“I am so happy when I do this work,” added Mr. Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he's seeing what I do.
Make the people rise and emphasising pain are the reasons why I can do this.

The two France of Peter Nora
Perplexedly, universities have long painted to define and place Peter Nora.
Professor in amphitheatres and course rooms?
Nevertheless, but by emphasising his weakness for the cross roads, Sciences-Po, the High Editions.
Arbit other works in the Gaston-Gallimard Street office?
Indeed, however, ignoring the hidden work and the subterranean writing of the editor.
Heritage of the shooter that employs Source to the French Academy?
Of course still, but as a sacred one could not replace the true oil, the one of the thesis, which happened.
They were voluntary to recognize in him a great swimming, animator and federal snake of their work, but noting that it was little slow to produce himself.
To this image, the monument of "Memory Places" which he attached his name also contributed.
The wicked languages could see a gigantic market on the pounds, presented by a intelligent comment, with a vif shoot of edition, but uncertainly dilecting.
The two books published by Nora soon two years have already found that the one who passed to not write had much and well written.
The book that this is to make him ultimately justice.
However, once again, the temptation of equity, the intellectual vagabondment, the jubilation used to save as joint feet from one to another.
But rapidly it is understood that the disappeared objects assembled in this book so beautifully bring the broker to a single and the same passion: the discovering of the constitutional nodo of French identity.
Why these dramatic calls to national unity?
Identity: It's a time concern.
Here, we were collectively invited to give a definition.
But in the perpetual spirit of our value leaders, the French identity was an intemporary essence.
The case was obliged to deploy accidents, and the case, jacobinism obliged, was confidened to the prefects and sub-preferences, authorised interpretations.
Those who touchs Peter Nora is everything else.
It is not a heritage of everlasting frankness, it refuses to define.
Analyst is worried about a family strangety, it is wrong in a symbol forest, arrested at each step by a rebuilding object, tourned to irritating questions.
Does this, who is born from the company itself: why, in a so sustainablely installed country in its borders, if older charpent and solidly machoned, are these dramatic calls to the unity?
They're not so pressing, Peter Nora suggests that to conjugate the native problem of the discords of French history.
Francs and Gaulois, Armagnacs and Bourguignons, Catholics and Protestants: Division forces, here, are very old.
And of course the most embléatic is of course that comes in two the national history.
From the Revolution seismo, the French people have two stories and they have two nations, one monarchic, the other revolutionary.
The second desired the death of the first, but without reaching the nest; worried instead of finding sacrality and so much more aware of the unity and invisibleness that she had cut the head to him who was the obvious and powerful incarnation.
And from there, an inconveniently binary nation, shared between the left and the right, layness and Catholicism, worship and hate of the revolution.
To feel this uniqueness of French identity, nothing is the four steps outside the Hexagon, although the American escaped Peter Nora could be the heart of his book.
Because America and France have one and the other made a revolution, editing a Declaration of Rights, wanting to establish a new society.
But the American cousinship makes it just better to emphasize what is our own.
There, men who left their old regime in England and had no longer to worry about it.
Here, men composed of an Ancient Indigenous regime, and so widespread.
There is a consensual revolution when she seed the dragon and confidence.
There's always honored fondamental fathers, and here are the former revolutionarys whose templates are deceived to make models, and remaining inter-stituted.
There is an institutional contingency, and here is a box of constitutions, such as errors to ratify and try again.
France is going out, France that comes
However, there was a time in which the French people believed to be able to shut up the wheel of their history, and to win the maldiction of the two numbers.
To this III Republic, central and creative moment, Peter Nora showed much interest and even tenderness: welcome those who were then employed to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching students everything in the former France was deeply preparing the modern France and proposing a unified version of their history.
But this peaceful identity was just a time.
This is again discussed by immigration of a new type, threatened by the quantity of rewarded minorities, absorpted in the European space.
The book therefore offers both the fascinating French portrait that goes and seeks the circle of France that comes.
With, first, the portrait of the historic, which should book some surprises.
We find out that the road was a household.
Man of multiple curiosity turned, slightly obsessional, around the same idea.
The reader was at the center of the centre.
And whoever had put, this is more than a half-century, a subject on the idea of the nation, but was subject to the initiative of the thesis, trusts us, whose great outcome, that he would end up.
Securities in a less root shape, more eclated and subtile.
But we don't make it wrong, but it's too compromising.
Because more than the figure of the university cursus, this thesis says the internal need for life.
An old man in Lebanon: "The return is sufficiently complex to manage"
In Beyrouth on 8 March 1986 with three members of his "Antena 2" team, he came to film a manifestation of Hezbollah, the journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released nearly 21 months later, 27 November 1987.
Retreatment since 2008, he participated in the establishment of the World Days Defence Association, which has been presiding for several years.
Its main objective: obtaining the possibility of complaints and bringing their opposers to the International Criminal Court.
More than 1,000 days, the four decades of Aqmi (Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Feret were released march.
After medical reviews in the military hospital of the Val-de-Grice after midday, they have been able to find their families.
And try, a little bit, to return their course of life.
"The New Observator" questioned Jean-Louis Normandin, 62 years old, former reporter, retradition since 2008, President of the World’s Days.
Since the evening of your release, you were on the plateau of "Antinne 2" at 20:00 p.m.
What are your memories today of your release?
In particular, in Beyrouth.
When I'm free, I'll find me in the cover of a car where I meet - without seeing him because he makes dark - Roger Auke.
He said, "We're released," but I'm not sure, and I'm saying that we can still be killed.
We're very excited, but too tendencies.
It's war, and those who lead us are also very tender.
They're putting us on the board of a throat.
There are Syrian militarys.
Then we arrive on the Summerland Hotel site where the press is presented.
Francens bring us to the embassy of France.
It's the first time of filling to parents, family, friends, presses...
I remember I took a bathroom for an hour.
And dinner in t-shirt at the embassy of France.
I also remember a short night talking with Roger and Martini.
The tension is still here because we have no means to evacuate to Larnaca Airport in Cyprus.
Get up there in helicopters, we take a private aircraft that brings us to France via Corfou and Solanzara, where Pasqua is in boat.
How did your arrival run on the French ground?
We've got to Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's a little brutal.
There's an incredible bossulade.
And many media.
When I went, there were three TV chains.
I'm back and there's full.
The decent of the flight scale, the shoes with my son and my parents, my friends, all this is extremely strong in emotion.
Among the airport with me, many motors follow our car that Roussin drives.
The motards shoot up to make photos and follow me home where I have to make the police a little to prevent some of them to get away.
The mediac pressure is great.
It's not stopping, we're good to know...
But the state of feeling and fatigue is so hard to see it clear.
We're out of a garbage and we're all cut down under the mediatic fires.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, enough complex to manage.
But we did the hardest.
The evening itself, I'm at 20:00, the next morning I'm on the TV.
Then starts a kind of readaptation to life, very quietly, for one or two months, which are a little like holidays.
How were medical reviews and debriefing of DGSE occurred?
I had the right to first medical control in Corse.
The rest was done in the Val-de-Grice in the following days my return: radios, reviews in all kinds and meet a psychiatrist.
It is not a meeting that makes everything but we know that we can account on him, remember if necessary, that we are not delivered to us.
It is part of the procedure.
I also met the information services.
They asked me questions about the players.
It was logical.
It didn't hurt me.
How do you react today to the release of the Niger's four otages?
I'm listening to what it says.
The debate on punishment, in particular.
Some things are nervous to me. Otherwise.
I'm trying to do the part of the matters about my past as a hotage and my chat of President of the World's Association that allows me to get away, and I feel more interesting.
I ask, for example, about the definition of resilience.
On the other hand, I fight, with others, for the recognition of the legal status of the opposition.
I think there is a semantic problem.
It must be qualified to adopt “political” oppositions, which is the case most of the time - and allow the complaints to have access to justice, to bring complaints and to bring their opposers to the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and is joyful of the liberation of these edges.
But who said that these oppositions may also have access to justice?
A court in La Haye is done for this.
Why wouldn't you say to the opposers of opposition "You have cut the war rules, like those of all Geneva Conventions, we'll bring you to justice?"
It seems to be founded, legitimate, shocked with good sense.
This message is heard, but not listening, and that's my shame.
It's my main battle.
Egyptian Islamics on the street to condemn Morsi's Procedure
The angry is based on the borders of Egyptian Islamics.
Two days before the opening of the case of President Mohamed Morsi, they went down in the streets.
Mobilization in the whole Egyptians to call for the restructuring of the first democraticly elected President of the country.
This is not a prosecutor of the Muslim Brothers.
Until the lawyer couldn't meet him and no volunteer could take a copy of the documents of the case.
It's not a case, it's a bit.
The case of President Morsi is a false prosecution, is he who is to judge Sisi, not instead.
Morsi must judge Sisi for Rabaa's mastermask, Nahda's mask, and the massacre of the Republican Garden.
He's a liar and a trailer.
In Alexandria, the police used lacrymogen gas, 60 manifestants were arrested.
Monday, 20.000 police officers will be deployed before the Caire Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be judged.
Hagel reiterates 9 American States to violate homosexual rights
Since the Federal State recognised homosexual marriage, "all military partners have the right to an identity map of the Defence Defence Department and the benefits that come with", he recalled the Minister in New York in an allocation to the Anti-Defamation League.
"But some States refuse to leave these cards to the same sex partners in the installations of the National Garden" set out on their territory, or he refused to defend those States to violate the federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit many social or health services provided on these basis, or access to their shops.
The Secretariat to the Defence said he had ordered the Head of the National Garden, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the Federal Law.
The fraud of nine States began by Texas, which refused to implement these benefits on the installations of the Texas National Garden, due to conflict between the Texas law and the Federal Law on homosexual marriage.
He was joined in his refusal by India, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Caroline and Western Virginia, according to a high responsibility of the Defence.
Pentagon estimates the population concerned by the recognition of homosexual marriage to approximately 5600 active people, including the National Garden, the Reserve and Retreatment.

We don't, especially, misleading us.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, his founder, the "Part of the Banlieue" is not only addressed to the banlieusards.
I chose a map from France as logo, justify it.
When I speak of bathroom, I'm addressing all those who are excluded from the great national family.
He has not prevented his project, in Thursday, in a press conference in its National Community of Aubervilliers, that is born with the will of better defending multiculturalism, this great melanting pound cultural that characterizes before all the districts.
My proposal n° 1 is to create a Ministry of Multiculturalism, it indicates.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50 years old, territorially attached, now comes as "100% political" even if he has not always been neutral.
In 2002, he supported locally the Dominican Dominican of Villepin from 2010 to 2011.
I know well that the equality values I do in my program are to the left, but if the right people are ready to support me, I will also listen to them.

He said, “In some cases it went too far inadequate.”
And the President is resolved to try to clarify and clarify the people that it is now being conducted to a deep review of these practices so that no one feels wrong.

We have been beautiful and well prevented aircrafts to fall, buildings to explose and people to be murdered because we could know facts before.
