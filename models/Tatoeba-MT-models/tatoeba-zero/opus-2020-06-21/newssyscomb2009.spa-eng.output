Triunfo of the right popular in Austria, together with 29%
The previous elections to the Austrian parliament have taken according to the first approached results, a appreciative deficit of both parties of the current large coalition and express strengthening the party of the right popularist party.
Some strong and special losses have suffered from the Austrian People ' s Party (OVP), where the current President, Wilhelm Molterer, was severely rewarded.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the Chief of the State of Carintia, Jörg Haider, prepares its triunfal return to national policy.
According to the approached results, social democracy (SPÖ) remains as the strongest party in the country with a 29.8 per cent of votes, so that 5.5 per cent of votes are lost in comparison with the last elections of 2006.
The worst has still been completed by the OVP that lost 25.6 per cent, almost nine per cent of votes.
The worst results, literally catastrophic, are in the history of these two major Austrian parties from Poguerra and especially for the people who convoked these previous elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when the OVP was out of coalition, the people had a considerable benefit in terms of preference to the SPO.
But it is clear that the voters punished them for leaveing the naufragaary government.
In the first reactions to the results, speculations were heard about the division of the President of the party and, until now, vicecanciller, Wilhelm Molterer.
The observers believe that this Monday could be reached at the exceptional meeting of the party's presidency.
This evolution would clearly facilitate the path of the constant and closest start point of electoral results, i.e. the renewal of the great coalition between SPO and OVP.
In view of the strengthening of both the right popularist parties - the liberalists (FPO) have winned about 18 percent and the BZO, a ten percent of the votes - and the social democratics expressed their fears that the same year would be repeated in 1999 when the populations negotiated with the populations (the FPO was an unity, but in 2005 was moved from BZO) to a coalition government that came to generate sanctions by the European Union.
For this evolution that has clearly made Haider who has already announced that he is prepared to cooperate with any party and that he already returns to Vienna to national policy.
The Green Party has also been able to reach the Parliament even though he had slightly lost and went from the third to the fifth place between the Austrian political parties.
No other party has clearly exceeded the limit of four percent and therefore does not form a part of the Parliament.
Blackzenberg: relations with India can be frozen
If it is not possible to resolve the problem of the cheques scientists who have been accused in India by gathering illegally scharbachos, it could be a refrigeration of the Czech-India relations, according to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Karel Schwarzenberg.
This showed the minister in New York, after the meeting today with his Indian Homolog, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this would not be solved then, then, if it would be safely reached to this refrigeration", found after the meeting organized by the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that in legal matters difficultly can be put the executive.
However, he pointed out that in the case of Petr Švacha, which was exempted of accused and punished with a currency, the Government can negotiate with the local government of Darjiling, whose judicial law retains the matter.
"It could be resolved," said the Minister.
For Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years of prison, it would be the best, according to Mukherjee, to appeal to the highest instances.
Then it may request the exoneration of the case and expect the sentence freely, explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague was expressed in the same terms during the meeting.
"He advises to appeal to the Supreme Court and then would be possible the indulgence," said the Chief of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech party can enter into the matter is by obtaining the condemned "a competent legal support", expressed the Indian Minister.
On the other hand, he said that such a type of support was already obtained by the Indian party.
"We have the most interest in maintaining the best relationships with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize it," commented Schwarzenberg.
On the other hand, as he said, before his colleague, the Czech Republic emphasized the problem of the Czechian entomologys of a great importance.
"We really consider the prisoner and condemning these checos scientists aware of a tremendous error," announced.
The Minister addressed the answer to the question whether he received the promise that he would take care of the matter.
"I've received enough promises," he only found.
A arbitrary shock on the marine background
I am close to a wall map, in which he represents Australia around sea.
It is not interested, however, that the continent is only a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with her also the marine fund that it rodes.
The region is at the same time as a single continent," says the Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuossso, who belongs to the thirty-member team working in the United Nations Division for Ocean Law and Sea.
His head, Director of the Division, the Checa lawyer Václav Mikulka, continues to be exposed and, sometimes, complete.
Gobern this talent and enthusiasm of work.
The marine background has a unknown world, rich in natural sources until now.
Olive oil and other mineral prime materials can be found, but also unknown organisms lead to the key for the development of cancer drugs.
The fund is greater than the firm land
The coastal countries have started discussing oldly the new territories under the sea.
According to the United Nations Treaty, these are entitled to the rights agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is mainly the called Continental Borde, which sometimes extends some hundreds of miles from the coast of the given country.
This has, according to the Treaty, exclusive rights in all resources of the continental border.
"Singlely, through the continental Borde is understanding the part of the marine fund and its surface, which is the natural continuation of the continent under the water.
It comes to the border of the coast of the sea, and often, to the border of the twelve miles of sea, namely, clean economic area," Mikulka explains.
The request by the country given to the Commission, for the delimitation of the external borders of the continent Border, must be provided with scientific technical documentation based on investigations and measures.
It is the result of a series of years of work preparation.
" One of our tasks is organizing a technical and legal specialist assistance committee.
The committee has reached five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the last three countries mentioned have come forward," adds Mikulka.
Not long ago, the success of Australia had a global impact because it was the first that essentially extended its marine rule.
However, New Zealand also accompanied it — the sea background surface that gave him the commission last week is of 1.6 million square miles, namely, almost six times more than the size of the state.
Both countries have infected millions of pain for their study.
The winning that will be disappointed from the use of the marine fund will, as they promise, be inestimable.
Other states are also submitting their requests.
They can do it up to ten years since they ratified the Montego Bay Trade.
There the Continental Border begins the region of the Ocean fund declared by the Treaty as "Common Heritage of Humanity".
There, no nation has an exclusive position.
The law of exploitation in these areas is to be administered by the treaties established by international institutions.
"But the marine fund, however, is no gold threat," said the director Mikulka, emphasized, "when its separate areas are legally and clearly limited and its rule defined by contract."
Cheques in the Pacific
And today, a part of the marine fund belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is shared with other countries of the Eastern Block within the Joint Interocean metal organization.
This resulted in 1991 with a Treaty as investors as the same as other few states called "the pioneer investor".
It is able to explore the area of ClarionClipperton in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is something greater than the ancient Czech Republic.
There is an accident, it is something as well as a marine replica of the Tatra.
"A surface of a total extension of 75,000 square miles can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetal concreation rings containing niquel, cobre, cobalt and mananese," adds the Indian lawyer, Pakshi Rajan.
A macedonian employee of the Division, Robert Sandev, brings us a sample of this type of concreation.
Remembers us a small patch or with a bit of fantasy, the Shem, who, according to the legend, came back to Golem.
During the release of rehenses, the command of special forces was on the place of action
To solve the crisis of rehensus, the Egyptian Government had requested Germany's assistance and experts came.
When the situation was done seriously, the command of special forces was ready, but the operation was not done.
More details are always known about the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to the data of the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Internal Safety, the German Special Forces also participated in indirectly.
As a result, the Federal Criminal Investigation Office was also experts in the field of logistics of technical benefits.
As the ministerial ports reported on Monday night, the German forces did not need because seculars, taking account of a violent release, let them go to their prisoners and escaped.
The Egyptian Government accepted the aid of Germany to use it as a support in the place.
"Thankly it wasn't that moment," said a porter of the Federal Ministry of Interior.
On September 19, in the south of Egypt, the assistants had seen a group of travellers composed of 5 German, 5 Italians, a Roman and 8 Egyptian partners.
After the sequence in the southern wilderness region of Egypt, the rehens deported them from one side to another in the border zone between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of seculars was unknown until the end, as well as the details of the release or possible savings payments.
While the saved and saved people arrived to Cairo.
Steinmeier said the released rehens were under the protection of the German Embassy.
He didn't say any word about the details of liberation.
At first in Berlin there was no information on their turn to Germany.
According to the "Image", 5 tourists and special forces have to return to Airbus from Germany's airlines and arrive in March.
The United States Representative Chamber does not approve the savings package
The first room of the United States Congress has failed to slowly a large saving package of $7,7 billion for financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell very dramatically.
The United States Representative Chamber rejected 227 votes against 206 the Government's package for the savings of the financial markets.
Despite all calls from President George W. Bush and former two party politicals, most of the program should be limited to disorder on financial markets.
With a dramatic action, unexpected defenders had still tried to convince critics to accept the large package of $7,7 million.
Barney Frank, the leader of democratic negotiations, had requested Members to vote even though the plan is not so popular.
"It is difficult to receive political approval to avoid something that has not yet occurred", admitted.
During the vote, Dow Jones went to more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The cause of this was the concerns of the investors that the state saving package could fail.
At the end of the vote, it was distant and after the failure was made public, it was recovered again.
Experts have other serious turbulences in the international financial markets.
In order to leave the programme into force, both the Representative and Senator ' s Chamber must be approved.
The organizations register the increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travelers:
According to a study, the volume of sales of travel reserves for the next months increased in comparison with the last year - including the winter time in more than 30 percent.
According to a study, despite the debilitated countura, the desire to travel from Germans remains as previous.
As the Monday reported the German Travel Association (DVR) in Berlin, travel reserves for winter seasons registered a volume of sales that is 31 percent more in comparison with the same period last year.
According to the investigation of the GfK market research institute, reservations for the months of autumn have already been in number.
Thus the volume of sales from travel agencies in October was almost once percent more than one hundred in comparison with 2007, reported the DVR.
The results are GfK's digits that are analyzed information on reserves in 1200 travel agencies and computers nearly for the whole market.
The data collected is the travel reserves until the end of August 2008.
Because of the deficit rate of the dollar over all travels to the United States, he reported the DRV.
In this case, the number of reservations increased almost a third.
The favorite destination points of the Germans are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece, but also the regions of Germany.
Over all organized trips are very preferable, Klaus Laepple, the president of the DRV.
In view of the fact that energy and food prices increase, in this case travel expenditures are "better calculable for the customer during a individual trip".
Among other things, consumers can spend money with pre-reserve discounts or with All-Inclusive offers, explained Laepple.
In the summer months, travels were well reserved, so that the volume of sales in comparison with the last year again went - even though another study the number of Germans who performed a trip, comparing the last year, slowed.
My first October Festival
The shoes of the festivals under the sky opened in the Balneary without end, the bird in the jars of a litre and the famous people who are clothed in traditional designers' battles.
A deb in a camping shop.
Really Susanne Kronzucker and I don't have much common.
She's ruby, the moderate in the television and brings a traditional snake in measure.
I have the dark hair, I'm a student, and my clothes are already used.
But there's one thing that one of us: we're only in a campaign, photographs have already shooted up to us and fill their memory cards with the photos - it's very lisongeous about all because I'm first in October.
So makes friends.
Traditional swimming vessels seem to perform their function.
In fact, as a tourist in October, from the north of Germany, my feeling of well-being with a traditional bavaro clothing was still limited.
But after reaching the Prade of Teresa, it's not so much.
Almost all around the world brings the traditional battle or cute pants; no one seems to be given if or feeling unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my delantal receives a rare look at the side of a platform stand on the chocolate.
A municipality calls my attention on my delantal who had been clothed in wrong way: "The left is alone, the half is the virgin, in the right side is compromised, behind is old."
Oh, God, now I'm cut back to the left.
"He's good," I don't say.
Others are not worried about many of the subtle methods to flirte and bring gorges where it is written "To drink to get clothes!" and show, without requesting them, their sweet ball.
A young boy who is conducted in an exhibitionist way is called Bob, is from England and is also the first time in October feast.
He seems to be "gorgeous", which is expressed with a very long "or".
I know that after he put his vessel on the side of a bird litro that just drunk.
I put it directly on the side of the fire mouth, most of them think that's a bubble cube.
So Bob is one of the famous people who knows drinking very much.
Others don't have a lot of luck, and they can't consume so much alcohol.
On the eighth night the health groups run over the party place and need to be worried about poor bottles.
Health provides always in a group - soon four people are always taking the ways covered from a campaign shop to the other.
This works as with most visitors: Come on, go back.
It is not seen who suffers the degrees of alcoholism and is on the way.
"These are those who "that can't be anymore," the answer gave me a healthcare, responding to my question and disappeared.
Police Unluke Visum identified by the police
It has been identified the peatone of 63 years of age that was falling in the hospital after a vehicle was shocked in Essex's gate.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road, in the town of Brentwood, was involved in the accident in Shenfield Road on Wednesday.
The woman was brought to the Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later he died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested under the suspect of nervous conduct.
Since then, it has been put into freedom under fidelity.
Turkey extended its diplomatic horizonts
Before Turkey agreed to be a member of the European Union, the European powers raised the desire to penetrate within this country.
In the eastern part of the Bosforo, perhaps only 20 steps towards Asia, there is one of the most interesting religious ones of the disaster imperial ambition.
The train station of Hydarpasha was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in neo-renacenter style.
At least, this is what guides say.
The building is placed to spend the end of the platforms and takes two towers, one for each skin, parking to all a typical German rent.
The stone is sweet.
The building in its complex is a few decades.
But once the cup is over, there is no doubt about what was the size of the company that this was the western door.
The station was inaugured in August 1908 by the German Anatolia-Bagdad Corporation consortium.
Germany, a "latecomer" in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this rail rail that was shocked to Damasco, Bagdad, and more beyond what today is Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during the World War I.
His holiday ways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and its irregular Arabs.
In view of the relative isolation of circumstance regions generated by the frozen borders of the Fria War, it fell down.
the British rule and when the forces progressed in Egypt, they moved to the Turkeys and their German allied outside Palestine and Syria.
The news was also bad for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a ammunition train was explosed by destroying its designed tower.
The Turkish sources commented that it was a sabotage.
Since then the station was cut down and remained at the margin of the history.
But today, this rail carriage, the entrance door to Anatolia and all Eastern centres, serves at least symbolically - to highlight the will of Turkey to extend its diplomatic horizons.
The Justice and Development Party, which is the Government, the ACP, has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of circumstance regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is now a new cooperation policy.
The Turkish Government maintains a good relationship with Israel and Syria, both Palestinian Fatah, Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To assess the parameters of this new external policy, I went to a letter and I went to the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the ACP leaders, expert on the external policy, the Prime Minister of Turkey Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - a few ten hours later - after a sacudi trip, which produced the chains of the ancient world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived to the Turkish capital - new city, thought to rule a new secular state, far from the past.
However, the ACP, with its clear Islamic roots, represents a paradigmatic change in the Turkish consensus.
who has sustained some suspects in Western and, in particular, Washington.
A taxi leads me to the ACP's headquarters, a ultramodern stone and steel structure - built ad hoc - in a development suburb, rounded by medium-building business centres and "power pastels" where the managers of the average trade class - men and women -- are gathered at the first hour of the morning to make business agreements/dealing.
Suat Kinikioglu could be a central-right policy of almost any party in Europe.
I'm clothing, sweet, I'm sure he's still got a Blackberry.
"The objective of the external policy of the party is to re-integrate Turkey in its immediate neighbourhood.
The Fury War was an anomaly," says me.
Turkey has been cut into relations with its internal.
Today you have to look at the East and West.
It is not a case if it is not towards one or another.
You have to do both things.
"But surely in some moment," asked I, "Turchia could be obliged to choose? "
"Turchia," he responded, "does not want to spend that choice."
Then he stressed a point that almost everyone with whom I have spoken until that time had been renewed by me nearly a memory: the relationships that Turkey has not only with the Middle East but with the Caucasus region, and with the whole Black Sea represent a benefit for Europe and the United States as for the same Turkey.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically mount those rail lines that open the world to East Asian and the Middle East.
Another time to the Hydarpasha station, after a second without sleeping night, my thinking comes back to the two German Mr Ritter and Mr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised would they have been to know that the ambitions of Europe in the Middle East would, mostly, be in Turkey's hands today?
And waiting at the terminal the ferry that will bring me back through the Bosforo, I agree that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe".
There are so many doubts in which the continent should be re-evited by this fascinating country.
Remember Lifes: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: What musical director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (squella, 11 September) was responsible for the Philarmonic Orchestra of Guildford and the Coro.
As part of the city's musical project, in the next year, he founded its magnificent youth core, Proteus.
It is supposed to go for the age of 21, but at the time the Proteus sanged its end in 1979, several of us were finished in 20 years - only we refuse to give up to the coro.
The name of "Proteus" (the mythological changer of forms) represented the core will and the ability to execute any music that are presented to it, madrigue or Messian, indifference if not accompanied or complete orchest.
The musical versastigity produced by this core of young people was often surprised, always embarrassing, and everything was due to the inspiration of that man and the entusiasm for the music that has continued to be absolutely constant over the years.
Frequently, death told us to let music speak for himself.
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in music.
So there's only one to sing!"
It was always absolutely clear and necessary, although never impositive, not too flowered.
Everyone out of the musical skarar, always ended at a greater level.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If some driver should have been shocked, this is Vernon Handley.
I met him very well in the two decades in which he directed the Gilldford Fieldford Philadelphics from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the past 40 years, I have revised more than 100 of its concerts and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed – on the other hand, many times I have been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated the drivers that, in his words, simply "very one or two war horses very well known throughout the world".
We'll miss a lot of less.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett wrote:
In its sequence of William Woodruff (25 September) states that "in 1946 the economic history studies in Oxford was re-enhanced and in 1950 gathered a bit of Houblon-Norman's research... was at the same time study for a license title, one mastery and one of doctorate."
This is learned in a note from Woodruff's author in Beyond Nab End, but it is not completely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, in which he completed a doctoral test on the UK bottle industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 with the British Rubber Industry title.
He spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a beach of Houblon-Norman, and the summer 1952 at the Illinois, Harvard and New York universities.
In 1953 Notingham finally left to Illinois.
The reason that Woodruff chose to pass this part of his career, it's unknown.
J. Vicente Resino in Filistic Faculty
"I recommend the exposure of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco and Life" because its photos in white and black, documental style, are fantastic.
They called me attention to their simplicity and for the strength they transmit, always treating protagonists with very respect.
A exposure that shows much feeling.
Resino knows to capture magical moments."
Second assault for Honda's Overseers
In November, Honda will start the marketing of the second generation of Jazz.
If his precedent had already a wide habitability, this new monovolume presents a more broader internal space.
All of this is introduced a refined mechanical, which increase the confort of conduct and allow more fuel.
Evolution against revolution.
That's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz presents a very similar line to the model that happens, changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among other things, we must point out an innovative design, a new platform, larger sizes and new mechanicals.
However, before analyzing the new model, it must be noted that this new Jazz arrives six years after introducing the first generation in the market.
The first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter period than the employee by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Jazz is less known, this model is a sale phenomenon in other markets.
This is Japan's case, a country where Jazz has been the most commercialized car in 2002 and also during 2008.
Only in Japan has been sold about a million Jazz units from its launching.
The second market has been the Old Continente, with about half a million units in six years.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz allows to increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese signing marketed a total of 83.000 Jazz units, estimates are estimated to 100,000 cars, which would have a growth of 17 per cent in the European market in 2009.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has marketed a total of 8.000 Jazz units since 2002, which is 6,7% of the total Honduras sales in Spain.
With regard to the new generation, Spanish branches are expected to sell 2,000 Jazz units in a full year.
Only the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to pay the decline of sales in Spain.
Indeed, markers expect to end the year with a total of 22.000 marketed units, which is 4.000 less than in 2007, a decrease of 16 per cent.
Despite this increase in Honduras's sales, its market share has increased in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% of the past year.
The Japanese sign also expects to reach 2 per cent in 2010.
To achieve this quota Honda trusted in the coming of another new model.
This is Insight, a 5-hour hybrid and compact size - 4,37 meters of length - from which the nipon company expects to commercialize about 200,000 units every year throughout the world.
By markets and according to Japan's manufacturer estimates, 50 per cent of the Insight sales will be produced in the United States while the remaining percentage will be shared between the Old Continente and Japan.
Insight’s commercial launch is planned for the first months of the year, since its submission in society was carried out in January in Valencia.
With respect to the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its pieces.
Its length is up to 3.90 metres (5 cm above), the width up to 1.69 m (2 cm above) and the distance between edges up to 2.50 m, which means an increase of five cm.
The height, in turn, would not go and remain at 1,52 metres.
In addition to increased sizes, it also increases the internal habitativity.
This winning should be made on one side to include a new platform and, on the other hand, to the introduction of the fuel deposit in central position, a solution adopted in the previous Jazz.
Similarly, the ability of malter - which is counting with a double fund system - is up to 399 litres, 19 litre more capabilities of the first generation's malter.
It should be noted that these measures are of the version of the engine 1.4, since the ability of Honda Jazz 1.2 is of 379 litres.
Other improvements – in addition to external elements such as trash leds or the possibility of mounting panoramic cristal – is a improvement in access to the trash places.
And it's that the doors that give access to the second row have an open angle of 80 degrees, against the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
It's also new engines in this second generation of Jazz.
At the start of its marketing, this small model will contain two gasoline propulsors 1,2 and 1.4 litres.
Both mechanics include i-VTEC technology that achieves a lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refinance, and at the same time it gets a higher in the whole engine regime.
The first mechanic of 1,2 litres obtained a power of 90 horses to 6.000 revolutions with a maximum of 114 Nm to 4.900 turns.
This propulsor, which was previously reached by Jazz 78 horses, presents a expenditure of 5,3 litres and 125 grams of CO2.
Regarding the previous propulsor, who had reached 83 horses in the previous generation, now there are 100 horses.
This Jazz 1.4 of 100 horses achieves a combinated consumption of 5,4 litres and 128 grams of CO2.
The 'batch' car that avoids colisions
To progress in the development of technologies for the prevention of accidents, Nissan has been inspired this time in the nature, in particular, in the abyss.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, taking as the base of the ships flight, avoids accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robbot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step in colision prevention technologies.
The engineers of Nissan Motor Co's Advanced Technology Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Centre for Science and Technology Advanced Research of the Prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director-General for Public Technology and Marke Management and Development, the BR23C is presented as an expansion of the Nissan Security School.
This robot has the intention of strengthening the colitions capacity to prevent the brand vehicles.
During his flight, each aviation creates its own personal space in oval shape that seems very much to the Nissan Security School.
But the most important thing is the eyes of the skin, you can see with an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, which allows it to fly without interruption within your own personal space.
To create this visual function, engineers designed what they called a laser logger (Laser Range Finder).
This detects the obstacles that are located up to two meters of distance within a radio of 180 °C before the BR23C, calculates the distance to that object and sends a signal to a microprocessor that is immediately translated into the prevention of colision.
"When you detect an obstacle, the small robot will imitate the movements of a ball and will immediately change from direction by turning its rounds in a right or larger angle to avoid colision.
The greatest difference with any existing system is that evasion manipulation is completely instinct.
If not, the robot would not be able to react enoughly to avoid obstacles," Tushiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Lab and main engineer of this project.
Unlike a switch, robot can not be switched up or down, or in diagonal; only can be moved into two sizes and in the direction that allows you to turn your rotations, not in unfinished directions and ways like the snakes.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and disadvantage, so that the small robot avoids colitions.
"This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act according to those data.
It does not require to store intuitive information or logical information of previous manuscripts, so it can operate continuously with only a couple of decades of memory KB.
It may be surprising, but we are not talking about memory gigs, nor even megas."
This is the first step to develop new colision prevention technologies, a technology that Nissan Vaticina will be introduced in the series cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and longer than the variety of lithium ions.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a satellite browser GPS system to drive the driver to its destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Perhaps before hypothecary
It should be recognised that the Department of the United States Teacher, in addition to having much liquid to make injections, is not Engineering.
Before the crisis, and to avoid the United States shipping in swimming hypotheses in questionable solvent banks, they have created an ammal and informal game for the browser: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
Or, the hotel of the bad credits... or the luxury.
The thermal aspect of this accommodation and especially of your receptionist is to think about one, two and three times if it is the time to request a credit.
And above all, where to do it, what is probably your goal.
Of course, you have useful information, but little details.
It's a more page for adolescents than a website for all publics.
What if the game is completed?
So there's an accommodation room inside the hotel.
Something is something, because to buy a better house or we talk to...
Morgan Stanley sold participation in Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into its capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which would pay $9 million to buy 21% of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a low-scale quote.
One week after discovered a provisional agreement, both banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9 per cent of Morgan Stanley ' s ordinary actions to $25.25, or is a amount of $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19 % of the account value of titles to 31 August.
MUFG will invest six billion additional dollars with the purchase of convertible titles as a result of 10 per cent and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley precised that the overall operation would be carried out as a basis for a price of $29, or 28 per cent above its current change.
The Morgan Stanley action was, however, lost 6,79 % to 23,07 % each to 17:00 GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate the transition of Morgan Stanley towards the banking status, " explained Juan Mack, the director-General of the United States Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which would have to allow him to diversify his activities but he pass under the Federal Reserve authority.
Its association with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is strong to the largest names of Wall Street takes a much more careful behavior than ever.
The modalities presented last Monday also show that the agreement has been amended during the last days: the last Monday, Morgan had announced that it would sell up to 20 per cent of its actions to Japan for almost $8,5 million.
"A week ago, he explained in Tokio Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, "we thought that the participation had only been composed of normal actions.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wished to reduce the risks and cover us. "
Based on the average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley titles a 7 % below its accounting value.
And the operation will be translated by a dilution of approximately 20% of the benefit by action.
The agreement provides that MUFG may convert half of its preferential titles in regular actions within one year if they are sold by more than 50 % above the conversion price, or at $47 more or less, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the MUFG capitals will enable you to cover investment opportunities, strengthen the balance and increase their liquidity.
However, a portion of the group was refused to give exactions on the strategic projects of the two new partners.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should show a solution ratio Tier One about 15%, one of the best sector.
Morgan had needed to have much enhanced its balance since the end of August.
The last weeks were exhausted for the group, which saw its quote in a cup down to half while the security costs against a risk of defects on its debt were deployed.
This was the last Monday, but it was at a high level, about 12 %.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only "persistent" banks of Wall Street's large investment banks after the slaughter of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced 15 million dollars, partly for Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group.

A Egyptian command launched the attack against the raptors of the nine tourists and their eight accompanies captured ten days ago.
They're in the Cairo.
The 11 European tourists and their eight settled Egyptians 10 days ago in the wilderness arrived in Egyptian capital after they were released Monday in the evening.
For the morning, the Egyptian special forces were released in Chad.
All of them had a good look at their arrival at 15.30 p.m. on the board of a special aircraft at Al Maza military base, adjoint to the International Cairo Airport.
Some helicopters moved them immediately to the Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of El Cairo, to be subjected to medical evidence, so they couldn't talk to the press.

The group was integrated by 11 Italian tourists - five Italians, five Germans and a Romanian and eighth Egyptian leaders: two guides, four chofers, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptous travel agency, in charge of the safari organization.

Letters - Silence of culture
A debate on the financing of cultures makes the manchets and employs the current election campaign.
That's better.
But a sector of our cultural life remains always forgotten.
Who will be risen to declare the miserable amounts that are granted to the small museums, the archives, the archaeological excavations or the national historic places that die from hunger?
What policy will it be strict to remember the federal government that disappoints its monuments and its heritage buildings?
Why do we not have true laws that actually preserve our heritage as in Canada and in Quebec?
Do you know that the French government dedicated three million and a half euros to restore the castle of China only in the Loira Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of the heritage is part of the United States culture and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all the elected and all government departments, and all this in concertation.
In Quebec, in the Federation of the History Societys of Quebec, at least 400,000 people regrouped in 211 societies of history, heritage, files and genealogy are concerned about searching in the history, maintaining with little money of private files and maintaining archaeological clothings.
These are often the guard dogs of our heritage, which protest with energy and dispersion when the promotioners and responsibilities launch their burdozers against our old stones and our forgotten cemeteries.
For when, a monument for history and heritage?
The Governments of the Netherlands nationalize a part of the Fortis Bank.
The States of the Netherlands - as the first ones in Europe - will be helped by nationalization to the Fort Belgian and Dutch Bank, which is in fact due to the impact of the North American market hypothetical crisis: the three countries will support this financial and insurance institution in Hungary totally 11,2 million euros.
In this weekend, the Governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have held a higher level of consultations with the President of the European Central Bank and the responsible for the economic competitive of the European Commission.
Fortis Bank is the first who has suffered the crisis of the euro area in the framework of the international financial crisis which is produced in more than one year ago in various oiled oils, so the decisions adopted on the Bank may, in certain sense, be considered as previous.
According to the decision adopted on Sunday's Sunday, the three States will buy about half (49 per cent) of the ownership of the Bank in their area.
The Bank with any security will sell a part of its business, including all the activities - primarily insured - insurance purchased last year by ABN Amró Dutch.
Fortis' actions have started a strong decline last week, and for the second half of the week there was already significant crisis signs in the institution.
However, analists agree that with 85 000 employees of this Bank is too large to allow them to disappear.
The company's actions so only on Wednesday reduced 12 percent, and this is the lower point in the last 14 years.
Since January, the value of actions was reduced with more than two thirds.
Noting the current prices of actions, the total value of the group capital is around 14 billion euros, but it is not real, according to the company's executives.
The bank's direction imposed the fall of the Fortis' actions to the insecurities of the North American market in relation to the adoption of the US package plan of $7,7 billion.
On Monday, actions have already shown a light increase.
On Wednesday, they appointed Philip Derrckx as the new director of the bank.
The Bank also searched for special investors, but until now no one gave a specific offer.
The Belgian government had already assured that investors had no reason to worry, they would not lose their money.
Among the bank clients until now there was no panic, they didn't invade bank offices to retire their money.
The Fortis has its own succursale in Hungary and has also purchased leasing companies.
Rare in the gallery
In the United States, life and health insurance companies see the data of the purchase of medicine often refuse to sign an insurance contract.
Privacy policy experts fear that personal data markets are uncontrolled.
" There are personal data protection programmes, which are used for the use of receipt data in all cases to the approval of the given person.
The same must be in independent hands, because if not, "We trust the gallineer to the ship" - quotes Washington Post to Richard Dick, designer of the medical receipt follow-up program.
Insurance companies depend on the insurance price and the amount of compensation of the customer health status and if they believe that the risk is excessive, they simply do not make the contract.
Before they sent the customer to the medical control and signed the contract with him, knowing the result of the control.
10 years ago Dick invented a much more precise procedure: with the number of identification of customers, the list of medicines purchased in the last and mid-year year and the program itself makes the conclusion on illnesses and health status of the customer.
For example, if you systematically take a large dose of pillars to reduce colesterol, it indicates that blood fat level is almost high, so it is immediately included in a higher risk category.
About many versions of the programme, some have also set a number of risks, so the insurance company in addition to the administration is only to do something, although there are small difficulties in this regard.
Among the devenge of the program, for example, some medicines are multiuse, for example, certain substances serve both to treat head pain and warm bones and even antidepressives.
This last is an important factor of risk increase for insurance companies while the firsts are not.
Special companies were formed to consult and process these data, which requested the patient's approval before obtaining medicines.
The authorities are already obliged to this, although they have not received much for the weakness of up to now.
Some companies have recently prepared the results of the laboratory reviews and complying them with the consumption data, have more specific information about the patient’s health status.
Each more company has access to these data and simultaneously is more difficult to control its use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but only for insurance companies and health services.
The draft law which provides right to the authority for the control of specialized enterprises for providing personal data is already before the Congress.
Dick Richard recognizes that this is inadequate: therefore, he developed his programme, which will require the specific approval of the person to provide his own personal data.
It is another question that this person cannot reject its approval, because if not the insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
Thus, despite all the things, galls are exposed to the good will of the widow.
Marsella's global menu
The European Union doubles its trade with India
As the European Union and India are mutually commercial partners, this issue, as well as other global problems, has dominated the agenda of the nineteenth Summit.
Today will also be celebrated as a French-India Summit to address mainly the cooperation in nuclear energy.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is a great democratic power in developing that should have more voice and vote in international matters, the Member States have not yet been able to reach a common designator on whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
This question has not been addressed at the nineteenth Summit in Marsella yesterday.
The French President Nicolas Sarkozy, President of the EU, José Manuel Barroso President of the Commission and Javier Solana, the principal representative of the external policy, received Manmohan Singh, the first minister of India, which reached an agreement to double over five years, i.e., increased more than 100 million euros, its trade exchange.
As regards the exchange of goods between 2000 and 2007 increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not a too ambitious goal.
Thus, the 20 bilateral civil aircraft conventions existing with India were legally harmonized, so the air transport can also fly in the future.
India, until the end of 2009, wants to sign the Union's Free Trade Treaty.
Sarkozy promised to accelerate the negotiations.
The goal is balance, because while the EU is the first commercial partner of India, New Delhi is only in the nineth place between the trade partners of the Union.
The Summit focused on global issues.
Both parties condemned the Afghan and Pakistanian situation and the terrorism - all the forms of this last - and encouraging the convocation of a United Nations conference.
The conclusion of the Doha's commercial liberalization round was also approved, although both parties have great responsibility in their failure.
The EU confirmed that its energy and climate programme will be addressed, i.e., to 2020, will decrease the polluting emissions at least 20 percent.
India is also agreed with this, as at the climate conference of the next year should be reached to a global agreement and decreased until 2050 with 50 per cent of the production of gas that produce winter effects.
They also wish to hinder the increased food prices and support the convocation of an international conference to overlook the financial crisis.
Today the Head of India will travel to the French capital, where - in a bilateral meeting - will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris believes that French companies will receive charges for a value of twenty billion euros to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency information, the agreement would be for a period of 15 years.

Finished by Steve Fossett's aircraft the Millennium Lost a year ago
The remains of Steve Fossett's aircraft, the millennium disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada wilderness.
The shadows have been found on a 3000 meter high level in the area of Mamoth Lakes Sera Nevada, in the border between California and Nevada.
In the aircraft, there were no human rests.
The Commissioner of Madera Council, John Anderson, has disappointed the doubts that remained: "The aircraft has been located, we sent a squad, and now we have confirmed that this is what Steve Fossett was driving on the day of his disappearing," said in a stamping conference.
The Commissioner has indicated that there was no human rests found in the aircraft or around.
The Millennium, 63 years of age, has been given for death in February.
The American Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) has known that some hours after the rest's notice, it was sent a researcher squall that identified the device: this is the Bellanca 8kcab own, dispersed since September 3, 2007, when Fossett dismissed Gerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Last night, always in California, not far from Nevada's conviction, some of Fossett's personal rests have been found by a couple near the house of Mamoth Lakes.
This is two documents with the name of Fossett, the two issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, the money in effectiveness and a slaughter.
Fossett's search had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The Millennium has been conquered a place in the history thanks to a wide series of primes.
In 2002, the sixth attempt was converted to the first Man to complete the world's turn into an aerostatic plane: two single weeks of flight.
Three years later, the world turned in an aircraft and without scale.
Among its records, also that because he flyed at 15.445 meters above the Andes, but with a copilote.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A Suv outside the schemes with a original and well established design with defined lines and angles.
This is, in synthesis, Glk the last born between all the "compact" trucks of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a new window in this sector.
Proposed for the content outside the traditional, it will be unexpected and unconventional, the communication that will be accompanied by the launching of the Suv Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz exposure rooms from October 17.
The advertising campaign to accompany the debt of the new car launches an unreceived communication modality through a 3D publishing campaign, used for the first time in Italy by an automobilistic brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, which dominates the central street of the Milan shopping, advenished as, until November 15.
The first stage of this new type of communication will start with the presentation of the car in the stereoscopic version and thanks to special data distributed in the advenida How can you see the new suv in almost real sizes and in three-dimensional format.
Effectively, looking at the image will be the impression that the car gets out of the poster.
Next, through the use of the innovated Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be iluminated in different times in all its details, to recommend in one image.
Unlike doubts Mercedes with this advertising it is trying to introduce something new in the stereotype of the automobile communication.
Can you get the interest of the future buyers with this form?
is clear who are Italian hooligans
In the Tribune the prohibition of access to sporting manifestations is played.
But who are those 150-200 girls and girls of Italy who are now hungry? They are part of the "Other Italian" group that has continued for years and now, saying the truth, had never created too many problems.
And they were never found with the rival fanaters.
The extraction of the group is right.
Promotors come from the Trivenet.
De Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
A small group (in reality) of the campaign and Apulia has been accompanied by Sofia.
They have three colours where the city of origin of the warriors appears: Saturday after night have been cut off so that they are not identified.
The English fans are inspired.
In Bulgaria have found a group of real nazis fans, the Levski.
Figc had available 144 Italian fanats for the party: all with the names, so easyly controlable.
And the minister of the Interior had already controlled them all: among those who had come out to Sofia there was no one with a Dapo (prohibition of access to sports events) at that moment, no one who had banned him to frequencise a stage.
For four Italian fans, who had previous crimes in stadiums, they rejected the ticket and the trip.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs now expects to read the acts that come from the Bulgarian police to take steps: in this case, it is possible to give Dapo (prohibition of access to sports events) for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or whom has been identified in the disorders.
A Daspo (prohibition of access to sports events) internationally that prevent not only Italian stadiums but also of all Europe.
Our hooligans, they won't put more feet in a stadium.
For luck!
But now it is the fear of imitation: that those few 50 are added to others.
"We have to immediately remove this fire and not legitimate those in this way," they supported the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
Therefore, "good-open goes" in particular in view of the Monday National Party in Lecce.
In Apulia there is also a small nucleus of Ultra Italy's supporters.
The Observatory is meeting tomorrow, on Tuesday, the Cams that can also contain with a section of the Aasis (Agence for Foreign Information and Security, namely the secret service, which takes care of the problems in the stages.
"Does the twenty-third colors and the arm slow during Mameli's hair? In Bulgaria isn't a crime...".
This is the thought (expressed in unfortunate way) of Domenico Mazzilli, a few weeks ago the director of the observation of the Ministry of Interior (he took the place before Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was the Chief of Trieste of Public Security where there was a nucleus of supporters from the Ultra Italian group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that Bulgaria is not right to celebrate the Twelve but if, the behavior of those 150-200 fans that have been confused.
"I do not do socialist – adds No. 1 of the Observatory – the crimes will be assigned in countries where the fact is happening.
Until now, this group has been conducted well now, we will see what happened and we will take account of it for the future.
But we also speak of the silbidos to Mameli's hill: these are also not a crime, but if they don't allow them to be educational...".
