The Republic of the Republic of Obama ' s Revocation Strategy
The leaders of the Republic justifyed their policies to combat flexibility.
However, the Brendan Center is considered the last micro, claiming that the cases for elections in the United States are more rare than the deaths of the moon attack.
Furthermore, the Republican lawyers were only 300 cases of electoral flexibility in the United States for ten years.
One can be said with confidence: these new trends will have a negative impact on the sequence of electioners.
In that sense, such actions are partly disrupting the American democracy system.
Unlike Canada, the United States are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
That is why the majority of States Governments have adopted laws that are complex in the registration or vote process.
This occurred newly after elections in November 2010, which brought to the Republicns 675 new places in 26 states.
The result of only one 2011, 180 draft legislation limited the right to vote in 41 States.
New election laws require election laws to make the election authorisation with photos and evidence of the existing American citizenship.
Furthermore, these laws reduce the period of a period of suspicious vote, stipulate the right to the registration of the electioner on the day of the declaration and reject the right to vote in the citizens of justice.
Before the elections of 2006, no American State had obliged elections to proclaim a personality certificate.
India became the first state that introduced such a requirement.
The High Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the law adopted in India in 2008.
The Republican authorities have efforts to disseminate this practice and other states.
In the past two years, they have initiated draft laws that forced electioners to proclaim photo certification in 34 States.
It is important to note that the American citizens do not have such universal personality certification as the card of medical insurance.
In fact, 11 per cent of the American citizens, 21 million people who have reached the age of age, have no proof of personality with the photo issued by the Government of their state.
Furthermore, five million new elections in 2012 have no similar document.
In this regard, the value of receipt of the requested personality is often exceeding $100.
New disproportional restrictions affect youths, minorities and people with low income.
Indeed, 25 per cent of Africans, 15 per cent of people who pay less than 35,000 dollars, 18 per cent of 65 years older and 20 per cent of electors from 18 to 29 years of age have no request for personality with photos.
But it's not yet.
Students, who are considered to vote for candidates from democracies, have not been allowed to use a personality certificate in several states.
As a result, these States authorize members of fishermen and voluntary clubs, which are mainly voted for the Republicans, to vote on the certification issued by these clubs.
To 2004 no State had required evidence of the existing American citizenship to vote.
The first such requirements were introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than ten States adopted the laws required by elections to prove that they were the United States citizens.
These measures are obviously aimed at restricting the vote of outdoors from Latin America.
Two thirds of the Latin American electioners are voted for the Democratic Party.
Furthermore, the Republican legislators initiated in 2011 the laws which reorganize the registration of electioners on the day of vote in the eight states.
They also limited the right of individuals or groups to provide assistance to those who wish to register.
This restriction has not been passed without the consequences.
For example, during the elections of 2004, the election campaign helped the list of about 10 million citizens.
At the same time, the measures taken since 2009 have been decreased to 17 per cent of the registration of new electioners in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition to the Republic of Republic, five other States adopted the law aimed at reducing the period of long-term vote.
Similarly, during the overall elections in 2008 in Florida 33 per cent of the voters were Africans, although the last 13 per cent of the total number of elections of the State.
Similarly, it was the same thing with the visitors from Latin America.
Representing only 11 per cent of the elections, 24 per cent of those who voted for a while.
Rather than white, 76 per cent of the elections were only 46 per cent of the voters.
Of course, democratic lawyers and their parties are actively opposed to the adoption of the laws limiting the registration of the electors.
Many of the law projects were blessed by the democratic governators.
The most important legislation was suspended in the intervention of the United States Prosecutor-General.
This allowed partly to limit negative consequences.
For example, only 16 of 34 states have adopted laws required for proclaiming the personality certification with the photo.
However, the new rules involving the action of the election law are unlikely to be implemented by the 2012 elections.
Democratic critics condemn the preceding of the laws adopted, seeing that they are obvious to affect the results of the elections of 2012 in key states.
The report of the Centre of Brendan from 2011 shows that the states adopted by these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required in the election colleague to win the presidential elections.
It is too early to say that these legislative changes at the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the presidential elections in 2012.
Only one uncertainly: these new provisions will affect a negative effect on a elector.
In that sense, such actions are partly disrupting the American democracy system.
Crystaling predominant iron: going to pass the test or not?
Indeed, the PSA tests sometimes gives wrong results, false results, and sometimes false and false positions that lead to an inutilable medical involvement.
Mans, and so desirablely disappointment, are more doubts.
Does it pass the test or not?
We asked the view of two specialists.
Studies carried out in the United States have been observed in many cases of infringement among the investigated groups, so it was difficult to interpretate and to develop a clear recommendation.
Another study, at this time, has found different mortality levels in patients who have been scratched and those who did not pass it.
This study also showed, after the 12-year-old monitoring, that the possibility of metastasis is 30-40 per cent above those who have not been covered.
So I would recommend that the test starts for 50 years, or from 40, if one of the direct parents had a cancer.
Mans of African origin are also undermined to increased risk.
The key moment is to take a right decision only when cancer is found.
Rick may be aggressive and vulnerable.
The patient must clarify the risk of his cancer disease, proposing the possible options, without obliged cancer treatment, which is not dangerous for life in a long term, and, in these cases, choose active monitoring of diseases.
Today, many men who have been identified cancer will not go to treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and no threat to life.
We will propose active monitoring, and if disease begins to progress, we will start treatment.
We are more accurately determined by the criteria to decide who should or should not be treated.
So I would recommend that the test is going to be tested.
But it is also important to consult with your doctor to determine, whether it is necessary or not.
In cooperation with the International Urology Association, Moweemberg created a tool that enabled to evaluate everything for and against the PSA testing.

Prevention of Diseases
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recepte to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress in scientific research, respect for healthy life is the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It seems that if all people were healthy and enough moved, 30 percent of cancer cases could be prevented.
"If nobody would smoke anymore, this number would grow as at least 50 percent," stresses Andre Bole, Cancer Press Secretariat.
However, estimates are estimated that 10 per cent of cancer cases were inherited.
A few types of cancer remain completely unexpected.
For the Canadian Cancer Association, it remains priority, despite the reduction of the number of smokers.
Courtion is 85 per cent of light cancer cases.
It is a risk factor for many others.
It affects the health of people.
"Actually in Quebec there are 1,5 million smokers," says the secretariat André Bole.
Increased fact: After 10 years after smoking, the risk to die from cancer is decreased.
Wes
According to the CAR data, loss of weight and glue also contribute to the emergence of diseases.
They increase the risk of milk iron cancer, smooth and direct powder, feed, iron and mass cancer.
" Research shows that regular physical activity is protected from cancer, " adds to the Association.
Question
The Association also recommends that the consumption of red meat be limited.
In too large numbers, it increases the risks of the tumor cancer.
It should also be avoided.
Conservation of meat by copying, sweat or seal, may lead to cancer education.
"The last time may cause damage to organic cells and cancer development", explains the Association.
Vietnam
In recent years, many scientists have been investigating the impact of vitamin additives on cancer development.
But at this time, the results of these research cannot be called a single.
According to SCC, Vitamin E studies have opposed results.
If one of them showed a decrease in the risk of cancer development, the other has resulted in anti-pollution.
In assessing the impact on the development of vitamin D, there is no fully clearness.
However, Mr. Bole emphasizes that his concerns and family anamnesis are important to discuss with a doctor.
"The good analysis doesn't lead to cancer."
Higgs Bozon in details
Last year the report that the scientist may have found Higgs' Boss could have been able to find the real shoot, not without grounds.
It seems that this bosom explains the mass of all parts in the universe, and there are no few.
Moreover, this is the last part of the existence that was predicted in the Standard Model is our best, or, in any case, the description of the nature and the conduct of the mother, which has not been found in an experienced way.
But the physicians aren't yet sure that it's about the Higgs Boy.
We know, without the darkness of doubt, that we have a real new part and that it very much remembers the Higs Boss predicted by the Standard Model.
Furthermore, the new data presented for this week at a large physical convention in Kyoto seems to be reaffirmed, although some of the data are not yet sufficient for fully confidence.
Let's imagine that it's about the Higgs Booth, because the chances to be wrong are the minimum, and we'll see what that means.
There is, in this world, one law is perfectly inevitable, that two things may not be in the same place at the same time.
Requiring this rule is no possibility, even trying to be too generous, otherwise harmful.
However, although the physician of elements is a very strange world, it also shows that there is a law of such nature: the principle of exclusion of Paul, which claims that two parties cannot take the same space at the same time when they remain in the same "quality" as the "condition" is, in general, in some of their characteristics.
As a result, physicians are divided into two categories.
In one angle, we have good ordered citizens called farmions, who are wisely subjected to the Pauly principle.
Otherwise, there are bobines, the smell of anarchists, who have no respect for anything, at least to this principle, which means that they may be prestigious in the same place at the same time.
The website reports (which is not completely unlimited) P article Adventure Labour Berlin, these boosons are, on the other hand, divided into two groups: the mezones we're not talking here and the "participations" by which the main forces of nature are distributed and some of the kinds of Higgs' boss.
These boots should be stressed, not all the ecologists that might be thought.
In fact, if you can read this chronic, it's due to an incredibly banal box: photon, or part of the light, which is the corner of an electronic magnetic power.
In fact, when a part with electric switch is accelerated or changed, it "inflates" the electrical field in this specific place, such as a stone that is broken in the shore.
The "breach" is born by an electronic magnetic weather (the light, or the inflation removal, or the ultraviolet, etc.), and the wave is nothing else as a photon, and therefore one of the bozones of "force translators".
More Stabilious Fields
The same thing happens with the Higgs Boss, with the only difference that to appear in the boss, the other field, the Higgs field must be "inflated".
However, the Higgs field of a larger, stable electrical field; in order to rebuilt it, it is necessary to reach very and very high energy, as if it speaks of the slope of a smooth stone, the surface of which could only be a very large stone.
That's why we need a large acceleration of parts, such as the Neo-National Coleder, which is a 27-km diameter, to achieve such great energy.
Analogs with the electronic magnetic field are also useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs Boss and the Mass Boss.
In fact, not all parts and not all materials are interacting with electrical fields.
Some, such as magnets, are interacting, others are not: the papers, for example, will never be maintained on the cold.
Similarly, not all of the parties are in combination with the Higgs field, but those interacting have mass, while others (such as photons, sweats) have it.
So what's "to bring" all these studies, asks Mrs. Plamondon?
They are used in science to check the validity of the Standard Model (SM) and also enable physicians to try to switch between monitor results and MT prognosis.
Furthermore, some of them are very desired to discover such disappearance, so that the small inconsistence may open the door for a "new Physical" and close some of the models.
Lastly, there is still a substantial deficiency, without proposing any explanation for the degradation (a!). or for a dark mother, which forms about 80 per cent of the Universal (a!).
But until the CER hasn't found such divisions.
Impacts
The use of these studies for daily life of a medium-statistic person would be more difficult, but it would be a mistake to predict that it is not.
See: At the beginning of the 60s ’ s, the pioneers of the Laser Laser study in the Bellah Lab could not even propose what revolution their work will make.
They predicted their annexes in science, but not more.
Indeed, a quiet physician Willerd Boyle, who worked at the Bel Lab, where the Laser was developed in 1960, and who himself developed the first impossable laser (immunal) in 1962, said that the original laser was considered as a "layer's thoughts".
Put me...
Furthermore, the annex can be found for a research tool.
For example, the same William Boyle developed a small light tanner during its optical research in 1969.
Although this wasn't his original assignment, it now serves as a "shore" for all the world's digital cameras and was the Nobel Physical Prize in 2009.
This is, of course, not that the work of the Great Adrian Coleder must change our lives, but it only shows that everything can be.
Pallitic help is the best way to die...
The Commission for Adequacy Death in Quebec recently discussed the issue of the end of life.
Debates must soon be restored, and at that time the draft legislation is prepared.
However, there is still much to do in this important area.
Dorg tried to look closer.
Over a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived another in his apartment in Monterrey.
The throat was destroyed from the outside, and he gave him a delay for two years.
"I've been given five years, I lived seven," he says, between life and death, sit in bed in the accommodation of Victoria Gadbua in Bella where he arrived.
"But it's always a shock, it's impossible to prepare it," he says.
The disease does its work: an incredibly weakness that does not give up in the toilet and even self - feeding.
Sit on a table to which the appetitive dinner is to be paid and agreed to help him take food.
He is guarding, even smiling to smile, to talk to unconscious people who work around him, to bring medication to him and lead him to the bathroom.
Humanity before normal death.
"My largest desire to get me out of diarea is low," he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found the medicine from this disease.
"In the life we learned that a man must stand up," says Peter Broder, psychologist in Victoria Gadbua's accommodation.
Regression to the state of the child for some inadequate decline.
Everything depends on the ability of humans to die with a fall, he says.
As many people in the Palestinian department believe that the most important events have occurred in the distance of this accident.
Patients who are in the palliative reception of Victor Gadbua are all cancer.
Prognoses have a maximum of three months of life.
At that stage, the physicians and nurses do not provide any more assistance called "therapy".
Ms. A., 89 years old, is worried more to die in consciousness.
But sickness allowed me to know my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I don't want anything anymore in life," she says, before she allowed to put her mask that facilitates breathing.
She continues to wait in the nearest days of the last visit of her son from Italy.
The Victor Gadbua accommodation with the voluntary group provides body and food assistance.
It's a palliative department that remains when nothing else can't do.
To make death more comfortable.
There is a place in the Palestinian Assistance institutions for each 11 700 people in Quebec.
This is very little, considering that we all die early or later.
Here, life continues in the best conditions possible, explains Dr. Christine Martel, one of the doctors of receipt.
Be physical, emotional or mental comfort.
The dead one we agree to provide slips from breeding or pep, seeing what he's going to ask.
We're not going to control the sugar levels.
And death is part of every day.
Tonight we brought Mr. J. who died tonight.
His son took this drink in his feet in a calm.
"We are helping close people as well as the patients," says Nathani Savar, Director for Hepatic Diseases.
There is no way in the Victor Gadbu's accommodation.
A 93-year-old old man who enjoys his last family meeting in the garden, putting on his suburbs during his honour, tragicly dies 36-year-old man, a parent, wife and two small children, and who trys everything to survive.
"In the last half of three to five kitchens, cancers are always employed by 45 years of age," says Dr. Christine Martel.
53 per cent of the patients receiving Victor Gadbua have come from home and 47 per cent of the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative entry
77 per cent of Canadians only have access to palliative department, which is provided to facilitate the suffering of patients who have been in the final stage of their lives, either at home, in the hospital or in the hospital.
And some institutions, such as Victor Gadbow and the Palestinian Employment of the Grand Montreal House, are specialized more or less exclusively at the invasion of cancer diseases.
That is the great space in the Quebec health system, which many doctors in the Palestinian Association, are concerned about the adoption of the Eutanasis Act and the assistance for self-assault.
Starting from October, he circled a manif signed by the Palestinians, Dr. Balfur Munt, and Dr. Bernar Lapont, who witnesses their inconvenience with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christine Martel, the Quebec health system is inadequate to ensure the right to a palliative high quality prior to how it will be allowed to move to evatanasie.
Recently, she says, I have seen a patient who took 14 days in the ambulance office, in fearful pains, and no one took the necessary measures to facilitate them.
I'm afraid the patient wants to die only because they don't get adequately.
At the same time, many ecologists are trying to save patients, despite pessimistic predictions.
The hope of the survival of Elen Richard was at least when she stopped deteriorating chemicals.
When I told my encyclopedia that I've stopped the treatment, she answered me that I'm sorry I stopped fighting, she tells me.
That's why she told me that my days were slow!
No Forced Income
Dr. Martell believes that 90 per cent of those who ask for death thanks to the nursing because they did not comply with their request, after the Palliative Disease Team facilitates their pain.
However, it should be noted that the palliative interference is not absolutely all-powered in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, the Palliative Reception Director of the Palestinian Community in the Grand Montreal House, the patients were not admissible to 8 per cent of the cases.
At the end of the life, doctors often go to the palliative ceremony in which the patient sleeps before his death, or from time or time.
We can't make it possible that we don't know about these sufferings.
More and more sicknesses that are not able to facilitate pain will be able to have access to palliative seeds.
The worsts suffering from pain always say the same expression, "I want to die."
But this doesn't necessarily mean "I want to make me evatancing", that means "I want to make me more easy."
The development of this report was possible by the Canadian Health Institute of Journalist Graduate.
Degree-based scandaries in Quebec
The persons responsible for the construction of the road, construction contractors, funds of political parties and Italian mathematician specialists every day tell that they are aware of the colonial " system " for the construction industry, public officials, politicians, professionals and matheomy.
"Industry", which was very expensive to the Quebec payers, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"Indeed, how the system is slowed after all the instruments were made, Jack Ducheno, Deputy, and the former police head of Montreal."
That was due to him in 2011, scandal as a pleasant investigation of official crimes related to road-building contracts in Quebec, whose Prime Minister from Liberals, Jean Share, agreed very unfortunately.
Ducheno report established a direct link between industry, secret financing of political parties and corruption.
" From the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he stressed that only one of the Ministry of Transport would keep a billion dollars on contracts, if some of them had maintained their intentions of the brother's share.
The Charbono Commission "is already smiling two ladies" adds that he hopes that it would be "uploading schemes that are standing for individual personalities".
Permanent Corruption Unit established in 2011
The Permanent Corruption Unit established in 2011, composed of the broad state of government auditors, researchers and analysts.
In addition, staff of the Moroth Special Unit who set a "stay card" after 2009 to stop the cost of contracts.
During the past weeks, a series of surveys were made, and some municipal officials, in particular Franco Zampino and Rishura Marcotti, had been accused of fraud and corruption.
On the street, Gil Winyancur, a recent departure from Mrs Lavalla, the third to the largest city of Quebec.
It is suspected in receipt of receipt in the location of State orders.
Furthermore, a number of engineers of Montreal's way of communication and the Italian manufacturers, including Tony Akcurso and Lino Zambito, were officially accused.
The last explosion of the present bomb was made by the impact of the "system" of the "receivement of State contracts".
Over a few years, Zambito gave 3 per cent of the cost of contracts in Montreal, a mediator related to mathematica, which, in turn, transferred Mrs. Jérald Trumble The United Monreal party.
In the 2000s, Zambito spends on the right and left, and has listed more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (enlarged 68,000 euros) to various provinces, mainly to Liberals, which were then in power.
He also acknowledged that it was illegally collected for the former Vice-Minister of the Liberal Party of Natali Normando.
Canalising contracts in which values were increased
In Montreal, the "system" corruption worked unfairly.
The Viel Surprin, former civil construction engineer, describes it in detail before the committee: for ten years he received from the building companies, invited to travel, to the golf tours, to the restaurant, to the cook and towels in general $736,000 in exchange of changing contracts, which he has increased.
Other officials who were responsible for the construction of the road were recognized that they received the laptop with a higher account of 30 to 40 per cent using false supplements.
Afterwards, one organizer of Mr. Martin Dumon accused Mr. Tramble that he intended to close his eyes to the existence of a parallle budget filled by the partial cassettes.
After these openings, Mr. Tramble went to the departure in the beginning of November, loading Montreal in a deep crisis.
Chantal Rulo was one of the first deputy in Montreal who killed the threat.
Mr. Rivier de Perri, east of the island, is contrary to the sale of a municipality area purchased by $5 million and transferred to... 1,6 million to the building paper.
70 per cent of greenhouse money in predicted campaigns
She states that in the investigation that will finally begin, it "flies for a cut to understand the functioning of the muscles to stop the gang and determine the guilty."
This process characterizes it as a ill but positive.
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but Montreal will be required by its own investigative group and observer to avoid returning to suspicious practices.
How we go home.
Regular.
Jak Ducheno notes from his side that “the chiefs have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars” but especially concerns the role of the "selected officials who know about this scheme" but not in the maquination.
In view of the fact that the percentage of burning money in the financing of the election campaign in Quebec reached 70 per cent, he sweared: "I said that this was just a slight reflection of reality. "
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit to $100 of the donations to the parties, but, in his words, it will not change the situation: "As we are not strictly limited to the elected expenditure, the policy will be burdened."
He requires a full restructuring of the system for State contracts and the financing of the party: "We can't go below, we can build a house on a more constant basis, with the best control and law."
If this story and casts the dark on the international mosquito Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Ducheno calls those who smile to look at their own door...
It's not F.C. Barcelone.
You've got an unexpected snack at the PSC in this season.
How do you explain this growth?
This may be explained by individual consciousness, but it may be a new measure of GSP.
Great games have arrived.
I'll grow with them every day.
Technical staff has also been a lot of responsibilities.
These factors make me up the level of my game every day.
And during the match, it's easier.
All happens very fast in the football.
But I don't shoot.
From the beginning in the NIF preliminary training centre in Clairefont and before my arrival in St. Ethien, I had always stepped forward.
So you're exciting benefits from the competition established by Carlo Anchelotti...
In addition to that summer, it is not a very high level player in the news.
They also know that each training is very important.
This leads to the fact that the game like me wants to be at the level and get up to the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Anchelotti supports my position.
He's helping the Vice-Crown McEle who played in the same position as me.
Anchelotes are the master of the situation?
Of course.
Antiloths strive to respect all technical personnel.
Today, he has no equality in the First League and is included in the best trains of Europe.
He has an extensive experience, and he won a lot of titles with high-level clubs.
He worked with great games.
I think he's gonna bring new Paris titles.
In January, I had an exciting conversation with him.
Then I went away from the whole series of traumas.
The confidence he shows me also explains my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the CPS season?
In the First League, Leon took us a leader.
But we're still ready.
One of our main objectives is Liga Champion, which we effectively qualified in one eightth final.
What is the goal of the club in this tourist?
We're trying to go as far as we can.
It can be all right now.
We can say our own face to face with very good European teams.
We first wanted to finish the first ones in our group, before Porto, to have the possibility of taking the responsibilities in one eighth end.
Can the CPS become the first-class European club in a short-term perspective?
He has a budget for this.
In order to become a large European club, Paris needs to play the titles and strengthen positions on a long-term perspective.
That's not so today.
Financially, the GSP has a means to make this project real.
Don't you take the title in the First Ligue, like in the past season, the biggest loss?
Of course, it would be a great depression.
In this year, we really want to prevent this champion title.
In the past season, we were close to that.
In May, there was a disappointment because we had everything to come to the finish first.
It was a very lucky season.
We've finished it with 79 eyes.
Normally, 79 points are the champion name.
But the other team, Montpele, has played more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's gonna be okay.
Despite the struggle of the titles, I think we have strong teams such as Marcel, Lion and Bordo.
Don't you think that the media are waiting too much from the S.H.I.E.L.D.?
It's normal that we're expecting a lot, taking into account how much it has been and what games we have.
We're completely ready to do this.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 at home against Trua, we still find out what to discover, of course, is a little disappointment.
We ask what is the first time that people are waiting for us.
We can't win every week 4-0.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to introduce a game project.
The team is formed with time.
We have proved in Liga Champion, that we can respond to modern votes.
Look at Manchester Washington, who hasn't already been able to go to one eighth finish, although they also lost great money!
In view of the amounts set, we represented you at 15 points forward to the winter break.
This would be a detriment to our opponents and to the Championship of France.
Lion and Marcel, who were not at the height of the past season, were "developed" by this new CPS.
This shows how intensive the First League is.
I hope that in May we can smile and say ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have winned.
It seems that it is completely dependent on the Zilatana Ibrahim subways.
Well, if you say there's a little "Dependence".
It's just that Ibrahimvian has been very successful and that he forgot a lot of heads.
He's coming for this, and he's proving that he's the First League star.
The train where he played, he showed that he was a great player and a star of the world.
We respect him as a man and as a player in the group.
He also respects people around him.
What he did is really extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their game.
The Silva, who is one of the best protectors of the world, also motivates all to move forward.
How did you survive Euro-2012 with the French collection?
Like disappointment.
I wanted to learn to this Euro.
Unfortunately, my tragic has helped me to play a little game time.
I saw a lot of things there, and I went out of there.
Today I can play good selection shops.
That's what I hoped from the moment of my baptism in the Sons.
We have learned about what happened to Ukraine, and now we have to be sworn.
What do you think of the first months of the Didi Desham in the head of the Blue?
They're for him.
He has a good position in the selected group to the Championship of the world.
He's a strict trainer, he's close to players and inspires the winning.
How was Loran Blan?
But I wouldn't like to compare.
Bran reached his goal, he qualified us in Euro.
I hope the Dead Desham will bring the Blues to Brazil.
Good assigned nickel (1-1), issued in Spain on 16 October, is this a fundamental shop?
This match gave us faith in us.
Everyone fighted for all.
Before that shock in Spain, there were no such mathematics in my car.
Plan and sale without bank help - with Bitcoin
The full contrary to the current currency exchange based on the central accounts provided by transactions between the parties receiving c committees on their processing.
Furthermore, how often these technologies are, obviously, political vision: the conviction that the current currency system of bank monopolies leads to financial crisis.
Indeed, Bitcoin, developed by Satoshi Nacamoto (spoke) is a virtual currency (converted in dollars, euro...) and a protected protocol of BitTorrent exchange, which allows to perform the exchange of files between the parties in one level.
About 2000,000 operations have already been registered from 150,000 computers in the network.
A number of thousands of websites are accepted for the implementation of donations or as a payment fund.
The bicycle rate, reached by maximum $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, was up to $2 months later before returning to $10 (bitcoincharts.com) today.
Nothing specially compared to the global exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in its report on the virtual currency published in October.
It describes a bitch as a "slightly successful virtual currency", "competitive with the dollar or the euro" and "competitive for ordinary currencies".
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies, as "creats" used for video movements that are played in the game process or which can be purchased (which and exchanged).
The Facebook social network has also developed a similar system.
However, exchange operations always controlled and processed any central body.
In Bitchen, all networks are the mainteneurs of the Buhgalter Books, the auditors, the monetary emitants, the purchasers and the sales.
How does this network function?
Each transaction between two users is actually between two electronic addresses, such as e-mail.
Only for each new payment, the user may choose another address, thus ensuring an anonymity.
The collection of information relating to this case is signed electronically using a double key encryption system.
The network may also check the reality of the contracts.
Thanks to the content of the file, it may be possible that the bits used in the box are actually in the public account covered by the entire network.
The key stage is the registration of the new transaction in this book.
It is through the decision of the mathematical task dissolved to the computer, which has been resolved as an interim central bank, the privileges to add this new line.
It's about the heating phase of the file, which is the conversion of a large file into a digital, short and unique signing.
Computers will take a new transaction and add her number before he hasn't all together.
The goal is to find the number that will give a unique numerical sign (like numbers at the beginning).
Once this number has been found, the other samples are easy to check that it is right.
Transaction is thus shown nervously related to the cement of all other transactions; any modification changes the digital signature.
If the user would like to pay two times one and the same payment, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network, and the other would remain uncertain, since they have different electronic signatures.
The computer that decided to get 50 bits.
In order to avoid inflation, the rewards may be regularly shared until the end of 2012.
The number of bits in treatment is limited to 21 million, but they're delimited to the one stoolion that leaves the rest of the reservations...
The task is also increased by an increase in calculating power.
Life of the network has already survived flights and falls.
Bitcoin services have been attacked, and buses were stolen from reserves.
"Usered defect does not concern the protocol itself," says Peter Nuas, who recently started Paymium - the company of real money using Bitcoin network.
The ESCB also informed the possibility of eliminating the money through this anonymous service.
But the money is also inadequate.
Great games, such as Wikipedia, refuse to take such donations.
Others, such as WordPress platform blogs, are allowed.
Addy Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Waitman Institute in Israel have recently analyzed the account book and found that nearly 80 per cent of the bathrooms were in the traffic.
"Gigant sales" was announced in November.
"Third thousand dollars were exchanged", agrees Jon Holmkwest, who works in Coinabul, employed by the conversion of balls in gold.
Peter Nuas, another author of this currency, is strongly believed in the capacity of this technology as an operational network.
His system, Paytunia, is an equivalent credit card (in the present money) or a mobile phone payment, but uses Bitcoin to check the transactions that thus comes out of deficit.
The driver better controls its personal data and may thus be an anonymous.
The simple system for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
Only reporting the address that can "foto and recognise" by the phone, Peter Nuas states that there are thousands of users already.
There is a general trend of revision of the ironarchic systems for more horizontally.
"Before Bitcoin is approved, it will take some time, but 2013 may be a turning moment," he states.
In its report, the ECEB proposes to review the diversity of risks considered to be increased today in the case of success of this system.
We're out of Afghanistan.
What's going on?
The French troops left their responsibilities in Afghanistan (Capissa and Soboa).
NATO and the Americans should follow them at the end of 2014.
For the Afghan army, it's time to return to control over its territory, and to choose their future, not only for us.
We had suffered in the main part of the Afghan baptists, which we considered to be terrorists.
And we're, with 88 murdered soldiers, and blessed and punished.
Taliban is from foreign extremists who have been hidden in Pakistan, but often from the crystals who reject the presence of the foreign army, as was in the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and Archaeicals, to even join the Jehoidians, Pakistanians, arabs, tooths, dancings.
They are suffering, sometimes helping local forces, but they will be no longer until the West will be more detailed.
The French troops from the Nigerian base, which I watched from the height of the mining woods through French credits, were fine.
The shipping ships and the helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
Since the end of 2014, the tsunami will not be at Kabul.
The circumstances have changed since their unexpected transition from 1994 to 1996.
At that time, Kabul was empty, the country was in fire and blood because of the fight between different groups.
They were then under control of the country as their type of release to return to security.
The Afghan Women paid for the masterships of these creatures in which Al-Qaida had been overlooked, but their situation has not been improved in our day.
The former moderates, the Afghan Government and the present talents are in their desire to maintain women in the substantive situation.
The main personalities of the antisotic war returned to the authority in 2001.
They turned into deceasers of public land to sell them under the installation of repatrians returned from Iran and Pakistan, using the great American sub-agency contracts.
They were dismissed; most of them, they did not even fight themselves.
People, as I heard in a rural location, want the Government that wouldn't be of the weapons.
Many young people want to go to the way they go away from American generosity: Capital Population.
Young people slaughtered from war and their ideology.
They lived in the modern world during the expulsion of Iran or Pakistan, and were assessed the advantages of it.
About 65 per cent of the population is over 25 years; in Kabul there are now 5 million people, one of the fifth general population.
State schools in cities are filled with boys and girls.
These young people who do not want to return to an old party or to the corruption of some leaders must be assigned to work.
All, including armed bombs, love mobile phones, television and Turkish milk operations representing the modern world, and are looking at all.
The army is at the moment.
Will the authorities who will command it be considered legitimate?
The old teams of anti-sociotic combat have already taken measures to restore provincial women who would not be subjected to central authority.
Afghanistan, a mountain country with strong local differences, must be decentralized in a certain sense, in the form of Western countries, but the United States wanted to convert it to a centralized State with a strong presidential authority, eliminating the post of the Prime Minister, which was held in the context of the Constitution in 1964.
The President of Carzai does not want foreign control, particularly before the elections referred to in April 2014.
His country, starting from the 50s and even before, depends on foreign assistance.
Industry was not put on feet, no flesh functions, no irrigation system has been reorganized.
Everyone is imported; nothing is produced except fruit and fruit.
Priority is given to the private initiative.
In the country destroyed by thirty years of war, the infrastructure control would be necessary.
They heard that Afghanistan had great mineral riches.
This has only increased the sense that western countries were present there only to possess them.
Without energy for the processing of iron routine or mediums on the place, without transportation to export them through the mountains, no useful coppers.
The Chineses have almost left the birth of Mes Aynak, left the international archaeologists (financiated by the World Bank) to discovered a large buddhistic complex and to remain the largest employees of the province.
It should also be necessary to restore normal relations at one wonderful day as Afghanistan and Pakistan.
The conclusion of the French combat units has been concluded on 20 November.
The New Cooperation Treaty provides for the maintenance of traditional assistance: persons for girls, boys, French Language Faculty at the University, the French Institute, the cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support of the Archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, with the efforts to “require hearts and vulners” and to carry out the impossible task of co-operating with the future operations, the "free-government activities" service at the Ministry of Defence" in 2012, together with a small French public organization, has contributed to a number of public works and activities aimed at reconstruction of rural housing in decades of mountain villages.
These works, with the intensive involvement of local workforce, have helped to maintain upstanding: goodness, collars, drinking water, forest rebuilding, fruit trees, food protection and increased the area of coastal lands.
What do we have to leave in mind, losing two billion euros in military expenditure?
The more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of local population living conditions, which are very ridicule in those regions, often located at more than 2.000 meters above the sea level.
The Administration has received decades of written requests for the implementation of small agricultural work from local communities in Capis province.
To save the resurrections of foreign groups, which the farmers want to say to me, there is a small inevitable support to them that would be well controlled and directed.
Extreme species of the Constitution of Egypt
This is a new risked step by President Mursy.
While Egypt is part of more than ever, on the question of the Constitutional Declaration, which is providing an emergency authority, he decided to play a va-bank.
Instead, he announced in the medium that the Official Assembly would vote on the final text on the next day.
A week ago, the Head of the State provided the congregation two additional months to end the work.
Two years ago, as Egypt is opposed to a preliminary text which has been amended several times to reduce institutional stability and lead to legal oppositions.
This new initiative has only increased the separation of the country.
His opposites believe that the President is in its "autocratic sweet" by continuing "reducing the word" and "astraining the right".
His followers are convinced that this is the way to end the institutional and political crisis by speeding the transition process.
The referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time that lets the brothers refuse to explain the text to the Egyptians in the article.
For the President, this is also the way to restore public and democratic legitimacy while involving in the whole country.
Mohammed Morsey seems to be convinced that the Egyptians are declared positively as he stated in one interview of the American weekend Time.
In addition, the appeal to a rapid vote is to the Egyptian people: “If you vote for my text, or I have an emergency power”, which, as it is supposed, must be completed after the Constitution's adoption.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Governing Assembly, most of the Islamics, were declared the text last night.
Most Liberals did not respond to calls.
In the midst of November, soon before the Constitutional Declaration, they took the door, feeling that they could not be able to give their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 persons of the participants were successfully added last morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
It is unexpected that in most cases the article was declared unilaterally.
On the other hand, the comments encouraged the fact that one of the few different discussions of the day was around... a time for prayer, since some members of the Committee read that the time of the Governing Assembly was wrong.
The text of which the vote was still voted last night is of article 234.
The general attention of article 2, finally, remained a identical article from the Constitution of 1971, which claims that " the principles of the shariat are the main source of law".
The Palestinian parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law was one of the main demands, were expected to replace the "principes" to "just" which would give them a more strict application.
For the Islamics the fact that this article has not been changed is the testimony of their good will and respect for the other parties of the Egyptian society.
"Licemery" is answering liberals that are seeing only a pilar.
Because it is their view that the exclusion of the Constitution occurs through other articles.
They are particularly indicated in article 220, which gives an advisory role to the Al-Azhar University, in particular with regard to checking the correspondance of the chariot laws.
According to the specialist on Egypt, Sofi Pomaie is concerned, etc. "The people intended to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy."
We can look at the birth of the theocracy."
Many Liberals, moreover, are reflected by the fact that the next ctor of the university seems to be less dead than now.
" There is no specific religious involvement at this moment.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of civil law.
Most lawyers who worked on this text are not worthy, but people with university education, some have been trained in the French system," said Alex Bloe, who will prepare a dissession on Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that " around article 220 may occur in an independence, since the terms used in it are imminent from religious physicians.
This applies in particular to the “fix” [Islamic law, accepting the rhetoric].
In the future, it may be a question of how competent civil courts are to make decisions on this."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is criticized because it provides wide power to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers claim that they have significantly reduced in comparison with the old regime.
Another opportunity: the Army's authority.
In accordance with military desires, the consideration of the defence budget will be not in the Parliament, but in the National Defence Board.
The court of civilians in military courts will also not be prohibited, despite requests for human rights associations.
Recently, it was also concerned about the text, which they are considered guilty for freedom.
Reserved responsibility for godly devotion and currently prohibited distortion that may have serious consequences for the freedom of words, and especially for the freedom of pressure.
Nevertheless, no article speaks about the protection of women, Heba Moraefe, from Human Ryan's Tache.
It says that the only positive moment was the prohibition of torture in article 36.
The word not appeared in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian Chairman had to speak last night on television, the manuscripts were planned today in the second half of the day.
The headquarters of the State will, on their way, go to the street on Saturday.

"Break and Power" to Moscow will prove that migrants will copy money in the language
As long as the Deputy and Rights Defenders claim that the law on binding language tests will be granted, there have already been frauders in the country for "little" certificates
Any year, 13 million guests arrived in Moscow, Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of these citizens in Middle Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkey.
Their only goal is to pay money for the family remaining.
From 1 December, it entered into force of the law, under which every working migrant would be required to provide an exam to the knowledge of Russian language.
As long as this rule operates only for those intended to work in the field of services, housing and communication, fat and degrading trade.
However, with the time, - they promised to the ICF, the tests will be binding for all arrivals.
Afterward, it is not just the language but also the Russian history and the basis of legislation.
The knowledge of the language should also be confirmed to receive and to extend work permits.
Excludement is only for citizens of Russian countries where the language is public.
The law and persons who have been able to obtain attestations and educational diplomas before the SSSS fall in 1991.
Use, decrease and protection of rights
The network of exams will work under the Russian Institute of the Language of Pushin, the University of People's friends, the ICU, the SIPH and other Russian hosts.
Migrant tests will be possible in all cities, and more than 160 such centres are now opened in Russia.
The initiative for testing was supported and the Chairpersons of the Gospel and the FMI.
And so, before the law entered into force, the human rights defenders have been able to ask the press a lot of times, and what would it give?
What changes the obligation of knowledge of language and for Russians, and for the most residents?
First of all, the representatives of the migration service are enabled to reduce the number of people suffering from “the body slavery”.
Many say now about the protection of the rights of labour migrants, explains the leadership of the Russian FBI representative in Tajikistan, Victor Sebel.
Protection of their rights must be started before their departure.
Only organized system allows for 90 per cent to address foreign workers.
Problems occur in migrants without professionals, education, unknown languages without medical observations.
Without understanding of the language, Sebel, the future immigrant is deemed to face insufficient people who will be able to cut a trap in a hot sweet bar, where he and his decades will be seen for months without food and documents, including 12 to 14 hours in the slope.
We receive a number of complaints from our migrants.
"In the family they promise one, and at their arrival they lie, they choose passports and do not pay the promised payment," reaffirms the Chief of the Tajikistan Tolib Sharif.
Don't smell, sweetheart!
However, until many people in the Mediterranean Republic, who are assembled for work in Russia, are acknowledged that they do not only know the language of the country in which they try, but also write with their own work.
It is certain that it is not their wine as bad as it is: few turcmen, denses, and taxi may allow themselves to even obtain an explicit primary education.
Because their families have nothing even to use their children, not to be able to spend them in school, training, and training.
The first time that they are employed before adolescent age, they are sent to work.
It's hard if it's bad to know the language, they're recognised.
"You're low and unprecedented."
True, the Law on the Rights Protectionists notes one important point.
Testing will be conducted only for migrants who have legal status.
If there is no status, no examination or a subsequent official work.
However, the large part of the hastabutizers remains illegally living in Russia.
"Good welcome, or the bilateral entry is prohibited."
Many of the residents claim that obtaining official status in our country is not so simple.
The responsibilities are in bureaucratic preferences and the same language difficulties.
Moreover, the legialization has money: from 12 to 16.000 rubbers.
The false registration can be made quickly and over half thousands.
The Russian police officers know that we are mainly false documents, no registration, here and the cases of demand.
"A hundred, two to smoke, a tea," was shared with the journalists of Tajikistan Ummd Hushadham.
"Don't buy, buy a book."
On the first day of the entry into force of the Language Law, the false persons were not only migratory instruments.
A number of "left" language test certificates have already been issued by FMS staff.
Detailed papers are printed on a normal color printer.
It is sure that they were sufficient to new owners: each of the migrants who hoped to facilitate the task of the testing has paid for the 70,000 rule document.
This is two times the road of official testing procedure, which will be covered by the employee in three thousands.
The main task for the next time is to protect the corruption system so that the " shorts " could not be able to purchase, settle and representatives of the authorities and rights defenders.
As long as the authorities may promise the gustarbiters that have not been successfully tested from the first time, time to study the basic language course.
Furthermore, there will be a proposal for work in areas that do not promote active communication with people.
IDP does not take an illicit weapons market in the trade
Crimes with the use of legal weapons are extremely small
IUD Russia proposes to renew the law on civil weapons owners.
This is the reaction of the recent incident authorities: Try shoes to marry when there was no victims, and the battle established by the Moscow judiciary Dmitrim Vinograd, resulting in the death of seven people.
Police officers want to prohibit the pressing of traumas in public places and to increase the age of which the arms license can be obtained from 18 to 21 years of age.
The idea supported the Head of the Reflexion Committee on Security and Competition of Irina Yaroya and promised that the amendments of the weapons law would be introduced in the future.
It is not all pleased that the Russian authorities try to fight the problem through the "hake cutting".
There was an open letter in the web, which authors, representatives of different public organizations, required to reject the "begotten vision".
The percentage of the brutality with registered weapons was minimumized, and the Russian Bibi-s-criminalist Vasili-Lessler declared.
In IMD statistics, 142 crimes were made in 2012 with the use of internal offences registered by fire weapons, while all the same period has been fixed by 1168.000 crimes.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the restructuring of the legislation in the field of civil weapons does not place a crime to go to the black market.
Now, according to their words, we can find any weapons in Moscow for a low price.
At that time, IUD claims that the situation is controlled by the dissemination of illegal weapons.
Traders: from officers to officers
The "Charest" weapons market is filled with several channels.
The main channels of five are reported to the embassy of Victor Balanz, who has been employed in the Ministry of Education and Henstabe for ten years.
A website that accepts a weapon orders
The first is 'Armee or Military Suite' is a weapons slaughtered during the fighting action in Kavopah.
"The weapons and the Russian officers, and their own cowboys," says the Barranja.
The next type of black weapons is a slaughtered crime in the representatives of the force structure.
The board explains that the police officers are incoming here, and slaughtered directly to law enforcement officers.
Unlawful creatures are in the sale of military equipment.
In many military units, explosions have often occurred.
"It's a evidenced version that a part of the shooting was made specially - to cover the slowness," said the former military.
Their lips, as Barranty says, produced weapons.
“Actually, private weapons are fruited, which does not sustain competition on the international market and elect weapons from the field under the black market, including Moscow,” says the experts.
Another source of black market is the contraband.
In particular, weapons and cars from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"They have their production, sometimes a cupary, and the mafia that organized the river," explains the former military.
Where's the weapon?
Experts learned how close every source of illegal weapons on the black market was provided.
The report on this in 2011 prepared the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Management Projecting.
Specialists analyzed the reporting of IMD and Rossstat, criminal literature and the open data on weapons topics.
A part of the illicit weapons, writes researchers, comes from the army and force states.
Half of the weapons on the black market were in the report.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of the armed conflict cases are from the place of arms conflict, 14 per cent of the weapon production stages, 5 per cent of the black archeology.
One of the weapons shops who asks not to call his name believes that weapon found by black copers has already been buying too old.
It's just what he says, for the new party, the soldiers are going to the army.
A man is buying a unit, such as the TT gun.
He's writing it, they're transmitting it through the slaughter.
"He'll transport her to the city and sell it to 900 euros for two shops," he says.
"But, the police in the course of all cases, therefore periodically when the crime opening plan is driving a control purchase for illegal weapons," adds the advisor.
"What's in the growing shop."
Sellers and buyers are often finding each other through the acquaintances.
I looked at the websites, in the blog until the friend was called to come to the Godwai platform where the man would take me to the "hook" where we will trade.
I learned the price just there.
Military Conspirator Victor Balanz
I need a acquaintance to get enough to get me out of here, tells the license, and I have a very acquaintance, but I'm not sure in it.
The sellers are on the market, but there is also need to come from the "Ivan Ivanovic, who asked to deliver that the daughters of the tooth had gone".
I'm even getting a couple of castes through a man who's sure.
He also puts them alone to me because he knows I'm not going to give him.
News are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military Victor Balanz was the role of buyer of illegal weapons in the middle of the 1990s when he prepared for the publication of this article.
His words did not change.
He gave the album with the photos where "too good".
"I felt like in a growing shop," remembers the military.
The purchaser, according to Barranty, does not propose a cup in a cup -- everything can be tried.
I'm the potential customer, not just buying - we're going to go with a soldier in the forest, we're taking a mouse there.
"I have a chance to shoot, and when I convince that weapon is good, we start to trade", describes the expert procedure.
Wonder shops
Searchs on websites and groups in the Vancoute, where they propose to purchase the weapons for different purposes.
There are no documents and meetings for this purpose.
"Thank a certain amount of money," writes the advertising chat on the website "Copting a gun or an automated gun."
The users leave their applications and put questions to them.
What about the juvenile sales?
"The license of the license, of course," asked the user "Ivan" (reserved orphography).
"T. Moscow Count" - Laconally forms the "Fedrenko" request.
The Federal Security Service has now dismissed a large network of substantive websites and those who want to purchase war weapons is a stroke.
People come as a hungry fish on the floor, and then get to Siberia angle
Military conspirator and former military Victor Balanz
I heard about such schemes: normally the website is registered under Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer is making payment.
"The answers are sent photos and instructions where the weapon was hidden", says the public secretariat Dmitri Kivov.
Victor Balansky claims that when he left a request on the website, it is possible to stay without weapons and get back for a decision.
The Federal Security Service has now dismissed a large network of substantive websites and those who want to purchase war weapons is a stroke.
"There are going to come as a hungry fish on the floor, and then they get to Siberia angle," he says.
Makros for $100
In purchase of illegal small weapons, expert estimates, the amount of $100 to $900 can be estimated.
According to Dmitri Kyprow's arms organization, Macarv's weapons are obtained for $100-300.
It's going to be waiting for a month.
It is downloaded from long-standing components of these medium-related components.
Official statistics, in comparison with January-October 2011, the number of such crimes in general in Russia was 7 per cent, and 22.9 thousand, and the number of deficiencies and demands of weapons, bombs, explosive substances and explosive devices were decreased to 7.8 per cent.
In the United States, fastfound workers and supermarket workers
Through work at the McDonalds, all American adolescents go to the fourth.
In the past days in America, the anti-protections against low salary in Walmart and the restaurants of popular fast food networks such as "Macdonalds", "Burger King", "Yo Bell", "Wandys" and "Change Fryed Chunn".
As long as no one may predict whether the wave is transformed into the nine currency or condemned to wake up early stages.
Action supports professionals and several left public organizations.
In addition to the improvement of moderate wages received by the Walmart and the rapid food system, the establishment of prosecutive organizations is the aim of prosecution.
As long as the economic sector is not almost covered by the professional movement.
46 cents per year?
The shares began last week, after the Thanksgiving Day, as the Black Friday called, when in America the orgy of sweet sales, the earliest millions of swimming persons, and sometimes the floors contributed.
In that day, some workers of the Walmart corporation, in which 2,2 million people work around the world, left their workplaces and cut together with professionals and the left shopholders, whose goods were equipped with modest and medium-sized people.
Walmart spends all on the light, from the shooting, shooting weapons and car batteries to swimming powders, ices and milk.
Products in its shops in average 8% to 27% dechews than in large supermarkets.
Thus, many low-employed workers in Walmart are only in their own jobs.
The accessibility and assortment of goods made Walmart one of the largest American corporations.
According to the critics, Walmart may allow himself to sell the sellers to be paid as little as paying to his employees.
Recently, the lack of car loaders or manual scanners are also complained of the difficulty of work.
Their shareholders were required to increase payment and deteriorate that the cost of the company ' s medical insurance was upgraded from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
The typical worker Walmart, receiving $9.5 per hour, said they.
Scientists from the California University in Berlin have proved that if Walmart increases the average payment up to $12 per hour, the corporation is $3.2 billion.
It's about 1,1% more than it's paying for now.
If Walmart's whole payment is going to be paid for buyers, every visit to the shop will be over to 46 feet.
They will cost $12,39 more than now.
The Walmart parties noted very much that the protestist action had occurred in only nine states and did not cause corporations nor a small damage.
"First Thursday" continued in her shops from 8 hours to midday afternoon, and Walmart sold about 5000 goods in seconds.
In the total complexity of her cash devices, nearly 100 million transactions were produced in the Green Friday.
The representative of the company, Dan Fogelman, said at the left site Huffington Post, that the workplaces left in the general complexity of Walmart officials, and that the protest action was the total "normal pirate trick" organized by her prosecution.
"Free Cassa."
Protests continued this week in New York, where their object was not the Walmart university (which do not regret them in this progressive city, and therefore there is no place here) and McDonalds and other quiet restaurants.
McDonalds says he's sell billions of portions, and then he didn't even give you sicks and does not pay you for your honourable job!
Julian Williams, New York Mountains member
At this time, the minimum payment, according to the federal and New York legislation, is $7.25 per hour.
The restaurants have increased rapidly, but less than they are, and their average number of workers receive $8.90 per hour in New York.
They're less than in this street, no one's pays.
How to exist in New York for such money, it's unreasonable for me.
Sometimes "Makdonalds" had been through the four American adolescents who worked for their appendix after school, lived with their parents.
A little person saw this main source of survey or planned to stay there for a long time.
But now, I continue to stand on the interview with the McDonalds workers who regret that they should live on the payment and sometimes even in the child.
On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal forum has comments that the author notes that the child is insufficient if you don't know what you're going to use them.
Protest shareholders started on Friday 6.30 on the 40th Street and the Madison Avenue, required that the casiers and the fast food systems start as a minimum of 15 dollars per hour, and that they had doubled the current minimum loans.
They were also required to create professional organizations in the area of rapid food.
The American law prohibits the administration of this to prevent and punish actors of driving and freeships.
On the other hand, the Administration has rarly facilitated their lives.
But the fast food is complex and objetive.
One of the mains is an unexpected piece of career.
Inconvenience
The sweet protesters were held on that day and some of the other sweet restaurants of Manhattan.
In the middle of the mixday, the action appeared in the McDonalds, close to the Times-Cover, where several local democratic politicians were held, in particular, a member of the Gulf of Jimmy Williams, who claims: "Macdonalds" said that he sells milliars of portion, and then he does not even give you hospitals and does not pay you for the honourable work!".
Demonstrators supported and other visible New York Democratic Democracy, for example, candidates at the post of Mr. Bill De Blasio, who stated that " we should be friendly to support fast food workers in order to achieve fair payments and economic well-being for each New Yorker".
As the New York Times observed, this was the greatest action in the history of the American Food Area.
But only a few hundreds of people were involved, but not all of them were fast-commerce workers, in which tens of thousands were employed in New York.
Until it is unexpected whether the screen of the mass movement will generate.
"When the brain lies, it's a medium."
The popularity of modern technologies has recently been adopted through special points.
At the first summer, Google showed the current model at its annual conference, and then, in November, was known that the application for the relevant patent was given and Microsoft.
However, from the discussion with the leader of the 3D Interactive Technology Group in the Cambridge Lab, Microsoft Sharam Isradi should be that for the scientists of the ship company, a passenger stage.
They have the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in black hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Tell me in general what your research group is doing?
- We are employed by human interaction with machines, but we try to divide the borders of this interaction.
As the humanity was shocked in the mass at the work stage with pickles on a floor screen, sometimes the tsunami is in them.
We want to look at 5 to 10 years ago and warn the cardiac changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox and the Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold without Kinect, because it's interestingly cruel management.
- What's going on?
- Despite Kinect's interaction to physical levels, many of them are still on a pool screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input has been improved (the system receives more data) and the conclusion is not very much.
We're trying to change this, working on the truly three-measuring systems based on different technologies, including projects.
We need to get the computer world out in our physical, to make it more vulnerable.
However, it is necessary to recognise not only the user but also the space around it.
Then we can complement the real world by virtual objects in a much better form.
And in the first way, these stupid shoes of virtual reality!
- What do you think about the voice management?
The polar shoes, but do they not reassess it?
- It is certainly impossible to call panacea - a question of privacy, because it is not always desired to publish the surrounders about their actions and purposes.
In fact, all kinds of relationship with computers are good, but everyone is in their own.
For example, we had a project that we thought about kitchens, but not over swimming, but on such shopping, short.
The shoes were taken not the camera of the device, but a manual bracelet that fixed the skin and mouse movement.
As long as he is big, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of the hand hours.
But the future is for the kind of management, for example, jist+ голос.
- How is that?
- For example, how do you ask me to give you this gas bank?
You're gonna show you the same time.
- I'm usually just talking.
- Oh, it'll be very complicated to recognise.
- So you want to make users adapted to what may or can't at the time of the machine?
- It's not necessary, but it's a mutual approach.
I think, in the nearest time, we have to work on the development of new sensors that will enable us to determine the human reactions.
This may, for example, be the laser sensors, they give bad permission to deeply, which is very important.
- If you talk about your work with Senators Xbox Kinect, what claims to modern cameras?
Is there no permission, depth or anything else?
- In the principle of the present generation, it is what can be dismissed in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get megapixel 8 with a speed of 1000 a/s.
But the case is not in the most megapicules, but as the mothers and the deepness.
From the last point of view, all the current technologies are inadequate, which adds work to the designers of algorithms.
That's why we should remember not only the permission of X and Y, but also Z.
It's also very important, the number of carriages in seconds.
Human movement is very dynamic, and the current 30 k/s is clearly small, especially for jewels.
Steven Betiches from our Radmond Lab was a scenario with a regulated delay of 1 to 100 ms, with modern serial sensors near the second (60-100).
Not everyone understands how this affects the relationship between humans and machines.
I would like to be very grateful to the equivalent of this device, not just the need for a degree of career in seconds.
- Doesn't the number of cameras need to increase?
- Kinect now has three boxes, one of which actually is an inflated wipe, and the second is the acceptant of the signal.
And here's the third camera, that's the common senseor of the visible diameter.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
More cameras could solve the problem...
Or raising it, increased the number of calculations required.
It would be easy to create a flexible Kinect analysis, playing with a crystal camera position, and see how this helps in three-dimensional definitions.
- I remember, Microsoft, in different ways from Google, did not present the public.
Do you not think that daily use of additional technologies is one of the most prospective platforms?
- Of course, it's always time to switch, holding Smartphone in the hands, not very nice, but I think: the most beautiful option would be the "passing" reality, when you could change with the small platform, the projection screen and the more.
The skin is a very personal device, in which their powers (private things are only you see) and the weakness is a supplementary reality based on the views does not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- We'll present a minute that the manipulation of virtual golf objects in the air is not only available for Tony Stark from the Heavy Man, but also the simple death.
There is a problem that often indicates the criticism of this idea: no tactical call!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers will your group prepare for this call?
- In my lessons, I often say that supplementary reality is the seventh passenger in the interaction of human and machines.
I think the eighth could be an appendix of tactic feelings.
Together, one of the interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a shape of images.
She's registering the test!
But there are also technologies that are really directed to the assembly of these "cartinas in the air" - for example, interference of several extractional pieces in a certain point where the ball is, it makes a feeling, but it's very weak, like you're slow.
There are bracelets on nervous finishing in the fingers, also a prospective direction.
- You tried to lie the brain?
Let him think he's feeling like it should feel at the time he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we're not sorry to do this.
There is another task that is to be held for a long time - as to put a person who is physically in a very limited space, to believe that it is on an open, practically unnecessary, working and on the concepts of flight roads (as not in clubs), moved platforms and large shapes.
While the brain lies in the medium, work is still a lot of years.
That's what works on the virtual reality of such an appeal for the researcher - a lot of things in a completely initial state.
Artist instead of culture, Rosebalt.
The "Rosbalt" project continues to be the Pieterburgh Avangard, dedicated to the horrors that are forwarded in the Avangard of Cultural and Art.
In this pocket, the light of Petersburg art-scensor, whose achievement is out of the cities framework, often acknowledged in Europe, in the past of Russian knowledge.
The New Rosbalt Hero is the epata artist, Kirill Miller.
The whole city is known by Kiril Miller as a red man who has been found in the Russian Museum, the Latvia garden, the modern tubs and the beaches.
Cartina, Kiril Miller, always collect the snakes where they wouldn't be.
Kirill Miller is one of the peterburgian social and philosophical speakers who created new microologys.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant man of Peterburgian Avangard at the end of the 80s, starting the 1990s.
He also was a man of the city who appears on the streets that causes a smile in the horns that upsets all the visions.
He recently took a sharman in his hand and became a Peterburgh sharmaner, as he shouted for this complex role all his divine existence, philosophy and immigration.
- Kryril, why are you going to the city in the whole red, not in the iron or blue, for example?
- I chose a red colour as a model that works with a type and a mixture.
The red color in this world is a compromise between artist, immigrant and society.
Although everything in society is not serious, it causes aggression and resurrection of unclean qualities.
But my interviews are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my invasion action is an invitation to the debate.
- When do you understand what to be an artist?
- My work was put to the Nevaku.
I realized it's my way.
Then the circle of old informal artists went, and my new, free types were not understood.
I started friending with the artists of the new wave, with a post-shore that brought to the Pushanese-10, and there was no more waves.
I'm going to the theatre, clothes, music, all the gentlemen, except words.
And all this has been connected to your Art Clinic... - I was important to see in Petersburg's culture centre, where all the best creative forces should be gathered.
In 1995, I took the territory to the Puskistan 10 and there was a musical-artist club, a godly club, the house of the Peterburgian gods.
Many of them were born: NOMs, Tequila Jaz, I remember Snara's project with the "Wang Van Gog".
Snow and his friends were sing under the fanner of light songs, they were in a swimming trick, among them was the modern player of Joer Wodovin.
When the group played alive, she became Lininggrad.
Tricktenberg was the leading of many programs before the califer times.
We gave them Trucktenberg, and he went to the big carriage, and the basic education and education he received us.
The "D 137" gallery is the "Griboed" club.
Our employees have gone forever.
I'm a hero of the last century when the culture's meaning was something.
In 2000 there was a press, the premium was the "Food of our city".
In the name of the Year of the Year I was called, my culmination ended.
In the new times of old rules, I am a man of truth, honestity and cultures of the past century.
In these years, it is easy to become popular, but cultural and popularity can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work is a skilled manager.
- Many of my pictures are the shoes, they have an outstanding activity and shock.
I'll have a program exhibition, the Russian Museum in Klones.
Clones are an interim category.
I was so social, now being so painful and horrible.
But in the clons, the tragic is cut off.
I love the smell, I've got a sound idea.
For instance, the salvation of peace by the same asliance in order.
Now, on the clothing, they meet the external mechanism, not the internal man.
Well, maybe he couldn't give him a hand and he's gonna have to smell in the skin.
And the lie will be cut off by relief.
And recently we saw you in the role of a city sharmaner.
Whoever isn't me, they're.
- Maybe the commercial art can be beautiful?
- The commercial art must now be accurate, tactical, smooth.
It's the declination of culture.
Mansome were shocked in the shoes, the god loved one, the lack of the other.
But now they're on the micro-based communities, and it's hard to enjoy all.
I don't have a twenty-third paper to love everyone.
Now you have to think who you're gonna like.
Now, every cultural hero has 100 worshipers.
- And the Michalova Stace comes a few thousands!
- He's got brochures, there's a sex-social area.
And 300 people will come to the cultural jungle, and 100,000 will not come, and, as a result, less mining, money, all shooting.
I have worshipers, mostly not to lie, not to export the useful.
I wrote the pictures in the youth that they were on the wall next to the Falk and the Larryon winter.
I started from the pictures that are usually finished.
Now it is often the idea.
They say, the culture of spiritual and consumption.
There is no culture in consumption, that is from another operation.
I am the people of the culture last day, growing up in examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, rejected money for images.
I'm about this culture.
- Kirill, what's wrong with Peterburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is an idea: a cultural official.
But not everyone can do culturally.
At the right kings, the kings may not have understood much in culture, but understood that they had to keep the right experts.
Here are good advisors in Moscow now.
We have people in Petersburg that might be experts, but they are accused, as they need higher experts that will evaluate these experts correctly and give them the way.
Now it's a sweet sweet.
And Heratt, but they're different because they're telling honestly that not all the modern art we're taking, are those artists who have to find themselves other museums.
- What is Peterburg for you?
Petersburg isn't a cultural capital in Moscow, there's more place.
And on our stones, the art of growth is difficult.
We need cultural advertising, and we have writers now more than readers, it's wrong.
There are very many people in Europe who are exhibiting.
We've got this scene.
We need to do a model art as it was in the beginning of the last century.

Number in Space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or combination with asteroid murderer.
The Caribbeans of space ships on ships are sending for the search for a reserve planet.
In order to maintain humanity, is the main question of how to continue its nature in situations of pregnancy or the same safe planet?
I think the choice is small.
Factually, the present planet is only two that can be seen, even if hypothetical.
"He is Vener and Mars," he is a senior scientist of the State Astronomic Institute of P.C. Sternberg (GAIS) Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions of life are more suitable at Mars, the temperature of Vienna is 500 degrees.
You can live only on a large height or on the Vienna orbit... in the space.
Reproduction issues were started from the fleet.
Another half years ago, experiments were conducted in plants.
Four generations were not different from their earthquakes.
Then the exhibition in the orbit of insects and small fruit-drizophiles.
In 1979, an egg was sent to the space to check how the embryo was developed in pregnancy conditions.
We're going to get out of a totally normal pepper.
And this is still starting a problem.
"The fact that this pencil is to find the opposite, he must stand on his feet and start moving", explains the leading laboratorium of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP) RAN Vladimir Snich.
I don't find the opposite, the peppers were shocked in a shock.
10 hours later, the full astrophy of instincts occurred.
The penns did not react on light and sound.
And there was a disaster that they just died through the fourth shoes.
"And two times we sneaked the pigs, after that we refused, because it's just impossible to work with them, "is kept the experiment with the birds in the Vladimir Shangev space.
With the last time the biological "mininclage" flyed to the orbit 16 years ago.
Experiences will be continued at the end of 2013.
However, Bion's biosport will be only one-complete persons.
There was an experiencing with crystals that were sent to the space with fruit.
In principle, there was nothing of supernatural found.
"It's been on biostellics, but again, it's a unique experiment, and such research needs to be conducted," notes Vladimir Snchev.
After the landscape of the space crystal, the seeds appeared.
But to address the problem of multiplication directly in the space until it is not received.
It's a simple task.
Life, loss of the environment, cannot simply implement its original instinct.
The man, in contrast with the beast, may, in principle, be.
Homo Saien has an abstract idea, and it is possible to create a similar emotional background.
Ethicly, such experiences are not carried out.
But women have been flighting in space for 50 years.
The largest risk was in the Teresk.
And the most precious thing that humanity has, it's a woman's body.
Our chick Vultel, and no one on the earth could say, whether he's keeping after the fleet in the space.
Does she have a child after that fleet?
"Nobody answered this question," said Veteran, the Vachtan Vachnadz Radio.
In June 1964, only a year after the fleet in the space, the first cosmonaut, Valentin Teresa, was born a daughter.
The father of the Andrian Nicolav child was also a span.
In 1988, Svetlana Saudika, a second woman who was in orbit and even working in an open space, was born son.
However, the risk remains.
We have little units with space cars that have been swimming after long flights, and a healthy generation grows.
"And if more, it is dangerous even at orbital flights," has the result of the cosmonaut flight, the Heritage of the Soviet Union, Russian Walker of Pole.
However, humanity needs to look for some new ways in biotechnology, protecting from radiation, creating art grammation.
The CCC Hidrolator is a binding stage of fleet preparation.
Here, in the conditions of the nucleus plot, spaces develop ability to work in an open space.
Water is injured.
If you are adults, you should be comfortable, but you are all alien in the environment, then the natural nature of the child is for adults.
Small theirandars seem to be confirmed - life in the sugar from the ocean.
There is a connection between the child’s about nine months in the mother’s swimming iron, and it is easier to swim into the water.
In principle, this is logically because since the birthday, from the first purchase, is only two weeks.
"It's very little to forget something," says the María Marine Axone.
In the words, if injury is more natural for a child, the women is the need for gravity, the force of gravity.
Very fast in the weakness, the muscles of the animals, the taze, are able to evacuate the fruit.
Okay, let's get it, trusting in the promotors of the family.
Of course, in the special camera to go to the kind, it's cutting it out.
"And what further?" provides untruthful questions to the Valler of Pole.
On the other hand, the child also needs art grain.
Without the earthly slowness, the body does not form a sketch and a muscle system.
New birth in orbit is not possible as an adult to load a special load cost for training.
He'll just be slaughtered for his life.
"And this experiment we're going to go with you, allowing the birth of a child into a foreign environment, brings us to the earth of disabled people, completely depassed," is the director of the IMP RAN Pestal Bioeth committee.
At the birth of children in space is the question of the theory.
However, this will be the reality when a landscape is on its ships to a far planet that will become a house for their descendants who are born in the space.
Head of the Head of Audit and Control Management: the swallowing system is slaughtered by the policy.
The Czech State Procurement Area provides good control bodies and, despite the existing quality legislation, it remains in its application.
This statement was made by the Miroslave Cal, Vice-President of the Supreme Review Control, from the interview for the website Update.cz.
"Zakon will never be perfect, but he must apply correctly what, I think it is not enough," commented the current situation of Cal.
Such conclusions provide joint inspection of the Czech and German control bodies.
As an example of wrong practice, Peter's approach is soon to the so-called sharp system.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the GDP (Charlie Democratic Party) would not be worried about the investigators of checking, which is prohibited or permitted?
"In any way, the Zakon should be established and, if he is prohibited, the Prime Minister cannot oppose the work of institutions involved in verifying and enforcement of the obligations, " constitutes Khal.
At the meeting of the Advisory Committee at the House of Deputy, you have spoken about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, which was composed of the legislation on public purchase of both countries.
What's the speech?
It's a parallular check that we've started two years ago.
On the other hand, the fact that the European legislation claims how public purchases should be made, national legislation should be further and then apply to practices.
All information was gathered and, even when an unlawful verification has found interesting differences - simply, legislation may be " accurate and unfair," but in practice, we are in some parameters of Germany.
It should therefore be focused on the application of its own law in order to create a more detailed rules.
And how can the project help you to do what he means for you?
This joint control may contribute to the stopping of the legislation, reducing and improvement of restrictions, since this does not lead to a positive result.
The economy means obtaining relevant things for a reasonable (not always low) price to avoid advertising and, perhaps, criminal behavior.
But it is not the fact that we reach it, decreasing the limits of orders.
Maybe this system will be fulfiled by "bums" so that those who want to find the lace in this system will find them much easier than if the limitations are not lowed.
You are talking about internal issues of practical application of public purchase legislation.
How does the monitoring system function in Germany?
Is there an organization such as our CCR (Control-Revisional Management) or does it work otherwise?
With regard to institutions, there is also a colleague that works a little different, but both mainly functions similarly in our principle.
Furthermore, the authority to a certain level is similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audience unit and a federal land level -- in that system, some of them are different from ours.
BRH can be managed only by federal money, we have public resources.
The general funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at federal account rooms.
What about local legislation, there is more than we have?
In fact, I wouldn't like to compare without specific data, but some of the Germans can be taken for the image, but I can't certainly say that it's better in all.
That's that, because they're better controlling?
Of course not, but I repeat, I don't like such comparisons.
However, it should be said that even sculpture countries are faced with many problems.
On the other hand, they would not receive any advantage from cooperation with our office, wouldn't they?
If you speak of domestic law, how did your establishment amendments to the State Procurement Act show the consequences?
Bearing in mind that the legal force of these amendments is very short, it has not yet shown in our control work.
As we control the facts, we need to take into account some delay.
We take this into account only in the process of future checks - we have started using our new "development of the risk of non-economic risk" through which we have extended nearly 14000 State contracts, and we have analyzed them, and of course these changes will be shown because the limitations are changed, some types of trends are changed.
How do you think that the adoption of this law will benefit or additional burden to the bureaucracy system?
I think that this law, of course, is a step in the right direction, and I hope that it will be confirmed.
The problem that may happen is that the rules are "fair" and they will not be respected.
In the functioning of the previous rules, controlled enterprises are linked to the supplier (e.g., regional operational programmes, with the Regional Board) that any non-compliance with the State purchase law means a violation of the budgetary discipline.
Should such a law be resolved?
I think it's not like that.
The system should exclude those who want to load and abuse, but not punish those who do a formal error that does not affect the decision.
This system will only create more pressure on bureaucracy.
And how do you get out of this situation?
Let's know that this way will not come to anywhere.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the GDP would not worry about the investigators of the so-called sharp system.
Swartz-system is prohibited or authorized?
The Law should be established in any way and, if it is prohibited, the Prime Minister cannot oppose the work of the bodies involved in verifying and enforcement of the obligations.
We can say, "We can change this law and decrease it," but we cannot say that we will make it like nothing happens.
The State Procurement Act contains a very strict rules as to which it must be implemented, and it is right, which protects public purchase.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic when candidates with the best proposal disabled only because of formal deficiencies.
The law will never be perfect, but he must do what I think is missing.
The roads are sweet, but we're mainly walking.
In some places of Checa, the roads are sweet and disappointed.
They're in the main way, but somewhere more careful.
Caribbean
Tonight, the roads were passed in the Carlovaal area, but some of them were sweet and disappointed.
Temperatural falls from 5 to 10 degrees below zero, but the temperature must be heat during the day.
The sunfall in the region has stopped, only in the bottoms there is a small skin.
Nevertheless, there are about 30 centimeters of snow on the Road Mountains.
From the information received from the areas of road workers, it was known that there was a lower visibility because of the tsunami.
The R6 crops and the roads of the first class in the region are now without limitations.
However, attention is needed on the bridges where the surface can be shocked and skilled.
Also, all roads relating to the second and third class, including mountain traces, are passed.
But on some of them, there are still remains of the rest of the swimming snow and the rest of their places.
Specially attention must be on the higher roads.
Paradubic and Crowley
The Checa road management and cars on its pages is informed that some of the roads of Eastern Chuania are threatened by Holocaust, and on the mountain roads and roads situated on higher levels may be a dangerous snow snake.
Railway workers warn the golf drivers, which can be particularly trained at the Paradubic land levels.
Holocaust may be around Lanskrowun, Usti-Nad-Orlizi, Policky, Svivia or High-Mito, particularly on the roads of the second and third class.
Rounds I/43 and I/34 located in Sweden are processed by chemicals.
The snow is particularly on the streets of the Cruznoch and the Orchick mountains.

Shin Ornest: We want to get positive energy on the concerts.
What do you think that less than a month later the end of the light should come?
It's just one of the many worried news that we, people, are so easy to fall.
However, with the Tap Tap Group, we are continuously smiling to this topic and say that we are the only world group that can collect enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the light.
Moreover, in December, you're going to make a totally unique three concerts against the end of the light.
Could you tell the readers more details?
This is the national assembly event that we have already planned for two years.
We decided to use the marketing capacity belonging to the May calendar, which was declared the end of 21 December at 1110.
For the day before that event, the 20th December at 21 a.m. three congress in Prague, Bron and Australia are parallelly launched.
They end up, unfortunately, at the moment when Kiribati Island in the Pacific Ocean, the timeline of which at 12 hours before we have ended the May calendar.
Who did this idea come into the head?
This was my idea, and we've all planned together with our artist of Hong Kong.
Besides what we want to take enough positive energy and prevent the end of the light, we also want to think together with the public about the situation of this world, where we are once transferred to our children.
In the case of the Middle Calendar, we have created a unique collection of objects from tissue, footballs, sacks and original keys against the end of the light, which can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz and thus provide support to us.
The Tap Tap Group, together with other musicians, also performed a giant against the end of the light, called "The King of Light".
Does YouTube's favorite listeners have a gymn on these banal concerts?
Of course, at the end, if everything will be achieved and the end of the light will not begin.
He's assigned to all of them at all gates at the same time.
The chineses are simultaneously replacing in the direct edition of the Chesk TV.
Words to this song wrote and played Jesus ’ role in the clape of Thomash Ganak, also participating in the performance of Xindl X...
How did you start working with them?
We are also cooperating with other individuals of the Czech cultureal life, since we conduct many well-being events and concerts.
We are trying to connect them actively to these projects.
Many people liked to work with us, they're interesting.
What will the exit from the concert against the end of the light?
In order to purchase a equipment for an unlimited STUDO educational centre, we have been working so with the civilian association of Tap to the Edward Institute.
Promotors regularly visit students from the Edleki Institute and conduct awesome and interesting events with them.
The students have no means to be sent to the providers, and we are trying to give them this opportunity so.
In the context of the project of the Additional Institute, there will be a building in the future in which we will move with this project.
A number of musical groups and executors will be held on each concert.
What were the choice criteria?
We have tried to create a programme that is interested in all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Lesbian support, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Iri Suki.
You can see all the details at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any such "participation events" in the future?
In May, we will first be talking about the "Plural spring" festival and, of course, prepare a interesting programme with interesting guests.
In the next year, we would welcome the presentation in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we are in the United States, would like to go to Washington and Chicago.
You have seriously plans for the winners, you've already spoken in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap Group is a group of people with limited opportunities.
How are you doing the road from the view of organization and logistics?
It's not so worried as it seems to be the first view.
We have five electric disabled balls, their skins must be traveled to the bathroom, and there is a large number of pieces and instruments.
However, the Czech Airlines and the British Airways have always been overwhelming for us as a lot of surprises.
Even to Moscow, from where we returned recently, everything happened without problems.
You can compare different countries with accessibility, public relations with disabilities, and so further.
What did you have to do with this moment?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries, where everything works better than we have, we became witnesses in Russia that still remains on the base level.
In comparison with Pragoi in Moscow, there are still many barriers, and there is still a single movement of humans to an electrical disabled cluster in the centre of the city.
There's no bad things that are going to be in the way of disabledness in the lift.
Happily, and there are public organizations that are trying to focus on people ' s problems with limited opportunities.
What, on the contrary, should we continue to prepare the previous countries?
There are very many things, which are the levels of fulfillment behind.
However, it is important to clarify that improvement and improvement of the situation are always dependent on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, people who are hardly disabled moved on the streets can go to the toilet, to the museum where they want to...
There is no wide range of people with limited opportunities to participate actively in public life, so we and the Tap Tap are a little angry!
The respect of publicity or non-interference is one thing, but at the time we have known sports, artists, actors, policies or lawyers, it will really begin to change.
Together, these are the unique cases, people with strong will.
The Tap Tap Group is now very popular, but we're going back to two years ago that you have put it to organize it in 1998?
I was in the Edlean Institute as a teacher, and there were many young people around me who wanted to get something.
And because I am a musician and playing, including at the socket, I was organizing an interesting music circle together with my colleague.
Well, at the time, as our leader Lady Angelovic says, it's just a little out of control (I think).
The popularity came over the past few years, or I'm going to travel?
That's true, we have been able to join the famous snares and actively work on the propaganda group.
We concluded that the work that no one could evaluate is like no one.
Thanks to the European Union, we can allow qualified suppliers, equipment and further.
Did the Tap Tap stand before you so well?
Since the beginning, I felt their ability to do something that was unexpected.
In the show-bizzings, it's a whole thing that reflects one another.
This is logically, it's all new to be careful, and it's long.
There's a little rare things, but I'm sorry to say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a man who's seeing us, of course, that's naturally...
But this painfulness is perfectly bad because people with limited opportunities are not any of the suffering and all we have to regret.
They are people who can live in full value and, of course, developing only if they have the necessary resources.
I say, if people with disabilities get something, it's not only for them but also for the whole society.
Have you made sure that you are a strict leader, how many of you believe?
If we want to work qualityly, we must be in many cases uncommissibly and maintain a certain discipline.
But I think it's okay.
Some people come to us with romantic presentation and flights in areas, and when they know that two times a week, they have to go to the reception, visit training courses and carry out a lot of time on the road, very fast losing anhusm.
But that happens in any group that wants to work and reach something.
Currently, the Tap Tap Tap group is twenty.
How many have they been started in 1998?
Only one lady Angelovic.
We're a open group, people come and get out, that's impossible to prevent.
For those who have desires and powers of will, our doors are always open.
It will be held on the day before the expected end of the light, on Friday 20.12.2012 at 21.00 p.m.
The Concept is going to Prague at the Incheba Stadion, in Brino in the Fleda Club and Australia, in the Plynojem centre, with the 12th group and other Czech musicians.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected to the smile at the time of the sing of the Tap Tap Tap Group "The King of Light is cancelled".
The purpose of this project is to collect financial resources for 25 million chrones for the purchase of multi-functional non-functional equipment for the STUDEO educational centre at the Edlean Institute in Prague.
The ticket is 400 krones, for children to 12 years of age, and the tickets can be purchased in Bohemiaticket.
Poland and Space.
The last week, at the meeting of the European Space Agency Ministers, the twenty-eighth European Space Agency was adopted as a second country from the former Eastern Bank (after Checa, which became a full member of the ECA 12 September 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with the ECA in 1994 and actively participated in a number of agencies projects during the following years.
But the way to the space of Poland began many years ago.
Another time before the Second World War, the Polish enthusiastes were in space, but they did not always understand it.
I remember, for example, of the A. Sternfeld lessons represented in the Varshaw Astronomy Observatory of the ideas from his new "Introduction in Space".
The ideas of the young engineer (1905) were left by the audition of equally, and after a few years, Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Yan Gadmski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Sternfeld wins the prize Robert Esno-Peltry and André Louis Hirsch for the "Introduction in Space".
Dr. Yan Gadmoux (1899 - 1966), speaking above, later became the large propaganist of astronomy and space.
He published hundreds of articles in the Polish magazines and wrote a number of books dedicated to these scientific disciplines.
The Guadama became a known world propagandist of space and its contribution was assessed, including that one of the rotors on the back of the Moon was appointed in his honor.
In 1925, it has been built in Poland with a swimming swimming swimming driver.
Unfortunately, the author of the idea remained unknown, as well as the details of the project.
Not clearly, the missile should not even be used for the distortion or for the torment of the telephone.
Information on this path is only known from the press of that era.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery began to think about missile shoots.
A study was conducted by the Arms Technology Section in cooperation with Professionals Mechidolaw Wolfk and Gustavo Moliksk.
Reserved materials show that the studies have been reached at the stage of practical tests.
However, with the arrival of German forces, they were interrupted.
In 1937, the idea of a photo-electric shooting switch proposed by the engineer Rogozin, and the next year, "Aviation Rake and Aviation Rakes" author Leveli Kidblocks.
Both projects were developed for military use of missile engines.
Before the war, the Interim Scientific and Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Committee, Doradczo-Naukowy), coordinated the whole work.
The Committee was established in 1937, but two years after its work was completed since the beginning of the war.
The following scientific work, dedicated to the space, appeared in the Poland press after the war, through the work of the Polish Astronaut Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first part of the society is mentioned in the November, November 1954 magazine, which published four quantities of astronomic articles.
One of them suggested that the society will be organized by space.
At that time, projects of artistic satellites have already been traced, and it was clear that space studies were a prospective area.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronaut Society (POA) has tried to enter the international astronomic Federation (based in 1951), and the POA has been its effective member.
And in the next year, the first President of Kazakhstan Zarankevid (1902 - 1959) became Vice-President of the International astronomic Federation.
He left his death in 1959.
Since 1956, POA has contributed significantly to the development of a very successful meteorological rat of RM (Rakieta Meteorologicalczna), which has become the first Poland Raket, which has performed scientific research.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first start was 10 October 1958.
The racket, which was able to overcome the distance of 1800 meters, was about 80 cm, and its weight was less than 5 kg.
The improved version of RM-1A was then built, and in 1959, the 12-year-old RM-2 missile was tested.
The missile was around 1,4 m and its weight was about 11,5 kg.
The next version of the missile was already able to work with the RM-34 rat could exceed 14.5 km, and its task was to monitor high winds.
But in 1962 the further development was suspended.
The primitive RM type was the Meteor-1 missile developed between 1962 and 1965.
The raket was considered as a twenty-five, its total length of 510 cm and the initial weight of 32.5 km.
Three types (named Meteor-1A, -1V and -1C), which were different from the size of the camera for scientific equipment.
The raket meteor-1A was 0.4 l, Meteor-1V - 0.34 l and Meteor-1C - 0.62 l.
The maximum length of the floor in all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1965, the Aviation Institute has developed the development of the Meteor-2 missiles, and its first annual tests began in October 1970.
The raket Meteor-2, with an emergency weight of 380 kg, was able to carry out the useful weight of 10 km up to 60 km.
The versions of Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 were then built.
It should also be mentioned that Poland's entry into the CCPA (Spacial Research Committee) in 1960 and that the establishment of the National Committee of the CCSPAR is two years later.
Furthermore, in the Interspace Programme, Poland participated in the research of the space for the Soviet Artist Satellites, and in 1978, the Poland pilot Miroslav Hermashevsky became the second intercommon after the Wormira Remecca.
The cancellation of public works law is not a problem.
Last week, the Constitutional Court denied law on public work.
The establishment was a substantial debate in the society.
Indeed, it will be interested in considering this problem with a broader view.
Liberal and orientated economic systems in the EU, as well as globalized world, are based on the principle of multilateral, non-regulated economic competition.
In fact, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in a constant conflict.
This is related to the principle of free trade and free, no restricted private capital movement along with unreasoned financial expertise.
As a result of a significant difference in the value of workforce (employed payment) is priced pressure.
In this sense, it must be understood when the manufacturer is trying to exert the economic competitiveness of the competitive value to take itself a large part of the market and thus increase its own income.
This means for most enterprises, the transfer of routines, the low purchase for routine or the disappearance, resulting in increased unemployment in countries where the value of working force is compared to other and higher.
As the private capital does not have any social responsibility, including for the unemployment of them, it will increase the inevitable costs of States to social needs.
In general, the situation increases the desire of the employees to pay taxes and thus compensate the public economic and social damage that they have income.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to bring specific statistical data.
The private capital methods are set up at the economic level of individual states when the Governments have to enter competitively to reduce the social level of their population in order to adhere to the foreign capital country.
In other words, Governments give up their own population to private capital, despite social accidents.
This reflects mostly in the amendments of this legislation.
The goal is to establish its people to undertake the Dictamental of Private Capital, especially in the field of payment.
This acts as an economic responsibilities system in the case of long-term unemployed persons, and at the same time is the tool to eliminate the rights of workers in the field of labour law.
As a result, poverty is increased and the difference between the poor and the rich.
A number of years ago, there is a public disappearing of poor products that could not be able to make up their own work.
The number of people are already near to millions.
In the context of enhancing the competitiveness of the German economy, cases are constantly occurd when employees receive such payment that the State should pay for a minimum of sustainability.
Such scandal became known to the public and in the case of additional workers of Bundestaga.
Economic measures in all the Southern States of the EU, indefinitely, have the same condition in which people under pressure of the catastrophic social status have been required to emigrate, as in the 19th century, or to exist in a low payment for society in hope that a private investment capital will ever come in the country.
But it's wondering where he is taking?
If the capital comes from other EU countries, the poverty will be moved from one country to another, or it will not be, as Chinese, India, Brazilians, Turo, Maroccans, Egyptians, Africans are still working for the part of European payment.
That's about the whole Latin America.
The Liberal Information Theory and Measurement Declares that the State cannot participate in the capital of its own property that the management of the economy leads to economic disaster.
The private capital urges that the State should not be undertaken in the economy.
Should it go further to the question whether the private capital is not operating, now practically managing policies and the same State, in its own egoistic purposes?
The same answer is yes.
Proof is the existence of almost powerful and wide lobbys in all States.
As a result, we have an unexpected situation in corruption to ensure mutual benefits in the legislation where almost all punishment is a crime, but it is not a crime.
The GFF is the situation that the Government's Ministrys, because of the lack of financial resources, are attributing the development of the laws of private legal undertakings, which are substantially related to industry.
Afterwards, the draft legislation applies to Bundestag.
The entire authority is not from the people, as the Constitution of Western Type is called, but from the financial and potential groups who prefer their own interests.
Obviously, Liberal-Oriented Democracy is now soon in the situation, as the appeal describes in the "Crise of the Roman Empire in the days of César and Pompei," "the Government has been defeated for a long time and the states are engaged in violence.
Welcome, unlawful gain of mercy with stones and swords.
The rescue and corruption continued without any bans, and the people went to election with the previous voice "... ordered people had not yet been shocked to the government post, at the end of the end of the eight months a State remained without console. " Everything people began to say that the only salvation in this terrible situation was self-deserved and the need for the choice of an energetic man " .. Appearcan believes that this would be Pompei, but they were the Cezarea who finally changed the democracy in self-defence.
Like in ancient times, the modern society preserves its own unfair interests without taking into account public interests.
The private capital is no longer intended for public purposes.
The present result is not different from the past: an unexpected accident of elite without any effort to reform more deeply.
This is the cause of fasist and communist regimes that we have to search for an unfair liberalization of the economic systems of 19 and 20 centuries.
Today, the absence of these regimes and the existence of liberal democracy can be taken as a certain pass, after which the next tour is expected.
Previously, the present Elite fully ignores the consequences of hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, humanitarian and social disasters that we have already observed, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.
The Clearance of the Public Works Act is not a decision or at least forever.
Under the pressure of competitiveness at the international and national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will continue to search for the way to further reduce the social population.
This trend is therefore a systemic nature.
Decisions are objective political and social reforms that will enhance the economic participation of States, enhance the role of citizens in the management of the State and reduce the monopolitical situation of private capital in society for State.
Israel: Chaos Lab.
"The violence's nothing going out, and we can't ever leave" - Stuning, the "Cruchy" song, where the main script is the words: "We don't forget what we're crazy."
"If my sons don't want to war, they wouldn't have" - the dead Guttler Shanper, wife of María Amshela Rothshild.
The last tragedy of violence between Israel and Gaza has always been called by many respondents.
Some speak for Israel, arguing his position as he has the right to self-defence and the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing that racism by the Israeli State, the genocide made over Palestinian Arabs, and the Israeli State is assigned to the role of a terrorist State.
I don't want to think about whom in these periodically repeated murders is a criminal, but whose victim, at the end of the time, was born at the moment of the political situation, and were not witnesses of violence.
My goal is to propose readers to look at whom, first of all, have been able to serve 95 years of tension (reading the signing of the Balfu Declaration in November 1917) in a small part of the Middle East.
Some of my opinions have been supported by historic facts, some of them are based on my own understanding of whom or whose group of people is the main engine of events in modern history.
Humanity history is mostly the history of war against power.
In each era, we can find the same Alexandre of the Great or Napoleon.
What isn't so clear - whether these people have always taken their steps, or were a person who has sent them to the most important goals.
It should be permitted that we live in the period when the world's riches are concentrated in the hands of several people, and that this concentration of money and prominent authority could not occur for a generation's life.
Among the astronomically rich families, one who could be considered as the head of the slope (I don't know whether someone is over them, but it is not excluded) is Rothild.
It's not a lot about them.
Sure.
The First News Agency (Rathers) has already purchased in the 19s ’ 19s to stop listening to their name with criminal action in the darkness of which they had been, and who have always enhanced their authority, the increase of riches or the same time, and the other.
They have large share packages in almost all the central banks of the world and against countries whose central banks are not equipped with their share, they lead or prepare war (only seven countries were in Afganistan, after the invasion of Caddefy, the Russian government had remained only four, but at the same time, the Central Bank has taken its country in their hands).
Everyone who tried to oppose this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to maintain the status of the Central Bank for the Rothildow Bank of America, and during civil war he began to launch his own money (including government) and was killed in the theatre in 1865.
John F. Kennedy began to expend his own money and wanted to abolish the FED (Federal Reserve System) was killed in 1963.
Their desires of the world authority in the period 1859 to 1871 introduced the development of the three world wars created by the Great Mason of 33th-year-level Albert Pyak.
The first war was the destruction of monarchy States in Europe, the second was to destroy the colonial rule, particularly the United Kingdom, and the third should lead to the reduction of the world population by about 0.5-1 billion. (The number of slaves will be enough to ensure their comfort and growth, and they will not need many resources), the creation of a unique universal religion (exomenism can not be any other than the preference for such project) and the complete protection of complete power.
The method that works with the group of the most rich families in the head of Rothshilds is the calls of the crisis and the follow-up of decisions (order ab chao order from chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see the foundation of the EDF to prevent the recurrence of the crisis in 1907).
Thus, after they were able to defeat the First World War through the murder of the Astro-Venger throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the king Russia, starting a majorist revolution.
The first world war has been concluded as an immediate, unreasonable in military and economic capital against Germany (no longer was necessary for the destruction of the Kingdom Russia) and, as a result, the development of the Central and European State, Austria and Hungary.
In order to facilitate the development of the Second World War, bankers and policies have established a hidden conflict situation in Germany a great military reparation that had made a preference for the radicalization of the food mass, then only to strike the Germans a sufficiently strong, guilty and proposed simple decisions, and also to establish a multinational Czech Republic with a strong German minority that had to play, and to truly strike the five colonies with the war disappearing.
At the end of the 19th century, Rotshilda has promoted the foundation of the sionist movement, one of which had tried to create a Jewish State, desiredly in the historical area of Judea with Jerusalem as his capital (returning to Zion).
The above Declaration of Balfu created a proposal for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, which began to be the first assembled with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks were both out of the side.
The Second World War, which was difficult to evaluate whether Hitler was out of the chairs where he was markedly maintained by bankers, or everything he did, was planned, in any case the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps had made proposals for recognition of the Jewish world community.
Israel was officially based in 1948 and, as Germany had been promulgated by military reparations at the 2nd World War, Israel ' s State was proclaimed to establish a third war.
If the international bankers have been able to interconnect it, the Jewish people, as in the second world war, will be victims of warfare on the front line, now together with the Arab or simply the Islamic population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a guiant lab, a source of divorce and chaos, not only within the country but also at the international level (only a slight separation of people on parties and opposers of Israel).
Who's guilty, and who is the victim of the Palestinian-Israel conflict, where both dinners in the unconciliated cemetery of violence, if everything began with the desire of individuals and their efforts toward the world's authority?
There is a need to distinguish the common people of Israel from their leaders, since, as we have, international bankers will join people to vote on the elections of only their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, Nyanjahu, Nyanjahu, is a typical example of a politically fasist, loyal international banker who works everything to start a war with Iran, which, through the membership of Iran in the Shanchai Organization of Cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...) will threaten to translating into a world conflict, and taking into account the control of Iran on the Ormosan Oil, containing 20 per cent of all world oil (the court Corea is only 2 mile) and will also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In the light now, the words said by David Rockfeller in 1994: "We all need to be a general crisis, and people will take a new world order."
The new world order in their presentation is the peace of masters and slaves.
The world where the remaining part of human population is a huge financial aristocracy that enjoys a comfort.
The world where each parent body is inplanting chip, with which it becomes substantially controlled.
"And puts all the small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves to the right hand or to the leg of clamp, so that the man who is not marked by the name of the beast or the number of his name could not purchase or sell.
This is what the wisdom is: Everyone who has mind may calculate the number of beasts.
Because it corresponds to the name of the human, and the number is 606.
Argo Operation: When there's something worse, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, the Islamic Demonstrators trooped the U.S. Ambassadors in Teheran and took 52 diplomates.
They should be released in the exchange of the shock of Mohammed Res Res Resus Pehelai, who fled after the revolution in the United States, who were the guerrant of his regime for decades.
For the United States Administration, the situation was not expected - it could not allow himself to evacuate ships, because it could cause the confidence in other countries.
However, the release of delegates in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of the theocratic regime, was not able.
It was a shock on the press of the United States, which later has been strengthened by an unsuccessful attempt to release the forces.
Closed diplomates were finally released after 444 days after negotiations with the Algerian Government.
Their judges called the house of solidarity and anti-Iran.
The event in Iran was significantly encouraged by Jimmy Carter's infringement on the presidential elections of the 1980 ' s elections finished by Ronald Reagan.
The film, referred to by Ben Affel Operation, describes one of the episodes of the history of America's small winners.

Combination of genders
The plan developed by a expert on Evacuation, Tony Mendez required cooperation in Hollywood.
In order to be reliable, the film project was written in the specialized magazines, and the press conference was affected, and the production company had a real office.
The details of the operations were held in secret, films, based on the memories of Tony Mendes.
The African film is a special combination of several geners.
On the one hand, a real political trillar called "film-kinopos", the history of a lucky destiny, the face may be a number of films about the friends of Owshan.
The movie is constantly changed - from one part, documentally designed scenes from Teheran (in tits the historical pictures of events are shown and the same situation has not been shown in the film - great differences).
On the other hand, it is facilitated by voluntary retreats flowing with irony and dead overcome.
And then, scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in the costs are discussing the situation in the negotiations tables, on the stations, on the phone...

"Argo" Operation is a third complete film, after the dark detection "Shees, kids, forgiveness" (2007) and "Good" trills (2010).
At the same time, this is the first film of Africa, which does not take place in the town of the resident of Boston.
Place atmosphere is the quality of which has increased the early film of a Hollywood standard.
And Aphlex shows this in Argo, where Teheran plays Canada.
The best film scenes are on the streets, when reconstruction of real events - the entry scenes of the U.S. are impressed by their clearness, which also transmits the emotions of travel and inevitableness that happen when the history is soon changed.
The likely effects of Aphlex and its colleagues are reached in the scenes of the production (specific headquarters on the Teheran Base).
There are too many processes in too many places.
The register had to have a case with the fact that the notification is not a majority of the cinematographic value scenes.
He works very successfully with that little, sometimes thinking something -- it is not so elegant (the scene in which the phone call in America prevents the driving crisis in the Teheran Airport, and the flight on the aircraft field seems quite sweet).
Argo is an inadequate rationality related to the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Gudman are really very grateful in the role of the Hollywood colleagues, but their personals would be more space, and they are not the only ones in the film.
Aphlek's film is not a little dramatic, that is a film that can be seen with the dead interest by assessing the decree and the retro-style of seventy trills.
But it's lacking work.
However, this is enough to remind one, still known in the sense of living history, as well as the proof of the presentation of all powerful and well-known specialists.
Rules for aircraft, bananas and circles
www.bankovnipoplatky.com, a annual banking survey on the most absurd banking collections, now decided to declare the competitor on "the same absorption or project from the master EU".
"We have met the last event in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 per cent cube for women in the administration of large European companies," said the questionnaire Patrick Nager.
The recent decision of the European Court on the linking of the insurance rates for men and women is among the abuse appointment.
Women still had money for life insurance, because they are less arbitrary for insurance companies.
"Another incredible ideas from the master EU can move to competition until the end of this year.
The vote will take place until the end of February 2013," said Nagel.
The EU is, for example, with a binding addendum of biopopulators that results in harmony of nature and prohibition for the use of reliable torts only because they contain relatively small number of dangerous substances, or the size directive for smoke cells, which resulted in significant travelling of eggs in this year.
The actual ban on the use of the term "bottle oil" or out of the sale of classic lamp lamps is also critical.
Quality bananas must be 14 centimeters long.
The general European device often decides on the pressure of a trade or industrial lobble which is generally protected by a State or group of States (for example, Czechia, even now, remains under the threat of the winds of its banks).
Lobby interests are such: For example, the bananas of the high quality in Europe had to reach the length of 14 cm and not the pleasant to demonstrate “anomical Crisis”.
The European Commission had thus justified that only harmonization of existing discrepancies national rules that have complicated trade.
The EU, despite the resistance of some States, raised standards on fruit and vegetables, referring to the fact that existing directives lead to the planting of products.
The applicant may also become the last year ' s decision of the EU, in accordance with which the sales of aircraft should be warned that the children of eight years older may not be able to overcome them without the use of adults.
The EC requested American research, in accordance with which aircrafts at game were potentially caused to death of children through the smile.
Such limitation is now distributed to children up to 14 years of age, which are prohibited to enter into junctions.
Nice ideas are born and home
It is sufficiently absurd, and a rules relating to the most European officials: everyone who has any official position in the EU cannot, in view of the fact that the theme is to use the name of Macedonia, and should be called "BURM " (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
Portal Bankovnipoplatky.com, in cooperation with the association of liberal economies "Neithership" (Laiça Faire), proposed to vote, in addition to a number of above-mentioned absorptions regulations, for example, the EU Rule on the amount of food stocks in the territory of the Member State.
The EU has set up the maximum amount of food stocks that could be located on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its entry into Europe.
In addition, Czechus exceeded, for example, the quantities set for conservated slaughter, for which it threatened a large shock.
The questionnaire organizations also interested and ideas to pay to some countries because they had no sea, and the idea of granting subsidies to a declaration of granting subsidies.
But these ideas occurred in Prague, not in Brussels.
"We are in an unexpected situation because we don't have a sea.
We ask the European Union for Compensation,” said October 2004, the Minister of Agricultural Affairs of Yaroslav Pallas (CPC).
He pointed out that the country had a high grain of seed, and the State had full stocks that had to be delivered.
Because Czechia is far away from ports, the EU, according to Palestinian, must have been paid to us hundreds of millions of euros.
The European Commission was on the meeting of the Czech Republic, organizing the tender to purchase a cerebrous from countries that have not been out of the sea.
Subsidies to receive subsidiaries suggested to the villages of the Ministry of Regional Development, the Director of Minister Paul Germany (US-DEU), in particular, that subsidies should be made for a statement from Brussels.
EC: Incredible allocations are exceptional
Although decisions in Member States are easily critical, the EU efforts to regulate, as well as the more effective functionalization and development of Europe, in view of many experts, will be better recognized.
A serious problem, in view of experts, is the interpretation of the EU ' s contributions to projects that have not even noted a general number of European integration, but which Member States have been achieved at the budget debate.
Emotions among the Cheques and that, as well as in other countries of Europe, the Czech Republic should fight in Brussels for the right to a specific identification of its traditional products, which does not always win in this convergence.
Although Chachs after six years of struggles with Germans and Austrians have maintained the name "Olomous shoes", but "Turkey Rom", traditionally in our country in the 19th century, our manufacturers had to be renamed to the Tulandic.
The name of the Roman can only be products from a twin distillate, not from a soft snack.
In the official list of EU registered products, along with the worldwide known "feta" and "Gorgonzole", the German Caribbean or the Parmish winter, there have already been, for example, carlobar sugars, powdery and three-bodies and sweet smells.
The EU’s good signs can also be proud of the slipper and the gorgeous shoes.
People want me to protect the Republic, but I'm loved, I say Ocamura.
Mr. Senator, how is the man going to be balled by the president?
I don't think to be a senator or a President.
If we had all worked in the country, I wouldn't be balled anywhere.
But I can't see how in the past 20 years the country is developed, how there are volunteers, people increase taxes and pension age.
I didn't have an ambitions to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I'm trying to find a decision how to change it.
And since I have been able to do forty years and I am an independent person without any party, I don't have any other opportunity to affect things except to ball the senator or the President.
You went to Senate, but soon they went to the presidential store.
Do you not so smile to those whom you have chosen?
I always said I am involved in the fight against the Presidential Charter, depending on the results of the elections in Senate.
Then I said that if I was chosen by Senator, I'll be balled in the Presidents.
My goal is not position, it's a tool that I can implement my views.
Therefore, I need the most influential and widely powerfulness.
But the difficulty is not only that we're as a nation in our bar or television, but we're ready to shoot every one who trys to change something.
It is added to people ' s media and who are free of words with lie.
For instance, I have said that I'm giving my journalists to, or that I was the advisor of Irgie Parobeek.
Let's go to your views.
You have started fighting for the presidential charter with the thesis of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and on the retailable property declarations for more than twenty million.
In order to implement this, the law must be amended.
You have no authority as the President, and only the senate can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this task?
When I was a citizen who made an excursion a free business, it could be extended.
The problem is in policy -- when a person comes with a good proposal to the left or the right thing, it is a matter of prevention, and it holds citizens.
As an independent person, I have much greater capacity to receive support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I have no party planning, without dogma reviews, I can take every party the best for our country and apply it.
Do you think you are a person more related to the right or the left?
I think from the Czech point of view, I think it's better about my people to the left.
It's not important for me - a little left or a little right.
For me, it's important that we go forward.
This isn't what someone's going to do with the right, but someone to the left, I want to join people.
I will always support any good thing to the society to decide whether it will propose the CCD or the CCD, and I will also be against a bad idea.
You're angry when someone tells you're smelling.
But do you not prove that what you said?
When you create business plans for the company, you also have some perfect goals and views.
And you're trying to get closer.
It can be called population, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already working in the world, or you're talking about the visible experts.
But without the support of the Parliament, you'll only have a lounge.
And that's what you're going to do for a long time in the policy.
Or do you think that when you go to people and talk to them, you will be able to implement criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have any other possibility.
Only avoiding politicians, journalists and publicity, and trying to move them towards us.
If I had been elected by the President, it would not be a problem to organize a direct television transmission in which I wish to the Chairman of the parliamentary Party to legalize material and criminal responsibility for politicians, State servants, judges and prosecutors.
And, in the case of refusal, they should be informed of why they do not want it.
If it is a strong person who feels abused, a political scene is possible.
Take the direct elections of the President was the duty of the public's pressure.
I'm just saying I'm loved, not genius and not intellectual.
I'm trying to find unions to resolve my confidence and views.
I'm just the starting policy, and I'm trying to get support for my program for most.
I'm trying to move myself; if that is not possible, I'll end six years later and return to the private sector.
This seems like Ocamura should save Checa.
I'm no salvator.
I know I'm not gonna do anything, so I've got a few known people with a proposal to ball the Senate.
I went to Raim Yancher, and he refused to deal with the great amount of work.
Also, at least, I supported the leading journalist Yan Lawrencew, who has discovered a fracture with light fuel oil products.
I've shown my candidate because people are really unpleasant, but now I feel at weight.
Sixty per cent of people did not go to the election, but most of those who were elected by the literature.
Our independents in Senate are only two.
People chose Senate so that changes will be made with the work.
Despite this, I will fight for my views, for example, for the direct elections of the masters and the Governors.
Do you think about the basis of your own party?
I didn't think about this, because I don't have time to check the purity of the past, and I don't have this money.
No money and the presidential campaign, just twenty thousand chrones on my transparent account.
You don't have money?
You speak of the property declarations, and how will your own business be able to do this?
Personal property is estimated in about 60 million.
I have some 25 million in Prague, a apartment for 10 million, another apartment for 8 million, a collection of arts for about 10 million, Aston Marine for 3,5 million, and Scoda Superb for million, Nu, and more than a few million.
Sometimes Aston-Martin came to me because it was my boyfriend dream - I always liked Jaymes Bond, who moved on the car, was galant with women and at the same time fighted against submission and illicitness.
You're traveling to Aston-Martin, you have 60 million possessions, and you don't have money for a campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but your money are specially not income.
It's not very convinced.
I don't have 15 million campaigns.
Should I get in the debt?
I've already put 2,5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have a sponsor is that my program is not interesting.
And I don't have to pay for a pre-selected campaign from my carman.
Meaning expenditures will actually cover the senator payment.
But I wouldn't have lived for these money, for example, couldn't pay my son for an English school, which is 30,000 monthly.
If I just wanted to pay money, there wouldn't be any ball.
So you will continue to work in business so that you can live?
Didn't you tell you that you reduce this activity?
But this does not depend on the size of payment.
As I promised, I have decreased my activities in part.
For example, the director of the Tourist Agency will become my Vice-President.
People would like to want me to be an unreserved man who will save the Republic.
But I also need to live in something.
How much, as a entrepreneur, you're attracted to receive a month?
From twenty to four hundred thousand, I'm getting further.
And if I'd be a president, my business would end up.
You will find the full interview in the Saturday Sunday.
MVRDV architects prove that this appendix is not only in the images of Spain and its recently built Book Mountain - 2 photos
"My building seems awesome, it looks faculty, and finally we can see something interesting again," says Lizate Veryeg, walking on the road.
And Stefan Spermon, ICT specialist at the nearest firm, says, "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I ask myself, why do we have another library today?
All have Internet, iPad and electronic books.
There's nobody who's voluntary to such old libraries now, right?
Speekenniss, a few remarkable bedrooms under Rotterdam, belongs to an uncommon recursion.
His population of 80,000 people is the lower level of education in the Netherlands.
A few years ago, for the fighting of this prestigious situation, it was decided to contribute to the general education and to build seven industrial bridges that were designed on euro banknotes, as a result of a decreased miniature from ironethane.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the fathers of the city found that they had the only opportunity to get the statistics: to build the library here!
Maas from the MVRDV Architecture Office of Towerterdam, the master of cold table diagrams and authors, sometimes even cynical buildings, has taken the task of its ordinary non-energy, and had a competitive hearing in 2003 with five books under the mouse and shocked persons.
And soon as the jury members were carefully reviewed and shocked by the shoes, the snake Maas put out of its original pyramid gift from its size and ended the talk in protecting their project as follows: "Highing horrors!"
It's my proposal: "Break Mountain" in Spain, so called Buckenberg!
By nine years, this mountain has grown 30 million euros.
It is part of the auditing project, which includes sub-term, supermarket, e-mail and several facilitating housing houses and tankhouses in the total complexity of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November the World Mountain was noted the second competitive prize of the Netherlands Library in 2012.
The project also participates in the National Holland Competition in 2012.
Thus, the unprecedented reward that was not previously proposed, except the postmodernist peak zone and a surprising white facility, which makes the thought of milk-based milk, became richer for one modern architecture.
But the main thing in Spain was the first in the history of this city's public building of cultural appointment.
A long way towards the book
First impression: Eldorado's book under a snake.
There is only one lift in the centre of the mountain mass, since the true architecture and readers prefer to investigate this place in the pest.
In all parts of the location, lightly and easyly shocked, swimming pools and elliptical swimming snakes are wrongly made a feeling of a public city area.
The urban environment is perfectly restored.
They're looking for shoes, dogs and kids in the football.
And all are books, books, books.
"The book flights stand around the fassads, and the middle is a large dark room, as a rule of unclean and unclean," says Viney Maas.
We have set a classical configuration of space with feet on the head and put the zone to read out of the outside.
The internal area of the book mountain has been used: offices, websites, chat clubs, environmental centres and technical locations in the center.
They are particularly pleased by the black books that serve those of the wall office, the paraptics, the legs.
They're innocent, texture and smell.
Even tried architects and engineers are lost in records that it is for unknown material.
"We have tried to work with secondary materials," explains Jop Traubourst, the leader of the Switzerland community, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
And once at a agricultural company in France, we met a suitable farm product.
For many years in the warmth and fields in the Netherlands, the artificial millimetre of mollusk material is used under the root.
It's sweet and economic.
The tone textile serves for a two-year season, then you can select it.
For library, this was totally, first in such quantities, a total of four sanitators in the panel.
The so-called landscape (KLP) is converted to a dark, unique, simple material, a little remindering new car and a little bit of sweet.
At the top of 105 steps.
A person who goes over the road of about 500 meters will be rewarded in literature coffee not only by fantastic species in the city but also by the Hollandese steps and by grains in the hills.
They are concerned about the atmosphere, and first of all, the right power of the air on the literature mountain.
The costs for the new soul
"It's hard to believe, but it's the building, despite the multitude of steel surfaces, represents a typical project for environmental plans", says Trouborst.
The warming of the earth is used for heat and heating.
Although the Book Mountain is under a strike strike, even in the lights of the sun, it is only a short time.
The small farms from the grain trees situated perpendicularly in the steel fascination give shadows and take themselves a large part of the sun.
The climate is very welcome.
The remaining protection provides fully automatic roll shoes.
Stefan Spermon, mentioned above by the IT skeptic, has already visited a new library.
The Reesete Verchag was already here.
Also, a predictor of the traditional Chinese medical of Sintia Godd, who called Buckenberg's Deep Spain, who hasn't been missing for a long time.
Subject: For a few weeks before the opening of each resident, the invitation was received to offer a book from his own congregation.
These books should have made empty places on the fields not yet completely integrated library - at that time there were 70,000 books.
That's the idea.
The pools are put up.
"It's nothing worse than half a library," the architect Viney Mass says.
"I think that by our invitation now, every resident in some way is associated with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if she serves only for stealing.
Thus, MVRDV was able to resolve the king's task, which is called the establishment of identity.
Species wrote his literature history.
And let them be very young and unformed.
It's just the first point to build identity.
Sabour: "The Nine must play a more important role."
Germany was suspended by the vote on the recognition of the Palestinian.
According to Stefan Sabo, an expert on the relationship between the United States and Europe, Berlin is slightly balanced by a diplomatic road.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany understood that it voted against the complaints of Palestinians to obtain the status of observer to the United Nations.
But then, Berlijn stopped with the vote.
Why?
Stefan Sabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.
Germany now needs to be careful about her special relations with Israel.
But at the same time I believe it does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - therefore it was not too critical to Israel.
During the resurrection in Libya in March 2011, Germany also continued to vote on the introduction of a banned field zone.
The NATO concluded that proposal.
Germany is difficult to make a clear position on complex international affairs?
Yeah, that's it.
The fact is that it is in the process of transforming its external policy, which is transferred from a policy which, so the United States has managed to a German external policy own.
A further situation is that Europeans have no agreed single policy.
Consequently, the Germans are retreated between two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not attracted.
I think that until they are just playing their role, but they are on the way towards a better normal foreign policy.
External policy, which is carried out by France or Britain.
What specifically means the "normal" external policy with the German view?
This is the willingness to take place in their national interests, not depending on the position of the United States or the European partners.
I believe that the German external policy depends on economic policies, namely on export and connections with certain regions such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The economic interests of Germany are significantly different from the interests of other major States, and Germany should therefore protect their interests.
Have these economic interests affected the position in the Middle East and the vote in the United Nations?
First, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, in particular in the Persian Valley States.
It is therefore necessary to be careful to prevent publicity and elites in the Arab countries.
In any case, this plays its role.
But I wouldn't give it too much, it's not a completely unilateral connection.
But in any case, this plays an important role in the calculation of the Germans.
Has Germany affected its relationship with the United States by maintaining important decisions, such as the vote on Palestinian?
I am sure in Europe and even in the United States are understood by the sense of the German position.
That's why I don't think that it was the same dramatic strike as in the liquid matter.
Germany may even have a certain respect.
This signals that it should be taken as a player for the international aren and that it should be considered with its interests.
There are various views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
On the contrary, the United States were clearly shooted for the wind.
Is it possible to divide opinions between the United States and many European States?
Such differences were always existing in the light of the American internal policy.
I believe that the Government of Obama is in the deep sense of the European position.
However, with regard to the local political situation, the Government cannot, of course, be open to such a position.
I believe that significant disappearances in the views are not so significant as always appeared.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Neanjahu, then note that Obama is not totally income from the policy of Neanjahu.
Should Germany combine their close relationship with Israel and the United States from one part and the situation of the most important partner in the EU with another?
I think this makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, the Germans would have a few more simpler if there would be a single non-profit European policy, but now it is not true.
Therefore, they cannot speak within a broader approach and have been obliged to act instead of doing it, just in the vision of the situation.
That's how they do with the euro.
I believe that in the future, Germany is a leading role in developing a common European position.
It is understood that Germany is not easy, even if it was because of Israel's relationship.
This theme was always a smooth.
But I think the Germans clearly have to play an independent role.
If Germany itself is the role of an international player, does it really take the main role?
Or is the leading role still in Germany hard?
Germany has not yet engaged in this, and it is still unfortunate and, for obvious reasons, it is still hard to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis - every time Germany has an important role, the most different anti-German sentiments are shown.
The Germans aren't just doing this.
Indeed, this is an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by enemy countries.
From this point, Germany is a significantly more serious situation than the United States.
It should take into account the different neighbors and views, and that is not easy.
So the impact of the United States in Europe policy is constantly debole, but now the EU does not fill this vaccine, who then remains?
The Germans should simply play a more significant role.
Even if you do not like that, unfortunately, or enduring infidelity to you, such a life!

"Protection Safety" in China: when Puma and Armania will immediately become Chinese
Armania is a worldly known trademark, Polo Ralph Lauren, also.
But what's Armani Polo?
This is completely officially registered in China, which does not have a common name with the companies whose names it has been educated.
However, it will be safeguarded until the owners of the original names are not proclaimed.
But then it is unexpected if they are able to defeat their rights.
"Foreigners are still more difficult to protect their market marks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer of the company Taylor Wessing, who specializes the rights of trade marks in the Forest.
Every week on my table appears in a new case of such a kind.
The imhibitors are sufficient to add a pair of letters to the right to register their trade signs.
So from Gucci, Lu-Gucci is obtained, instead of Prada, you can register Prada-Kny.
The same way is legally copyed by German companies, such as the manufacturer of sports products Puma.
Pattles opens a folder with the registration of the market signs in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, the Chinese company registered the trade mark of Zegna DF Puma, an artistic name which also used the name of a model house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that Chineses are a champion of the world's copy and violation of the rights of intellectual property is known.
There are numerous universities in large cities that are sold almost exclusively.
However, the case is not the case of Pattolok, but he speaks to his believers against the fact that Chinese enterprises are officially obtained from the state of registration of the good signs of the right to use the name already protected there.
The Chineses call it "minpay bath", the passager brand.
This word is associated with the "bad dokuani".
This is called women who are fighting for rich men.
Chinese authorities do not recognise their own guilt
"This causes a damage to business, that's necessary to fight," says Patloch.
"The tragic brand is shocked, the unique situation is lost, the gang is very painful."
Financial losses and processing costs in the suffering areas are calculated by millions, especially in cases of cost-copyed products.
According to the CLSA market research company, China, with the amount of EUR 15 billion per year, is the third to the size and the fastest increased market of plant objects.
However, it is difficult to remove suspicion records in the trade signs register, and it is costly.
The process may extend to nine years, with uncertain expenditure.
Patloch tells about the cases in which the court rejected the case, since the anti-protectional name became the real market.
If the truth does not bring, he should even pay the payer, as he has damaged his trade mark in China, says Patloch.
Sometimes the Jangles law is ruling here.
There are also famous cases on graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler has played a judicial controverse with the Sany manufacturer, a company that had been acquired by the Bentonosa Sosis Putzmeister.
So the Chineses still have the right to use a emblem like Mercedes star.
The Coupe Volvo Company Geely was originally using a blue-white logotype, recorded by BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
The model producers of Lacoste played in China to the imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, where the famous Steadhol was looking at the other side.
Chinese authorities do not consider themselves guilty.
The registration of the CTMO market marks in Beijing confirms that there was a place of discharge in 2010 because of the lack of staff and equipment.
But in the past year, the "return of an emergency situation in the work process to the standard".
Thus, the number of non-employed cases has reduced 22 per cent.
About 57.000 such cases were closed, over 75 per cent of which has been over the last year.
However, 81.500 claims are still expected to produce in the State.
We should fight this way.
As often in China, digits are impressed.
In the past year, more than 1,4 million complaints on trade marks were made, almost thirdly than 2010.
It means that China has issued a list of new registrations throughout the world ten times.
Similarly, the overall number of commercial signs is only 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1,8 billion of collections were paid.
If simplifying, it means that each registry is average of 1280 euros or 160 euros.
Protection of it is much more than the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For over seven years, the conflict is fighting against the Chinese slaughter.
The Germans could achieve that the illicit production of their specific car details was eliminated.
However, the imitator strengthened China's rights on the trade mark of Freudenberg.
This was the own insurance, since the names in Germany were not protected, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the State of the registration of trade signs of CTMO rejected the claim of the Munichians.
Indeed, in the following two instances, Freudenberg wins, but the opposite side continues to fight until now.
We need to be a moment
The issue is now being considered at the Supreme Court.
Wetseller hopes that the case is good to be completed and that the professionalism of the courts is honorable.
But he also says, "The prosecution is an emergency way and takes much time, money and nerves to us."
The internal expenditure is noted that the company's archives had to consider even acts of centuries of long-term to prove evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg proposed the opposite "the large sixth amount of euro" for a solution.
"It's clear how much we need it," says Wintersler.
The dangers of the Forest are threatened to move in Europe even.
In the case of imhibitors registered there unprotected trade signs.
Yes, one Chinese producer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for skins and skins.
The Concern has long stopped production in these areas, but, despite this, it has been possible to prevent the registration.
"We need to be a shock," says Wentzler.
He also recommends that the German companies be very careful with China.
Insufficiently, the international provisions on goods protection should be confidened to foreigners "all that should be protected and registered in China as well," says Vincell.
Otherwise, this can be covered by a lot of road than the registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg plays in the last act of its trade sign, the other party should pay the licence collections for its own name, explains Vincell.
Otherwise, we're out of the market in the back segment.

The "Obani" is an unfair thing, which each horse has its text, also in a completely strange language: the Zulus, which says 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and in some parts of Swaziland.
Help for self - help
According to the UNHCR evaluation, the United Nations HIV-related programme is around 34 million in the world.
23.5 million lives in South Africa.
In Swaziland, 245.000 AIDS serials are living in Swaziland.
There is more than 40 per cent of HIV populations.
For 180 AIDS series in the island of Estonia, the Voices for Africa has found heads in Germany.
70 of them are visiting a school prepared for further education.
For 15 or 20 euros in month, the headship may be taken.
It guarantees a child's money in school, school form and daily hot dinner in the Go-Center.
Involuntary in the Zulus language means speaker or praise.
This room doesn't tell us fly to the bathroom. They can't be able to sing.
Only 10 years of horse is sing in this foreign meat, and from time to time, it will even bring them back to where they have appeared first: to South Africa.
By the distance of 8733 miles (833 km) from Haidelberg, northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, it is the village of Esitjan, which depends on the voices of the German horror.
Inhibited 40 per cent
There lived about 2000 people, some still in simple grains of grains and grains, among the inhabitants of many children.
More than 300 of them remained without parents who died from HIV virus.
In the miniature, Estimate reflects the entire Swaziland disease: the highest level of HIV identification, the lowest life expected in the world for UNICEF data.
The decrease of the extreme flesh of a man who is evidencely decreasing the risk of infringement of half of the population is almost not adopted.
More than 40 per cent of the populations of Swaziland have immunodeficiency virus, death in the middle of the fourteenth century is not rational.
Hor opened the village in a joint journey to Africa in spring 2005, but before the participants, Imbabwe had seen many children on the streets that were not only parental concern but also all: food, clothing, education.
Without school education, there is no opportunity for humans in the poor country.
First, this was a private commitment to individual parties - for several euros per year to send a child to school and to give him a chance to receive a hot food day.
But in the past year, the horse was based on the "Voices for Africa", which has been almost professionally concerned with AIDS syrpathies in Estonia.
Infections transferred by sex
What are the important diseases transmitted to sex?
Bacterial IDPs relate to cyphilis, chlorides and trippers (Gonore).
A number of viral AIDS are HIV, human pavilion, genetic herpes and hepatitis.
Lobicular pedicules and capsules relate to parazitary IDPs.
What are the main groups?
Syfilis and Gonnary are meeting in the main men who have sex with men.
The Robert Coha Institute is due to the fact that at least four of each five cases of cyphilis registered in Germany is transmitted to men by sexual contact.
In adults who often meet sexual diseases, who are sexually transmised, there are chlamide infections, trichomonias, candydose (glydox), gonorea and human ill-virus.
The dissemination of HIV between gender-sexual adults is relatively low, but about 20 per cent of the new infections of HIV is to the group.
Among young chlamide infections are significantly more than other groups of people.
On European data, three four of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years of age.
Youths often meet the human pavilion of virus.
How is the number of cases of infection changed?
None of the sexually transmitted diseases shall be obliged to register.
The disease by cyphilis, according to the Robert Coha Institute, has doubled more than 1697 cases in 2001 to 3698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections is reduced since 2007.
About 2700 cases in 2011.
This is about a tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate venerical diseases?
Infectional diseases may result in illnesses, complaints of smoothing, cutting, low animal pains, or injury or invasion.
However, they are often not associated with pain and other symptoms and remain unremarked.
How can we protect?
Conservation is able to reduce the risk of infringement but does not provide 100 per cent protection.
Partially rebuilding sexually transmitted diseases can also be distributed through contact infection and close physical contacts.
As a result, experts recommend regular survey, especially when sexual partners change.
During the early diagnosis, the majority of CIPs can be healed and avoided from distant consequences.
The Head, donations, and not in the last time of the honourarys for the chronic exhibition throughout Germany are enabled to gather something.
"We have spent about 2000,000 euros to Ethiopia," says Anna Lennartz, President of the Union.
In the village of Germany, there is a skilled and active woman in Côdova Dlamín.
She also cares for the well-building of the syrotics, such as one of the grandfathers.
Gouss, called the Zulus old women, is a shock of villages.
Some of them took themselves up to 14 syrtoms, give them a shirt over the head, and care for children in the form of each day at the time.
Those who haven't remained family have come to Hanashire, a single woman who receives the payment of the unity, as well as two strikes that are preparing for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, the Voices for Africa has organized a Swiss school, built two smokers, together with the American Health Organization of PSI, have organized a HIV analysis for many villages.
It is hard to imagine, but about the disease that is so obvious in the whole country, they prefer to pray deeply.
King with 14 women
"SSID is a absolute table," says Anna Lennardz, "for he's related to sexuality."
It is necessary for the country where the king has 14 women officially.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mustai III, was known by his love for exilations.
Poligamia instead of democracy.
In particular, in such an authorized State, the lifestyle has also been wine for that HIV virus has been so rapidly distributed in the past years.
However, it is also in brown workers that divide the virus in the country.
The reserves are literally on each edge, says Anna Lennartz, "but they are almost not used.
Another culture is flesh to meat."
In order to support the cultural exchange, the Hour of Ibidmony travels to South Africa every two-third year and spends on the songs, full strikes, warm spirit, confidence and black self-conscience, which many still have known in the south of the black continent since the time of the apartheid.
Autobus, full of white songs in black tongue, is not only a good way and joy, but has even caused lips at the eye of the dark borders.
The journey is always coming to Ethitonia, where snakes visit sub-shore children.
Despite a small village with work can be found on a map, it is more known than it is.
"It's going to Ethia, there's light," the people say.
And after 8733-kilometer flowing back to Yaydelberg, when the swimming snakes return to the reception hall on the Berlin Street, we can see that this light is also sweet here.
Messenger: NASA will open the lady to Mercury
The Messenger's zone found evidence that Mercurius is a lady on the planet.
The leafy can have a thickness up to 20 meters.
The United States Cosmic State, NSA, proved to existing ice on the Marcus planet.
Although it is nearly nearly to the sun, there is also a largest water that appears from the three research published in the Special Science Journal on Thursday.
The Messenger Zone found evidence that the permanent planet's dark region was shocked with iron.
It must be at least 30 centimeters and may even 20 meters.
The water is likely from the comits or may be a steroid covered with Mercurius.
No one lies open ice with the existence of life on the planet, said the scientist leader of the Solomon Zone.
The temperature in Mercuria can reach 426 degrees of Cellsia.
However, these openings could help explain how water and other life building elements have fallen in other places of the Solar system.
Unlikely for the people of the Earth, the telescopes and the small jobs, such as Phenics, are investigating the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to the Earth: small clouds in unconciliation.
Image is from the cameras developed by German researchers from the Max Plank Institute.
The eight planets of our Solar system, as well as the Carly Planet of Cerera.
As Pluton, who is around the sun for Nepal, Cerera, in the new definition of the International Astronomic Union since 2006, is not a "Planet".
This fraction of the infrared telescope "Speaker" is a set of generations of stars: the oldest stars in the form of blue points, which are harder to identify in the star round of racial "new-born" stars.
This region of star formation, not romantically called it W5, opened the "Speaker" TV in Cassiopea, at the distance of 6500 light years.
This shooting shock of the dead star photod the NASA's telescope "Speaker".
It seems to be a ring of the material that the star has cast out in the death process.
There are new stars from the planet and the powder in the guiant tunnel of Trifid, which is removed by 5400 light years from the Earth.
Telescope NASA "Speaker" made this photo of the Galactic Parent Hall.
The Star Collection of Praida, also called "Seven sisters", can be seen in the night with an unarmed eye.
Of course, a color telescope is better.
The red eye supports the humble observer of the U.S. on this infrared picture.
It is located at the distance of 700 light years in the Air Star.
The earth-continent has produced this darkness of the North America.
Combination of the normal and infrared photo provides a expressive warning.
This new star in the whole beauty has been photod only through the infrared telescope "Speaker".
Saturn and his corners: how they occurred, one of the great astronomies of astronomy.
It's likely the saturne moon slaughter, which has disappeared 4,5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and most clear TV images of "Habble": Air galaxy
Depending on the color of the images of the spy galactics, the actual art is transformed.
The picture published by Southern European observer shows that Triffid has been removed to several thousands of light years in the star of the Wall Street.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifius (threkhdolene, tripartite) because the dark pools are separated in three parts of the discovered heart of the star.
In the stars, the astronoms photod the astronomy of the space assembly: at the distance of 400 million light years from the Earth, two switch galactics meet each other and are inevitablely covered.
It's the birth of Habbl's telescope's sliding in the M83 special galaxy.
Those who do not like technical reductions may call it above the South Coast.
The photo of the spatial telescope "Habbl" shows the fragment of Iris' Tumanity in the star of Cephea.
Turmanity, removed by 1400 light years, consists of the powder parts of 10 to 100 times less than in the normal house pool.
This image was composed of the optical and ringgenic pictures of different telescopes.
It shows a number of black darks removed by 430 million light years from the Earth.
This group of galactics called Arp 273 photod for the NASA Space Telescope "Habble".
The largest spiral galaxy of scientists is called UGC 1810.
The most brilliant group of new stars is in this star darkness.
The star jungle always creates new stars.
This is a star area that is connected to the darkness of the Rose, also constantly creates new stars, at the distance of 5000 light years from the Earth.
In this lighting galaxy, with a small black dark, there is no powder, only gas.
Researchers suggest that it had been soon before the Great Explosion when the universe was mainly water-concepted.
Our views in the universe: most important telescopes
The telescope was probably discovered in 1608 by Hans Lippersheem, before Galileo Galilee later began to observe the stars.
Since then, optical television mirror has become more and more available to their space views.
During the 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Haley Telescope in the Palomar Observatory in San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The snake was 5 meters of diameter here.
In Arizona, the United States, sets a great binoculture telescope.
It allows to look in space with two diameters, each diameter 8.4 m.
The "Gran Telescopio Canaryas" has a giant internal device - only a diameter of a mirror is 10.4 m.
The Great South African Telescope Segmented Segmentated, because of a decreasing cost.
However, in diameters it reaches about 11 meters.
The inadequate cost of constructive performance: the telescope is strongly strengthened under the vertical edge, which limits its movement.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope also has a fixed vertical angle.
His particularity: high skill.
It reaches, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, the parameters of the largest world television.
Researchers have been listening to external signals in space by using a telescope in Arizbo (Pourto Rico).
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Participating in the "Search for Foreign Discipline" project (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing its calculative power.
View of the European Astronome Service (ESO) in the Chile Anders.
There's a very big telescope here - a full corresponding name.
His four mirrors are enabled to see in a soft tube even the medium inflactor.
The Chile Observatory also plans for the installation of the European "A great TV".
His main mirror must be covered at the total of 42 meters, and shall be composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, photos should not be expected before 2018.
By 2007, both the "keke" TVs in the Guadai volcany Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They have two diameters per ten meters.
The Keck telescopes include the Mauna-Kea guard, which is close to them by using the Subaro TV and IRTTF.
Furthermore, a new guiant telescope in Mauna-Kea must appear with a diameter of 30 meters.
Here they can love the illustrations.
However, the most important types of space have a spatial telescope "Habbl".
From 24 April 1990 he sets pictures of far-related worlds.
Since March 2009, a space telescope "Cepler" is looking for planets outside the Solar system, especially those who can live.
On 2 February 2011, NASA reported that 1235 planets were discovered from the beginning of the mission.
The last preparation of the "Cepler" space telescope is printed on the picture.
The cosmic telescope James Whebba (JWST) will be sent to the space before 2018 on the board of Arian 5.
The main mirror of the spatial telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the aims of the telescope: he must search for the Great Explosion on the light of the first stars and galaxy.
Scientists suggest that Marcuria is a lady in the south.
However, there is no reliable data about it, as the Messenger turns close to the northern planet.
Radial measurements for decades indicated that Mercurie had a lady.
Thanks to the Messenger Zone in 2004, the first, which turns around Mercury, are now scientists.
Get oil every day - and live up to 168 years
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach the age of e-mail.
There's even a long-term museum here.
Search for mention in the country where the 97-year-old elders are still relatively young.

Search for mention in the country where the 97-year-old elders are still relatively young.
Travel through the Talish mountains can be called a beach and romantic.
The microautobus with the swimming swimming road is shocked by holms, brown ridings and simple cristian houses.
Everything around is so green and glass that you can think like you're in Swartzwald.
But this is the Southern region of Azerbaijan, the Irani border is just a few miles away.
There is a voice of the people of Caucash who knows a little, but only what they say beautifully about the Farsis and the Azerbaijan and is different for a long time.
The final point is Lerick.
The small town is cut into a too heavy soviet architecture, which is not exactly in harmony with the vibrant landscape.
Tourists from Europe are almost not coming here, the road from the Azerbaijan capital Baku is too humble.
At 323 miles (323 km) goes eight hours, since the road has only one floor.
The Legendary Re riches of which the country is able to flee the Caspian ocean here, in the province until it reached.
Pilata Fatulaev (48) believes that Lerique is only interested in tourists.
"In May Baku has been glorified by the celebration of the Eurovising, and in the next year we have the festival of older people of the world," says Fatulaev.
She's the director of a long-term museum, probably the only part of the world.
There are some eight decades of biography that have been documented over 100 years, and the fatulaeva indicates a black-white photo.
It's my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
136 years old, he was born another child.
But a shock star of the museum is the Sherali Muslumes, who has been executed 168 years of age.
The birth witness, however, did not.
In view of the fact that the elderly whose age is under the age of 122 years of age, the age of Muslim is extremely doubtful.
"He was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973," explains Fatulaev.
She was married three times, and he had 23 children, 136 years old, and she was born her daughter.
Does the musulman thus add a couple of decades to his age?
Even Rembrandt Schultz, an age researcher from the Max Plank Institute in Rostok, heard of long-term in Middle Asia.
"In some regions of China, Japan, or in the Hungary Valley in Pakistan, we can also meet a lot of people of persistent age," said Shelz, "in Sardinia also lives very old."
However, because of the lack of documents, the scientific confirmation of age is impossible because there was no civil status recorded.
Each day of fuel oil
However, there is a fact that people in Lerick are often reaching Bible age.
Now, 20 people are older than 100 years of life here.
Why, in the south, so many long-terms here?
The Azerbaijan Exploration Farid Musimzade explains this special genes of the Talk.
The director of the Fatulaev Museum, on the other hand, believes that the food case is.
The meat, bread, and more milk products, many of them drink each day on the fuel oil stainless; however, it may not be a healthy dial with the environmental view.
Or in the first form of life that keeps youths? in Chenghemiran, a small village near Lerick, lives in Rubab Mirzoeva.
In 97 years, she is still relatively young for these widths.
Mirzaev, who claims that the 143th descendants live in a simple village house, typical for the whole Caucasian region.
She's sit on a floor with a shock of oil that can't be cut down here.
There are eight men under one box, including one of the sons and the daughter of the Mirzaev, who have already had their grandchildren.
And the nearby will switch two little ones.
The guests are preparing a tea that comes in the typical pound stations of the army.
With the world's perfectly weight and strong white dentists, it covers the long dark and Russian bones that her son, with honour to us.
I'm always with my hair with milk, so they've never gone and saved the colour.
"And I never used shampoom," says Mirzaev.
Monthly pension is lacking for life
She's always eating just what he had grown in his own room, powders, cardfels, goods.
I never bought the products in the shop for the whole life.
Then she tells her husband who served in the army.
It was the worst after the Second World War.
But it's better when Gadar Aliev's loved father slept in the route.
Propaganda does not often feel like a old woman.
However, the culture built around the face of the father of the nation, which rules of the country as a dictator, does not really know the borders in Azerbaijan.
He was the authority until 2003, and then his son of Ilham took the burden of the government.
However, there is no poverty among the Azerbaijan elderly.
230 maniaks (approximately the same amount of euro) Mirzaev receives monthly as pensions, for local conditions, the amount for which it is possible to live.
And maybe a long-year-old son of Mirzaev also has the right: "The stars in our culture use deep respect".
They live in a great family, loved, surrounded by concerns and happiness.
There is no reason to remain in the lives as possible
The word "human rights" is not in the Constitution
The Revolution returned to Cairo.
The confronting manifestations in Kaire shows that the nation is deeply discovered.
The building Constitution based on the snare was confronted with an awesome resistance.
The Egyptian President did not purchase the cafos.
We have to make a transition.
"And his success is on my responsibility before the people and before the god," he said at the public television.
His words were treated to all the people, but in the first way to Christians, Liberals, Muslims and the nonreligious Egyptians.
Because all of them, still uncertainly discovered in the growing opposition, have experienced fear.
The fear of the religious State to Nile for the mercy of the powerful "Braty-Musilman".
Mohammed Mursey, who had not been sorry, said he had temporaryly cut the competence of the Constitutional Court and enhanced his competence "to save the revolution".
However, the fact that he really wants to save a 61-year-old engineer with a doctor of South America's University is not clearly clear to Egyptians and all the world.
Is the power of the court?
In fact, article 234 has been able to pass in the night of 15 hours with obstacles to the Islamic Constitutional Meeting of 100 participants, which is partly threatening.
As in the previous constitutions, the project states that the judicial production is opposed to the principles of Islamic law.
But what's the princess?
This was and remains the case of interpretation, and it can be afraid that the Islamics will use the distributing form and the legal luxury for more strict interpretation of the scratch.
At least one new article has been introduced: in all cases relating to shariate, Al-Ashar University, the main Islamic institution of the country, which is the larger authority in all the Sunnic Islam.
This should not be, but it may mean that the clergy supervises the law that de facto would have been the result of the limitation of the judicial authority.
Many of the Constitution projects are the object of interpretation
Another problem: civilians should be reserved for the military court.
These courts were servicing for the allocation of oppositioners during the Mubalak authorities.
After a dictator in military prison, up to 11.000 civilians were engaged.
Similarly, in the project, the State must protect “the real society of the Egyptian family” and“success moral and value”.
It was legally so clear that public institutions will be able to control even film content and literature through this article.
The open text does not mean anything else as a tangible.
Indeed, no article does not set directly the equality of men and women.
And the other bans to disfellowship and create the prophet of Mohammed and his Messengers.
But what is the calamity and how it should be punished, it remains unexpected.
It is also the form that is prohibited by the "distortion of people".
Is it sufficient for carriage to the President or shooting about justice?
The question of interpretation, as well as many in this project, which Murcy proposes to sign and which, as he said, "too fast" will be submitted to the Egyptians to a referendum.
"Revolution returned."
A few weeks ago, the opposition of Islamic superiority has been formed.
Decades of thousands have gathered in an unfair unity on Friday night at the Tahrir area in Cairo and promised to destroy the document before he could enter into force.
"The Revolution returned, and we will win," said Hamdin Sabaki, who took the third place at the presidential elections.
The Nobel World Premier and the former leader of the International Atomic Energy State of Mohammed El-Baradey said that a "constitution project" was a place in the history.
Through the service of short news, he accused the Mursy's adherents in the desire to call "the way against democracy".
"If he makes a referendum, we're going to his door and his tent," said the opposer Jaser Said.
"We have not yet been shocked, the blood of our brothers has not yet been deleted," quoted Egyptian media of the opposition policy of Khaled Ali.
Many judges also informed that they did not want to observe a referendum that would have done it indeed.
"Corran is our Constitution."
Good organized Brother Muslims, in turn, called against-voluntary demonstration, but, from warning, not at the Tahrir area, and after the mass prayer at the other Nila Beach before the university of Kalifornia.
It has participated in a large number of women under the clamps and salads who cried: "The nation requires the application of God's law."
They needed: "On the land!" and assured, "The Coran is our Constitution."
For the struggle of authority on a symbolic area where all was started, the state of the practical civil war was pronounced.
Murcy followers, obviously, did not want to go to this risk.
The Muslim Brothers said that both the opposers and the partners of the Constitution's project were very clear and clear.
It has now been time to give the people to decide in the election urine, in which direction the country should go.
The majority of Islamic projects is considered a decisive case.
The concept of human rights does not mention anymore.
Hafiz Abu Saeda was angry of this consolidated constitutional process, which, in fact, was to extend to February with the participation of all public forces.
The 48-year-old lawyer and the Chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (OECD) defended the "Bratiav-musulman", when they were sent in prison or submitted before the court.
It is not because he divided their world resurrection, but because human rights are weekly for him.
He was murdered, sentenced, arrested.
And now the word "Human Rights" has never seen in a new Constitution, and he regrets the World am Sunday.
The enlargement of Murcy's impact on all three wings of authority in the State is devastated by the lawyer.
These measures represent clear attacks on the democratic rules of the game and bring Egyptians to a new dictature.
"Instead of enhancing the civil State, President de facto has cancelled it," Saed regrets.
Without civil organizations, democracy cannot work.
Saeda feels that all of them have left him, even the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle on Nile with the smiling of love and tension.
This may start payment.
The demonstrant on the Tahrir area warns: "You're creating a monster that you can't control."
Norwegian mixture: Is the most crazy fish in the world?
The five-millional population of Norwegia is one of the highest lives in Europe, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Maybe the secret success of this country is a local attraction to one extremely gender fishermen?
Take a few cuts of skin.
Place them in a lot of sweet and swimming clothes.
Leave them there for a week.
You've got a misleading smell of missiles, one of the most famous Norwegian divisions.
I'm in a small town named Fahernes, three hours from Oslo.
It is very beautiful, but the air differs from an insufficient snake.
Rakhsk is a fore which is a salt and brown in water for year, depending on what the soul needs to be achieved.
As soft and cold, the Norwegians gather to the festival in Fahernes, dedicated to the same, will say so to the shocked.
"It eats the skin and snakes a skin, a local thin water,," explains Havard Halvarsen, a local fire fire on professionals and a joint "Rackfisk General" which leads to the festivals.
People around us eat small cups of fish and smell it with a small portion of sphere.
"It's someone more like aquatic than a racics," says Havard.
This drink can be able to smell.
I'm trying a couple of pieces.
If you can spend a piece under the nap, it is not so bad and bad - little than it is different from the portion that you have sent to the bus for a long time.
Rakhsk is a Norwegian product from all other times, while poverty, when heavy fish was covered in genetically closed bottles with salt water.
Then the deep winter, when the fish was already well and basically broken, it was cut off, and, shocking with alcohol, they used food.
The fact that thousands of Norwegians had been obliged to leave their country in the search for work and immigration, primarily in the United States.
Now the population is increasing - more than 13 per cent of immigrants who are involved here, high payment and the development of the social security system.
Sweden’s people (the former counterparty, and not so long and much more useful neighbors) have come to work here.
Rakhsk is accepted as an important symbol, which is unprecedented, and several bad elements of the past Norwegia.
It's one of the most beautiful local shoes.
On the other hand, a small swimming pound or sandwich will be shocked in 9 feet (14 dollars).
Norwegia appears rarly in world news, and most of the people of the country seems to be affected.
People are still desirable to mention the name Anders Bravik, racist and extremist of the right tower, in the past year of shoot and murdered 77 men, women and children.
Not mentioned by his name, the terrorists are called "the event of the 22th July".
Norwegians are very difficult to believe that one of them had been collected to such animals and murder.
Norwegia’s today ' s welfare has been growing (of the beginning of seventy) one of the largest oil sectors in the world.
"One oil is not the only cause of our prosperity," says Anna, our officer, with a variety of contributions to the deserved missile, women with long light hair and very blue eyes, involvement of the Northern well-being.
We are like a nation, as you call it, a reasonable.
Like most Norwegians, she's beautifully English.
We don't like to show up, we're not satisfied.
Norwegia is very strictly linked to its oil, and the large part of the oil income is invested in the special fund established for future generations.
In the years before the world's financial crisis, when all of them were slaughtered by money that they had not had, Norway has severely estimated all costs.
"When winter can be cast on the winter and walk in the summer, that's enough for happiness," says Anna.
And there's a racket, and she adds with an unfortunate smell.
I'm standing in the sneeze for some food - a missile with me.
Here's a hamburger with a loose meat, that's precisely ecologic, sophisticated meat.
But the evening is waiting for more than the same fish with the forgotten smell.
My guests have a special dinner dedicated to a missile, during which the voters define the best or possibly the most aromatic fish.
It's a direct television that shows the leading in the bambooca-bambooke, around a missile ball.
It looks like a song concursion.
"So, Thor-Urgen, what evaluation have you set for the best fish there in the mountains?"
"Yes, Haward, this is our appreciation."
Everyone's laughing and applause.
Somebody falls out of the stairs, maybe he's switching a squad.
Maybe it's just smelling this fish.
The President of Mexico Enrique Pineo Nito is an unfair start of carriage.
While the newly elected President of Mexico Enrique Pineo Neto is ready to take place, the representative of the BBC Wil Grant invites us to consider the difficulties that he has to face and to expect the peoples of his country.
The road movement in Mexico is now in particular in pleasant state.
The city was loaded by transport and at the best time, and from the lunch there were strict refunds that overcome a number of key magistrates to the capital and chaos in the roads.
However, this was not to give people to work from rewards but to prevent the protesting participants towards the parliament building.
On Saturday, the new chapter of Mexico Enrique Piney Néto will take the Presidency and take a brochure of the country's government.
It's a simple task before him.
Mexico has achieved good economic indicators at the Administration of Felipe Calderon, which now has its powers, but the country has polluted in the war with drugs that has been ordered by 60,000 lives for six years.
“My Government claims to the people of Mexico that he is willing to fight violence,” reported previously by Mr. Peña Néto President of the United States Barak Obama in the White House castle.
I'm going to propose a new security strategy that allows us to achieve this goal.
To these statements, Mrs. Pineya Neto, a political carrière with the United States, has developed as a post of his parent state in Mexico.
In his family, in a huge and wide state of the capital of the country, the opinion of the new leader was separated.
Primical man
For example, the Vale-de-Bravo, in the idolatrous city, remembers warmth.
The people have been able to live in tourism, to develop a cook and to create infrastructure.
The city can be reached by one of the new shoes built by Mr. Pine Nito, which are different from the roads of the wheats and meats that were previously on this place.
The tables with his name depend on the modern sports centre and the impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We linked him to the hope of real and serious changes," said his friend and the political associator Gabriel Olver Ernandes, the State Congress of the United States of the United Nations Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We are expected to change these and decisive changes, which are so necessary to our country, first in the area of security and economic development.
After 81 years of unexpected residence, the Prime Party had been deleted in 2000 by Visente Fox.
The Congress of Olver acknowledges that after his 12-year-old absence, the party has given great hopes to Enrique Pineo Nito after his presidency.
He also checks the accused of inconsistentness issued by the new President of the opposition.
It is very direct and very dedicated to the implication of his future country's vision.
This is a supervised public person, and, above all, a person enabled to listen.
However, in the other part of the state, many people had another representation of the former Governor.
The municipality of Nessaulkootl, also known as Susan Ness, is the most radical contrast with the powerful Vale de Barauo streets.
He was hidden under the east of the automobile, and in many senses, he was the reward of the Mexican itself.
And the problems in the municipality also have a serious nature of this megapolis.
This year, for the elimination of the bands of drugs in these regions, were engaged in the army, and violence against women has been particularly severe.
In the desert, only in the past two years, a number of decades of murdered women had been found.
More thousands of women were killed in Mexico during the governance of Mr. Peña Nito, which is significantly highlighted by the sadly glorified city of Susan-Huares, whose name was narrow when the murder of innocent women.
According to the opposers, Mr. Peña Neto, in the best case, it was possible to say that during his residence at the Governor's position, he did not have a duty to address the problem of murdering women.
In the worst case, his administration is accused of fully ignoring this problem.
The lives of a beton house, like most of the houses in this area, Irina Bundy with work, showing me a picture of her sweet daughter Marianna Luna.
Marian's official version of the 2010 suicide.
However, her family believes that she was killed by her parent.
"When I arrived to her home, it seemed to be her body before it," remembered Mrs. Bundy.
It was signed that the body was killed, and the body was already shocked.
The mother of Mariana tells this story, and the portrait of the daughters looks at us from the wall where he spends close to a snake, which is a whole word: justice.
That is, as they say, that family was rejected.
"Another persons of the State were treated with me as a old pilot, an unvoluntary offender of peace.
They want people to just accept everything they're saying, and they're disappointed.
But it's wrong, that's not possible, especially when it is around so many violations and deficiencies", she says.
In the hope of the President ' s movement to Saturday, President Pink Néto, together with her, is an unfortunate responsibility.
Over the past six years, ten thousands of families in Mexico have affected violence crimes, and the new Chairman promised to address this problem priority during its rule.
"I hope he will be exactly the same chairman as the Governor," says Olver, the Vale-de-Bravo Congressman of the PRI party.
However, this is mostly threatened by the families of victims in Susan Nes.
Bradley Manning did not complain to a bad treatment, claims the accused.
The accusers are trying to check the statement of Bradley Manning about the bad conditions of detention.
In the hearing, Manig remained in military prison in Quentico, Virginia.
Defence requires to close the case on the basis of the conditions of Manig's arrest.
A number of United States armies are accused of pursuing a number of thousands of secret documents.
In Friday, the accused tried to prove that a series of Bradley Manning accused of the largest escape of detention materials in the United States history did not use numerous opportunities to make complaints for bad treatment, which, as he said, had to be transferred to military prison.
During the recruitment request in Fort-Mede, the State of Maryland, the military adviser, Ashden Fein, stated that the annual visits of Mannig's representatives of the prison administration for nine months of his content in Quentico, Virginia, had no complaints for bad treatment.
The recruitment request for the protection of Mannig case based on the conditions of his arrest were cruel and in itself sufficient punishment, was carried out on the next day following Manning claimed that he was in custody, he was able to conduct self-assault.
The military analysis experts arrested in June 2010 are accused of investigating several thousands of secret documents during Iraq ' s service.
These materials were then published on the WikiLeaks website.
The WikiLeaks Ressource did not confirm that the source of information was Manning.
During the hearing in Friday, the Prosecutor Fein, together with Manning, reviewed the reports completed after the visits by Manniega's representatives during his stay in the Kvantico prison, where he was at the strict condition of the sentence system from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, the officers gave Manniegu questions and recorded the answers.
When the Prosecutor Fein asked the reports on Thursday, Manning acknowledges the treatment of the prison administration as a "prominent" and the general terms of detention as "professionally organized".
The reviewed reports do not contain complaints for bad treatment, despite the demand of Manniga ' s conditions, said Fein.
Manning answered that he had expressed sincere concern about these problems and that his visiting representatives had discussed these problems with him and claimed that they would be taken, but did not fix it in a written way.
"They's not recorded the challenges." (After the discussion of my complaints, it doesn't mean that I didn't take this topic in the interview," says Maning.
The Military judge, captain Dennis Lind, also asked Mannig why he did not complain for his injury in January 2011 during the meeting of the Commission to consider the socidian purposes he had expressed in writing for a few months before it.
Manning answered that during the meeting he wanted to achieve the "prevention of the trauma" and reduce the constraint conditions.
The military leaders explained that the limitation of the conclusion was at the level below than the supervisory regime for the prevention of self-assault was introduced to protect the prisoner and for the security of others.
"I wanted to know the Administration that it's all right with me that they can delete the prevention of the trauma... to improve my level of life, in my view," she explained.
On Friday, Manning witnessed his arrest in Iraq and translated to Kuwait, where it was contained nearly two months before he was transferred to the Military Base in Quentico, Virginia, July 2010.
He reported that the thoughts of self-assault appeared to him in Kuwait, and that once he lost awareness because of a strong strike.
He explained that psychology is very hard when you don't know how your participation is, and what happens in the outside world.
"My peace welcomed Camp-Ariffung's base, until my prison size, said Manning on Tuesday.
- I thought I'd die in this cell."
In Quentico, Manning, on his words, conducted a large part of a small camera at least 21 hours, and often more than 23 hours in the slope - in full unity.
Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only mats, sweats, sleeves, several clothes and shoes.
He said he tried to move because he was sleeping or even just sit in a daily time forbidden the rules.
According to Mannie, during his sleep, the light was constantly smelling outside the camera.
If the guards didn't see him face when he turned into beds at night, then, as he said, they built him and put him back to the bed.
The lawyer Manning gave an official comment on the injury to Manning in January 2011.
In April 2011, Mannig moved to military prison in Fort Livenworth, Canada.
In addition, in Friday, the judge asked Mannigal about the statement he made during the date of the statements on Friday, that after a night he was put to sleep in his camera in Kwantiko, he was forced to stand low before the guards and other prisoners in the morning check.
Manning said that it was not possible to shut up during the check.
In response to the judges on Friday, Manning said that he understood the guard's command that he had to leave the shooting that could be closed, but acknowledged that no one had directly commanded him to leave him.
On Friday, Manning said that his last night had been able to sleep blue because of his attempt to show the officer that he was not dangerous for himself.
Manning told the officer that he could use the skin of skin or sleepers to smile himself, but he did not.
On that night, Mannig's witness, his low white, sleeves and skins took out of the camera.
His lawyers are hoped that at least the judge teaches what he had to survive during the detention, and that it would decrease significantly the duration of the sentence if Maning is recognised by a military court that should start to consider his case at the beginning of the next year.
The defender said that he planned to propose Manning to recognize the guilt for less serious crimes and other accused to oppose as excessive.
The renewment of the hearing planned for these weeks is expected that the accused party would expect that the conditions of detention were justified.
Pentagon claims that Manning was in Cuntico in accordance with the rules regulated by arrests with a maximum strict regime.
Among the accused of Manningh include the unlawful promotion of the data generation into the Internet, the transfer of information on national defence and the defence of public property or documents.
If he is sentenced to all items of the accused act, he may threaten a living sentence.
My crisis of national self-determination is the statement of the American origin of Mexico.
In view of the author, many mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the absence of the possibility of implementing themselves.
Mexicans are forced to blame those who have gone because they remember the people of the country about the difficult times.
Ruben Navarette believes that the Mexicans of American origin are disrupted between two cultures.
During the recent journey in Mexico, I passed to the coastal to arrive, approached the border control zone and passed on the place.
The signs were indicated in two directions: one for Mexico (Mexicans), second for Extranjeros (Foreigners).
I stood a few seconds before them, I don't know where to go.
I grew up in central California, and my life was called Mexican.
It's just a conditional name, as my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends from New York consider themselves Italians.
Afterward, I stopped the complex construction of the American origin of Mexico.
But I was here in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather ' s family, there was no need for conditional names or complex constructions.
I was just a American.
I'm talking in Spanish enough to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary stock is poor than the porters of the language, and I can't be free from the American accent.
Because I got my American passport, and I'm on the way for the extraordinary.
I recall this story a few days ago when the newly elected President of Mexico Enrique Piney Nito visited the White House and met President Obama.
The agenda was suitable for the meeting of the chairmans of these countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
The President of the Níto was willing to speak about the cut-off Mexican economy, with which the Mexicans now will be able to stay in Mexico instead of moveing to the United States.
He wants to establish an agreement on partnership with the United States and Canada and to establish a certain North American trade block for Europe.
Furthermore, President Peya Neto had promised to continue the war against drugs in Mexico, but no specific proposals had been made.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is a heavy and old issue.
Most Americans never thought that in 1848, the United States had entered Mexican and, under the dust of the expense, their leaders rejected the half of their territory.
But the Mexicans think of centuries, not in minutes, and see the memories of those events all over.
As a result, only one of the US public deactors should be a critical word on the side of Mexico, in the press and among the elites of the Mexico society, there are complaints that the Americans are on the sovereignty of neighbourhood.
The Montesum posts are inherited by militaryity.
The most complex of the relationships in Mexico with more than 35 million Americans in the United States.
Do you want to talk about both?
They're enough.
There are winners and losses in Mexico, people who are found in this country for themselves and who do not have such opportunities.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Fenicos, Denver or San Antonio, there were so many people in Mexico because of only one reason: at any time, their family history, a father or a grandfather, had no possibility to realize themselves in Mexico and was sent to the north.
It was more than the Mexicans of a certain type of sweet, low-formed, from poor Christian families.
We're their descendants, and we remember it.
It's not otherwise in Mexico.
Our life is the involvement of the American dream, we learned in good schools and made good work, but we don't forget that even this dream is American, not Mexico.
Our national self-determination is unexpected, but we know what country to consider.
United States.
We also know that most of the representatives of Mexico ' s Elite and the right class do not love us.
We answer them the same thing.
They see in us the reminder of low-related struggles and relate to us as people in the second shore, as to the unfair Mexico.
We are insufficiently speaking in Spain, and our relationship with Mexico is inadequate.
Our own existence is explained by the failures.
If our priests were successful in Mexico, they wouldn't go.
We wouldn’t have been in the past for a heavy burden, found in the United States, but lost spiritual links.
My wife was born to Guadalajara and was legally moved to the United States in a child, and this reminds me that between the actual Mexico and the Americans of Mexico, there are some trains - the Mexicans will clearly understand their national identity, and the Americans of Mexico.
She is a citizen of the United States and believes that it belongs to both of these countries.
At the same time, many of my known Americans in Mexico have no sense of belonging to one of them.
We're listening to the Mexican Group of Los Tigres del Nord, but we love Bruce Spangstin.
The best ones of two worlds, you're going to lose the roots inevitablely.
We are Americans in Mexico.
And in the United States, we're called Mexicans.
Now, as I explained during my trip, as if our relationships were uncomfortable, some Mexico leaders and intellectors want to restore the relationship with diasporal.
They want the Americans to work on their type of senders of Mexico and to represent the interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends what this beautiful country is and how well it is to visit, and we could convince political leaders to strengthen the relationship with Mexico.
Yeah, of course.
Nothing's going out.
A lot of dinners in the past.
And taking into account the disruption between the rich and the poor, corruption and drug trafficking, many of us are not considering this country such a wonderful wealth.
I'm sorry, but let's do this, Migos.
And it's just.
If a part of the Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States as they have done with Mexico a half-century centuries ago, they must also take the fact that some mexican Americans still have been dinnerly as they have recently met with their parents.
Yeah.
I think we've got more common than I thought.
Old Battles in New East
The agreement on the end of the fire between Israel and the Hamas group may be a smooth foundation for the further world
Is a long-term peace between the Arabs and the Israelites in the Middle East?
The normal round of bloodproliferation underlines the conclusion of such hopes.
It sounds that the first one starts; the majority of the buildings are ruined; the murders of more than 140 Palestinians, most of which were civilians, and six Israelites; in the first place of the conflict from the Gaza sector, the missiles slaughter slaughtered in the neighbors of the capital of Tel Aviv and the sacred city of Jerusalem.
However, although Israelites and Palestinians were uncertainly linked to their eternal conflict, the Middle East has changed.
This may be a wide, but the events of the " Arab Spring" were loaded in a swimming swimming snake of the reality, and the Palestinians with the Israelites were not able to remain in the side of the swimming region.
They may be more bloodproliferated than previously.
However, there are reasons for giving hopes to leave this mortal tube.
War without Victors
At first, the situation has not been taken for optimism.
Even if the end of the fire, which was signed on 21 November, will be carried out, which only strengthened the positions of both sides.
The leaders of the Islamic movement of Hamas, who had arrived to the Gaza sector in 2007, claimed that they were forced to abandon Israel, despite their losses.
Despite some group leaders have been destroyed, and 1.7 million people were blocked in one of our planet's most ruining and problems, Israel could not destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas encourages its popularity on the west coast of Jordan, another Palestinian territory controlled today by Fatch’s more dead movement.
Furthermore, the leaders of Hamas may find that time is working for them.
Increased Islamic movements in the Arab world in Hamas are new influential and rich friends.
The resurrected regional leader of Turkey, who was once the most closest partner of Israel among the Islamic countries, has supported Hamas; the example of Catar, one of the most rich and dynamicly developing States of the Persian Valley.
Hamas Training parties will declare the establishment of a Islamic half-month surrounding Israel from Lebanon to the north, in which Hezbol, to Syria, in which the more prostitute forces here will reject the power of Basher Assad, and further to Jordan, where the king's authorities are threatening Hamas' Unions.
The worst change of the balance of forces in the region has occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most hot and important Arab country, in Egypt, where the President of Muhammed Mursy has strengthened the influence of the brother-musulman movement.
Hosni Mubarak, who was the Rules of Egypt for 30 years and was denied in 2011, was a light dictator who had not given special attention to Hamas' support.
Instead, the Muslim brothers are a organization, in many similar ways with Hamas, and their leaders are more strict to popularism.
The future diplomatic distances of Hamas may be a major player whose voice will not be able to silence even Israel and America.
At the same time, the "floor" lines in Israel will come to contradictional conclusions.
Hamas was returned in military terms.
The Israeli anti-related "Green Cook" system justified the costs of its creation and successfully destroyed many of the runned Hamas Raket.
The people of Israel can sleep peacefully, at least some time.
With regard to diplomacy, the United States remained faithful to their non-smooth position; many European countries have also condemned the beginning of the last year of violence in Hamas.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, especially in the Government of Benjim Najahu, which significantly ignored the peace process.
Despite about 30 Israelites died since 2004 from the missiles issued from the Gaza Sector, Israel was able to address the minimum problem of the mortal terrorists, in part by the wall of the western Jordan River, a significant part of the unrecognised Palestinian State, and to protect the Jewish populations that continue to be enlarged in spite of the illicitness of such action in the context of international law.
The position of Prime Minister Neanjahu, whose party Liquod, in the preparation of the elections on 22 January, has joined the more aggressively established conservators under the direction of Abigail Liberman.
What is the purpose of creating Palestinians and giving them their own State?
If they give the entire authority to the territory of the West coast, will they not start start starting missiles from Israel to the side of the Gaza, as they do in the Gaza sector?
It's better to keep them behind the wall and to make any attempt to get up the heads.
The "floor" lines may be winned, but their calculations may be checked by the Arab early.
While the Islamics who are in Egypt and other countries have experienced no warm feelings to Israel, their priority will become internal problems.
The protective part of the Israeli budget is more than all its Arab neighbors, together.
The fusion of war with a regional superstanding does not help the Arab Governments to strengthen their economy.
The Pragmaticism of the President of Egypt, Murcy, who worked together with Barack Obama on the end of the fire, is a well-known knowledge and may represent its start of change.
Israel must take into account the long-term consequences of its policy.
During the invasion of democratic changes in the Arab countries, the extent of the Palestinian rights to self-determination is a bomb of a slow-related action that is shocked early or later on the occupied Israeli territories, such as a bus in the Tel Aviv in that week.
Republics are already undermined by the basis of democracy in the Jewish State, and the demographic aspect of the growth of the Arab population is only to affect these problems.
Blood-proliferation operations that are conducted every few years in the Gaza Sector for Hamas movement should be paid to the growing injury of the international community.
Both parties need an external impuls
The only decision to which healthy representatives from both sides and the large part of the rest of the world and our newspaper is that two States and Israel ' s involvement in exchange of security.
The hope remains not too short-term perspective, the hope that the end of the fire allows other countries to influence conflict sides more effectively.
Egypt, which has long decided to reverse the weapons of the Gaza Sector, and Turkey and Qatar, have as a positive position to ensure that Hamas recognize the borders of the Jewish State adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of the Territories and the common use of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile Hamas and Fatch movements.
This would be more to create a Palestinian State than the next vote in the United Nations, which could result in recognition of the virtual state of Palestinian.
It should play the President of Obama in order to put Israel into the negotiations table.
In his first term, he did not present its own plan of peace-resolution.
After returning to the White House, he continues to demonstrate the unwantedness to address this problem.
This is a disastrous position.
The United States are livingly interested in stability in the Middle East.
This may only be possible in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians.
In Australia, the Cigarette pack has entered into force.
The warnings of smoking and images of infected parts of the body are contracted to the unique green boxes that are equal to all smokemarks.
The First World Trade Act of Australia on Unified Cigarette and Taxis has entered into force by replaceing logotypes and the color of the different marks of the same olive-filled box with the sharp pictures of the infected part of the body and images of the children whose health has been subjected to smoking their parents.
Besides different images and descriptions that warn to smoke, the only difference between the packages that are required to be introduced with this Sabbath is the name of the brand printed by a small font.
These are the most terrible conditions in the world for the formulation of packaging of tasting items.
The Federal Government of Australia states that the aim of this action is to keep young people from smoking, with the lack of the harmful incidence of moderate status.
The results of research shown that people who have not been smoking up to 26 years were in 99 cases that have never become smokers.
“Certainly, even in the age of the young, children understand the meaning that are trying to bring tax companys through the packaging,” explains the Minister of Health of Tana Plyberseth, referring to studies that show that, for example, the low-type root is associated to children's ideas of princess.
Australia is one of the least countries in the world of smokers, so that these changes are not particularly indicated to the arrival of transnational corporations, but the possibilities of such measures are already considered by other countries.
The Tajik Industry representatives have intensified the adoption of this law.
Taxi companies claim that it will only increase the part of the black market, which will be sold low and available cigarettes.
"This law will lead to the serious consequences that are different from those who have been planned by it," says Scott Macintoir, representative of the British American Tobacco company in Australia.
Detailed product producers from China and Indonesia will provide much more goods for sales on the streets of Australia.
Instead, new laws contribute to the growth of business.
Sandra Ha from a small family company, Sico Import Pty Ltd states that the demand for portuguery and silicon footballs that hide package pictures are slightly growing (praktically from zero) since two months ago the company, such as British American Tobacco, the British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan, has tried to spend the case in the high court of Australia, where they tried to condemn the law.
According to Sandera Ha, the company has already implemented six thousand entities to the business of the private trade and has expected a new party.
It's a good business for us.
The potential approach to the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the population of social networks in particular the part of the population to which these measures are aimed.
After the adoption of a number of laws made by the illicit television advertising and supporting the sports events in Australia, as well as for prohibited salers to put cigarettes on a visible place, the public of taxes moved to the Internet.
The Government of Australia prohibited local companies and websites to place an advertising on the web, but it could not be limited to the local sites.
"If you're shopping taxi items and you have only this small lace, the idea to move your products in the Internet is showing you extremely strict," explains Becky Flynn, who investigates public health issues at the University of Sidney.
Frymen notes the growth of commercial reviews written by individuals as common users, in social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
Is this really the case of a jungle citizen who loves Marlboro's smoke that hasn't seen strength and time and made a video, or is it the advertising company?
The Australian Office of British American Tobacco states that there are more adjustments to new rules than advertising.
The representatives of Tahiti Industry even took steps such as the shocking of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to strike new rules: these States provide claims within the framework of the World Trade Organization, declaring that trade had been unfair, despite the trade relations with all these countries with Australia.
WTO decision is expected to midnight 2013.
According to Tani Plybersus, the Government has discussed the possibility of adopting similar packaging laws with other countries.
In 2001, Canada introduced the first binding of photos that warned smoking.
This rule is now adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of re-established laws is considered in Britain, New Zealand, Southern and India.
Many of the smokers in Australia have not been demonstrated by new information.
I don't know these pictures.
I just don't care.
"Increasing smoke and hiding a pack in the carman," explains Victor El Heig, who buys the cigarettes with the photos of the smell pack.
Really, the only thing I can let me leave is my little daughter.
James Yeu, who purchases Taxis King of the Pack in the centre of Sidne, claims that the same packaging has complicated the task of a field distance
"I've got a new party to download, and now four hours," he regrets.
"It was supposed to take and prohibit smoking, then we would say, "Oke, all over, we'll close the shop," he says, shutting up the hands up.
Disabled electronic networks and permanent connections in the world is not so bad.
On that day of thanks, I was unexpectedly to take five hours to the airport, because our aircraft has discovered mechanics and replaced it by another flight we've been expected.
So I had enough time to think about the nature of the shock.
I won't lie you.
The half day in the race airport is really sweet, and there are no helpful books, magazines, iPhones, or even the shopping of free trade.
However, recently, more scientists and child development specialists have been expressed in use of shock.
They say that in some situations, we and our children are missing not so bad.
This requires the brain to react to the interesting different topics that may contribute to creature.
And since we are all in the modern world on a screen, the advantages of the smells are on us.
Maybe we need to try to shoot?
Yeah.
Not at the same time.
We'll be back to that.
I was thinking, as many, that the smell is a discovery about recent times when people were more free.
This is not true, Peter Tui, Professor of Greek and Roman History of the Canadian University of Calgari, author of the Lively History of the Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011.
"Indeed, the smell can be very old, " said he.
In Pompei’s walls there are Latin records on the shock dated for the first century.
This remains an open question of how we understand the skin.
The problem is, says John D. Yid, the professor advisor of the University of New York in Ontario, Canada, that the understanding and vision of the weakness have often changed.
He studied research materials on this topic and asked the target group of 100 people, Professor Yud and his colleagues came to the following definition: "The crack is when people want, but they can't do what would be satisfied."
The difference between smells and pharmacies, he says, is that a laughing person does not do anything that he wants to do.
I don't want to do anything in the aptee.
The main thing in the worried shock, he says, is "the breach of attention and the deterioration of the attitude and the feeling that time is slowly".
The description of the skin may be very similar to the depression.
However, Professor Edad claims that, despite the possible relationship between these situations, people suffering see the cause of environmental problems and circumstances, and people suffering from depression see problems in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're missing when we really are simply focused on something.
In his study “Inconsistent thinking: the definition of skins from attention” published in the September magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, professor of Gede and colleagues refer to the previous experiment that the participants listened to the record of the magazine.
Some participants also heard the sounds not related to the case of the television program in the neighbourhood, others heard the same sounds in low volume, so that the third group had been identified, and the third group was only listening to the record of the voice without a multilateral sound track.
The participants who heard television at a low-level level noted that they had been lacking, often others -- it was difficult to concentrate, but they did not know why it was a reason and they had recorded that shock.
When we try to concentrate on the difficult or encouraging task, the stopping of the attention can cause a shock, says Mark J. Finsk, professor advisor in the University of Gulf, Ontario, and one of the authors of this study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteressant, "for example, in the stream of ships in the search of marriage, a slight music can help avoid shocks."
It's still that when people start to break on the stove or draw a carcasse on a paper, they do it from a shock, but now we know that these actions are actually helping not physically reducing.
"The survey showed that children who are not prohibited to shut up and return are learning better and forgetting more information than children from whom they need to sit silently," says Professor Fensk.
At a moment, we all experience a shock: at a delay (always in my case), listening to the monotone speaker, inducing an uninterested film.
However, different people demonstrate a variety of ways of shocking.
In the 1980s, researchers have developed a special "scale to skin" for the measurement of such individual characteristics.
To determine such assessment, "My of the things I have to do in a similar and monotony" or "I'm too interested, so there's no time to do."
With such investigators, they determined that the boys are more lacking of girls, says Steven Wodanov, psychiatologist at the University of Western Florida, especially in the existence of different external destructors.
However, in general, adolescents are often missing.
In 1991, Mr. Rid Larson, professeur of personal and public development at the University of Illinois, performed an experiment in which he had linked with the pitcher almost 400 adolescents and their parents 7-8 times a day.
He received the following results: 32 per cent of adolescents claimed that they were lacking at school and at home task, and 23 per cent claimed that they were disappointed from schools.
Only 3 per cent of parents noted that they were weak.
Prof. Larson notes that he has no data about the kind of shock data now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that “the age of adolescents is the skin of shocking,” mainly because children and adolescents are not fully able to decide what to do.
Let's go back to my original question: is it useful?
Sometimes, because in extreme evidence, such as the research shows, it may emphasize people to absorptive and dangerous physical action, risk-free games, or misuse of certain substances in trying to escape the shock.
On the other hand, many philosophs and writers thought about the relationship between the shock and the creature, says Professor Vadanovic, dedicating the study of this problem over two decades.
"There is our brain emphasizes us that we should do something else, that's a shock," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York.
However, this brain is not always aware of what is better to take.
If you'll be sweet and you'll send this energy to a guest game or a culinary experience, you'll make yourself better.
But if you're going to look at the television, you'll be better at some time, and soon it's going.
So, if your child laughs and you give him a iPad, he stops missing, but he won't learn to fight with a smoke yourself or any other way to manage his time and employment, says Professor Finnske.
“And such qualifications of self-regulation are carried out in the most different situations” said he.
Your child learns not only to do something alone, but he will also learn self-control.
I don't think that the shooting needs to be shipped.
However, it should not be considered to be wrong.
It should be learned to feel comfortable even without the unexpected flow of action and technologies.
Professor Yud agrees with this.
"We see this, that we need to try more, while the smell is a very unpleasant, innocent desire to take something aware," he says.
Indeed, people are trying to get away from permanent concerns and simply relaxing.
"In the modern world, we're attracted to the excessive stimulation of the feelings," he says, "and when it comes to calm, we're losing and don't know what to do."
As far as the new marihuana legalization law will be applied in the state of Kolorado
Antony Orosco, the nine-year-old football team game and the student of the public college in the South-East of Colombia, are accused of promoting criminal crime that will soon be enforced on the entire territory of the State: the safeguarding of a small portion of marihuana and shocks in which he smokeed it.
Mr. Osko said that one day in September he was with friends in Lamare and went to a car near the border with Kansas when the police stopped.
After the police has found in the marihuana car, Mr. Osko came to the court for drugs and ownership, a small crime, each of whose cost is $100, and the date of the judicial meeting.
"We're going to be like criminals," Mr. Osco says.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of non-determination that has been continued a few weeks after the state of Colorado proclaimed for the legitimacy of the use of marihuana in small quantities to disappear, the decision of hundreds of small judicial cases is not depending on the law of the place of consideration.
Infringements in small crimes related to marihuana are already undertaken in hundreds of cases here and in Washington State, which took similar measures.
Police officers have already stopped embarrassing people under 21 years of age and older than guarding small lakes that would be considered legally only after a couple of weeks.
However, in the more conservative districts of Colombia, the accusers decided to consider the existing matters related to marihuana and continue to be responsible for the keeping of the drug.
At the same time, in some cities from Denver's residents to the Western mountains, they vote to not allow new shops for the sale of marihuana in their places.
"I don't even know what to wait for further," says Daniel J. Outs, the police leader in the city of Aurora, on the east of Denver.
Representatives of the control bodies in Washington, Washington, have also been shocked with the heads.
It should be formed a rule to determine the licence for the development, processing, dissemination and sale of marijuana, and it must be done until 1 December 2013.
They say that Colombia, well or badly, has the majority of other states in solving marihuana matters, first in medical purposes, and now to disfellowship.
“In Colombia, they are a good example,” explains Brian I. Smith, representative of the Production and Success of Alcohol Products in Washington State.
But now no one can do more, recognize Mr. Smith than making any proposal and hope that it works.
"We don't have the actual precedence to which we could stand," he says.
The Washington State Project, called I-502, shall enter into force on 6 December and the whole year in the state of uncertainty when there is no public license system and the right to domination of marihuana is already legal.
There are still insufficient technical aspects that must be decided in this period, for example, the equality between the allocation of the State on adequate access to the authorized marihuana with prohibition to trade at a distance of 1000 feet from school, parks, game gardens and child gardens.
“It will be very difficult to situate licences for marihuana trade undertakings in the part of the city, in particular in the Seattle and its rewards”, explains Ben Livingstone, representative of the recently established research group "Centre for the Legalization of Marihuana".
On November 21, Outs policeman from Aurora dismissed his sub-e-mail message that the city's prosecutor will no longer be able to spend the age of the 21th year to the ownership of the small number of marihuanas, and that the police stops to eliminate people in violations of the "prior to this time".
The Police Officer Outs reported that the police would monitor the compliance with the cities of rules regulating the activities of marihuana for medical purposes, and would follow illegal traffickers and drug distributors.
The Prosecutor of Wald in the northern Cololado, Ken Back, represents a more strict approach to this issue.
After the vote on the draft law, he stated that the prosecution would continue to be responsible for the possession of the marihuana, mainly to encourage its users to go to the treatment course.
At this time, 119 persons have been accused of guarding two and less marihuana units, although many of them are accused of other violations.
"The obligation of our institutions to follow the acts that are considered criminals at the time of their accomplishment," said Mr. Buck in his statement.
The response was unlikely even in places such as the rural district of Mes, where voters rejected the proposal for the legialization of the marihuana.
The police of Grend Janckhn, the largest city in the district, has no longer taken account of the responsibilities for the possession of a small number of drugs.
The surrounding Prosecutor Pit Haatzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to take up the accused of already open cases related to marihuana's guard.
"I think that to ensure the compliance of the law until it changes is our direct duty," he says.
Despite 55 per cent of the people of the Colombian State who participated in the vote, this decision supported, the use of marihuana for public and legal divisions would not be simple.
The anti-oriented reaction of the people in different states was the independence of the relationship between local authorities to the experiment of the state of marijuana.
"In the environmental prosecutors there is a cultural barrier in this issue," explains Shon McAllister, a Duveran lawyer who represents the interests of the judges for the conservation of marihuana, and the local representative of the National Organization for the reform of marihuana laws.
"They have persecuted people so long for it, that now they can't be deceived by the fact that it is no longer a crime," he says.
Colorad and Washington are the first states in which the small number of marihuanas are the same as alcohol are convicted to be an experimental field in countries to check the ideas of drug legialization.
Participants of the State ' s legitimacy and officials plan to expand the territory of legitimated trade, but at the same time they are expected to provide instructions from the federal authorities that are still planning to consider the sale and enhancement of marihuana as federal crimes.
Participants hope that the Office of Justice will be addressed in this matter.
Despite several widely received arrests of trade and patients using marijuana for medical indications, the Federal Government has in most cases providing goods to trade marijuana for medical purposes in Colombia, Washington and 16 other states.
The Officers of Drugs and Drugs would not be in the house to conflict a small marihuana package, but they would have to close their eyes to the regulated authorities of the State of the Registration Margin, which were authorised under the new law, believe Kevin A. Savat, former drug advisor in the Administration of Obama.
Some cities in Colombia have not been expected to be taken by federal authorities.
Before the presidential elections, some local administrations have approved moratories for opening new markets for the sale of marihuana that could not be opened before the year.
Last week, Montros, a city in the west of the state, has issued six-month ban on trade in marijuana, which will be approved by the next week.
"We don't want to make such a situation that we make a license, and then it will solve serious problems at the federal level," says Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our city proclaimed this amendment.
And now we have an opposition between the results of the local vote and what the State has declared.
There are still many indecisive issues.
Peter Wyatt: I survived from Oxford because I was a conservator.
The persecution of university students has not been today.
As far as I remember, I was always dreaming to do at the Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in Oxford and described it as the best in the world's training, the modern analysis of anti-symposium, which placed two basiss of civilization, the freedom of thinking and patience.
However, after two weeks of the historical College of Western University at the end of the eighth, I gathered the chain and went out that was the first real scandale in my life.
My father didn't smell and smell.
The friends were shocked from the point.
The Evening Standard stated that I left a college because I didn't like my colleagues in the neighborhood.
The writer E. Norman Wilson shouted that I was gone because I had to drink out of the shoes.
It wasn't really nice.
I'm gone.
Yeah, I ran because I was systematically hurted and threatened.
It's not because of my very innocent name or what I've learned in private school.
Only one reason for me, and in this glorified colleague of education this seemed to be a real vulnerability and a blind fanaticism: my father, who is now dead Wuドロ Wrightt, was known as Margaret Tatcher, and I was the counterparty of the consertors.
You're wondering why you can remember this now?
According to the recent data, the new generation of students in the right-century views is the same trauma.
This institutionalized and continuously growing hate to conserve students in Oxford was so strong that in the past week, the group of students needed the same protection of their rights as those of persons with disabilities, sexual and ethnic minorities.
The student club of Corpus Christi in Cambridge states that they "will be actively disfellowshipped, affect personal attacks and make feelings of unlawful guests" because of their political views.
They wish to enter the Committee on Equal Rights of the Additional Representative in order to ensure the freedom of expressing their views.
Their situation was only understood recently on BBC 2 a documentary film on the "Starn wonders: young, intelligent and legal", which was presented by experts and non-onicists.
The film showed by Joe Cook, former President of the Oxford University Consistent Association, which travels to Rolls Royce, has a golden skin and three with a golden snake.
In other universities, conservator students are regretting that they do "cockles of discharge due to increased educational payment".
Luke Blake, 20 years of age, the Vice-Chairperson of the University of Nottingham, in an interview, said that " the university environment increases the transaction of the left views.
Those who don't even know us are considered us angry and unbelievable children of rich parents."
Samuel Roberts, 21 years of age, a historical college College of Corpus Christi, in which a request for enhancement was called the “neuttle” atmosphere, and Stephen Cheryl, 19-year-old President, the new president of the Oxford University Consistent Association, said that the relationship of members of the student club to the leaders of the legal views has been significantly worried.
"This is a threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual discussion and simply for the normal life of club members," she says.
The first few weeks in Oxford I was not just a minority, I was alone.
I did there in September 1986, a worker and a tendency of a 18 - year - old girl.
Oxford was discovered from hate to the conservative party.
For this year, the university left a former student, Margaret Ttcher, because of the reduction of budgetary allocations for higher education.
In that atmosphere, it would be uncomfortable even graduates.
In the first day of the week, when the students met each other and the employees, I felt the first time I was waiting for me.
I did not know that the suppliers were not only looking around the fingers of the consecutor students but also joyfully participated in it.
Political matters — striking shatters, privacy and unconsentment by the Government to approve sanctions against the Apartheid Government in South Africa — have shocked the shooting tree walls of the audientors.
At my first seminar, I had to transfer the French text to English on the eighth century, and I was not ready to follow this.
"Ms. Waitt, I said the speaker, Harry Petet now, - please move the first paragraph."
The text made me work, I saw it.
Harry Petet was a very sweet man with a face like a torch.
"Technicists aren't teaching French or just missing the brain?" asked he.
Other students were protected.
I've been laughing at my eyes.
"I call you to take a few of the main lessons of French in a free time, if you're not very busy, turning into society," said Peter.
I returned to my room very unfortunate.
That night in the college, I sit for one dinner, and then somebody slaughtered me on my shoulder.
This was James, a second course student from the English School, represented as a member of the university Consistent Association.
"I know who you are," he said friendly.
- Unfortunately, the case will be as follows:
Whoever suspicions in the symptoms to the conservators will be disappointed.
It's hard to me, and in your case they know that your father's close to Margaret Tatcher, because you're gonna be more difficult.
The majority of the Conservators are designed that they are labourists."
Afterward, I tried to hide.
I insisted that it wasn't agreed with all the words Margaret Tatcher.
He's not able to smoke.
The first student of the Philosophics, policies and economics, who had learned in Ethan, said, "You are the daughter of a fasist pork.
You're ridiculous."
Other students gave him the words.
I was slaughtered, slaughtered.
"What are the containers in sex?
- They're putting each other together, right?
I felt like the homosexuality should have felt before the cancellation of criminal persecution in the sixty-year years.
Will I ever have a normal life in Oxford?
Or do I have to meet the one-industries just under the slope of the night?
Would I have to be a license and to hide my real beliefs?
The next three years of my life became a damn, a full shock and unity.
The only provider in my colleague, who didn't hide its conservative views, was Norman Stone, professor of modern history.
He was hated not only because of the conservators, but also because he was a Tetcher for Foreign Policy and one of its specialists.
He did not appear in the colleague.
He presumed it for the provinceality, the vulnerability and the commitment to the marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997, he adopted a professional position at the Billkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not gonna be happy," he said to me.
I moved to Oxford from London’s parents’s home, trying to find a refugee between my parents and the unprecedented capital friends.
I told her that I hate Oxford and explained why.
He didn't believe me.
There were any political views during his education in 40 years.
"But it's the best university in the world," he said condemnably.
- It's not possible, not only in the city of a long-term...
Even my Communist friends have always become unforeseen."
His powerful eyes were remembered.
"Do not take slow decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You will tell me the heart if you leave the university."
I was disfellowshipped by permanent travels in London and my emotional protection was weak.
My friend, also the conservator, did not hold pressures and rejected his confidence.
In the next week, during the seminar, when the general history predictor was very seriously called me “the enemy of the people”, I decided to do the same.
In the smell of the smile, I admitted that the brain of my parents was slaughtered, and called them "the old fools".
It's been too long.
The last shooting of my carrière in Oxford was condemned to forget my father.
At that time, he wrote every week two columns for the publications belonging to Rupert Merdoku.
My door was closed.
I didn't get out, and five minutes later, my persecutors came.
When they went out, I gathered the chariot and the village on the first train to London.
I didn't come back.
You can call me a plax and a shirt.
However, in eighth years no one should be an object of such a malnutrition and fear in training.
The worse is that it was Oxford, which was not only launched by the fourteenth Prime Minister of Tori, but also the day is hidden for an unfair reputation of the university, in which it apprecies the equality and freedom of mind.
"Valentely prefers the elegacy of glory."
The Valentino: Master of Shire, who was opening this week in London, is contacted with Nata Abascol, Fiona Tissen-Burnemia and other famous Italian designer
Somerseet-Haus, the former resident of the British Queen of Elizabeth I, the only place in the British capital, has the right to take a statement on Valentino Haravani.
The designer acknowledged this during the opening of the Valentino: Master of Shie, a triumphal retrospective exhibition, which combined more than 130 plates of high mode created by his "home" over the past 50 years.
"I am afraid of this house," he says with his incredible Italian actor.
This exhibition is a final part of the story, the only person whose "il sine" Haravani was, but could not be written without his named customers.
Valentino has always felt a wide and far-good world knowing.
In the first room of this exhibition, open to 3 March, the personal letters and photos for the signature of the most famous aristocratics, from the princess of Salma Ya-Haan to Lord Snowson, including Mari-Santal, Prince of Greece, and Margaret, the prince of Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as a trofey of their social submission: from a modest port from the city of Volgar to the northern Italy to the cloud of the international "Elite".
If you're loved in the Queen's gate, it's nothing bad.
"They wouldn't have the sigarettes on your magnificent coffee, as some beautiful pop stars do," says the Baron's Fiona Tissen-Bornemia.
We lived both in the 1960s and 70s and were good friends.
Valentino is an unpleasant master and is able to accept guests with generosity and eligibility.
"We all liked to go to his chalet in Gustad," explains the former wife of Hayney, Tissen, close to the friend of forgotten beauty like Maryla Anelly or Eugeny Nirkos.
Valentino always prefered the glory.
And despite this, he's a star.
Valleria Mazza, represented by Valentino
The Argentinian Valeria Machz model remembers the charistical model.
One time we went to dinner with him home, that was after the showing of the Spanish area in Rome, a few years ago.
Among the twenty-five guests were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy the young man.
The Valentino style showed every detail of his apartment, its burning, the food, the music.
"Anyone of the Valentino guests gave themselves to be an important and loved one," reminds the "pot model", which was working with the model in 1995 during the week of the high-mode in Paris.
"He never goes out of the mode, because his exhibition is the real art." it ends.
Party of Parents
The life of Haravani is not the story of obtainment, but of love with full mutuality.
He loves people with good education and high titles, and they love him.
One of the Somerseet-haus gallery was converted into a glumir subsequent of sixty meters long, which offers a change of role: a visitor has to do a model and must be deficited by the suburbs, the slaughter of the shoes of the shoes from Valentine, such as the material chosen by Jacklin Kennedy for his marriage with Aristour Elasis, a shoe that used Monicat in New York, or a shoe of the shoes and shoes that belonged to the shoes of the Fabra.
The models include names such as Sibilla Luxemburg, Gloria фон Turn in Taxis, Mete-Marrit from Norwegia, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofia Gabsburg.
Avatar and modeller, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is as the first love, "not possible to forget".
I remember it's beautiful.
These were shoes, shoes, icelets and shoes from the sleeve collection of 1971-1972.
"It was a gift he made me," said Nati Abascar, one of the designer museum.
"I want to read him for his wife, for his great love to women, because he emphasizes our beauty," adds the former herogy de Feriah.
I like the color he uses: there's a lot of light, and they're going to his face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and Patricia's Model Legislator Jovampaol d'Alenberg can also forget the first time that it arrived in Valentino.
When I was adolescent and lived in Italy, I dreamed that I would have a age and a behaviour to take one of his evening toilets...
Finally, the time was at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first bathroom from Valentino to take him to the feast in the shelf of my cousin, Prince Eduard de Line.
It was a red kitchen with a sweet, a swimming snake, a shock and a shock without a bracelet.
"It was a dream that makes an appearance," says Rodrigo born d'Arenberg.
"Valentely equal to mode, his suffering is immediately", explains this Italian aristocratic, who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Island.
Princess D. Allenberg's feast payments from the model with the maximum care... because it's not just a garage, it's also a counterparty of rememory.
"Roll" Model
The great finance of the exhibition in Somerseet-Haus is a married marital Mari-Cantal Miller for her marriage with Paul from Greece in 1995.
There were four months of work and 25 "twins" (he calls their swimming models) to prepare this slope of the slopes of the slopes of the slope shoes, with a twelve species of different rounds and slayf in four to half meters.
According to the journalist Susan Menques, the greatest authority of the specialized press, the payment represents the high mode of the end of the XX century, “Return of customers from highlight”.
The many years of the "life style" of the elite, and now Valentino is the best representative of her.
The Great Cross Cavaler (the difference of the highest snake in Italy), Kavaler of the work, Ordered Arts and Wordness commanded by the Order of the Complex Legion, Haravani collected so much of the same respect as any of his customers.
"Forever, my attention has touched his integrity, his calmness, his accumulated and unforgettable outdoor," remembers D. Arenberg.
The last time I saw him a month ago at a tragic dinner in the museum Orce.
He sit on the table with the Jacklin de Ribe graph, my big friend.
"He was uncertain, time is not for him."
If that's the princess...
The worst professional in the world: Kavah Yyena chatters
For four euros, Indonesian shatters are risking life and health, swinging 70 kilograms of snakes on the top of the volcan stores
There are people for whom their work is a god, and others are literally working in the god.
Among them, Anto Vijaya, one of the 400 shatters that are acquired for the lives of the snake in the Kavah Indian volcano, located on the east of the Indonesian island of Yava.
Each day, Anto spends on the slowest day, where the serial gas that is slow from the depth of the Earth is slow in contact with the air.
A large piece of serums, which can be reached by 70 kilograms, is put them into two bambooting corners, slows the corners on the shoe and puts them up on the shooting stone road.
Before the top of the volcane, which is 2,386 m, only 250 m, but the shipping loaders need more than 40 minutes to take up a strong step, to keep equality and to carefully shock the road, so that they are not shocked or shocked.
They know that one innocent step could stand on them, as happened with one tourist from France, who has been shocked a few years ago from the Kavah-Yegin skale.
Cavah Yyena Chasters pay $5 per kg of the series that are acquired
On the top, they spend the road between tourists who are photographing them, as if they were sicks from the circle and, swallowing hard corners, stepped up three miles [3 km] to the weight that the sweet company has put up at the height of 1.850 metres above.
It is about PT Candy Ngrimby, a company that has been exploitationd by this volcan since 1960, and is better and not to say that its employees whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupes (5 euros) for every kilogram of series.
Then it is sold for the non-technological production of 10,000 rubbers (83 euros) because it is distributed in daily life and used for the manufacture of shoes, fever, spaces, dynamits and even for the coal.
" As the standard is the overview of 70 kilograms, we pay around 46.000 rupes (3.8 euros) for each shop", explains Anto, which usually performs three daily transfers.
He costs three hours for each of them and finally feels disappeared, but allows it to cover 138.000 rubbers (11.5 euros) to the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a miser for such an inhuman effort, it is three more than he would have paid in the field.
" The daily payment to the chatters is very high in local measures where coffee pays 15,000 rules (1,2 euros) per day and medium month is equal to two million rules (167 euros), " explains the loader who had previously worked as a stone in the Bali island.
There was 75,000 rules (6.2 euros) in the day and in the park, but Anto returned to his family in Baniwanga, a town near the volcan, because of the winter reason that Indonesia was the same devastating, as a series, "I married a girl with Bali, where ones of the Indians, and brought her to Yavu to accept the Islams."
In Anto asthma, he's breathing with work, constantly shocking, and he's shocking the eyes because of toxic gases.
In its 27 years, Anto spent three years of risk in Cavah Yyene, whose series had already started to refer to him, despite the existence of masks and special points.
He has a asthma, he's breathing with work, constantly smells, and he's shocking the eyes because of the toxic gas that produces vulcanic.
That's the price that he must pay for the achievement of his dreams.
"I'm working for more than two years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises more than accepted by English.
A life - this nice and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, officer or port in the hotel, but instead of doing the mura work.
In the case of a sweet tree with other portators, he stands up every day at two hours at night, because the snake does not stop sailing at night when its character yellow color is transformed into a blue and listy among the smuggle.
The swimming calls to the teatro, Anto spends into the shooter, looking at the road of a small background bound to his castle, which he himself purchased for his money.
About 400 portators snake a snake on their snakes
In spite of the high arrives, the winning company did not mechanize the serial for the cost of the economy and provides none of the portable equipment that operate in its account and with such punishment.
In fact, they do not even receive parts of the $30,000 rules (2.5 euros) of a photo collection that, along with the incoming ticket (1.2 euros), the guards of the commander are taking from tourists who are coming to photograph Vulcan and its men.
"This work is for the plant, not for the people," says Budrusin, a 42-year-old counterparty, who carried out at Kavah-Yyene three decades since he left the college.
He believes that he will suffer the work " so much as possible " because he needs money to educate his three children from 18 to 10 years of age.
I'm not going to the pension, I'll die here, because the vulcan is my whole life.
Although the snake smells and eats the eye when the wind is slowly changed and shoots in the fleshly houses that come out of the volcane, they were so exacerbated that no one was complaining about their heavy diseases... more seriously, apparently, more seriously than their adverse problems with breathing, arthrosis, pain in collines and skins on the skins that were deformed under the weight of the corn.
The balance of the shooting corn, the Olympic can only up 50 pounds in its 53 years.
Each day, he and his friends have 15 tons of vulkanic seals, which are transported by three carriages to Tanzasar, a distance of 18 miles [18 km] from adults.
"I'm not going to the pension, I'll die here, because the vulcan is my whole life," says the U.S.U.A., opening a mouth that doesn't miss a few teeths.
From his five children, elders, 30 years old, also worked as a serial translator.
The time is passed, but the poverty is a generation to a generation of one of the most serious occupations in the world: what human murders are doing from Kawah-Yegin.
Singapore search for children to save the economy
Singaporeans accused carriage, stress and prices for housing and education in the absence of children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I'm a patriotic husband, you're my partner, and we're doing our civil debt and create a life!
It may be unreasonable that these lines are part of the advertising of smells, but, despite this, or perhaps through this, this video became a YouTube chief at Singapore in the beginning of this year.
These phrases are part of the trap that uses local talks like "Dave a bao (bola) in the beach" to be placed above the birth level in Singapore.
The Advertising Agency, which was made by the BBH, hopes that, using the advertising, they will be able to focus on this problem in a development form.
His creative director, Dugue Gamilton, said he wanted to use the music force so that people do the national debt.
This thing is only for the Internet, so we had to do it awesome and pleasant.
This is the main problem in the country.
We were worse in the world's reproduction of ourselves, so we felt that it was the subject that we had to touch.
We knew that the Government had tried to do many things, such as the launch of pharmaceutical spirits or to organize a fast-speaking feast (the visits).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they did not have to work.
So we thought we wouldn't do the most creative thing from the possible to solve this problem, that is, to resolve the rlip?
1.2 Child
Those who do not accept this so easyly, so the Singapore Government.
It costs $1,300 per year for policy to encourage citizens to birth more children.
The State package for marriage couples and parents provides up to $15,000 for children, extends pregnancy and kinds and provides tax prices.
But all this has a low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and high-technological reward State in South-East Asia, also known by its leadership and its strict public control.
The birth level in Singapore, according to its national population governance, is currently at the level 1.2 of a child at women.
The last time he was below 2 - which was known as a percentage of replacement - in 1976.
So why are Singapore no more children?
Tan Way Min, Director of the Office of Marriage Policy and the Family of the National Population Management, says that the cause of the "reasoned education" and "a larger gamma of carriage opportunities".
" This allows people to have a more wide range of variants in terms of living objectives and priorities other than marriage and family creation," explains.
These social standards contribute to the increase in the number of colleagues and the allocation of marriage and birth of children, resulting in decreasing birth rates in Singapore.
The immigration policy, which is aimed at slightly increased immigration to combat the reduction of the population, is a relief among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the eye hidden xenophobia regarding many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese who criticize the maintenance of low-level payments and the desire to integrate.
The growth of immigration is also considered as one of the reasons that the Singapore government party has received the worst results of elections from the time of independence in the past year.
After elections, it was tried to solve the problem with the cup and higher tax for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While birth downwards have a remarkable impact on the economic growth of the nation, tax, medical costs and immigration policy, the Singapore example also began to have some unexpected consequences.
The Government has efforts to not build such a small housing.
For example, this has started to affect the non-motive sector.
The City Development Guide has passed to control the number of small apartments known as a " cow box " which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments are very well sold at 46 square meters.
However, there is the view that they can contribute to the cold form of life and remain the stimulation of manufacturers who want to build a large family housing.
But Lim Yu Sun, Director-General of the El Developers, says that their "building boxes" are sell so faster than space machines.
They are more popular, meaning that such apartments are purchased for a few days, even a week, faster than the larger apartments.
As a result, our money income is increased.
However, he acknowledges that new standards are giving more clearer orientation to the manufacturers whose previously had been preposed if they wanted to propose too many small apartments in the project.
Too overloaded
Singapore is a state city.
Although these new rules can be a step to increase national birth, after conversation with synagogues working in the centre ' s financial quarre, they seem to have no special effect.
"Their lives are very excited, very precious, also educational, and many are dismissing it because of this," says the young manager.
Others may have children.
"But for me, it is important to pay your own money and time," says another young man 20 years old.
Women and women mention their career, stress and prices for housing and education as reasons for preventing children.
So, even though the Government had tried to encourage its citizens to birth children, as regards detriment, the last word remains than sympathy.
Privacy in the offline - personal online
Privacy.
According to the King Academy of Spain, it is the property of a private or "personal life area that has the right to protect from any involvement".
What is personal for an incomprehensive 16-year-old age?
How does it apply this definition in their daily life and social networks?
Does it understand the dangers at the Internet discussion of situations that would not be shared outside the Internet?
The period has been interviewed in five people from 10 to 15 years of age, private network users.
In four cases, they associated the term "also very much with my" in a personal floor, and "now and user name" when they applied it to social networks.
"My largest secrets I wouldn't have loaded in post," says the 10-year-old Horchee, when trying to explain the importance of personally on websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has two years of counting accounts.
"It's very secret, my mother can know them, but not all the world," he says.
I'm loading beautiful pictures or pictures of game.
I also spend with my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that's not my, or someone who is stupid," he says.
The child is aware that it is wrong to publish unfair photos of persons who are inquired, crimes, or to write disappointed or disgraceful comments.
Horchee believes he knows 35 friends that he's in the FB, and nine of his phones on Twitter.
Most of them.
The mother is aware, she has a password to one of the accounts.
I commanded Twitter to express myself and write interesting Twitters.
"I don't know if they answer me, I'm just downloading them," he adds.
"Social networks - disfellowship, I can talk to further relatives or with my baptized friends," he says.
Without consideration, it answers that it would never have received a request from an unknowledged person.
It wouldn't be considered to anyone who would recommend him to be an inconsistent.
The 14-year-old Hose is different.
The adolescent has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and recently recognizes that 20 people have not been added in the list of friends.
"This doesn't worry me, because we have something common, music, for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one was in confidence with him and asked his home address or phone number.
"If I would give or require, I just remove them from my account," he admits.
José became the follower of Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
The boy's not a strange experience of what he knows today as a cybermbing.
One of my friends was downloaded into a social network.
He was threatened and earned money.
"He did not know who it was," he assures.
The victim, according to José, did not remove the account.
"There's also involved confidentiality."
Then he explains the follow-up of steps to set up the accounting in a safe manner.
Rather than Horha, this boy would load photos of the acquaintances or confusion situations.
Yeah, I would do this if someone doesn't like me or if I want it.
"I know that it's a cyberbombing," he confirms.
Key Questions
Marilos Porras, an English and education specialist for education and education, believes that in order to send children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of the social networks is to inform.
"Web appeared as a means for information, but with the appearance of these websites, the rules of the game changed," she notes.
Paula indicates that the academic Mark Prensky, the master of the Jelish University and the author of the Digital Organs and Immigrants, has developed these terms to explain this phenomenon.
Digital orrigens are they, children and young people who were born at the time of technology.
"We are digital immigrants who have to teach them while we are still learning," she says.
It explains that this theme is complicated, "for we ask them to have a certain criteria of what we can or can't distribute, publish or speak, when the skin is not enough for this."
"As to be elected, while the most important thing for them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking of the consequences," she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to show that confidence to children and adolescents is to put questions to think about them.
"Give them that they don't do this, it's not useful," she adds.
Then Porras's lists some options: there are things that you wouldn't tell an unconscious person, so why are you doing this on the Internet?
Or would you like to publish your photo like that that you published about your friend?
Do you know that others publish you?
When you sign photos with a party, you're asking to call others to notice them?
And another thing, do we all need to know what you're doing at all times?
Another paragraph is to give them understanding that they should be online as they do this offline.
It's the same rule.
"In the Internet, a person has respect, responsibility and other principles, must also be in social networks", says it.
Responsibility
Estuardo Guardiy, university teacher, professor of primary education and education adviser, explains the need to read the family heads well-being social networks.
In understanding each of the items, they have a good basis for communication with children about the proposals for opening the accounting in the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to distribute or publish it," he said.
According to Gauderya, the key question is to recall the lesson to the children 'not talking to the non-known.
UNUSURD Summit ended without the publication of the Lima Declaration
The Vice-President Summit of the South American Nations (UNSUR) has concluded today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration declared previously and theoretically signed family by compulsory parties.
Ephe has often tried to get access to the document signed at the VI regular meeting of the United Nations Heads of State and Governments, but the sources of the Office and the Administration of the President indicated that it would be transferred after the closure, but then confirmed that it would be published at a certain time on the Peruan Government website.
As regards the text, they pointed out that the content was presented by President Peru, Olante Umala, during short press statements.
The access to journalists on the Samite was still limited.
During the day, only, in the press hall, a video of the President's Assembly without a sound message with the "Closed Meeting, sound prohibited".
A few information that circled among the reporters was transmitted to the press secretariats of some Governments of UNSUR, present at the meeting, but not the Peruian.
The unique document, distributed during the day, was a list of participating Chairpersons, which made it unpleasant to hundreds of journalists from various national and international media, who requested more information.
The President of the Peru has then sent an electronic media communication with the “final declaration” of the Sumite, but it was the statement of Umala, not the official document that the summit was completed.
On October last, Peru accepted the Summit III of South American and Arab countries (ASPA) and, despite the continuing demand of the press, the Lima Declaration was also not distributed as previously declared.
On the official website of the ACPA, you can verify that the document was published on Tuesday.
At the two international meetings, the Peruvian authorities were forced to ensure the transmission of systems for all journalists but were limited to the receipt of information.
The Summit also concluded the joint decision of Chile and Peru to adopt the Hague Court's verifies, which regulates the territorial conflict between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Olant Umala, and Chile, Sebastian Pinecher, gathered at the regional meeting and ratified that they would comply with the decision of the International Court, which began on Monday in Hague to hear the statements of both parties, in the context of the accused accused that Lima had issued against Santiago.
"We will observe and implement a decision that will explain the differences that we currently represent in this international court," said Humala, close to his Chile colleague.
"It was, there was a country that respects international law, peaceful permission of disputes, packages and international courts," added Pineker, and welcomed the slaughter of Umalu's hands on the background of the flags of these two countries.
Reaffirming the two Presidents that they were subject to the International Court, it happened immediately after Colombia protested this week of the Godoth Covenant, which she recognized the submission of the international court ' s credibility after the decision on marine borders with Nicaragua, which she had considered wrong.
The Samite was in the absence of the Presidents of Brazil, Dynamy Ruseph; Venezuela, Ugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirshner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNSUR was suspended since 2011 after his former President Fernando Lugo was not involved in the meeting.
The acceptant President, Oljathan Humala, was responsible for the opening of the debate and for the closure of the Summit, after the midst of Lima.
The Head of the State reads the resulting document reporting that 16 agreements were adopted and was approved by the project for 31 projects among South American countries, the amount of investments proposed was $17 billion.
Among the agreements he mentioned that UNUSUR countries would take “the important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we expand the settlement on the residence place”.
He reported that efforts were taken to improve cooperation against the incertitude of citizens and against organized transnational criminality, to increase access to drugs, uncomfortable access to the Internet in all parts of South America and to take into account the joint and effective risks of natural disasters.
As Europe is in crisis, "The Latin America's economic association should not have a triumphatoral basis, but should serve for the expansion of our productive basis and for the best future for our cities," he added.
"We have decided to provide the privileges of a group of 31 sign projects that will improve the link to South America, particularly in villages and border areas, together with our countries and form new economic schemes," said the Peruian President in a read message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five were related to Peru, and the limitations were limited to the seats on its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two of the largely linked with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details.
The final document also affected the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the election process in this country will serve its re-association to the South American Union," which is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of well-being and peace would be an unity, and a good relationship between neighbours was another theme stressed on its own.
In this sense, President of Colombia, Huan Manuel Santos, said that before starting to the regional meeting, he hoped to meet his colleague from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortegoy, in Saturday in Mexico, in a respectable form of negotiations on marine controversial as a result of the believer of the International Court of Justice.
"A spring (in Saturday), maybe I meet President Daniel Ortegoy," said Santos.
"We can overlook all these ways, and they are not unlikely, including Nicaragua's covenant needs a debate with Nicaragua," he stressed.
" With President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we are doing this maximum possible civilization and respectfully", added Santos.
Santos and Ortega are meeting in the Saturday in Mexico, where they are expected to have the presence of the new President of this country, Enrique Piney Nieto.
In the framework of the Block Ministers Summit, the 2013 Action Plan was also a preliminary meeting, aimed at strengthening the dialogue and achieving the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Haiana, Suriname and Paraguay have been formed by UNNASUR, although the latest participation of the countries has been suspended.
Peru has an temporary presidency in the regional block.
"South America should be taught in Europe in the integration of citizenship": Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a general citizenship is a goal in which South America, in this case, must be learned in Europe.
Correa, who participated in the VI presidential Union of South America (UNSUR), held in Lima, declared the public television of Peru that the Europeans " killed each other during the Second World War" and in other assemblies, "we have now been almost one."
He defended, in this context, the draft establishment of South American citizenship that approve the UNNASUR countries.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country must be achieved as it is already happening with the Andian community, but there are still reaction sectors that want to return to us in the past," he warned.
The Ecuador President also demonstrated himself as a renewing partner of the Organization of American States (OAAA) to reduce the impact of the angloson States and to take into account those signed by the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who read lessons will never take any commitments to themselves, but we, South Americans, are not signing everything.
"We do not explain that the Inter-American Human Rights Commission is in Washington and financed by the United States," he said, on the political rescue given by the Ecuador, the WikiLeaks Julian Assanju Foundation.
Correa assured that it was not complaining of this decision because he did not give up his principles but comply with its “the deep value of democracy and human rights”.
He added that at its time " had certain suspects that Assanja will be extracted in the third country and will not be respected".
He also discovered the Swedish justice for the request to arrive in his territory to investigate a related sexual offence, while "as the Swedish law considered possible to implement it through a videoconference that could be made from the Ecuador Embassy in London".
Correa confirmed that there was a risk of deterioration of the physical and mental health of Asanja.
"I didn't talk to him since he arrived in our administration, but the flight told me that he had a small light problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuador head of the State.
What is really, that is the danger of his physical and mental health due to small-scale invasion without the possibility of air training.
"This affects any person's health," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the refugee issues provided from June to the Ecuador Society in London was addressed by providing inadequacy guarantees that allowed him to go to Ecuador is in the hands of the Great Britain, Sweden and the European Judiciary and stressed the negotiations in London on the search for a solution to the WikiLeaks founder.
We do not conduct negotiations on human rights, that is the word we are not used in this case, but have been permanent discussions.
"The challenge is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European judicial bodies, since the lawyer Asanja, Baltasar Harson, has conducted a number of processes in various European institutions," said he.
And he said that "if the United Kingdom would provide the guarantee of non-conciliation tomorrow, it will be concluded."
And if Sweden, how beautiful it allows her legislation and how she has already done in other cases, will ask Mr. Asanja to the Ecuador Embassy in London or ask him about Skype, the problem will be exhausted tomorrow.
Correa used the case to demonstrate himself as a protector of the freedom of print and stressed that it would not suffer "directionality, non-consciousness and lies that express freedom of expression".
"The major enemy of the freedom of print are not the defects of policy, but the bad journalists supporting lives, loads and demands," he said.
In this regard, he remained pleased that neither these journalists, " neither bankers nor Burundian countries have dominated in Ecuador," and added that, as a re-elected, "a gluubit of revolution to continue development into a faithful direction".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the wind of Paraguay at least until the following elections, arguing that the organization should "we must be strong and not suffered by deporting and supporting macedonian laws", since "the law of the Paraguay Democracy has actually destroyed".
The Ecuador President also said that his Columbia Countries Huan Manuel Santos now had negotiations with Nicaragua on the marine borders between two countries after the decision of the International Court of Justice of Gaga, which was used for the Nicaragua Sea Sovereign.
This decision is not respected at this time.
This is a problem between South America and Central America.
The conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome the desire to go together.
We need to process their communication to overcome them and continue to move forward.
He also expressed the hope of a good conclusion of the controversy on the marine borders, which leads to the same court in Peru and Chile, and said that "the Latin America is right to make an international instance if two countries were bound to decide what serious it would be".
The candidate to the next presidential elections in Ecuador was able to spend on the third term, he pointed out that the opportunity was to consider "with great optimism and joy, although it sometimes is very difficult".
Correa assured that if it was playing for elections in February 2013, it would leave a public life.
Personally, I was never interested in the authority, but in injustices such as Ecuador, social and economic poverty can only be corrected by political authorities.
"My political movement felt that I guaranteed this reliable victory, so it must be recognised," said he.
In the case of victory, this would be my last time in the position of the President, and then we go out of the public life.
If we lose, the same thing is.
"This is a decision," he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned the new course of treatment by the President of the Venezuelan Ogo Chavez in Cuba.
I just talked to the Venezuelan Vice-President Nicholas Maduro, who told me that he went to the treatment already planned, rutinal, and that he expects to lose the campaign to return to Cuba.
“It does not mean the deterioration of the health status of President Chavez,” he explained.
Head of the Ecuador State has participated in Lima, the sixth Heads of States and Governments of South America (UNSUR), which has concluded with a greater regional integration to maintain progress, equality and security.
AIDS death today is the late diagnosis results
Fabrico was 21 when he announced that his analysis on AIDS was positive.
"My looks like it," he remembers that difficult, despite the whole physician tac, moment.
Young people hide this from their family.
When he decided to have a single disease, he wanted to know about her as much as possible, and his efforts were justified - he has already noted his 43th birthday.
Fabrico is one of the "ancient" patients of the HCV hospital civil de Guadalajara Hospital (HCG), where he was in 1994.
He lives with the "Human Immunodeficit virus" (HIV) for 22 years, and in the early 90s it would be difficult to believe - too little therapy options were too few, too little known about illness, too predicted.
Yes, even the Director of Clinics of the Mexican Institute of Social Protection did not want to intercepte with him "for he had a smooth."
In other words, there was a condemnation at the time of AIDS.
Maybe you can survive with this symptom and do this, not the worst quality of life.
However, not known about their disease, many people still come when virus has been damaged, the immune system has been struck and suffered from reporting infections.
Up to 31 years after the world’s AIDS, at least after the first declared cases, "the greatest achievement at this time is that the survival of a patient that begins timely treatment and the survival of the population in exactity of the same person," stated the head of the HCG, Haimee Andrew Villianaeva, referred to that information was confirmed in April of that year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectionist and expert on HIV/AIDS, Andréda Vilnyanaeva explained that since 2008, the scientists found that AIDS is not a conspiracy, but the sustainability and quality of life depended on the impact of the immune system in patients at the start of the diagnosis, with the best expected life of life in those who do not use drugs: to 30 years of age of 200 CDs and to 50 years when reported about 500 CDs.
Only say, the above means that a person who receives HIV-positive diagnosis in the age of 25 years, according to the terms " retaining control can live without a problem to 75 years of age," he explained.
In order to assess this progress, it should be reminded that the life of the Mexicans today is a average of 76 years.
Although mortality has been significantly decreased in the past years, in Mexico, the number of people died from AIDS, from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAUDS annual report) also is true, and 60 per cent of patients died from the time of AIDS in the national database.
Only 255 people died in Kalifornia in 2011, and 187 deaths have already been registered before that year; however, there is a total access to antiretroviral prepatriation since 2005.
- Why are there any annual exits still now?
- Personally, I don't think the problem is in access to treatment.
So I'm representing it, so that's the case in our hospital.
As at least the last 12 years we had no deficiency in medications, the problem is that patients come very late because they don't know their identification state, i.e. in the later stages of disease.
He reported a devastating data: "There are two of the ten patients when they have some deportive infection; what they need to do to make a greater impact on the general mortality, so that the diagnose is in the early stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide a loss to discover mass-scale, for all people who ask it."
In his proposal, specialists and officials of the State of the AIDS Protection Council in Khalisco (COESIDA), as well as patients, such as the Fabricio, who had been asked to check in a private lab, which was only convicted for his friend and, despite his young age, he had already been at the stadium of AIDS and even suffered from the slaughter of Kaposhi, the cancer surgery, which is one of the distributed complications.
Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die, and they don't want to know.
"I'm still going to die, better I'll get three times a week," they say, but not in my case.
There are positive changes, I care well, do training, taking medicine.
To this day, his parents only know that he's transferred to cancer.
I'm living in a normal life like any other.
"I'm working, I have a lot of jobs, I'm traveling, conducting an active sex life, but with a comprehensive responsibility, I'm worried about myself and another person," he reported Fabricio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO in order to submit his statement by those who now, in the context of the World Day of AIDS, are afraid.
Please check if there is a risk of infringement, let them know whether they are HIV-positive, so better, and if they are already diagnosed, let them know that they can live like any other person who are responsible.
This report resumes the topic of combating AIDS in 2012.
Conserves for Application
A large departure between health programmes and simple citizens believes Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, has been addressed to the problem related to HIV.
And this is the biggest prophylactics.
In the places dedicated to this task, "we have actually increased the dissemination of preserves before us one or two, now they give us a hundred packages, and that's very good, but it's showing that there's no one who still has a reserve access," he said.
Adolescents are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"Why are you?" This is a popular question, with awareness and condemnation, of social workers, school advisors, appeal staff and health workers who did not want to hear youths to propaganists.
I propose to change this inefficiency distribution, not only for instruments, but also for hundreds of them in local toilets that are often visiting young people.
This is not promoting dismissivity.
This is not a drink payment and a motel, and he answered the Governor Emilio Gonzalez when he asked whether a reserve could be paid in his leadership.
"This is not sexuality, better to preserve available for those already practiced sexual activity," he noted.
Key data in Khalisco
13.435 summary cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
The State is the 4th national rating on the new and summary cases of AIDS and the 13th HIV.
92 per cent of infections are sexually, 6 per cent through blood and 2 per cent to the primary road.
Assessed that 500,000 people can live with HIV, as one registered case has 4 to 5 persons that do not know about it.
In view of the ratification of the appeal Court of the United States, decisions which denied the restructuring of the Vitro Group through the competitive production in Mexico, the scenarios establish an annual precedent for any national company with the branches in the neighbouring country that has problems with payability.
It seems that the procedures in support of the survival of companies authorised by Mexico are not effective in the country of land and stars, in contrast with international agreements.
In a practical area, endorsing the decision made by the judge Harlin Hayle on 15 June in the court of the Northern Texas Banks, the Mexican companies remain unprotected before the possibility of arresting their property on the part of the Rio Grande.
However, the decision opens the doors of the leading manufacturer in Mexico to treat the Supreme Court of the United States, providing three incompliances.
As an entry, while the judge notes that creditors should be regulated by the United States Banking Code, the Appeal Court of the Fifth District in New Orlean states that the main proceedings relate to the competitive production considered in Mexico.
The first paragraph underlines the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of transnational profile incapacity.
Indeed, the United Nations Standard Act on the Integration of International Trade Law, defined as the arbitrator of the United States Law Institute.
Secondly, the verification states that without interferenced vote acknowledged in the critical mass of competitive debt production that had been before the maternal subsidiary of Vitro, the majority of the restructuring company would have been achieved.
However, this possibility is recognised by the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro was not the first case when the scheme was adopted.
There are twenty-four examples of Agremex and Commercial Mexico, whose inter-first debts guaranteed the Federal Institute of Competitive Productions.
It is also true that the voice of the branches, as well as the other creditors of Vitro, who were fighting against him in the United States courts, namely the funds of “assistant” like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited would not be achieved by most.
It would be 45 per cent against 37.
The appeal Court shall derogate these data.
On the other hand, he accused Vitro in a complicated situation with which since 2008 began a serious economic crisis that reached the United States, has been attacked by the country.
As long as the family company of Gonzalez Sad condemns the decision in the appeal court to reach the vote to his plenary, it is, five judges, because only three were declared.
In the case of failure, a certification request is required to revise the process from the Supreme Instance Court, in this case of the United States High Court.
It is all that the Court rejected the document submitted by the Government of Mexico in the role of amicus curiae, which describes the process that Vitro should be under the Competitive Production Act, signaling that he is free of compliance with the agreements signed by both countries to link it with article 15 of the United States Banking Act.
Furthermore, it is noted that the country has been subject to the principles of the United Nations International Trade Commission, namely, the rules laid down in the case of intergovernmental incapacity, which guarantee equality for debts and creditors.
Carmbol from two ships: they shoot in Vitro and shoot in the country.
General balance
In view of the complaints placed on the table by Mexico de Aviation against the former company, Gaston Astarraga Andrade, who was accused of the Moshnic Office, has already found a botanical snake of the Aviation Pilot Association.
The Instance, invocated by Carlos Diaz Chavez Morino, just submitted a criminal case against the National Bank Commission and valuable Bugs, which is accused to prevent justice.
According to that, the Supervisory Authority systematically refused to provide reports to the General Prosecutor of the Republic on operations carried out by the entrepreneur to extract from the trust fund of F/589 bank of IXE 198 million weight, on behalf of Mexico Airlines.
Resources would be intended to purchase a professional management company.
Ascarraga Andrade is the main sharer of the Posada hotel network.
Surrounding Dragon Mart
Meaning on weekly forums at the Caribbean University, a group of local and immigrant ecologists, scientists, businessers and the general civil society has approved the establishment of a wide front to oppose the opening of Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We tell you, as you know, about the Giant Seller and Distribution in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean products of the isolated country, with a neighbouring area for staff of 150 companies.
Anciently, Canacintra was able to associate South-East Governants to oppose monetary forces that have compared with the land of the protected territory and posed serious threats to the industry.
ACTA death
The Government ' s critical rejected demand to explain the conditions and circumstances of the Mexican Ambassador in Japan signed the Trade Agreement on Contrattafaction, known as an Aboriginal to the English ACTA, in accordance with the Mexican Industry Institute, this case has already been archived.
As you know, the action has been done, despite the disabled senate itself to consider it as a violation of the freedom of expression in social networks.
Homex in a long-term perspective

Investment in this area exceeds $1.5 billion.
Hector, Reese: "Basketball was my life."
Hector Hetin Rees, a swimming basket, was more than 60 years old with the sport and, thanks to it, traveled to the whole world.
A little in Porto Rico is in the memory of so many battery stories as Hector Haytin Reese.
Before the blood in the brain had shocked it to the disabled skill in 2008, Reyes was shocked in sport for more than 60 years as a player of small categories, the High Backetball League, a complete and leading BSN and the President of the Bacillus Federation.
"I have played a lot of roles in the basketball during my life, including several times as I was President of BSN, the Director-General of the National Team and the President of the Federation in the 1990s," reminds Reyes during the first hour visit to him in Bahama, where he lives with Isaac, his faithful husband over 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reese does not overcome the approval.
His homes, nearly all the photos and memories gathered for his duty ways, prove to this.
Bymon in the Heart
With the most emotions, he keeps those who remember his way through Kubow, starting from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when his 15-year-old statement was performed in the role of the Co-Agent or the contract agent.
"These were my best years that I enjoyed most because I had the opportunity to be part of the eight Cuban Championships since 1967 as a agent, co-agent or leader.
There were many years of joy, including five championers from 1971 to 1975.
And then I have been assigned to one in 1981, in the year of Jerome Minesy in the BSN.
Since that time, the leader was "Couco" Ortis, who was the large administrator," said Reyes.
I remember that Jim Barts, who sent here and was in the Alabama University, said to me, "I have a very strong game for you, a growing 6'7."
"Do you think?"
And it was the beginning of Minsy, one of the best players that were in Porto Rico.
The bars then recommended the Ramond Gauss snake, who received citizenship and became one of our best bombs.
I remember what he said if Minsy would bring the Baymon Championship, Gauss would help get one more.
The Championship of Kubov and Gauss, but at the distance I was already, because in 1988, the Federation Chief had already been referred to.
At that time, I would like to enjoy his achievements and achievements in the National Collection.
I remember how we won the first time in the United States during the Olympic Qualification Tour in Mexico in 1989.
Then Championship of the World 1990, where we received the fourth place, and that should be a bronze if not the Canadian judge who made us to play the final game, said Reyes.
And the team with Champion's world in 1990 is the best collection you've ever seen?
She won at Dream Team in the Olympic Games in 2004.
But my favorite was and that with the Pana-American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we wined gold and shooted the U.S. collection, which was very similar to the one we wined for the champion of the world.
The team was not only played again in Mins, Gauss, Ramona Rivas, Phico Lopes and Piculina, but also young people (Harryer), Thonito Colon and James Carter, Leon's brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Khiote' Morales, who had not been able to participate in 90 years of colleague.
The team that might not be the best in the personal composition but brought us gold meal and great joy, was the Olympic Qualification Touring team of 1995 in Neuken (Argentina).
With the role players like Cannito's Nievesa, Pablo Alisa and the young Rolando Hurrouitner, who were temporaryly displaced by the Panama Championship of Mardel Platt, we wined gold instead of all prognosis.
Who was the best player in Porto Rico?
Without any doubt, it was Picolen Ortis.
His indicators in international tourists are impressed.
Nobody in Porto Rico dominated at this level as Picolen did.
And that's without his carriage in the various degrees in which he played.
Who was the best puertorist?
That's a very complex question.
We had a very good young man, including Julio Thoro, Flore Melandes, Carlos Morales, Raymond Darmau, Armendito Torres.
From young people, I like Leo Arilla's work.
What do you think your primary achievement in the Federation?
Participation in the most glorious period of the national collection between 1988 and 1995, and that at the beginning of the 1990s, the BSN had reached 17 teams in the season.
What'd you do?
There were things that I wanted to implement, for example, the regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, to play the ponce boys only in their area and only against the team of other parts of the island in the Ocean National.
Now, the people are traveling and playing too much, and that's a good thing.
At least, I see the fruits of the compulsory certification and courses for management, officers and judges.
This gives me joy.
What are you doing now?
More I'm listening to music, looking at the music videos of my epoch at YouTube, enjoying my necks, and smelling the basket machines.
And of course, I enjoy my partnership, Ihabelle, who was always with me.

Larry Hagman, born 21 September 1931 in Fort Walte, Texas, was worldwide known as John Ross Young, who was known as J.R., in the television "Dalles" in which he worked without principles, bad and manipulative businesses.
Larry Hagman, whose role of a smooth magnetian James Ar Yuning in the Dallas television was a symbol of pregnancy in the 1980s, died.
He was 81.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new "Dallas" season, died on Friday night because of cancer complications, according to the statement of the family provided for the Associationed Press Company of Warner Bros.
"Larry returned to his favorite town, Darlas, again playing a marking role that was more liked to him," said his family.
The family Larry and the closest friends were with him in Darlas on the earmark for the Thanksgiving Day.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his mate in the original series and sykwell, was close to Hagman, when he died in the hospital of Darlas, said her representative Jeffrey Lane.
He offered the joy of all those who knew him.
He was creative, pleasant, pleasant, and talentous, and I will miss him very much.
"He was original and lived in full life," reaffirmed Grey in the statement.
Hagman had been diagnosed in 1992 and admitted that he had drinked for many years.
In 1995, he has found a malnutritional sugar in the powder and transferred transplantation.
For a long time before Darlas, Hagman acquired television with the role of a slightly sort of "I Dream of Jeannie", translated by the NBC channel from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, astronaut whose life changes when he met a pleasant Jenna girl that plays Barbara Hind, and began to live with her under a sweet.
He also was the main two commodities that were rarely appearing in the eternal, The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the film included a well-adopted role in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But his master interpretation, J.R., brought Hagman to the top of the glory.
The drammatic CBS channel series on the Yunting cluster and other persons in its environment went from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan "Who shot J.R.?", designed to create a shock around the episode, a full emotion in which Hagman's personality has not killed, generated international discussions and millions of dollars risked in the Buckmecker Contractors.
This also helped to join the recursion audio series at that time.
When the response was received to the episode of November 1980, the average of 41 million terrorists looked at it and turned the "Dalles" into the second exhibition of the development program in the history, after the finance of the "MASH" in 1983, which was attracted to 50 million.
It was J.R., Christine, who shooted in him.
J.R. drove her and then threatened her that she would be accused of prostitution if she didn't leave from the city, but others also had reasons to attack it.
Hagman played the Young as an unfair corruptioner with a calibratic smile: an injurious entrepreneur and unfaithful husband who wanted to have his marriage mate, Sue Ellen (Lind Grey) to be treated.
"I know what J.R should be on the snake." He said in 1988.
It must be said, "I'll be a real citizen J.R. Ying."
It's the only thing he lost.
Victoria Princepal, also the hero of the original series, recalled the Hagman, on Thursday, as some of the "fright and out of the screen".
He is forgotten to forget millions of readers throughout the world, and in the hearts of each of us who have been able to know and love him.
Decade new "Dallas" episodes were shown a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The record of five episodes of the second season and sixth season has already been completed, reported to the channel.
Warner or TNT did not make a statement that will be with Hagman's serial.
Fort Wart, Tehas, was a son of actors and peaks of Mary Martin, who was close to classic events such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still adolescent when he was born in 1931 during her marriage with a lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried happiness in the New York Teatra scenes at the beginning of the 50s, and then served in the United States from 1952 to 1956.
When he came there, he met a young Sweden artist May Axelson and married her.
There were two children, Troston and Haidi, and they lived in the Kalifornian city of Malibu, where many famousities live.
In 2001 he called his memories "Hello Darlin": Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life."
"I didn't include anything that would seem to be able to cause anybody pain or affect them anyway," he said Prince Association at that time.
After the transfer, he began to promote the donation of organs and worked as a volunteer in the hospital to help patients experienced fear.
"I will give them advice, giving them to shut up and meet them when they go to the operation, and afterwards," he stated in 1996.
I'm trying to propose some comfort, like: "Do not be afraid, it's a little uncomfortable for a short time, but you're gonna be fine."
He was also actively speaking against smoking and participating in several campaigns.
It's starting a course to investigate the King of Light
Each week, students are investigating aophalyptical revelations such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
In this seminar, when Professor Stuart Charme decided to read about the end of the light, he knew that he had an outstanding impairment: the end of the "good back-related" calendar of May, 21 December, for which many people were cut off as evidence of the end of the light.
But Sharme did not realize that he was expected in the nearest couple of months: a catastrophic uragan Sandy, a financial crisis that some were called "dogharmeddon", and a growing conflict in Israel, where Christian theories of the end were believed that Apocalypse begins.
"I did not realize that this would be the most appealing seminar of all," she said this week to the University of Ruthgers-Camden (New Jersey).
If analyzing what happens in the world today, as if we had only 30 days, it was really a good time.
And remember that it's good for those who have an appealistic way of thinking.
And he is not the only professor who offers courses to the theme "the end of the light" in this seminar, theoretically last in history.
In the Timple University of Professional Advocate, Barry Waker reads the course of the “Autority of Mass Information, Cultural and the End of Light”.
Each week, students are investigating the pharmaceutical topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and bacteria, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas are being distributed in time," he said, "and how to propose hypothetical scenarios that cause certain human effects.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, the war could be disappeared.
In that month, students analyzed the films on pharmaceutical topics and studied how they focused on examples of real life.
"I tried to tell students what maybe it may be impossible," said Vaker.
In the main campaign of the University of Pennsylvania, the history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Ammar Solari, the professor of art and anthropology, were joined to read a course called simply the King of Light.
"We don't add '2012' to have the opportunity to read the course again, if the end of the light doesn't begin," said Restall.
Despite the "minimous destruction" students should learn, prepare projects and produce resultal reviews.
In the Penn State, the final examination will be taken in the Apocalypse Canon, which does not leave students to a different election, except to work " until the night in which the end of the light will be expected, " said Restall.
Kurses were very popular.
"The Hour has been finished for two hours," said Restall about his course for students with a high-medium bal at which 35 students were recorded.
We received e-mail communications for many weeks before the seminar of people who asked whether there was a place.
The students, in their own way, assured that this course is one of the most interesting ones.
"I like to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridge Robinson, 23-year-old student of the Division of Religious and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Ruthgers-Camden.
And the appeal philosophy of thoughts, light or religious, is only the question of comfort or absence.
Will Bekess, a 25-year-old student of psychology and sister affairs, said that he had regarded all pharmaceutical films.
"I never heard about the course I would do this," he noted.
I like him.
But none of the students asked - no longer say about the professor - said he believed in the date of the end of December 21.
"Our first project has affected Maya's prophecy, and in some kinds we dismissed it," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student at the Timple University of West Chester.
Maya never predicted the end of the light; it is just a key moment in the calendar, said Restall.
But he noted that there is an appealistic concern in the Western culture, which takes into account a few centuries, where people respond to changes around themselves, predicting the end of the light.
The Internet calls for increased the speculations.
"In other places people don't think about it," he said.
Previous in the English world.
Joseph Daghetti, Professor of the University of La Sal, who offers courses to the Philippins this year, quickly responded to the question of whether he knows if he was a course of “the end of the light” there.
"The Philippines do not participate in the end of the light," he wrote, as a result of the allocation of the above instance.
We've got a mistake from Dad.
Restalle pointed out that for a long time it was spoken about many days of the last court, and said that if nothing happens 21 December, "the people will start thinking about the next date" or philosophyms that the 21 December was the beginning of the seventh year, after which the world ends.
Students and providers are safely related to that date.
Some say they're going to go to "the end of the light."
"I may be calling someone from friends to meet together," said Samura Ford, a 20-year-old student of the Connection School.
