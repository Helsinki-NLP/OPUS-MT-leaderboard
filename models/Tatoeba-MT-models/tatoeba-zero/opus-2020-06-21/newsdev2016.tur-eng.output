Norwegian Rafisk: Is this the most funny fish of the world?
Norwegians raises five million people's highest standards of life, not only in Europe, but in the world.
Can the secret of the country's success be connected to the local workplace with some slow fishing?
Take the last time the sweeper choice.
Put these in the midst of a smooth futbol.
Let me leave a week.
Now, one of the big Norwegian sweet smells that are drugd.
I'm in the small Fagernes city, about three hours away from Oslo.
There's a slightly sweet, and that smell is always in the air.
Rakfisk is slow and water - depending on how funny fish you love - it is forecast until one year.
When it was dark and cold, the Norwegians will be assembled here for this most magnificent evening festival.
He said, "Havard Halvarsen, you'll be able to smell this flower and then a barbecue."
People around us eat small fish cups and smell in a lot of drinks.
Havard says, "Though people love aquavit more than Rafisk."
He can kill the smell.
I'm thinking some parts.
If you can escape from swiming under your shock, it's not bad – it's not a little long bus swimming language after.
Rakfisk Norwegian is a very different product of water and slow-scale times in the beaches that fishes do not pass in the morning.
Then when they are firmed in the darkness, they will be able to get out, and – with the uncertainly dispersed sounds – are new.
Only thousands of Norwegians were difficult to leave countries, mostly flew to the United States.
Now it grows speed by the people - more than 13 jobs, high-scale, and immigrants from a powerful view system.
The former snake and soon people are swimming to work in Swedish, a more richer than Norwegian.
Rakfisk represents something important, but if Norwegia's past is a little funny, it's a part of life.
Between the most precious food you can get.
But everything's precious -- you're gonna give a small barb or a sandwich £9 ($14).
Norwegia is often not coming to the world news -- and most people like that.
The people here are asked to be discussed in the name of Anders Brevik, a healthy root that killed men, women and children in the past 77 years.
Instead, it's called "the event of 22 July".
Norwegians are difficult to believe that in peace countries they can do such an innocence and murder.
Norwegia has now grown from the beginning of the 1970s from one of the largest oil and gas industry in the world.
Our garson says, "But it is not the only reason why we're so good to be so good, is that we're not the only reason to be so good."
As you say, we are a great people.
English, most people here are perfect.
We're not too exhibitors, we're not liked to be slaughtered.
Norwegian oil wealth is very carefully directed — in addition to a small percentage of the money from the industry, all are a special background for the benefit of the future items.
In the years of the world's global crisis, others slowly swallowed the shoes of the Norwegian shoes.
"We're happy as long as we can shut the light and write the mountain walk," says Anna.
"And raphisk eat," he swears with a peaceful sweet.
I'm standing in the cart and I'm waiting for something to eat - I'm going to eat enough.
Now, a hamburger is certainly something different and a more awesome.
But the night's more than that sweet fish.
One of the county mechanisms that arrange the Rafish night's dinner, here are the best ladies -- and maybe the most hardest of this is -- they're playing the fish.
There's a living television connection on a server with the Rakfisk tables.
It's like an Eurovision song.
How many points do you have for the best fish in the mountains?
"We're here, Havard."
The shops, they've got cakes.
A man slows from the sandalees, maybe in the effect of Aquavit.
Or maybe you're smiling all these fishes.
The Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto faces the start of difficulty
When the new President of Mexico is ready to pass through the Enrique Pena Nieto office, it looks at the difficulties that Will Grant faced with the BBC, and the people's disagreement expectations.
It's particularly bad now in Mexico's traffic.
In the best times of a cities, a variety of major routes from Tuesday has been caused by a variety of people in the streets of caos.
But the purpose is not preventing people to go to work, but preventing protesters to reach the meclis.
On Saturday, the new President of Mexico will take the President of the President of Enrique Pena Nieto and take the task of the government.
He's against a bad mission.
In the government of Felipe Calderon, he had a good practice from Mexico's economic opening, but in the control of a drug war which was slaughtered by 60,000 deaths in six countries.
Mr. Pena Nono said this week, the Oval Office of the United States President Barack Obama, "The Mexican people have a great word to decrease the violence of my holiness."
That's why I'll offer a new security strategy to help us reach.
Before Mr. Pena Nono's previous political trial was held in the Mexican park before he was deputy with the US President.
The majority of the surrounding groups, growing in this area, is where new leaders have been divided.
He's a clear man.
For example, the Red Valle del Bravo recalls lovely in the town of Bravo.
The people here are noting that he lived in his home where he lived and created my tube.
You can go from the new cars of Mr. Pena Nieto's, a great development on the changed shooting and all-spot roads.
In addition, the platelets that move their name are out of the modern sport centre and the influential climate changes of the modern sports centre.
"We're looking at him to bring real and permanent changes," says Mr. Pena Nono's friend and political advisor Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a local Congress member of the PRI party.
In particular, we hope that we need a very interesting and real change from our country from security and economy.
After 81 years of decline, Vicente Fox was deleted in PRI 2000.
The Congress member Olvera admits that it was very waiting for Enrique Pena Nieto for 12 years outside the presidential Chamber of Los Pinos.
And the war refuses the new president to defeat himself as an outstanding.
A clear man calls himself with a wonderful country vision.
It's a wonderful state man and a man who knows listening to all.
But this is not the idea that many people have about the former elections.
The city was known as Nezahualcoyotl, who was known as Nezahualcoyotl, could not be more focused on the park streets of Valle del Bravo.
A banking area of Mexico City on the top of their cars.
And the problems in the pool are hard and urban.
This year, armies were called to help combat drugs in the parks, and more violently against women.
In the two years we've been killed by a large staircase area in a empty part of the neighborhood, the body of women was taken.
During his judge, Mr. Pena Nono was killed more than 1,000 women in Mexico, and that's much more than the city of Ciudad Juarez, who is known with the murders of the famous women.
He says that women couldn't run enough to the murder while they were in the best position of Mr. Pena Nieto.
The worst way, they are accused of coming from seeing his rule.
In a typical beton house in the coast, Irènea Buendia's girl's photos of Mariana Luna is trying to fight with the age of age.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana murdered in 2010.
But he believes his family was killed by a partner.
"When I went home, it was like the body was burned." Senora Buendia.
There was a look that showed that he was struggled, and the death's slaughter began from a long time.
When his mother tells his story again, she looks down from a picture wall of Mariana, with one word on it, just.
But that's what he said that this family was completely disfellowshipped.
The local authorities treated me as an old dictator, a problem, a slaughter.
What they want to say is that they simply accept and shut up the rings.
"But it doesn't be true when there's so strict and illness."
The President of the Pena Ono Saturday comes with the responsibilities of the bird.
For ten thousands of families we passed in six years, he had affected violent crimes in Mexico and promised to give them a priority during the new President's mission.
The first Congress member Olvera says, "I'm a president as I hope it's. "
But this is the most fearful families of the victims in Neza in the city.
The defenders claim that Bradley Manning didn't condemn the bad behavior.
The defenders are trying to fight the ideas of using Bradley Manning's bad use.
Warning, Manning's staying in the military prison in Virginia.
The Defense Manning wants to close the case with the need to be incarcerated.
There are thousands of secret documents in the army.
On Sunday, the Defenders decided that the army of Bradley Manning, who was accused of the biggest secret material attacks in the United States history, was struggling to condemn some of the ill-treatment claims that he lived in the army.
Ft. Meade Maryland's conversation in the case of Master, who asked Ashden Fein Manning, showed that, while the officers in Quantico, Virginia remained in nine months, and the visits weren't shown an inquiry about the bad treatment of the records of their visits.
A day later, when he expressed the murder of Manning's case, with the need that he was slaughtered in the celestial, and so much punishment was taken by Maning to end the case.
The army arrested in Haziran in 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents in Iraq as a mission.
The material was later published by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning's source of information.
In the afternoon, Fein studied the forms of the offices filled with Manning after the meeting with Manning since June 2010 to Nisan 2011, when he was arrested by a higher prison penalty.
The officers reported the questions to Manning and reported the answers.
When he asked about the forms of the Fein Summit, he reported that the acts made by the Manning gardens were "member" and that all the actions of the test were "so much professional."
The forms don't show a skilled behavior, but the officers ask for the Maning's conduct right, Fein.
Manning gave the answer that they did not store the matters, and they talked about the concerns of the visitors and told them that they would be able to control them.
Manning said: "If you do not mean that you do not bring anything to it."
He asked why the judge Denise Lind de Manning wasn't infringed to investigate the cases of murdering in the last few months during the October 2011 meeting.
He answered that the terms of the Manning Meeting were "the prevention of the shift" were discarded.
The army told him to protect him and others, that the murdering overseer was a sixth stage of the murder.
"I wanted something to know what I was, and I wanted to get out of the state of the POI... to remove a quality of life from my eyes, "Manger said.
Manning Pershore was arrested in Iraq and expressed the transfer of Kuveyt, about about two months before he was transferred to the military prison in Virginia, the Marine Base Quantico.
He said he was thinking of the murderer at the Kuviert and heat, once he liked there.
He said he wouldn't let him know what he was in the foreign world.
"My dog was buried to Camp Arafjon," said Manning Pershore.
I thought I would die in that coffee.
Manning said, when he went to Quantico, most of the days, at least 21 hours and more than 23 hours, passed in a small cell alone.
Manning said only a bed, a bathroom, a leg, a little clothes and the eyes were given.
He said he was trying to smell in the day, and he was swept in the rules.
Manning always said he was sleeping out of the cell.
When the guards returned to the night, he said he hadn't seen her face and said he had returned.
The lawyer of Manning was officially in charge of the acts made to Manning in October 2011.
Manning Nisan, 2011, moved to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas military prison.
At the same time, he asked the judge Manning on the Sunday of Persians about a idea that it was difficult to sleep in the Quantico cell a night, a number of guards and other prisoners were difficult to stop shutting in a morning.
At my number, Manning expressed that he wasn't given the opportunity to strike with the battle.
On the next day, the judge told him that he had to take a manning garden's order to take him out of the order, but no one would have ordered to shoot him.
Manning Pershore explained that it was hard to sleep on the night before, because it was not dangerous for her.
Manning said he did not do that by using the smuggling snake or the legs.
Manning declared that that night the drinking snake, the fingers, and the eyes were taken from the cell.
The lawyers hope that at least the case of the lawyers will decrease the tests of prison and that the military court expected to be executed in the beginning of the next year would be decreased.
He said that the Defense Manning plans to accept the crime in smaller crimes and to fight against a lot of painful crimes.
The holding was planned to continue in the weekend, and the defenders are waiting to discuss the issue that the situation is guaranteed.
Pentagon Manning indicated that all the maximum rules in Quantico were properly undertaken in the courts.
Those who are opposed to Manning, helping the enemy, publishing the public in a wrong way on the Internet, communicating national defence information, and you're inadequate or registered.
If it's slaughtered from all the possessions, it's likely to be in prison.
Mexico's identification crisis
Many people say it's difficult to get away from Mexico because of the weakness of the opportunity here.
The Mexicans are on the shift, they remember the difficult times to the Mexicans,
The Navarrette says that the Mexican Americans are shocking between two worlds.
I was in the field of migration in a nearby street I made to Mexico City, and I came back to the surprise.
The workshops shown two points: one for the Mexicans, for the other "Extranjeros" for the Germans.
I stopped there for a few seconds, I didn't know where I'm going.
I was called "Mexican" during my whole life because I was grown in the center of California.
In this ethnical stage, my friends in Boston say they say "Irlands" or my friends in New York say "Itlanian".
Then I decided in Mexico.
But, this was Mexico.
And my grandfather did not need a stenoa or a stereo.
I was so American.
I'm talking in Spanish, so I'm better to control both sides of a meeting in this language.
But I don't have local words, and I can't save from the American point.
That's why I got my US passport, and I passed for Extranjeros.
I remembered that when I visited the White House to meet Enrique Pena Nono President Obama this week.
Like two leaders of countries in the day, they are always meeting: sky, drugs, and trade.
Pena Nono and Mexico were encouraging to talk about the growth of Mexico's economics, which is the cause of remaining in Mexico as soon as they were trying to enter the United States now.
The United States and Canada wants to be a partner and create a trade flower in North America in the way of the European Union.
Pena Nono hasn't suggested anything, but he sweared that the Mexican drug cards would continue to fight.
The United States are insufficient and inconsistent.
Most Americans probably had never thought that in 1848, the United States had deployed Mexico, and their leaders had difficulty to give half of the lands to the hardship.
But not in minutes, but in some centuries, the Mexicans are all the place.
That's why you're starting to hear the expertise of the American neighbourhood of the United States in Mexico press and elites.
And Montezum's kids go to the war.
And yet, it is a really difficult relationship for Mexico in the United States with more than 35 million mexican Americans.
Do you want to talk about the emotions that are insufficient?
There's a lot.
The winners and losses in Mexico have people who have created the opportunity of the country.
The only reason for life in the towns like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that a person in a smooth point, maybe a house or a large house, must be left out of the possibility in Mexico.
And mostly this person is sleeping a profile -- ten, less educational, a poor village.
We are their seeds, and We believe them.
It's not Mexico.
And if we live in the American Rule now, we've never seen what we've been going to go to the good schools and what we've been finding good work, not Mexico.
Our identity may sometimes be undefined, but our loyalty is clear.
It's the United States.
We also realize that most of the Mexican leaders are not loved by us.
This feeling is coherent.
They're seeing us as a reminder of a sweet innovation, and they're looking at us like we've been a high group not enough in Mexico.
Our Spanishs will never be enough enough, our bonds and Mexico aren't too strong.
Our existence is about the complete failure in their eyes.
Our family wouldn't have gone if they couldn't have failed in Mexico.
And now we didn't find ourselves down behind the loss, but we could live good in the United States but yet lost spirits.
When they came to the United States as a legal marriage in Guadalajara, they remembered that they were more common to me who they were the Mexicans, and that the Mexican Americans have drinked this because they did not agree between the Mexican and the Mexican Americans.
Despite being an US citizen, he seems to be a part of two countries.
At the same time, most of the Mexican Americans don't feel like the part of them.
We love the Mexican group Los Tigres del Nord and Bruce Springsteen.
You're taking the best ones of the two worlds, but you'ren't in anywhere.
We look like American in Mexico.
We are accepted as Mexico in the United States.
Now, as I learned at the road, some Mexican leaders and some of the ages want to re-interact with Diaspora.
They want mexican Americans to show their interest in the United States as a temporary Mexican "actors".
We're hard to say that it's a beautiful country to visit Americans like us, and the political leaders are to strengthen the links with Mexico.
Yeah.
That won't be.
There's too many feelings of feeling.
And most of us are not sure that there is a wonderful country with equality and respect for drug violence and drug violence.
I'm afraid you're alone.
It's just.
At least some Mexico are not ready to forgive the United States for a half-century centuries ago, then some Mexican Americans have to accept that they still have been able to maintain the conduct of the family members.
Hmm.
Maybe it's more than I think, "We're Mixed."
Ancient wars, New Middle East
It may be an unfair basis for the fireful peace between Israel and Hamas.
May a permanent peace between the Arabs and the Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodcake shows that this hope is empty.
Among the huge debates of whom it was started, it turned into a lot of buildings, more than 140 Philistine and six Israelites to be civilians, and the first time of Gaze, the great city of Israel, Tel Aviv, and the city of St.
However, though the Israelites and the Philistines seemed to have been struck in ancient battles, they change the Middle East around them.
The Arab garden was cut into the air, and it was arrested by the Philippines and the Israelites.
Maybe this makes their fight more blood than the older.
But there are reasons for thinking that they can't get out of their killer.
Whatever the win is a lost war
It seems it's hard to get it right now.
Even if the fires accepted on November 21 continued, the two sides of the week were forced by the war.
Since 2007, the Islamic movement leaders of the Gaze will claim that they have been able to retrace the Israelites, despite Gaze's struggle.
They couldn't destroy Israel Hamas, despite killing some of the leaders and 1,7 million of Gaza's people in one of the world's most struggles and the world's people.
Of course, the other part of Hamas' Philistines's larger groups in Fatah now wins the more medieval Philippines in Western Sheriff.
Moreover, Hamas's leaders can put out the results of the time.
And when the Islamics winned the Arab world, Hamas had strong and rich friends.
That's the purpose of Turkey Hamas, which was resurrected in the most closest Muslim times of Israel, and Katar, one of the most rich and most dynamic areas of the Côte d'Israel.
The joyful Hamas people, a Islamic conspiration around Israel, says that Hezbullah's military party runs to the north of Lübnan, the Islamic ruler, who was able to send the Fifth Esad to Syria, and that Hamas threatened the kings.
Besides all, between the Arab countries in the south-east of Israel, the most important and Egyptian countries, the President of Muhammad Musi, changed the lowest level of the region of the Muslim brothers in Egypt.
In 2011, there was too little time to Hamas, the Mubilik Ombudsman, to direct Egypt for 30 years.
Instead, there's a lot more about the cousins and leaders of the brother Hamas.
In the future diplomacy, Hamas, Israel and America can be defined as an actor that could not be prevented by.
At that time, Israel's guards will make the total outcome.
The soldier was put back to the Hamas box.
Israel's Demir Kubbe proved the value of the anti-fuzzing system and most of Hamas was destroyed.
The Israelites will sleep for a while.
Diplomatically, as far as the United States did, most European countries accused Hamas of starting their last violence.
Besides all, Israel, in particular the main leader of Binyamin Netanyahu, has grown in the rule of Binyamin Netanyahu.
Although the rocks from Gazze since 2004 killed Israel for about 30 people, Israel was cut off from the murderers of the Western Sheriff, which continued to swallow the Jewish places that protect their protecting the Philippines.
Likud party on October 22, Mr. Netanyahu, who joined the more warcraft group of Avigdor loverman.
Why are those false Philistines being shocked by giving their own states?
If they really control the Western Sheriff, they're not gonna fire rocks like they did in Gazze?
It's better for them to keep behind the wall and punish their heads.
Maybe the guards win, but they can change the Arab garden accounts.
If the Islams win in Egypt and other places are very less loved by Israel, it is to fight priorities in their homes.
The defence of Israel is greater than the assembly of the Arab neighbors.
The starting of war with the local super power does not help the new Arab governments to improve the economy.
Mr. Murse worked together with Barack Obama, and maybe they can make the start of something.
The Israelites have to look for a long time.
As the rest of the Arab world is more democratic, the Philippines are struggling from distress rights this week, such as a bus in Tel Aviv, which is an unexpected shooting fleet in the regions under the workplace of Israel.
The pressure in the Jewish government is already cutting democracy and the Arab people grows to democracy.
Every few years, the blood missions against Gazze will be reached in a diplomatic bed.
We need an external encouragement on both sides.
The answers of the two sides have been announced as most of the outdoor world and those in this newspaper: two governments represented the area for the security of Israel.
In short, you're gonna give some more pressure to foreigners that are difficult.
Now, the Jewish government, which has to begin to stop the weapons of Gazze, must be better convinced to have changed the idea of the land and accepting the Middle Flood with the Egyptians, Turkey and Katar in 1967.
Foreign Arabs should be hard to join Hamas and Fatah.
It's more useful to get the vocabulary requests in the BM to create a Filistin State.
Mr. Obama plays a role in bringing Israel to the table.
At the first time, he was wondering to offer his peace plan.
It looks like she wants to get into the White House.
This pain doesn't look like it's a good way.
We've got life-free exits in the Middle East, America.
This means a peace agreement between Israel and the Philippines.
Cigarette packing laws are in Australia.
Tuberculosis warnings and sick organs are placed in salt green boxes for all roof marks
Australia's first laws on smoking and smoking in the world have entered into the shooting, marking logos and colors, generally green swallowing, producing images and sigarettes of sick organs, and children who have been sick.
The only difference between the packages is that it is difficult from Saturday to the same small type of mark names, not only for different health warnings and displays.
It's the largest resignation for the packing of smoking in this world.
Australia's federal government says that youths are shocking to smoke from the shock of shock.
This is based on research that shows that people are never starting to smoking up to 26 years of age 99%.
"Are you can see that even when the age is very small, you can see that the children are trying to sell the smokes on the markets, "for example, the child's work shows that it's a lot of logistics, and that the federal health observer Tanya Plibersek.
Although Australia has the lowest rate of smoking in the world and changes will have a very less effect on the women of many nations, other countries think that they are similar to steps.
They made a hard lob against the laws of the twin industry.
He told the firms that they would support the chest trade, and that they would be more clean and more accessable to cigarettes.
From British American Tobacco Australia, Scott McIntyre said, "It will be the results that are not seriously prevented".
Chinese and Endonesia will bring more of these products to sell in Australia streets.
Others say that the laws are increased.
A small family company, Zico Import Pty Ltd, has led two months ago the silicon swords, to mask packs from Sandra Ha from Sandra Ha, from the British American Tobacco, the Imperial Tobacco in England, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco Australia, almost slowly lost the laws on the high court.
Zico says he's making more than 6,000 sales and waiting for a new stok.
That's a good job for us.
Foreigners say they are the popularity of social media in the demographic design of potential struggling.
A decade of Australian blood was banned television advertisements and sports sponsors, and the majority of soldiers wanted to hide cigarettes from places.
Australia has banned local companies and website advertising, but it couldn't be able to slow the sea sites.
Becky Freeman, the researcher of a people's health research at Sydney University, said, "If you have left this small window only to identify your products, you're the circle where you need to participate in. "
Freeman's brands indicated that they increased the "medium human" research on social media, such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
Is this a civil citizen who really loved Marlboro's cigarettes in the shock of taking video, or has a marketing company in it?
The British American Tobacco Australian industry said that it was able to take up new rules without marketing.
In the world's Ticaret Organization, the industrialists did not say that the Ticaret was unjustly disrupted, despite the importance of trade with Australia, until they were able to read new rules to Ukrainian, and they were able to pay the industry to the Honduras and the Dominican Defense.
A WTO decision is likely to get out in the midst of 2013.
So, if we've been, the government said he did not meet other countries who think that they would like to pack it.
The first country in 2001 was Canada, which makes photo warnings difficult.
Now, these were cut into Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine for more than 40 countries.
In England, New Zealand, South Africa and India, there are more laws.
It reads most of the smokes in Australia.
Images don't affect me.
I'm coming to see them.
When he buys a package with all his legs, Victor El Hage said, "But smoking and put it in place."
If you have to be honest, there's only one reason to leave, that's my little girl.
Sydney said that James Yu's only type of packaging was hard to shoot the ships in the center of Sydney.
Yu said, "I've taken my delivery a hour from the time, now takes four hours."
"I should have been lawful for all things, then, okay, well, we've been finished, we're gonna shut up the store," he said, "and we've got the hands out of the air.
It's so bad to be shocked in a world that is always fascinated
When our aircraft lived mechanical difficulties in this Thanksgiving Day, and when we were waiting for another flight, I wasn't waiting for five hours.
That's how I've been thinking about the angry.
I won't lie to you.
Even if we wait for a half-day flights, books, magazines and iPhones are very intensive (I don't even talk about the sales.)
But some of those who are not academics and children's development experts are awesome.
They say it's normal for us and our children.
The brain is hard to go to interesting tanks, and maybe it increases creativeness.
And most of our screens have to imagine the values of smuggling because we're depending on the other screen.
So we need to open warm open to smell?
Yeah.
And no.
But I'm going back to it.
First, I was thinking that it was a new chair, because I was slower than a lot of people.
In Canada, Peter Toohey, who wrote a Greek and Roman history professor at Calgary University, is not likely.
"Indeed, you have a long history of the slaughter," he said.
There's a Latin wall writing from the first century of Pompeii's walls.
The question is how you're determined to smell.
The problem is that it was identified in many different ways and that it was discussed by Ontario, John D. Eastwood, who is a psicologist at the University of New York in Canada.
After looking at the research literature and put about 100 individual groups in front of the idea, Professor Eastwood and Collections were identified as "No way, but not to be incompatible with pleasant activity".
He said, "The thing that divides from the poorness is that the person wouldn't be engaged."
He said there's no way to do anything in the midst.
He said, "It's an interesting process with the feeling of slow-mode and time slow."
It's like depression.
But Professor Eastwood, which may be, but often people see the problem in the environment or in the world, said people in depression are seeing the problems of themselves.
Sometimes we think we're just trying to be a concentration.
Profesor Eastwood and the associators, published in Psychologic Science Reviews in September, marked an old test of a person who read a magazine of a person reading a article on the work of the participants.
Some groups heard a high-level and non-related television program in the room, others heard that it was very low, but the third group had never heard it.
Those who heard low-level television reported more harder than two other groups, they had had difficulties without concentration, but they were not sure that it was reasonable and related to the difficulties.
One of the writers of the work and one of the nervouss at the Guelph University in Ontario, Mark J. Fenske, who tried to handle a hard or intriguing task, said, "It's a cause of an interference.
When you read something hard from the other side, "It can help you look at the bad machines in one manufacture, so you can't be able to cut your attention from the division."
Indeed, it is possible to enable people to be more physically slowly struggle with it by struggling to be a sign of distress.
"There's showing that the children who have allowed to be moved have learned more than children who are able to stop movement, and have more information on them," said Professor Fenske.
We all imagine the difficulty in some points, the late flight, the monotone, a slight movie.
But somebody's in a more delicate way than others.
For researchers, in 1980, developing a "Durch Exploration" range.
It's like, "The majority of the things I have to do, and the monotone, and I have a lot of interest in, I don't have time to do anything."
Stephen Vodanovich, professor at the University of West Florida, found that researchers were more slower towards the needs of more and more outdoor needs of the girls, especially for the girls.
However, generally, there is a very poor group in the boyfriend.
In 1991, Professor Reed Larson, in the Illinois University of Human and Social Development, tried to communicate about 400 boys and children through the computer through seven eight times a day.
32 percent of men found that they were slow in school and payment, but 23 percent were not in school.
On the other hand, they told the grandparents that 3 percent of them were cut off.
Professor Larson said that 21 years later he didn't know that the percentage of slowers would be lower.
But he said he knew that he wasn't controlled about what they wanted to do.
That's why I'm back to my first question, is it good for people to be disappointed?
Sometimes no, because investigations are decreased in a way of declining humans in the physical risks of hair playing, or use in materials.
On the other hand, Professor Vodanovich, who works more than two decades, discusses the connection between philosophs and writers.
Gary Marcus, a psicological professor in N.Y., said, "It's the way to tell you that your brain should do anything else."
But the brain doesn't know what's going on.
If you're disappointed, and if you use this energy to steal and eat, it'll be happy.
But if you look at the television, this can be happy in a short-term, but it's not in a long way.

No Senaryo for the New Marihuana Act in Colorado
Anthony Orozco, 19th, faced a district university students and football players in Colorado nearly in the area of accusing that it would be lawful: a few parts of marihuana and a swimming pipo to drink it.
One day in September, Mr. Orozco said he and his friends were stopped at Lamar, near the Kansas border.
After the police's officer found marihuana in the car, Mr. Orozco took a call for the $100 small crimes, the transportation and the drug tool, and he was given to the court's history.
"We were treated as a criminal," said Mr. Orozco.
But is that one?
In the uncertain weeks, the question of a hundred hundreds of small drug cases in the case of Colorado's pleasant use is depending on the question of the law of the small marijuana for the purpose of the use of the Colorado.
For centuries of criminal marihuana cases are closed in Washington, which accepts a similar congress.
Police units were 21-year-old and adults in the past weeks, the laws were left to be sentenced to take a small degree that would be legally accepted.
However, in Colorado, the defenders pleaded to carry out the cases of marihuana in a decision-making way, and calling for a court for the reason to move people.
At the same time, a number of new cities from Denver banks have been used to prevent the opening of marihuana’s license in the regions of the West Gulf.
The police chief Daniel J. Oates said, "I don't know what's going on to happen."
The editors in Washington are cut off their heads.
And they're looking for the last manufacture, vision, distribution, and sale of license systems of license.
It's like, or first, that's how Colorado uses me, now, most of them say that it's before the divorce of marihuana in the pleasant use.
Brian E. Smith, Washington Dictionary of Control, said, "They have a more regular price, so they're going to be a good guide."
But Mr. Smith continued to make more than suggesting what's going on.
And he said, "We will not have a real example."
Washington's law, which is named I-502, will enter into the historic of 6th and will leave a year of uncertainty to be transferred to the local license system.
There are difficult mechanical questions that must be solved in this period, such as the license of schools, feet parks, children's parks, or children's care centres in the 1,000 feet feet presss, with the licensed marihuana directive "eternal access".
The new research group, Ben Livingston, said, "It could not be more difficult than city areas, especially Seattle's large cities. "
On November 21, a letter sent by a lawyer of 21-year of the city in the head of Oates in Aurora, who would not open the courts of the small marihuana cases, and the police would stop the crimes of the police.
He said that the head of the Oates police would set up the cities laws and follow the drug trade and salesers again.
Ken Buck's headquarters in the northern Colorado area, represents a larger view.
After playing, the office said that it would continue to follow the cases to move to marihuana as a way to difficulty with most users.
Now, when 119 people are accused of transporting us or less marihuana, many opposed to other crimes.
Mr. Buck said, "The case of crimes in the time of our office is difficult."
Even in places like the Red Mesa Area, who rejected the marijuana.
The biggest city in Grand Junction is no longer a case for adults.
Pete Penzinger, the head of the region, supported this decision but decided not to close the cases that were expected at the same time.
"I don't think I'm taking my time out until I continue to apply the law until it changes."
If 55 percent of the players in Colorado supported each other, it would never be easy to rule the aimed marijuana and bring them into the legal system.
And there is a depth between local authorities on large green trials in the area.
Marihuana's advocate and Marihuana laws represented the National Reform Organization, Sean McAlister says that it is "a cultural barrier."
He said, "They have passed a lot of things in the case of people, so they do not yet accept that it was legal."
As the first areas of marihuana to marihuana, they are prepared to be national test cases for the legalization of the drugs in Colorado and Washington.
While law enforcement plans for law enforcement, law enforcement and law enforcement are expected to direct the federal government from the government to sell the marihuana and manufacture as a federal crime.
The lawful marihuana lawyers hoped that the Office of Justice is retraced.
The federal government, Colorado, Washington and the other 16 rooms, allowed most of the high profile arrests of twin marihuana diseases and soldiers.
In the Obama government, the former drug policy investigator Kevin A. Sabet said that drug agents must probably be able to shoot the doors for a small drug torch, but it is likely to prevent their discharge of the intentional marihuana, which was allowed by new laws.
It doesn't expect some federal authorities to move in Colorado.
Even before the election of the day, some local governments accepted the debt of new marihuana banks for a year before they could open up.
Last week, Montrose city brought a six-month law on the western western, and it's likely to be accepted in the next week.
He said, "We don't want to be licensed for a large federal problem," he said, "We don't want to be brought to the city advisory, Bob Nicholson.
We've used a play against the changes of our region.
We're looking at the area that it's in the face of the departure.
There's a lot of questions.

What's malumenity?
The SSK, who has lost at least 60 per cent of the uncertain age of MALULEN, and who has not been able to live in the SGK's safeguards in order to store their assurance conditions in the SGK law, can be adhered to their recognition.
They also have to be able to lose the power of assembly in situations where they are lost.
Who's going to say it's wrong?
I'm writing from the board, my name is Mehmet Gultekin, I have my 920 day insurance, and I have 1460 days insurance with the military debt.
In addition, I'm a bleeding sick.
I'm connecting to our language machine.
I'm still working in a job.
Can I take a month?
- Let's go before the board.
You haven't shown when you have been in the first time of your problem.
However, let's just tell you how the currency is connected to you.
The most important conditions set out in the law are to be safe since 10 years and must be the primary day of 1800 days.
In addition, if you have been identified that you lost at least 60 percent of the power to win your work force or your job accident or the outcome of cure disease.
But you can't connect monthly because you're here with dialytic diseases, you don't have a 60% conditions to meet the number of 1800 primary days.
Of course, we don't know how many years you've been working.
Your 10 years and the day you completed with the 1800 day, you'll be connected to you in a month when you're making a disappearing from your work.
Corrections to win the right to the currency month
Should anyone be able to connect a month without a day without 1800?
- 1800 days of primary payment must be completed.
However, there is only one instance, and for those who have decided to be able to have a constant consideration of others, it is connected to a month of safeguarding in the 10-year-old period of safeguarding.
What illness or distress will be set out in the chapters of our writings to continue to be able to consider those who have a illness or a distress.
The situation of those who are able to start working
I'm Ahmet Guller.
While I've moved all the paths in the SGK law, they said you can't take a month before I was sick.
I'm so sweet.
Isn't it wrong?
How do I do?
- Ahmet Bey, you've written all the paths in the Law, but one of the main courses, and the SSK and the Bag-cure insurance in the law requires that the illness involving the labour loss of work in the work.
It can't be connected to a month because you're not moved.
However, you can be able to be able to move the conditions of validity in the age of safeguard.
I have 3980 days. I'm insured for 16 years.
The SGK was identified by the SGK that was before my department was in the work.
They said you couldn't be able to smell me.
What I'm going to do in this case.
I'm not going to do it.
Can you show the way?
- Yes, you've heard it.
You don't have to be smuggling.
However, according to the SGK law, there is also a cost-related cost.
So there are two situations before October 2008 and later.
The first time you started working before this history, SGK indicates that you're insured at least 15 years of assurance period, and you can take a month of age with 3600 primary day requirements.
This is why we suggest you to find a request for a monthly connecting with the most closest SGK department.
Well, if you were working after October 2008, then you could have been able to find insurance for at least ten years, and you could have been at least 3960 days of age, age and death insurance at first.
Is there a condition to get out of work when you start?
I'm still working as a shooter in a job.
When I went to the hospital, he took me a cancer.
I want to be a smuggle.
Do I need to leave the job in this case?
Can't I get out of a month without a statement?
I don't want to stay unclean until you're connected.
- You've heard it.
You need to be left from work to give you a monthly connection.
But before the month, you have to be able to deal with your SGK law.
But if you have to be able, it's connected to you with other conditions.
You don't mean to connect monthly dialysis, you have a risk of staying unfaithful.
It's enough for 1800 days.
When you're going to SGK, you're gonna love SGK's one of the hospitals who have been authorized.
When you bring the health system report from here, the SGK will be assessed by your own health system and your health disease will be a reason why you are to find a monthly linking.
However, since you have to fill the 10-year insurance period to connect your month, it will be possible to connect you to you.
So soon, we can say that the insurers who worked as a SGK health scheme is not skeptic to make the decision "It's uncommon."
But if the insurances worked any work are taking all the conditions, SGK and the insurance situation may also want to detect and connect to the month.
This would be a case if the smuggle and the other conditions are carried out, and it might be worth to be a little more premature for the start of a month.
Should the link-Kur's responsibilities be cut down?
I'm Connect-Kur's security.
I'm stoneing all the conditions.
But they said you wouldn't have to be able to be able to do it because it's a duty.
What should I do.
- I'll read it.
Whoever told you is right.
You didn't write what the other conditions are, but if you think you've moved these conditions, it's difficult to pay your primary duty.
But I can give you a special tea.
I'll suggest you're paying your debt by banks or by the same organizations.
As soon as soon as you're connecting the month, you're going to pay for a month.
These institutions will be easier to pay you to your debt from your moon.
What stage connects?
Well, I worked as the SSK and the Connect-Kur and the Reverend.
Where'd you connect me from the month when I'm in the moon?
- I'm worthy, Connect-Corp, SSK and agency, you're going to have a month of insurance, and the last is connected to the security, and you're going to leave your SSK as the last SSK, and you'll get switch from the SSK.
SGK reports to the hospital
How can the Malithing Review be done?
What hospital's health report?
- You're sufficient to implement the social security departments or social security centres that you are dependent on health reports.
The SGK will love you to the military hospitals associated with the Turk Armed Forces, in addition to university hospitals.
However, if you have not been able to have these hospitals, it can also be delighted to the complete encouraged hospitals of the Health Department.
Isn't it possible to love a special hospital?
- It's possible, but there are conditions.
In ancient arrangements, the new management of SGK is now in place with a new management that can now be treated with a state hospital with a 01.09.2013, when it is able to make the love of risks of patients to be able to be able to do with the hospital who loved you to go and who have received health reports on the basis of the health system.
What are the conditions for love?
The SEVK request is sufficient to make it important for 1800 days to make a relationship with the status of safeguards.
The hospital's records of malnutrition will be paid by SGK.
And 10 years of insurance, SGK is looking at this.
In the situation of malnutrition, if a person is likely to be seen, the 10-year-old insurance period is only connected to the health system in accordance with the 1800-day report.
This is why, when the person comes to the first appointment of the department, it's likely to be able to take care of SGK only in 1800 days.

This is a scientific research made by Dennis Kommsa (12)."
In the Bible, the person who has a shooting should tell you where, when and how he found it.
It's in the shooting, and it's paying a shock and a postal payment in the shooting.
On August 16, 1963, a historic swimming swimming pool, where we were shocked to the ocean in New Jersey.
The 12-year-old Komsa, in 1963, said that it was surprising to see the skin that shocked on the ocean, saying, "I've got the water to find them, but I never knew that the snake would come back to me."
Sound frequencies loved
I was surprised to tell Turkey's first technicians what can be done with the South Pamir sound frequencies.
As sound technologies or sound technology are soon the sound systems about the mind of everyone's music.
So you know that you can prevent the terrorism with the voice technologies, that you can act perfectly with the sound frequencies, that you can love the person you want to love yourself, that you can confess a secret or that you can enable the path of the world to end up?
After the finishing of the Mimar Division in the South Pamir, he took a sound engineer diplomat from the SAE college in England, and made it master on sound technologies at the Middlesex University.
The young man's relationship with the Galatasaray technology has also grown in a sound engine in the ITM and has also learned music technologies, audio technologies, performance technologies, electronic music and advanced record technologies.
terrorism sub-limiting message
"What's the sound technology exactly?" is my first question.
"A technology that can be used in many parts of the world.
Our brain's smells all with electric shoes.
The sound frequencies are a kind of electrical power, energy.
You can make people move with the command you want."
One of the main higher parts of its technology is sub-limital message.
It's putting a message on a frequencies that is mentioned outside the border of the music or the song, and it can't be identified by the above memory, but it's in high memory.
For example, when a terrorist attack has been taken, Pamir says that it could be a musical publication to that region.
If a message is placed as a "Do this Attachment" as a revised song frequency, the terrorist will select this message in the terrorism.
I don't understand what you heard, but the golden memory comes to it, and a voice calls him "shooting."
And it is like a message from Allah.
However, in the world and in Turkey, there is certainly law and punishment to use these messages outside the social security.
The South Pamir is a sub-lime message prepared to speak to students at a conference in Istanbul Technology University only once.
"After the conference, I listened to the students.
I put a sound frequencies for the music.
I asked the students who didn't shut up at the end.
They said they were all so calmed in a way.
Pamir says that there are people who have a sub-lime message in our country, "in our country some radio channels have been confirmed that, but details are still not known.
There's a channel called "Smart Radio" in Germany, a frequencies belonging to radical Islamics.
The sub-liminal methods of attacking, religiously contained, computer-related, commanded to use drug hair.
"The German police and the Turkey police know that, but they're not able to start with the frequencies."
It also uses such dangerous messages in the music world.
Especially in the songs of some heavy metal groups...
According to these arguments, even a terrorist was destroyed in the aircraft, and he was performed with sub-liminal commands of the high-known pilots.
Close Mask
Sound technology can also be used in crimes.
In the United States, in particular, it's worth in banking flows from this science.
For example, when the police's phone phone calls, technicians can confirm where the phone's voice person is in the bank, where it is in the room.
A sound metal, a tasty, a platform, a wall or any other material is different from each other.
It is possible to identify the size of the room that has been found in the shape of the sound form, even if it is possible to identify the form of the room, how many points it is.
As a result, the voice of the guilt can be confirmed by what kind of components there are, and how large it is in a room.
There was also a computer program used that Pamir had the designs of a operational building from Tataristan, and he said, "I've calculated where the 175 holar building was placed.
It's not a bad technology, it's $4-5,000."
The sound frequencies are also used in the decoration.
There's a lot of jobs about Pamir's.
He made a arrangement on a restaurant where the workers went out, which was made upstairs, that the sounds couldn't get out of the table.
They're just gonna hear those talking in the kitchen.
Another one on two steps can't hear anything he's talking on the table.
The general system of these arrangements is, "If you want to destroy the sound, you're going to switch it in the same frequency with another sound, and you're turning the sound energy into the river.
But no one could get to the flight if it was not this system.
Because the aircraft's voice is so high that it can't be shocked.
They're going to destroy themselves in the planet by they're cutting these voices together.
Even if you open your windows with this system, you can create a peaceful environment away from your home.
The Egyptian piramids were made with a voice?
There's another interesting thing that Pamir did with the first technicians of Turkey.
He made a arrangement that can't hear the sound of music on a open air disk in the month.
It's not possible to get out of the boundary, and it's able to defeat with another sound frequency.
Even in a room, it can be silent after a certain line.
The Pamir's school's sports room and the sports and the concert.
That's what you're going to use.
Because when playing basketball, there's need to be a smuggle, but it's not necessary for the concerts.
In the clear concerts, it is possible to make a sound quality that can only be heard of music.
"We're using frequencies to destroy the sounds that are sweet, and to correct humans' matters, to make the music more cleaner.
MTV's too extensive about this.
It's clearly arranged concerts, and it's heard like the studyo stable under the sound."
It's been a test of the Tubitak.
The sound frequencies and the sound frequencies divide two pieces from each other.
There were scientists who claimed that the Egyptian piramids were made with a voice.
They thought that the stones could be removed with the voice.
I'm asking, isn't it difficult to use your voice with bad purposes?
"When I read the New York University's works from the Internet, I was so scared of reading others.
For those who are good-care, even if they are not laboratory, they may cause unbelievable results."
"Dualar Arabs"
The South Pamir, who says that he will affect humans in a sense of immorality, explains why: "Why all the voices that his servants hear are communicated to the brain.
Sometimes people hear the sound that's a single concentration, but the other voices are communicating to the brain, and they're going to smile.
So the brain's need to disappear, so it's good to walk on the ground, to do natural walks.
I think there should be arrangements for the orders of driving in schools.
So students will be concentrated on the voice of the teacher alone and can provide concentration for more long."
Pamir, who says that the sound frequencies believed in prayers or in the Arabs would be effective, shows that Arabs have a very rich frequencies-frequencies swimming snake when the voices are in the words, has been organized so slightly that they would have a lot of influence.
"But you have to read your prayers, but when I read the Law, I will smile. "
Frequency Love Target
"Is it possible to love people with the sound frequencies?"
The frequencies rate of love that Pamir has given, the frequencies to move on the feelings of a more correct person is: "I think you should find the frequency of the pressure that you want to talk to someone you want to love.
You can affect it by using higher frequencies in this frequencies.
For example, let us consider that the person’s pressure frequency is 300.
And you want to steal a music to make your feelings.
If you're gonna bring the pressure to those who are cutting on the 300 frequencies of the music that you're playing, it's the ability to influence the person.
Maybe he may love the one who is in that way."
Pamir, who speaks to have special sound systems to speak more effectively in the world, has been very strong, and a scene artist can feel like a great natural substance.
"It's in Japan, she's trying to make a voice that believes that the Mikail's day of preaching is not going to do, and how do you think it's going to be?" Pamir's answer, "I think human voice will be close to the voice because the voice of the people's most influentious voice is close to its own voice.
Indeed, it is a magnificent, like a man's breath.
"The gold prices will be loaded."
The Canadian Head Analyst Dan Hrushewsky said that they have worked to reduce their debt of the money units by means of declining the value of the money, so that the gold prices will continue to be the current level, "Original and safe design machine."
He said that Hrushewsky, China and India's distributors are a large role in this way.
Hrushewsky, remembering that India's most traditionally largest gold shopping is, "I believe that you're seeing your search accounts to control your search accounts now very calm.
People will find a way in this frame."
Hrushewsky is in the direction that they do long-term expenditure to the employees, "It will continue to serve with the role of being a safe designer.
Many Western government's debt levels are forgotten to be loaded from the "disciplinary exile".
The authorities are working to reduce their responsibilities by declining the value of the money units.
This is why gold prices will be reduced from the current levels."
"Ore in the area of the swimming world is stored in the ability to reduce the price risk."
The World Gold Advisory Director-General Marcus Grubb is a physical feature of being sacred, firm and confidence in the golden prices, which are more flexibility and volatile in the financial prices, "If we fall down in gold, it does not retain the capacity to reduce the risks of the main prices and risks.
He said, "The golden portraits of small quantities, showing the development of the transportation, generally proved that it was better to be done with the uncertainties and prices.
Grubb, marking that golden-energy demand has been laid down in the last 10 years, said, "The golden, global residues represent less than 1 percent of the worldwide.
This means that the prices are still very important to grow in golden expansion.
In this area, in the past year, 78 per cent of the culture of gold, and the exhibition of the powerful inputs that are made to the smooth, is the demonstration that you have protected the counter-productor's relationship.
"Independence must increase national gold stories to support economic growth."
The Grubb, who answers the largest gold prices of the world to India and China, adds that it has increased the increase of the smooth rates in gold prices in the second part of the second year of the year.
Grubb remembered 54 per cent of the complaint in China, and 51 per cent in India.
The Grubb, who made their benefits from the low prices of Chinese smokers, was a loading trend, "It would normally be silent from the Musevher's request in the second half of China.
He said, "Well, when the prices of the gold were unexpectedly slaughtered, and the swimming shooting was slowly slow.
Grubb stated that in India, with the deterioration of the golden government, the support of the Indian Central Bank's rule and the reduction of the outcome of the deficiencies, has a lot of priorities: "In the nature of the high demand, it is difficult to perform the applications of the high level of deterioration, and therefore is to meet the unable channels.
The World High Council believes that India's policies must be considered a strategic existence.
Furthermore, the long-term policy objectives were evaluated in a better evaluation of national gold stories in order to support economic growth.
Sustainable Gold Trends
According to the World Gold Council report last week, 856.3 tonnes of global gold requirements have also been 508 tonnes of gold in the second area of this year.
In the second part of the year, when countries have an important increase in the demand of the counterparts, in China, 54 per cent, in India, 51 per cent in 38 per cent in Eastern and 33 per cent in India.
At the time of the term, the smoking demands in China continued to grow strongly, with the expectations that the prices will increase in the future in the year, as the same 87 percent increased, and this year's assembly reached 276 tonnes.
In India, however, the government has decreased taxes in the first region of gold, but 310 tonnes in the past year has been loaded by 71 per cent of the smoking demand.
A warm cardinal film: A rainy swimming airlines
The doctor in Trabzon.
So the players are the favorite, sweet, smiling, smiling, smiling snakes of the village.
Next Free
There's only 4000,000 TL films, there's no replication, a lot of birth and a cup.
In the leadership of the Vice-President of Sinema's Era, the film was: "We want to observe a real kardinal story."
The cinema of the "Tepenin Avenue 1980" film was caused by a pleasant painting of the film, which is made in the Middle East in the village of Aceabat.
Forum AVM Cinemaximum was careful to the interests of the puzzles in the galaxy in the Sinema.
They signed a wonderful night with the teams, the horons and the cardens.
In the first place of Galaia, Muhammad Balta, President of Trabzon Fevzi, Dr.Orhan Fevzi Officer, Headquarters of Industrial Affairs, Ombudsman culture and Tourism Office, Abdul Rauf Ulusoy, Headquarter of the Republic of Turkey and many invitations, sponsor companies, national and local representatives.
In the film of Dr. Icemit Eran's scripture, the director Samet Karagasano, the Meeting, the Coral Man, the Selahatting, the Free Saral, the Adem Era, and the Resurrection Era.
In 1980, the Topen Islands today with 61 copy were used in Turkey to make it possible for the first time to agree to the Karadenz race in Turkey.
A star of the tent!
Samet Karahasano is still 18 years old from the head players of the film.
Whatever the name of Samet's player who lives in Trabzon, you're seeing the best.
A amateur theater, the code and the loading scenes are successful.
Samet Karahasano, who had the right to the end of the shops, has opened his call to the boarder's "to be one of the strike players that will be."
He didn't come and dragon!
The issue of Trabzon's Middle Province is the subject of the events in a period of 12 September 1980 nearby:
"Film's head character works in Germany, the young Wikmet's father.
It is one of the greatest dreams of the Wikmet, who is making shepherds in the months, to complete the training, and to do a doctor.
Whatever it's not much to read and work.
And when a village is the richest family of Züleyha, the daughter of Züleyha, is still hard to work.
This love that has been hidden for years is a hard obstacle to the Wisdom's father of Züleyha, who decided to tell his friends to tell him of the silences that he had taken to Züleyha.
Sabri Blue's daughter has other plans.
On the other hand, it is one of the greatest tribulations of the villages, and they have opened a war against the villages of this temple.
A short metro of the film...
The Senator and Governor of the Galada film explained the 1980s of Dr. Ismet's 1980s about the Topen’s aircraft:
"When we started this movie, our purpose was to make a short film.
But the first specimens of the social media were so interested that we started to hear a long-term shock to shoot us.
When we went to Istanbul, they said, "Do you have a great player?"
And I said, "We don't have a god, but I've got 86 cardinal games that you don't find anywhere."
The films and skins were used very badly, and the Karadenz people were wrongly identified.
You're gonna look at the original 86-foot in the movie that you'll see.
I tried to take a cardinal movie.
I wish others would have taken before me, and we couldn't look at a skilled film.
If you weren't telling people wrong, I wouldn't have taken this movie.
We first posted a Turkish subscription to the film.
It's gonna be the first.
We've done this because you're better understood.
In addition, we put the English conversation scenes in the movie and turned into the Karadenz snake.
When we turned this movie to whom we turned the camera out of the player.
It's our first movie.
I'm wrong, I can't do my cyclings."
Don't shoot this warm movie that brings a new cell to the cardinal movies!
Be careful when you choose your parfum!
Attention from those who are cut off with a shooting smell in your personal care.
It may cause your parfum disease.
We talked about the Citte Poikloderation, the source of different cosmetics that appears more frequently in women, with the Hisar Intercontinental Hospital Thematologist Dr. Funda Ataman.
In the Cyclothing's size of the Poikloderation, in the dimensions of the sky, and in the sky's decoration (which is not covered to the edge of the edge of the darkness) Dr. Ataman, “It appears to remain in the sun with the light colors of the people.
The coffee red legs appear in a shape.
He is slaughtered, striving, and slaughtered.
The pulse is one of the options for the treatment of the laser and the protection of the sun.
Another is the use of retinoic asylum creams.
These creams must be used for a long time.
It is not an adverse or alergia that can appear during the use.
In this case, it must be continued to be treated.
In order to be family, your parents must be known about premature protection and treatment of the age of Citte Poikloder."
Great in the smoking smoking.
In Turkey in the first six months of this year, 10% of the same period, and 41.779 million returned.
In Turkey in the first six months of this year, 10% of the same period, and 41.779 million, 190.000 per cent of the same year.
According to the information provided by the Institute of Alcohol Revision (TAPDK), the use of information on the product of adults in Turkey and the establishment of data on decision-makers and researchers is completed by the Turkish Statistics Institute for Advanced Agricultural Research (KYTA).
According to the research results, in Turkey generally 15 and more age units in 2008, 31.2 percent (16 million people) are using tuberculosis products every day or between 2012, and 13.4% of this rate was decreased to 27.1 million (14.8 million) and was reduced in 2012.
41.5 percent of men are using 13.1 percent of women.
The rate of those used by the twin product is 47.9% to 41.5% in men, with 15.2% to 13.1% in women.
According to the investigation, 10 people who use the tuberculosis are thinking to leave 6 tobacco.
The rate of those who think to leave the product in a month was 12,9,12 months, and 35.4 per cent of those planned to leave.
In the review section, the following opinions were placed:
"The net results of the opening of the smoking products are marked that the smoking control laws in Turkey and the National Control Programme and the Action Plan are active.
Thus, from 2008 to 2012, the number of smokes has reduced 2 200 million people, 4.1 per cent of the use of the use of smoking, and the most specific lowest rates of smoking were the price increases of young people, such as less educational people.
According to the 2013 World Health Protection Report, Turkey was the first and the only country that has succeeded with all criteria in the context of the control of the smoke.
In the report, other countries stopped following and imitating Turkey."
In the cigarettes, it continues to show its effects.
In the first six months of this year, the smoking rate of smoking was 10% of the same period, with a decline in the past year, with a decline of $41,779 million in 190,560.
In the same period of 2012, this figure was $46,325 million in a 100-millionial level.
We don't touch the walls anymore.
Ubi Interactive has produced a very interesting product for Microsoft's 'Kinect' technologie.
Microsoft has engaged 11 new companys in the Kinect Accelerator program last year to support Kinect projects to be used in Windows.
My scripture was in support of the money, place, and my donations.
One of the most interesting writers that appears from Kinect Accelerator has been shown by Ubi Interactive.
A projector, Kinect for Windows normally joins a projector and converts to a key screen on the wall.
A new message on Kinect for Windows website has a number of companies testing this technologie.
I'm the writing that the body tested over 50 in the special beta process, now Ubi's sell for everyone.
It's possible to reach Ubi's website.
You need to get 149 dollars out of the scene for a 45 touch screen.
A 100-clip-clip-screen that can be touched from 20 points, and you'll have $1.499.
You need to buy Ubi's writing and Kinect for Windows prices but as a projector.
Another newness to Android!
It will make it easier to use the Google patent with the "Faxing and Gender" process.
And that's the patent of a new interface technologie that uses the work of the shared files with the friends.
It's not very different than Android Beam and Apple Airdrop examples.
The last innovation that's transferred to Google's signature is that it's going to give the user groups instead of a partial share, and it's going to give the users easy.
The new personality comes to get place on the Android...
Here's the first smart phone in Turkey.
Turkcell also entered the smart phone work.
The manufacture of smart phones will be in Turkey.
T40 name
Turkcell identified the first smart phone in Turkey.
The TCELL design is made in Turkey and the intelligent phone that will be produced in Turkey on the end of September, T40.
Turkcell General Director Süreya Ciliv said he planned to sell in nine countries in which Turkcell worked.
He said, "T40's part of China will begin to produce in Turkey until the year 2013."
EXPIRATION FYRY
Ciliv, who said they would offer his phone with a suitable price, explained that they would close to the sale of the price.
Ciliv said that a more accessible price from the sale of the computer with a T40 and a smart phone of the market would increase its use of data and aims to increase its profits.
Ciliv, who stated that the T-series sold from the phones provided for for the sales in Turkey in 2010 were sold to 500 million libraries.
FYIATIES TO THE LOOK TO TO TO TO TO TO TO TO A LIFE
Turkcell General Director Süreyya Ciliv said that T40 would be the properties of the high-resolved sound, the sound-up and alignable user drive.
Ciliv said that before T40's price was out to the phone price, the phone's price would be appropriate.
WHAT 5 MILD FOR THE GOD GOD
When he said that the President of Tayfun Acarer supported the local production of information and communication technology, "57 per cent of the phones in Turkey.
The average cost of the phones sold by this expansion is $300.
We're looking at $5 billion every year from 15 million every year, and we're worried that it's going to grow up.
Android operating systems will have 1 GB RAM features.
All the priests were heartless!
The records of students in the normal media were renewed as a secondary student.
MEB converted all educational schools in Turkey as a midst, medium-sized and immortal environment since our education was over 4+4+4.
After the first year of education, it appears that a new scene was signed by a new scene during the work of transformation was re-established in the re-education of schools.
In Turkey this year, the priest's heart and care for all the publishers in the middle of the schools were able to take care of the existing students in the "conciliation" skandale, which was transformed and renewed in the Sugar Meram, Konya's Meram.
A normal year
The first school of the sugar was around in the head of the last year after the 4+4+4 arrangement.
In school, the system group was seeing a class of 3 and 4 classes to go to another school together with students of class 6, 7 and 8.
The school served as a normal school for one year, the end of the 2012-2013 education year was converted to the medium.
I believed the school around the heart this year accepted his students as "Image and students" to school first once this year.
However, in the past 5th class, students read normally and this year six were automatically renewed as a medium student in the electronic environment.
"Another school that doesn't want."
The brothers who learned the situation, they were a lawyer at school.
However, in the validity of the Leader of Military Education, the school government said to the brothers: "The bonds who do not want to continue in the heart of their children can take their record in another medium."
In explanation from the Millennium Educational Directorate, Konya took interesting expressions.
In explaining, "We turned some schools to be the Konyan government with the preferences of students and schools, and in this captain in Konya, the 15-20 school was in the priest.
Schools are engaged in the e-school system with school codes.
However, the priest's school is removed from the code of the old school in the environment.
The new school code must be opened by students in the system.
These schools, using the new code of the body to make the students switch up to the medium, were swallowed by the students who had changed schools.
The brothers who want children could take their children from these schools and give them to other schools."
Sleeping operation in Istanbul!
