The teacher admits his shooting girlfriend during the emergency phone
My voice is just a little bit of a color university student Shannon Lamb tells the police that he shot her girlfriend and that the police must come to their home.
The Lamb stressed that his "good dog" is alive and probably angry, and said that the closest contacts of women were found in this phone.
The police in the field found a message written to Amy Prentiss body and the hair page: "I'm so sorry that I could abolish this love Amya and she is the only woman who has ever loved me," said in a letter that the experts are signed by Lambi.
There was no reference to the fact that Lamb, who taught two network courses at the University of Minnesota Cleveland, had already traveled about 500 miles [500 km] to the school camp where the police believes that his shot and murdered historian teacher Ethan Schmidt, the door of this work room.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford reported to the U.S.A. at 10:18.
He told Lambi to call an emergency call a few days later.
By the end of the day, the number of dead arrived: Lamb made self - murder when the police turned up.
The authorities still tried to find Lambi’s motives on the day after students and staff were taken behind the doors hidden in the hidden.
Scientists both of the States have published information that the students and the staff were described as a donor teacher who, however, had problems.
Students told him when he was waiting for his feeling.
The police says that Lambin had no violence or crime records.
Schmidt himself had incorporated Lambi to write in his book where he thanked "making people" with whom he shared his life of academy.
Both the students taught society sciences and history, with a total of 17 members of the staff, and many students participated in the courses of both men.
On the other hand, there were marks of the problem.
The student named Brandon Beavers was in the Lambie, but he said that he also seemed to be nervous and unpleasant, "now if anything had been sweet."
Another student Mikel Sykes told Lambi that he had a lot of stress at the end of 2014-15.
The Lamb had previously asked the hospital from Delta State University to say that he had some health problem.
He just taught two network courses this year.
Recent changes in the principles of the university’s rewards mean that, although Lamb had worked very predominantly before his doctoral value, it did not give him automatical upgrades and the official of the opening professeur.
Professor William LaForge said that it wasn't between Lambi and Schmidt to know that there was any conflict, but "speakly Lambi's thinking was something."
The Lamb can't answer these questions.
After the Lamb fled from the camp, the police went to his followers when he moved back to Mississippi's state.
Before he was arrested, the Lamb shooting himself in a .38-caliper shooting house at about eight and a half miles south of the house of his parents from Mississippi Greenville in the former town of Mississippi, reported the student Methel Johnson of the district of Washington.
Lambin's car was still on the shooting.
It was not soon clear why the Lamb was just going to this house, although Johnson said to believe that the Lamb knew the people living there.
The Lamb was in the area.
Lamb began working at the university in 2009 and taught geographic and educational information. In the University, there are 3500 students and it is in the city where about 120,000 people live.
The Lamb conducted the doctors in the educational science with heat.
One of the old Lambi’s friends described her as intelligent, charistical and fun.
Carla Hairston told her 15-year-old and Lamb's 20-year-old age when they met through friends.
Hairston’s friends were in the class, and Lamb was pleasant, older boy who tried to teach Hairston to call a cup for many years.
He was so sweet in those days.
All the girls were closed when she was on the place, now telling 40-year-old Hairston, who lives in Jackson's headquarter in Brandon.
The Lamb and the Princess apparently were shocking some time.
The Lamb told his wife that he was killed in the late call, but there's no evidence of their marriage.
They had a name of Lightning dog, who lived with them in the Gautier shopping room.
The police told the dog's okay.
Princess' ex-marry Shawn O'Sst told them a divorce 15 years ago, but I remained friend, and now they have a 19-year-old daughter.
"He's really confused," O'Sz described her daughter.
He was his best friend.
O'Sten told you hadn't met Lambi, but she had heard her daughter Abigail that the Lamb had interested in music and called blue.
The Lamb met Princess when the Lamb and Abigail were both in the summer market three years ago.
Afterward, they were playing together a few weeks.
O'Sten told her daughter to do and sing his own music.
Princess was a hospital who worked for several different network companies.
The Julep Rome's bar near Gautier, a marvelous bar, and a swimming chairman Mike Shaffer tells that he saw Lambin and Princess last night when the Lamb had stopped his bicycle and swimming swimming snake.
There's nothing that seemed to be sweet.
"I'm a happy couple," he said.
We were playing and shooting to each other.
So, they were both very nice.
The dead teacher Schmidt conducted the seminar program of students in the first year and was specialized in Indians and the history of transferred, reported an English student Don Allan Mitchell.

He studied at the Emporia State University of the United Nations, as well as the director of his brotherhood and the government of the students.
Last night, in Cleveland, the Delta States camp was held a crowd in which about 900 people participated, including educational and other staff, students and Community members.
Schmidt’s wife Liz and Brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the messenger, which during the university's colleagues Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Learning continues in the middle week.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
Your crisis is over.
Now it's time to get up.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported about Mississippi Cleveland.
Associated Press writer Emily Wagster Petus from Mississipin Greenville and Rebecca Santana New Orleans participated in the report.
The case has been corrected according to the fact that the police now say the Lambi's emergency call after the shot of Schmidt, and that even though Lamb had been referring to his wife of Princess, there are no evidence that they were married.
Together R Us plans to pay less employees for holiday periods

The Chairman of the United Nations says that the situation of Syria is not armed
The answer by Mr Ban Ki-moon is that Russia's more military support to Syria is that this nearly five-year conflict "Don't solve weapons", and more weapons will only increase violence and millions of people's suffering.
The Chairman of the United Nations reiterates all parties, including the shared United Nations Security Council, to combine and support any undiscriminate negotiations to find political solution.
In the middle-week newspaper, Ban reported that he would like to meet the five permanent Member States, the United States, Russia, China, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, and the United States, and the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the General Assembly, later in the month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the Council, the Syrian people, and the dividend of regional powers, "he made the situation unable to resolve".
The Bank called on five permanent Member States to demonstrate the Syrian crisis of solidarity and unilaterality in accordance with the Iron nuclear programme.
8 Recommendations that show that Donald Trump is serious
Some have tried to smell him as a winter.
Others just like him as a sweet.
Some of you are waiting for the robbery.
Although some Republicans have tried to shoot Donald Trumpia from the slaughter of counts, it has not been successful.
In the last 11th national question, Donald Trump has been due to the two-number chapters, and some have severely understood what this means for the appointment of the Communities.
You're just in the first stage.
These results still do not mean that Trump probably would be the candidate of the Republic.
The comments noted that at this stage, in 2011, Rick Perry had lost her leadership to Herman Cain, which no one could have been able to enable any State in the appointment process.
There are also many reasons why he had problems in general.
Foreign groups such as Jeb Bushin Super PAC and conservative economic organization Club for Growth, however, have marked the synthesis of Trump and have started to use care for his savings.
The following recent adverse results refer to the fact that the Commonwealth is not only a unique stage:
Trump's recommendation figures have been completed.
Just before Donald Trump announced its ridicule in June, Monmouth University’s advisory statements showed that only two decades of the Republic were welcomed with the counterparty gas.
By July, the number was 40%.
At the beginning of May, there was 52 per cent.
At this time, six of the ten Republicans are welcomed to Donald Trump.
About three decades say they're denied.
These chapters also consider their place in the first states of the pre-agency.
In the university of Quinnipiac, in Iowa last week 60 percent of the Republicans reported that they are welcome to Trump.
Two third parts of the Republic of the Republic would be satisfied if Trump is a candidate.
In the last week in the question of CNN/ORC, 67% of the Republicans said that they would be "fellowships" or "pleasant" if Trump was a candidate.
Only two decades said they'd be "insured" if he'd be a candidate.
Only Ben Carson receives the greatest extent of the same inspiration as Trump (43 per cent of the "successful" vs. Trump 40 per cent).
The next cause of the most exciting exciting?
Marco Rubio's only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of the representatives of the Republic of the Republic would be "unpleasant" or "unpleased", if the representatives recommended Jeb Bush should be a candidate.
Trump's fire is not a problem for the majority of the Republicans.
Although Donald Trumpia has been criticized over its potential speech and injuries, ABC News/Washington Post surveyed 52% of voters at the national level thinks that the company has a proper nature for the President.
According to the last week in Quinnipiac's survey, the number of Iowa State organized by the First Party Committee is the same: 52 per cent of the Republicans believes that Trump has a suitable quality for the leader.
However, 44% of the question of ABC/Post believes that his nature is not applicable to the President, and nearly six ten of them agree that it does not belong to the White House.
The representatives of the Republic take into consideration.
When the Republicans consider as commentators, they agree that Trump is a real option.
According to the CNN/ORC survey, four decades were likely as a alternative to Trumpia when anyone may be appointed as a candidate to the Republic of Republic.
On the end of July, four decades supported Jeb Bushi.
Publication of information: The voters of the Republican Party have not always been able to use a clear Christian ball.
In this past period, four ten Republicans agreed that Rick Perry was appointed as a candidate, and only 28 percent supported the final condition, Mitt Romney.
In each case, the majority of the voters of the Republican Party is to be believed by the Trump campaign.
Although the Republicans would stand to support other candidates, Trump would still win almost everybody.
Some commentators have noted that the circle field probably has promoted the leadership of Trump, since the encouragement against Trump has been shared between several other candidates.
However, the question undertaken at the beginning of September of the University of Monmouth showed that the hypothesis of the two-traditional kitch between the Trump and almost all other republicans, Trump is in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina 13 points, Marco Rubiota 14 points, Walkeria 15 points, Jeb Bushia 19 points, and Rand Paul, John Kasichi and Chris Christy at 33 points.
He's at the point with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to win Trump?
If they were set up against them, Ben Carson would win the businessman on the largest 18 points away from Trump.
Right and just a majority of Donald Trump supporters have told the decision.
The new question of CBS/NYT shows that only a few more than half of the voters of Trumpi have decided whose voice is going on.
Your situation can, of course, change, and no one can absolutely say that he would never change.
46% reported that they may be able to change candidates.
In each case, the biggest competitor of Trump now has a second inevitable victor, neurochirurg Ben Carson, but those voters who said to make a decision are probably two times on the side of the Trump.
Of the six ten Republicans, they say that they are with Trump on the same agreement on immigration.
Since Donald Trump two months ago called the Mexican immigrants as a "fatal" phone of their campaigns, the migration was in the middle of 2016.
Some are concerned about the possibility of Trump's Latin voters from the far-depth Republicans and of the rebuilding enterprises.
According to the new ABC/Post-Chine survey published on Sunday, six of the six Deputy Republicns say that they are with Trump the same agreement on immigration.
So it affects that as long as immigration is in the middle of the matter, it is also Donald Trump.
The struggle to the government has been shocked up a new stage.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now examining about half of the representatives of the Republic of Republic, which is a large part of their position outside their policy.
Of the six ten Republicns, the ABC/Post question stated that they prefer to select an external policy person than a person with a government trial.
They are also angry to the government of the Alliance State.
Two weeks later, the investigation of De Moines Register/Bloomberg on Iowa showed that three four yowa Republicans have been disfellowshipped in the Republicans: 54% is "unpleasant" and 21% of "the real enemy".
Introduction of Jeremy Corbyn by the Chief Minister
The first question of Corbyn has been expected to be joyful since his choice.
The new leader Jeremy Corby at the Labour Working Party is the first time at David Cameron's Prime Minister's question.
Corby is up to ask for the first three questions after a little half day, and probably both the media and the unemployed people were closely able to strengthen its implementation.
Corby has required this weekly show for "mother theatre and more facts".
He has also said that he could leave a part of the opportunity to handle his colleagues.
This approach is the first parliamentary test to the leadership of Corbyn when he was appointed to the preserving government and he spoke at the annual meeting of the Centre of Interactions.
At the same time, the decision by the Director of the Working Party, during the national song, which was held in the Memorial Service organized at the 75th anniversary of the Britannican International Day, has raised the appreciation of the Conservation Party in the partners of the Conservation Party and appeared in several prior sessions.
Corbyn's decision not to be sing a national sweet has been aware of the attention.
The representative of Corbyn said to his "speakly silence of the session" and that he recognizes "the sport of the Minnesota aircraft in the Ison-Britannia climate war".
The President of the Corbyn Office, Owen Smith, said to BBC two Newsnight programs that he would have invited the Chief of the Working Party to sing a national song, despite his thinking that the Kingdom Room should be delayed.
Nevertheless, the ministers of Warden have refused to join in Corbyn's internal barriers with the differences in the economic, defence and external affairs, and the sixth part of the parliamentary Party has supported him as a leader.
The BBC Policy Robin Brant says that the position of the cocktail users in the European Union as well as the government's support chairs have been "faced" within the working partner in Corbyn's appointment.
Corbyn said at the meeting of the Central Organization of Professional Interactions that the Working Party would propose a change that would remove the whole disappearance.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, the officer of the Foreign Government, stated that the party was "a clear" in respect of the fact that they only opposed the plans of the government to count up to 26 000 trees from 23 0000 pounds.
Corbyn comes from the Fifth Employee Chamber, whose David Cameron has been head of the Conservation Party during the last decade.
The Director of the Working Party has promised a new approach to the policy and now tells us that he has "committed" the ideas for the Prime Ministers and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
Corby, the Popularist of the Northern region, has said that the main minister is too contrary to the question and that he will be arrested as well as the slight word and the smiling, instead of focusing on serious matters such as poverty, diversity and the challenges of young people.
Corbyn has said that the Ombudsman's Ombudsman Angela Eagle works on his position when Corbyn does not participate, for example when Cameron is outside.
Corby has also proposed that other colleagues may sometimes be allowed to use talks, and he has said his approach to the President of the Headquarter, John Bercowi, the team.
When Cameron arrived in 2005, he said to want to move away from a political theater, often combined to the questionnaires of the Prime Minister, but later he was able to admit his failure.
Since they were launched to television in 1990, the Chief Minister's question was an important measure when evaluating the ability of the director, the management of its sector rooms, and its position in the part of other civilians, although the valuers have criticized the question that they had been only a slight picture that requires great reforms.

The value of the powder is increased in the wage of the UK
The value of the powder slowed down after the numbers appeared to be increased in the britannic growth, and at the same time, the FTSE 100-index increased the offering of SABMller.
During the period between May and July, the payment of the United Kingdom, including the bonus, increased 2.9% compared to the same time in the last year.
The growth was the fastest after 2009, and it was considered to assess the increase in the rates.
The point increased over the percentage of $1.5505, and 0.84 per cent against EUR 1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed 1,49 per cent to read 6229,21.
SABMller was a separate part of the market and increased 20% after the competitor AB Inbev approached it.
The agreement would combine two major panics in the world and together with bands such as Budischr, Stella Artois, Aberni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share increased 0.9% after the competitive clause group of Richmont was encouraged.
Richemont's newest sales numbers were expected to be better, and moreover, they pointed out that sales in China, which are the key markets of Burberry, were starting to grow again.
The Glencore shares increased 5% after the counterparty reported that it had collected $2.5 billion by calculating the shares in the movement of a part of its payment strategy.
Package and paper group of Mond shares were the largest index of 4.3% after the Goldman Sachs changed its recommendation from the company to the "Sell".
JD Sports increased 3,1 per cent after the sporting company publicly informed its production by half a year before taxes: 83 per cent of the 46.6 million.
According to the director of the JD Sports Company, the highest payments may harm the expansion
JD Sports Company, director Peter Cowgill, says that if the minimum payment of employees is higher in the United Kingdom, it may mean that “potental consumers will grow.”
However, this purchase power is probably not exceeding the higher costs of work for the company, and Cowgill states.
The costs could be addressed to the expansion plans of the company, which would mean less additional jobs.
Metcash starts a food-free campaign against the Ald area
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA trade in Aldin's attack in South and Western Australia.
Metcash’s smoking sales of food has been initiated to defend the IGA market share in South and Western Australia before 700 million of Aldin's attack.
At the same time, Aldi is preparing two departments and the first trade in South and Western Australia, which has been reached by 120 trade. At the same time, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local coal intermediaries and build IGA bridges through the market of power and social media, as well as events, such as the Adelaide show display.
The tradeers and buyers of IGA have been delayed, and the burns such as the refrigerators from Dunsborrow offer the mass in the IGA trades, and the owners of the trade sell a decrease prices for the fighting of the shooter of Australian football customers.
The Metkashi is expected to provide more details on its Defence Strategy on September 29 when this food, alcohol and rail tabagment sales will organize the yearly strategy of investors.
There are many games, since nearly 30 per cent of the IGA trade in Metcash, and the product margins are higher than the IGA network of the East Metcash states.
The purchasing events in South and Western Australia are well-known, and the IGA revengeers have much greater market share than New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: over 30% in the south and 24% in the west compared to 14% of the Eastern States.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi is taking about 5% of these two states’ food products markets in 12 months after the opening of the first movement.
In its report, Morgan Stanley's analysis, Tom Kierath estimates that the IGA revengeers can lose $360 million per year in sale and Metcash can lose 250 million until the end of 2016.
This prophecy is based on the default that Aldi will open the next year in the south of the 25th and west 30, which produces 500 and 600 million dollars in these regions.
The loss of food and food sale and measures in the support rate of the frozen costs of Metcash may be paid to Metcash about 13 million dollars of trafficking infringements before the rate and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash lost the market share in the older states in Ald and Coles, although in the survey of Roy Morgan, it was stated that IGA customers were all more faithful.
Morgan Stanley believes that the Metkashi food and food sale is 3.8% in 2016; 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, so that its market share is 14% from 10.3% in 2020.
Last week, the manager of the Investment Fund and the founder of the Magellan Financial Group Hamish Douglass said in the business in Melbourne that Metcash can "before possible to disappear in ten years".
Metcash has refused to respond publicly to Douglass' comments.
However, it was understood that the member of the Metkashi government would have taken contact with Douglassis last week.
The market share of IGA has been calculated from 18 per cent to 14 per cent after 2010, and the production of Metcash food and food rights, which covers products for about 1200 IGA sales, has been estimated to 43 per cent after 2012, reporting on the reduction of the obligation of the operations when the pressures are faced by sales and margins.
However, it has been invested in more than 150 million dollars annually during the latest of hundreds of products at the same level with Coles and Woolworths, helping vendors to enhance their sales by increased rapidly increased food, and in the market, the best private signs of the market.
On the other hand, Ian Morrice, Director-General of Metcash, said that the rate of prices and the increase of sales have increased the strength of the smoke and he hopes that the smoke sales will return to the growth of products until 2017, first four times in the year.
President Steve Healy, Australian Tennis Association, supports Thanasi Kokkinak
Thanasi Kokkinakis offers more honor than its critical use
Thanasi Kokkinakis has been able to suffer in the last shock that has shocked his friend Nick Kyrgios around. He gives the honor more honor than his own critical behavior, says President Steve Healy of Australia.
The "Special Ks" named two younger member Kokkinakis, unless he wants to come to the public case in which Kyrgios doctor Stan Wawrinka Montreal Masters.
Shortly after that, in the warning negotiation in Cincinnat, the chief judge had two times to remove Kokkinaks and his opposer Ryan Harrison, when Harrison declared: "Wawrinkan had to shoot Kyrgios, and I should shoot that shooting."
Although the last time, Kokinnakis was seen to shoot his mail after the slaughter shocked his potential victory from Richard Gasquet in the United States open, Healy was an uncarcerable defender of Kokkinaks.
Just now, a young man is in Glasgow in a competition with Sam Groth on another place in Bernard Tomici with Davids Cupin in the semi-final of Britain.
"I'm so strong that Thanasi has been only watered with its skin," Healy said.
He destroyed his email because of the crampe in the United States Open, but he is not the first player who destroys his mail when he disappointed, and I feel sufficiently well enough to know that she's not proud of it.
But he has been very well-being, also in extreme provocative situations in the United States in Open Harrison, and so still, and I think he's worth a body.
He has a great team around, he has a great family around, and I think he's being a little depressed.
He's a very sweet 19-year-old, he works hardly, including its team, and so still, and he has never had problems with other players. He's not worthy in the bathroom, he works lowly, is good, and especially is a peaceful and skilled young man, and I think he should be evaluated according to his anxieties.
Healy has also encouraged the decision to be not taken from Kyrgy, according to that of Thursday, to the main games in this "community decision" for all good solutions, but I still support Canberra's return to a stable team.
"We want to be completely concentrated on games and not all the polymics [Kirgios] around the team," Healy said.
And Nick has really been slowly collected, such as Federer and Murray have been observed, and he has grown in public, and has made some challenging errors and gains all its criticism, but we try to support him, we try to help him understand the consequences of his work, and I believe that it is the best and the team, and if he brings some time away from the public to consider these consequences.
European Migration Crisis: Hungary announces the emergency account, closes the borders, arrests immigrants
Hungary proclaimed an exceptional account and closed the Southern border by arresting those who tried to go unlawfully to the country.
The king followed the caos when hundreds of migrants were gathered into the unrelated region, and the Serbian authorities reacted with a smooth.
People who flew from their home violence have now been able to make their tents and have placed an undefinite time between two controls of countries.
However, the deterioration increased.
The police's helicopter remaining above them, immigrants cut "Open the border!" and shouted the damages to the Hungarian mechanical police.
Some refused to protest food and water.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declared that it is "unacceptable to accept" the return of the migrants from Hungary when they arrived to be increased from Macedonia and Greece.
"(Serbia) wants to be a part of a solution, does not cause any damage to civilians.
The debate must be closely with other countries and Brussels," Ivica Dacic said in Praha.
The Czech Republic between the Hungary and Serbian border was born after the 28th group of nationality failed to create a common immigration policy in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed that 400,000 safe places were in the face of people who are now reserved by Italy and Greece, and that the Ministers were going to speak to the final agreement - in the next month or the end of the first year - of which the EU has to take 1200,000 additional places, including part of the Hungary.
The German Alliance Office Angela Merkel and Austria require the summary of the EU Summit, which is discussed in the country's immigration crisis for the next week.
However, Hungary does not hope that its neighbors or Brussels acted in the next days.
On the other hand, two Southern regions gave the authorities greater authority to act in the crisis and the possibility that you can be closed and safeguarded.
At the same time, Peter Ssijarto, Minister for Foreign Affairs, said that now, when the Serbian border is ready, the country will also be able to make a part of the swimming swimming swimming swimming swimming snakes on its borders in Romania to stop immigrants coming through the land.
CBS Newsinağ Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners had been disfellowshipped in order to swallow the swimming pool between Hungary and Serbian.
In recent months, Hungary has become the largest stage and arrival place for refugees in the European Union, many of which are going to fight against Syria and other parts of the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Victor Orban has claimed that the majority of arrivals is the better life of the refugees to seek, and not the poor of armed refugees that are right to protect - this view is strongly struggle with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that arrived in the middle of the night in Hungary are now defined as a crime to exceed or damage the company from 4 meters (13 feet) swimming pools, which has built the government towards the southern border of Serbian, and contain the higher imprisonment for human traffickings condemned.
"The situation caused by the immigration has been proclaimed by the Hungarian government's emergency report," the government informed Zoltan Kovacs to the journalists in the South Szeged city.
We are very clear in this: the overwhelming the border of the Office is a crime.
The Parliament must still be formally accepted for the war planned for the next week, but the Associated Press suppliers have already seen a weak military agent for vehicles and dogs for days.
Gyorgy Bacondi, home security advisor, said that 45 persons were taken by the authorities by trying to overcome the border, and 15 to a deepest land.
They are now a police prisoner, and they are accused of the crimes defined in new laws.
The authorities quickly correct the aid.
The Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven oversight places from Serbia from the coastal border after they sent one of these places to close one of them.
The main border site near Hungary Roszke was cut into the cake when the Hungarians opened a small officer for the processing of humans and the people’s troops struggled in.
Some 20 got inside, but thousands left out.
A group of immigrants supported the main engines between Serbian and Hungary, saying that they refuse to eat and drink until they are allowed to come to Hungary.
2016 Varies: National investigation reported by Hillary Clinton, director of Bernie Sanders, has been shocked on the side
The former Minister of Foreign Affairs Hillary Clinton continues in a two-number democratic appointment chair, but Senator Bernie Sanders circled him.
Clinton is now supported by 47 per cent of democratic voters (absorption of 58 per cent) and the second Sandersia supports 27 per cent (reduced from 17 per cent).
The President Joe Bden has not yet reported whether he would go with his presidency, but it supports 15% of the voters of the Democratics.
Over five months before the beginning of the prevailers, the majority of democratic voters states that it is still too early to say that they would have decided to vote.
However, Clinton's supporters are closer to their own choice than other candidates.
Clinton's recommendation has been calculated in several groups last month after the CBS News Poll survey, and at the same time Sanders have increased some comparison.
Clinton's strongly conducted in women and malicious couples, but his leadership has fallen.
His appeal has been significantly calculated in the couple of men, and Sanders have only 5 percent of the remaining units.
Clinton's prior to 50-year-old democrats have lost, and he is now at the level with Sanders.
But Clinton is clearly leading to the couple of older voters.
In the last month, Clinton led Sanders in a double chapter in the couples of liberals, but now Sanders leads this group with five percentage units.
About half of the democrats of the country say they support Clintonia with enthusiasm if he becomes a party.
The fourth says he supported him, of course, and 15 percent helped him only because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't help him anymore.
It is not very surprising that Clinton's current supporters are likely very encouraging in his support.
The men are more grateful with those who aren't in this moment to make Clintonia just the fourth helped him.
In which 48 percent of the democratic voters say they supported Clintonia with enthusiasm, the one of the Republicns from Donald Trump says the more rare Republican representative (35 per cent).
When Clinton's supporters were asked in the open question why they wanted him to be a candidate, the recommended answer was that he had a suitable experience (16%).
Clinton supporters also reported his contact with Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
Similar opinions and possibility to be selected were also mentioned.
Since the President affects the possibility of presidency, 57% of democratic voters would like to see him already in the kitchen, although the third is different.
The question of the democratic voters who have chosen to be the second party, Bden is the most recommended choice.
Among Clinton's supporters, over half says that they would choose Biden, which is much more favourable than Sanders.
If Bden decides to be without the condition of democratics, Hilary Clinton's leader will grow up. If B's coming, the lead is 20 percent, but if he leaves, chapter 30 is.
55% of the democratic voters believe that Clinton has the best opportunity to win the presidential, but this number has been calculated by 78% last month.
By this measure, Bden remains far, but the parts of those who hold him as voters have grown.
However, when the democratic voters asked what is important for them, they highlighted their views for voteability.
In the last month, no democratic candidates or possible candidates were considered impossible for these voters.
The candidates of democratics or potential candidates are very good in certain keys among their voters.
The majority of Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as honest, reliable and strong leaders.
The skin is in the best honestity, when Clinton's strength is the lead.
30% of democrats say that they do not believe Clintone being honest and reliable, which is more than 15% of Sanders, but 27% say that they do not have the opinion of Sanders.
The Democrats also generally consider that Clinton, Sanders and Bden are ideologically the same agreement.
When we look at all these points, about the fourth democratic voters say that they have no opinion of Sanders.
Although Hillary Clinton’s personal e-mail address and the use of his service as a foreign minister continues to ask questions, the majority of the democratic representatives are satisfied with his explanation and says that the matter has not affected their generality.
However, it is another thing when we look at the Americ as a whole.
The pools of the Americans are now unpleasant to explain him, and only some three are satisfied.
The views of the nation were divided in March early after the matter comes to a breakfast.
Most Americans say that e-mail policy did not affect their totality of Clinton, although 36 per cent of them say that their opinion has been bad.
More than six of the ten Republicans say that their views from Clinton have become worse.
Although the voters of Clinton's own defence hold him honest and reliable, this is still a problem among all registered voters, but only 32% of them are honest and reliable, and this number has been calculated by 8% in the last month and 15% after May.
62% of the registered voters say that they do not believe Clintone being honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55 per cent of the total registered voters of the country also do not consider Trumpia honest and reliable.
But both Clinton and Trumpia are considered well leaders.
The new candidates of Biden, Carsone and Bushi are more honest.
Sanders are precisely considered honest, but many have no view of him, just as not Carson.
There are 6 per cent units in the error marginal study, which participated in 351 democratic voter.
Ben Carson is close to Donald Trumpia in national question
Ben Carson will take Donald Trump near the newest CBS News/New York Times question
Two candidates were collected in the new question half of all the voices, leaving others to fight the passenger.
The representatives of the Republic of the Republic continue to support Trumpia, which has been encouraged to increase in previously, 23% of the question of the CBS published in Fox News in the last month.
However, in the same time, Carson increased from two percent to 23 percent.
The question was also observed that Carson was very good in the couple of different demographic groups and that it is being excluded by the high-educated Republicans of Trump.
The final fields have remained after, unless they were designed Carly Fiorina and Ohion head John Kasichi. The encouragement of the Visconsin Scott Walker has been the largest: from 10 per cent to the current 2 per cent of the last month.
The former President Jeb Bush, the former Archansas, Mike Huckabee, and Senator Marco Rubio, are on the third level in the third place of 6 percent.
Error marginal of this new, 376 Republican voter in September has +/-6 %.
Last week, published by the CNN/ORC question, Carson showed that it was in the question: he has 19% encouragement from the Republics, and Trump has 32% before him.
According to the newest ABC News/Washington Post, Trump was significantly above Carsone.
Carson's recommendation last week, Trump criticizes the remaining neurochirurgy in an accident, although Carso asked for forgiveness of Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Sunday with his campsite in Iowa.
Five members of the Brothers are accused of the death of the first year of the student Baruch College
About two years after a student died in the pinsylvanian Pocono Mountains area of the brotherhood, murder has been raised against five people.
In New York City, the members of the Ambassador of the College Pi Delta Psi were assertedly during Chun "Michael" Denig membership in September 2013, and then moved to his hospital when he carried out, so later effects on his death, the police said.
The authorities say that Denig's eyes were shocked and then he was shocked over 13-kill rings, after which he was repeatedly shocked into the land when he tried to walk on the left game towards the land.
Finally, Deng decided that his head was lost, and then he lost his mind.
The brother’s members did not call at the emergency number of Denig, but, according to the accused, they waited for an hour before they brought him to the hospital, the police says.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, search for information on their symptoms, and to contact the President of the brothership with Andy Mitch asking that advice, the police chief Chris Wagner reported in the pressing situation.
"There were the members who began to hide their ritual resources, and therefore, in practice, they placed a brother's well-being before Michael Denig," said the chief Wagner.
The Deng couldn't be able to get, and she died next morning.
According to the mortality protocol of Deng, the shooting of the shooting was struck in the head, in the guard and on the shooting.
"A lot of families have been able to suffer from the brotherhood, when at least one student has died since 1970," said Doug Fierberg, representative lawyer of the Denig family, in his opinion.
The brothers and their members must be responsible, and this step of the authorities is important.
The large cluster of Monroe's area was on the side of the fact that the first five members were accused of murdering the third position.
32 The other members of the brother, including Me, are also accusated of violent simplification and criminal drinking.
"We don't want to obtain the responsibility only to individuals, but if there is an organization that accepts the situation officially or indirectly, they should also be responsible," Wagner stated in that press.
Baruch College speaked to the Brotherhood and the National Brotherhood.
This happens when the United States Central Bank increases the rate
The rate of prices will be, and the markets of the increased rates will fall, the production of debt papers will be increased and the economy must be declined.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it's going or how long it's going to be.
The past does not just give help in terms of the schedule, which will be called to the economy.
Only 11 months after the first income of the seat, sometimes the income has passed as long as 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the US Central Bank has been often, although not always, to determine how the economic and financial resources reacted.
As a result, the officials of the United States Central Bank have so much pressured that investors should not be focused on it because the higher levels are starting to increase, but nearly to normalize the situation in the development chain.
Indeed, there are several changes.
However, the market shares may notify that all higher rates related to the coherence have been exceededed.
"The first global economic crisis of the Central Bank is unfortunately referred to in some areas to the end of the 'low money' period," said the report of Capital Economy global issues at Julia Jessop in the communication to customers.
Instead, we are not expecting that the United States' estimate returns to normal, even though still low, but there is a so-called reason for many feeling afraid.
However, this does not mean whether it does not affect it.
There is a view to how some economic parts of the regions will be reacted on the basis of the previous development:
As the market has been seen in the last few months, the expectation of the highlights can make the situation unfortunately.
When the emphasis comes to the reality, it is not very dramatic.
"Declares that the capital product has an effort to stop on 12-24 months after the first reiteration, which may be reflected again in the monetary policy," the German bank analysts said in this investigation on what happens after the rating of the Central Bank.
In fact, in the last 35 years the markets are generally strong, at about 14% when the approach is highlighted, 250 days later, the situation is very balanced (the average increase of 2,6 %) and the normal status has been reached by 500 days after the average product in two last cycles in 14.4 %, is reported in the analysis of Bob Doll, which was published in the newspaper of Barron.
According to Deutche Bank, the impact on the shares is generally clearer in the late stage of the cycling cycle when the products start.
Those are part of the economic life, but the rates often promote them.
In the present situation, the central banks have some challenges that have not previously been, and which can be able to slow down.
This is in particular a brutal population product that will be closer to the level of all times before the Central Bank’s incentive.
According to the German Bank, the 118-year-old NCB in 1950 has been only twice less than 4,5 %.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 %, it is rarely believed that when the third fourth has increased by 1.5 %, the Atlantic Alliance Bank reports.
The expenditure of the costs in the budgetary seat may be dangerous and urge a question of "is this one different", German Bank stated.
The market shares have been funded to highlight the Central Bank throughout the year, and all of them will wait for the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which will be finished in the tour.
Although many strategies and economic advisers believe that the Committee can accept the emphasis on this meeting, the smooth trade is only 25% of the probability.
"We have shown that since 1950, all the cycling cycles have been repeatedly increased in the supersykls in which BKT has increased their higher upwards very quickly after the starting of breathing", reports.
On the other hand, there has been an exceptional long-term approach, which has been the worst time of observation.
In the current cycle, the Central Bank has been expected to have been overly expected to end the last time: an overview has been 35 months, and now it has already been 74 months.
The coal product was also insufficient when expected that the markets were highlighted, and the model reminds some considerations made in comparison with the capital.
It is mainly that when the Central Bank changes its lines, its effects are more rapid than the shares.
The direction of the products of the letters appears to be immediately changed on the first point of the cycle.
At the end of the recommendation cycle, the product of debt documents is immediately calculated," Deutche Bank said.
Charles Schwab strategies believe that the rates of higher and short-term debts are caused by the approach of the products of the product, and therefore by the level of production.
High-produced bond books often produce better in such situations, although "we are, however, careful for the search of the product", said the analysis of the frozen product in Kathy Jones in one analysis.
Incredibly, Jones believes that the markets have already been adapted to the line outputs of the Central Bank.
"In addition to the rate of the Dollar strength and inflation expectations, there are several indications that the markets have adjusted the more strictly financial policy", he wrote.
The short-term rates are higher, the product is more balanced, the credit margins have grown and the insecurity has grown - all of these are qualified to the market when the Central Bank has stolen its line.
Generally, undertakings in which companies are invested in capital to the United States will win when the rates are increased and local products are more attractive.
Multinational enterprises who have a lot of debt are worse when the value of the dollar increases their products in the world markets, and their costs are more than what they have.
"The history shows that the 'inhabitants' components are usually the most productive after three months of the first highlight", analysts of Goldman Sachs performed in their report on customers.
Enterprises with a strong trade change had a weak business change in 1994, 1999 and 2004 after a average of five percentage units.
Enterprises with high capital production and low volatility shares were better performed than lower quality companies. Firstly, the average values were 4 (percentage units) and 3 (percentage units).
The brother's going to be a big problem.
Those who have a lot of responsibilities are mostly lost, Goldman said.
There is also the possibility of consumers to benefit from the increase of the value of the dollar.
The legislators can also win the delay of larger products, although the experts are different from how fast the impact is felt.
BBC Radio is copy of Classic FM, mediator Andrew Bingham says
Conservation Citizen Andrew Bingham accused of the channel of civilization.
He claims that the separation of the commercial competitor will become more difficult.
In addition, he took the BBC Music Awards money in telling them that they only travel to British Awards payments
National College Damien Collins criticize The Voicea saying that it is not own
BBC Radio 3 is "reverse" as Classic FM, claims the pressure of the additional production company that it makes something that commercial production companies do not do.
The conservative citizen Andrew Bingham also said to BBC's leaders that the radio channel of public service affected the content of the "building" civilians and that it is still more difficult to differ from commercial competitors.
"It seems that Radio 3 - I wouldn't want to use the term "Classic FM", he said.
He also took his stars in the BBC Music Awards payment, which was launched last December.
"BBC Music Awards launched last year affects only different names under the organized British Awards gallery.
So if you're trying to do something different, there are two examples directly to remember when in itself you just copy something that you already find from the market," Bingham said.
The Chairman of the BBC reaffirmed that BBC Radio 3 is a lot of commercial packaging to share life music and information to the citizens.
Radio 3 teaches such things from classic music that I can't learn from anything else.
Its commitment to living music and music is in itself the primary class.
"Anyway, I think it's really important that Radio 3 has committed to find a new music and to place new works", he said.
Previously, this year, Alan Davey, head of the BBC Radio 3, stated that the channel must work more than before to go to the public, because the Britishs know the less classic music.
However, radio 3 was not the only part of the provider of BBC that criticizes the funds of commercial competitors during the consultation of the Commission of Cultural, Media and Sport.
The Voicea, a civilist of the Conservative Tory Party, criticizes The Voice, a musical competitor whose BBC purchased from the Hollandic production company from Talpa Media by 22 million reds.
Do you understand why this programme is often discussed because it is not original, and isn't it any more personal?
Lordi Hall said that this BBC1 canadian program, which operates as Paloma Faith and Boy George, has been produced in the "BBC style".
He adds that he wants the producer's company "to find success inside his own house" next time it starts a reward.
However, he did not agree to prevent the production of the future The Voice times, or to decide that the money of the licensors would be used to other forms of reward.
On August, Black Friday may be reasonable
Network sale increased 7% in 2015 in the first three months
In the last month, the increase has been increased after the start of the statistics in 2000.
3 years ago the network sale confirmed the use of mobile devices for purchase
Experts believe that Black Friday can smoke with consumption in November
Official services have been slowly grown over ten years and have changed many of the buying cities in Britain.
However, experts say that there are marks on the decline of net sales now when the latest numbers showed only 7 per cent increases in the first 2015 year.
In May 2000, the total growth increased at least five percent from the last year.
Experts say that there are marks on the decline of net sales when the latest numbers showed only 7 per cent increases in the first year of 2015.
"If we consider growth rates for the past years and return to 2000, it was clear that the situation would be rational for the latest." Andy Mulcahy, provider of JMRG sales index, reported to Guardian.
He explained that three years ago the net sale was strengthened when the buyers began to use their mobile cells for the purchase.
It means that most people were buying online, and that they could be able to do in different environments, such as sweet.
But now it's leveld, and (created) can be counted.
The Black Friday show from the United States has been held behind the long-term trade.
Experts believe that consumers are shocking the purchase work before the last day of November.
Last year, the normal average value of five times more buyers parabled to their computers to catch trades in many trade websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, who received the buyers to strike the findings, can smoke the purchase work.
The British Retail Consortium published that only one of the five items were used online.
A number of products such as television and pesticides, more than the third purchase are now being made on network trade.
At the same time, more than fourty persons buy clothes and kids instead of using the purchased model chain.
Muslims enter the deaths of the Meca snake, the consequences of Bin Laden’s family
Muslims had 29 dead bodys during the first feasts in Mexico.
Saudi Arab has, partly, accused of the destruction of the structure of Saudi Binlad Group
The Ministry of Health reported that the total of 394 people had been injured when the shock was shocked down.
29 When hundreds of Muslims gathered together with them, the victims died, when the shooting was slaughtered in the great Muslims of Mecah.
Mostly, the murders slaughtered in the white slaughter filled the journey to respect the first dead who made their last journey on the Al-Moisem beast.
The painful passage took a holy place, where only a few days ago the shock was shocked through the disappearing of the mosque and slaughtered the servants.
The bodys were released to defeat when the Saudi Arab king strengthened the guilty of the Building Congress of Bin Laden, which also affected 394 people.
In the major muscle of the mechanics, the slaughter of the 29 body of the slaughter of the slaughter of the slaughter.
The four sons of death had Qasim Akram from Manchester's region. He was in his first sanctuary when the slope was slaughtered.
Akram was in the biggest muscle with his parents prior to the beginning of the year's swimming skin.
Saudi authorities have already censed that the hair of Mekka continues when thousands continue to arrive in the city.
Today King Salman stated that the Binlad Group should not leave the guard of the nostor when it was not used.
The Saudi Press Agency, published in the Arab version of the Decision, stated that the Binlad Group was partly a cause for the destruction.
The English Service of the News Agency did not mention this detail, but it was said that the company leaders were prohibited to travel to foreign countries.
Preceding this week, Salman urged to find out what caused the decay of shoes to a large muscle, where hundreds of thousands of muslims were gathered before this month later.
The Binlad Group has not published information on the destruction of the raw materials, and its representatives have not been obtained for comments.
The king's decision also condemned that it did not use the filters at the same time and did not cooperate with the meteorological authorities.
The Meca is around the large mosquitoes, which are part of the powerful construction structure, which is leading to the Binlad Group.
Binladin's family has been close to the Saudi Arab government family for decades, and it leads to large construction projects.
At the same time, Al-Qaida, the leader of Osama bin Laden, was a rebellious son whose family was prohibited in the 1990s.
Romanism was in an winter and swimming rule only days before millions of people arrive to the Kingdom for the sacredness of the Kingdom, which every Muslim that can be done at least once in life.
The authorities say that 158 people are still in the hospital.
The authorities estimated a million references (174,000 pounds) to the own of the dead and permanently injured.
The other blessed ones get half of this.
B&Q-popular says that the workers working for Eastern European authorities are a favorite
The Britishs still use more support services, Veronique Laury says
The number of professionals from Eastern Europe is behind the growth
As a search for professionals, Screwfix trade is opened to 200 more
At the same time Kingfisher closes 60 B and Q-shirt around the country
writer Rupert Steiner, the principal letter changer for the Daily Mail newspaper
Britain is said to be able to make households of the European Eastern Employees in their domestic laws and their maternal pensions, and to be more pleasantly paid.
It looks like if you're a key with the shooting or find the walls, you're in the minority today.
The Britishs are seeing more appealers to handle the tee-sea work at their homes, tells B&Q's boss.
The new Director of Kingfisher, who owns the home-to-level trade chain, said that the recommendation is the number of employees in Eastern Europe and that they provide their services for their bigger prices.
This leads to the planning of Kingfisher to open 200 new employees for screwfix and closing 60 B and Q.
Laury said she wants to want more women to work at the B&Q salesmen, since eight of ten purchase decisions are named as the most beautiful part of the sex.
Today the biggest part of personal life is men.
He said that changes in the population must be taken into account: there is now more women's households that make more households than before.
Laury said, "The biggest part of our selling person is still men.
We need to get better balance.
However, the pools of our customers are women, and 80% of the purchasing decisions of the products are women.
Women have a great role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of the only five women who lead the most important firms of the British FTSE100 index, which has rebuild its leading group because it has a lot of men and women's groups.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which the group has about 50 per cent of women, including the Chief and the Financial Director.
Laury said, "This was a knowledgeable decision... the difference is important here.
It wasn't difficult to find good women in the leading group."
Kingfisher reported the calculation of both the products and sales after the group took the costs of the closure of soldiers to its necks.
Trend results as Screwfix and B&Q owners Kingfisher is to open 200 new traffic
The third government decided to resolve the compulsory legislation to save the economy of the country.
Even soon the visible effects could be shown.
The sharp decision of the SAK and other NGOs began to impose the same step and, as a result, the country stands on the basis of the wide notice of employees on Wednesday afternoon.
Many time think that it will also be reasonable.
Let's ask if it supports the laws when it's going badly.
It has even been founded in the contradictor.
More than 500,000 people in the network have already been reporting that they are not going to participate in the imagination but to work.
At the time of a good consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no net where protesting, but openly proclaiming richly would have been a small political suicide for humans.
Military professional organizations are not a lot of moments of protest of some ten thousands of people, but it gives it a reason for thinking.
The position of vocational access is no longer as clear as still for a couple of years.
All don't know the goals of the movement to their own, values have changed
In view of the interestfulness of the work of the ship, the boundary solutions of the government can also be seen as a direct gift to heaven.
When things have shown their own pressure for years, we will finally enable the rights of the employee to defend, visually and honestly.
The government may likely want to defeat the role of the cycling movement when the membership in the Professional Union is seeing the cases more necessary.
Whatever the organizations agree, it's not to say that the opinion on the birthday would stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped.
For example, industrial production has been calculated for 31 months.
Great people's production continues to reduce, and unemployment increases.
You thought you had to force all of these things.
Slow rate of emissions to the university of labourbuilding: 8.5 million expenditure, staff decreased by 130
The technical university of the Lampebuilding will start a resource currency aimed at obtaining the cost of €8,5 million.
In particular, the University of the University will initiate all the nuclear negotiations on staff with the objective of restructuring of 6.5 million annually.
This means reducing about 130 employees.
Other activities are intended to resolve more than two million.
The financial budget of 2016, which predicts 8,5 million of new operations, is undertaken by the undertaking of the negotiations.
It also affects the government's financing sectors.
In this account, the university makes about 2,6 million results.
Consumers will grow a little for the next year, but the funding of the ministerial area is reduced by 2 million and other financing by EUR 3,2 million.
The overall budget of the university is about 85 million euros, so the budget plan is ten per cent of the total budget.
It is very important for our university to learn and investigate, and to reduce the coefficient effects of business financing, says Dr. Anneli Pauli University in information.
Before long, the effects of the surgery were more moderate, but now the reduction of supplementary funding appears in new measurements.
The negotiations with confidence men will be initiated in the next week and they will sustain the six weeks of law.
Over: Onnibus wants to finnish rail
Halpabus Company Onnibus's owner, British Sir Brian Souter tells Yle that the company will also be covered in Finland.
I'm very interested to go with the Finnish roots.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest radar transport companies in the United Kingdom, Souter says.
The root transport must be opened to competitively.
First, in the mountain, it is the nearest area of the capital cities in 2017-2018.
After the neighborhood, you're in the mountain.
Subter has already told the Minister for Transport.
The Ministry of Transport is considered to be welcomed by the Onnibus plans.
At least transdev (ancient Veolia), which has such a bus transport in Finland and rail transport in other parts of Europe, has reported other international interests in other international companies.
The United States Central Bank must make decisions on higher rates
Another world will follow on the page when the United States Central Bank is assembled for two days a mid-week and struggle to make a critical decision whether they will raise higher rates for the first time for about ten years.
In Reuters' question, a few more than half of those who still believed that the Central Bank was in the last week, now believe that the situation is still not resolved and highlighted at the current level of 0-0.25%.
This has a historic event, since when the Central Bank has operated the rates to zero, it is seven years.
The first time we are approaching the situation in which the central banks have the possibility to get out of null and start normalization of higher rates", said Angel Ubide, Peterson Institute for International Economics Institute, senior fellow.
The United States economy has been relatively well-being, and it has produced a few billion dollars of balances and a little inflation.
However, the bank cannot take attention to less rare global views.
It has warned the markets that they should be prepared to be income, but it also shows them that the likelihoods are highlighted.
The decision shall be published at 20.00 p.m. (CET).
Delta State University's shooter left an apologic message
When he shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Wednesday after the same day, Shannon Lamb wrote a message that said he was "devil" about the first murder and hoped that "to be able to cut it", they told the authorities as a stage.
Mississippi's police reported that the teacher of Delta State University's geographic and social science and the Lamb called an emergency number from about ten morning.
Wednesday, he told him he shot and killed someone.
The Lamb told the respondent that the police had to send the officers to his home.
He said "her wife last night" and also said that in the house there's a "small dog," which "not hurt anybody," but it's probably confused.
The police asked the caller's name, but he didn't tell it.
The Lamb didn't explain to the shoot.
When the police came to the place, there was 41-year-old Amy Prentiss' body, and a message written by Lambi, 45-year-old, which reads: "I'm so sorry I'm so sorry that I could pull it.
I loved Amya and she was the only person who ever loved me."
When the message was written, the Lamb traveled about 500 miles [500 km] to the Delta State where he killed his historical observer Ethan Schmidt before finally killed herself as a late afternoon when the police was designed him.
Professor William LaForge said that it wasn't between Lambi and Schmidt to know that there was any conflict, but "speakly Lambi's thinking was something."
The authorities said that, despite the statements published on Monday, the Lamb had believed in the relationship with Schmidt was not "weakened or evidence" of any "third Draft".
Shawn O'Sten told her being married to Princess about seven years old and described her "some man".
A couple left 15 years ago, but he remained a friend.
O'Sst told him and Princess had a 19-year-old daughter who was "burned."
O'Sten told that Princess and his daughter were "the best friends every day."
According to Linsday Knowles, Princess worked at his home online. Sun Herald says that he was a close friend of Princess.
Knowles reported that Princess, who had a dog named Lightning, had been seen with Lambi for about three years.
"He always wanted to help others," knowles said.
The police told the family Lambi's call to a family who had to meet the lunch to tell them that "Don't go to prison."
When the police aimed at Lambi’s Kingdom at 1 Greenville after the same night, Lamb stopped his car on the way, left it and went to the forest where he shot himself.
The Lamb claimed about the educational science of Delta States on Thursday 2015, reports the list of the university’s websites.
Stars that lost their power of astraction
The viewer (left), picture with his son Redmond (right), has been sweet over the last few years.
In 2001 he was sick to Leukemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
According to drugs, he also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested by drug management.
All such things really require their taxes.
Manchester United Luke Shaw is outside months because of double destruction
Luke Shaw took two murders to his right feet Manchester United to the PSV Endhoven in the battle of the Meester.
Although the defender left in a shock and is at least six months outside, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will be coming to play still in this period.
In 15 minutes after the 20-year-old Shaw was inflicted in the PSV region, the Vamman caused Hector Morenon holtiton.
He was treated 9 minutes in the field, and he was forced to give the acid before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has two murders in his feet and he's in the hospital now."
She'll be moved tomorrow or maybe after the day, and then we'll be shocked in Manchester.
It's a horrible thing. The boy comes to Manchester as a 18-year-old age, suffering difficulties, and then plays slightly, and now it comes.
When I was in the bathroom, he was on the hair.
He's crying.
I'm not a doctor, but there's at least half a year of double murder, and he's not playing in the slowest stage.
I hope he's going to play this time.
Morano was affected by happiness when he got a red card and a punishment.
Decorative Nicola Rizzoli did not punish a mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian employee was wrong.
You can judge the situation when I say that it was a punishment and a red card.
It was a bad two-way explanation.
Shaw tweeted: "Thank you to all your messages, you don't have enough words to tell me how crazy I am, my arrival begins now, I'll come back as stronger."
Regarding the question: Manchester United suffers of the case of Luke Shaw and losses PSV
The English Defender has an additional recognition for the accession of European mastership competitions in France next June.
PSV's trainer Phillip Cocu said, "It's really bad."
If somebody player gets out for such a worst thing, they're all very painful.
Our player's purpose is never to struggle the opposite.
Moreno's leg struggled when he played a Mexican team against Van Gaal's Holland in 2014 MM questions.
"Moreno takes this pregnantly, because it is not intended to hurt the opposite, and when he hears that wealth is really bad, it's bad, " said Cocu.
I didn't see that in the situation.
The only thing that I saw was a pillar that was going to different directions, so he [Moreno] would have touched it, but I did not see Luke’s back.
Moreno said to SBS6, "I know what it feels, I know how hard this thing can be.
"I'm so sorry for this, I'm so sorry."
Andrés Guardado was also transferred to the hospital with Chris Smalling.
Why David Cameron knows Lorax better about this?
Each parent has learned soon: If your child loves a book, it will not be long before he learned almost outside.
So just if you're David Cameron.
When the services offered for childhood were asked to the Prime Minister of his favorite book, he chosen the history of the protection of the environment published in 1971.
The choice was difficult, Cameron writes on the websites of SuperCamps company in the public message and continues: "Easy, adverse, creating and contained a strong message. I like to read this book to my children, because it is always feeling a image or message that we have never seen."
All this is true, but the next chapter, in which Cameron is unfortunately described by the book, is a efficacy of the 2012 film version, which has been filled with a very short text of the original text and details.
"In the city of Tarville, where everything has lost and even air is commercial goods, Ted's son hopes to gain his dreams in the heart of Audrey's hope to see the right tree," the text states and describes a lovely man who died in 1991, the right name of Theodor Seuss Geisel, did not write.
If this is not sufficiently suspected, Cameron's text listens to the place as it would be taken by the Internet Movie Database Internet on the drinking photo of Lorax, which begins to: "In the city of the Tarville inside the murs, where all is methodic and even air is commercial, the Ted son hopes that his dreams will be able to get on the side of the heart of the Audrey girl."
In view of Cameron's publicly active parent, it is uncertain that he would be so unfair to drink a book. There, the youth of the names hears how the local nature has destroyed the shoes, trees shocked and needed to smile Kerskane, unlike the story of a short name, the sweet of Lorax, which was "sweet in favour of the trees".
This relatively visible PR work is likely to be foreigned to the assistant who has apparently never read a book 20 times from the child.
The Director of Directors said that the text was linked to Cameron's office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's personality, but not commented about it at that time.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger to stay on the page of the English team, but it was still a hard place.
Playing against Pakistan has a strong task in the Arabians, but when you see what team the English team has chosen to round, I don't believe that the last 3-0 series is likely to be repeated.
I didn't close the guest from the counts.
A half of the Cook may have experienced less than a team over three years, but there is a strong way of thinking of good routines and teams: they have no idea in 2012, just a youth positiveness.
Moeen Ali is developed in circulation and Adil Rashid is an attacking option, although it is an unknown factor at this level.
Regarding the question: Adam Lyth threw from the English critical team, his condition will come to Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth's team is very difficult to analyze me because I am his headquarters in the Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good attackers in situations that could be deceived, and the simple but the truth is that the critical players are valued on the basis of their results.
For example, Joe Root had no incertitude before information, because, as I previously said, the players are the best factors of the choice.
About a hundred more points, and Lyth had been able to continue in the team, but he was responsible for his own goal.
I hope, if he gets more walks to the Yorkshire, the second chance is to come forward.
The English Chief Trevor Bayliss was the place of Lyth when he did not do so as much as he could, and it is not surprised me. Lyth is mostly a team player.
It's difficult to answer questions how long the slaughter is to leave the rest.
Lyth was elected seven times in the country team, such as Sam Robson before him, once again Nick Compton was elected nine times.
Only Compton had the opportunity to play as well as home and visits.
The only question of the complaint is that the English chose Jonathan Trotti first to the Caribbean when Lyth was in the highest, but it is now the last time.
Alex Hales comes with me, and there's a shooting that I'm worth it.
He has a cricket player of something we had seen in the West of New York in this time when he made 236 points against us in the Trent Bridge field.
He must, at least, give the same opportunity as others before him, but this really depends on the meeting of the team in the Arab Middle East in the United States.
There was a shocked idea from Moeen in the shocking car, near the Cook, where the field could be extra consumed but four speeds could be held, and I'm not against this.
I don't understand why the kids could shoot there, and this left-handed has already proved to be a very critical player.
It doesn't necessarily make her task in its creature in Worcestershir, but he's a third of them and there's no difference.
My old teamfriend Justin Langer played the first 38 games in the first castle before moving to the open in 2001.
He did three hundred points immediately, and you didn't remember the past.
Zafar Ansari will be a shooter of the team, and, the little thing I've been doing with him, he feels very effective of a young man.
People can look at his beautiful statistics - the average value 31, with the 35th ball, and think that it is a threat, but there is no too much food and choices that have chosen young people.
He learned a lot in this round.
Outside a little, England seems to have a few hard additions to the trainer.
The appointment of the Sri Lanka slaughter Mahla Jayawarden for consult games can be shown as a neuro-slaughter.
He is one of the most pleasant friends of the game, and it meets a huge number of experiences, because it has done everything in all situations and all attacks.
Paul Collingwood will join the white ball games, and it brings together both energy and unregular displacement.
I always thought that he was born to be together in the international critics, then it was playing or training, and he has the same useful intellect as Mahel.
Sometimes the new voices in the swimming room may be able to run the teams, although their message would be the same as previously.
Colly's Aviation of Durha, Ben Stokes, will be shut up in one day, root was given the same torch against Australia, and I have at least no problem with this.
Although all are not the same, trainers and elections do not make timetables.
And you should remember that just like players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions have never been made so far.
The support of the United Kingdom (Brexit) from the European Union may be able to be able to overcome if the economy is in difficulties in 2017
David Cameron's half-first renewal strategies for the maintenance of the British Union are still more challenges, although it would not take into account even the heart of Jeremy, "Isn't it or not?", the election of Corbyn to the Headquarters of the Centre for Employment or Employees in Europe.
And foreigners have their own Corbyn and Nigel Farage.
The European diplomatics rather explained that since the EU is in so deeply different crises, all of which is not its own reasons, some Member States have sought to be in the UK's self-especially agenda, which is full of consents and adverse changes that these States do not want to be larger.
In Britain's annual meeting, the Central Organization of Professional Interests decided that there is no desire for them if they were slaughtered for social protection.
We couldn't call it Daven and George's self-geenage.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of State Securities shall late for the high-school meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign cities, taking its image before the local memory mark, or without her, and then come home, saying that they will win supporters for reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend who wants to look out in the EU-Brittanian Union - "Do not leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that the most shortest ministers and officers of certain capital cities are now in such a point that they do not care for our way.
Angela Merkel, a careful and modest partner in Germany, has been an alliance, but has been ten years of authority and wants to leave his step before it goes to the pile as it happened too long to thatchers (11 years), Mediterranean (14) and Kohli (16).
France François Holland has a re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's also a swimming force.
Poland may have a national legal government, Spain left.
It is difficult to see these countries to sacrifice self-electrics when their energy would be supported more than planning to prevent Scotlands from the source of the United Kingdom - they do not want it to be because of their own separation guidelines.
Thus, my friend presents that some of these ministers may even be designed to make no useful comments on the skotlan national style of the Ison-Britannia in 2017 in order to accelerate the Brexit process.
"Review negotiations have been organized and there was no meaning for the British Reviews."
The Europeans have experienced slightly how the newspaper of Fleet Street is part of and how the EU-skeptic newspapers are, as they were not inspired by Tony Benn in 1975, when our membership began to be strengthened in the relationship 2.1 in 1973.
They can pleasantly recall Boris Johnson, the largest European candidate, who made its own name by writeing "the largest bananas of the EU" at the beginning of the 1990s in Brussels.
Ed Miliband may be a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They were part of a booking number of taxes visiting vejaers, foreign people who have hacked their phones, as well as persons who have a homeplace in other parts and who own the largest part of our largest newspapers.
Tony Blair thinked of them at the same time, but he knew that if you're in a slight gorge with the gorge, the bananas must be able to get up because of the smile, if you want to be on the lunch of this gorge, and later on a day.
Indeed, Miliband was more blair than Blair itself, which will be opposed to the renewal of Cameron, and a bar had, on behalf of the principle of the Constitution of the European Constitution, which the French and Hollanian voters rejected in 2005 and thus gave Blair the issue of exit.
The newspaper never let him forgive.
But the dear Jeremy Corby, who met me friendly at Westminster's parliamentary account on Monday (I told him that he has no longer time to condemn me for me), seems to have a danger to repay the Mordoch Strategy of Neil Kinnock in the 80s.
Although it can take time, however, he must develop a coherent strategy to keep connecting to the media. Not me, but doubtless, Andrew Marri, whose BBC association Corby came on Sunday.
The official position of Corbyn in Europe is beautifully developed.
He says that we would like to remain in the reform of the EU.
Well, the largest part of the United Kingdom's self-defence partnership in the U.S. war into the U.S. Military Instinct and the most disgraceful nationality outside the Conservation Party can certainly be set on the basis of this view.
Hilary "Ben, but not Ben-fani" said in radio and television this week, when his internal party would like to admit that Corbyn's choice to appoint John McDonnell as the minister of State Security.
It reminded me of the 70th century when his father's television stripped me to be unfaithful against his government partners, without that it would go so long that it would lose his government.
Hylary paintings were more shocking.
But on the other hand, the fight is that we're staying in "the situation where it's good" - the statement of Benn - wasn't what McDonnell said, and not all the conclusions of what Corby told the heads and people in private meetings on Monday night.
Anything that is an inherent, accurate and personal image that Corby wants to describe (remember that even in me), it is important for the currency of the communication during the period of surround-earth television, and in particular in the social media orders, which are an accurate growth in persecution and breasts.
As McDonnell has said, it is just the right to be not to give Cameron an expression to Europe by allowing him to support the Working Party in the people's vote campaign clearly.
Simon Jenkins's at least thinking like that.
But McDonnell and Corbyn are based on the EU membership (and in line with their Benn's economy and their anti-kapitalist past) is no longer difficult to discuss the couple of the linksmen whose narism of small differences is a key dogma in channels.
With regard to his two-party, Tom Watson (Tom Watson has convinced that it is not a Corby campaign to rely on), foreign diplomats must only try to explain it to its exemplary.
Why would Paris or Berlin be able to support the political capitals (and they have unbelievable voters) granted to the United Kingdom when it can be totally disappointed?
The United States have already been struggled by a weak military execution in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in the power of the reducing conservative government, as I was reminded in the launch of the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticized the public Health Electronics Rating of the Public Health of England
Researchers have said that the State financed Agency claims that electric smokes are less harmful than traditionally, and that there was an initial 12-animal meeting with a part of the smoking industry.
The British Medical Journal (BMJ) experts contacted the use of the certificates used in their reports for electricity shuttles in Lancetin.
The PHE has published this "virus peculiarity" report in the last month, which describes it "two to be regarded as a certificate."
However, many researchers have investigated the sustainability and communications between certain experts and smoking industry.
The Medical Time Journal Lancet published the last month a chapter that was rejected by the head decision of the PHE 's headquarters'.
Two other researchers written in BMJ have considered whether the arguments were "structed for a ball or a skin."
London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Professor Martin McKee, and professor of the University of Liverpool clinical epidemiology, Simon Capewell say: "The main principle of the health of nationals is that functions must be based on evidenceful efficiency."
They say that the public expects that the PHE claims that the electrical smoke is at least 95% less harmful than traditional smokes, based on the detailed assessment and model of the certificate.
In fact, it will be a 12-century meeting with a multi-critical decision-making model (MCDA) to synchronize their views of the problems associated with different Nicotin products, and the results of this meeting were intensified.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was the company named EuroSwiss Health, whom the Director is informed of the financing previously received from the Brussels American Tobacco company for an independent investigation.
He also supported the health capacity of BAT in the Sustainability Report, they say.
One of the 12 meetings reported about the financing of the manufacturer of the electric smoke, but not the financing that it was previously reported to the smoke company Philip Morris International will increase.
The elements of the selection of the members of the panel are not reported, but a number of known electrical supporters in the panel, some also reported about the financing of their research.
Other places have not been known for their expertise in the monitoring of smoke.
He also participated in the meeting by the Director of the Cigarette of PHE.
The research produced by the group "speakly recognised," says McKee and Capewell, in the majority of the products and most of the criteria, is the lack of "unreceived certificates cocktails for the most important part of the products and most criteria."
However, no such communications or limitations shall be mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell claims that "we have no evidence that the electrical tuberculosis operates on the road to smoke with children or non-smoking."
Professor Kevin Fenton of PHE's health and well-being said that the claims submitted in BMJ have been answered before.
He says, "Electronics are significantly less deteriorate than burning."
You're gonna smell your life's smokes to die their dependance.
All proofs indicate that the health risks caused by electric tuberculosis are relatively small, but we must continue to investigate long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public of what the certificate appears and what it does not appear, especially when the relative risks of smoke are so much public intelligence.
About 800,000 people die annually on smoking disease and smoking pay for NHS to $2 billion.
By explaining the current certificate material, namely, although electrical tuberculosis are not unreasonable, their deficiencies are only part of the traditional tuberculosis of the murdering tuberculosis - we shall comply with our national responsibility area.
The BBC will support the end of EastEnders, says the former Championship 4
The former chairman Luke Johnson said that BBC should stop programs such as EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would "don anything" from such "nothing" in the street of Albert Square.
Johnson said that the license should only be used for programs that other employees of the British Shipping activities do not.
He criticizes BBC that it will establish public services programs which probably have a smaller public publicity, the most difficulty to combat competitors' programs and channels, as well as the channels of BBC4.
After the BBC's chief Tony Hall said to want to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson said that he had home to Chanel 4 for six years to create a relationship with BBC in the meantime.
"I don't know that BBC will produce and send programs that were clearly agreed to non-subventional competitors," Johnson said to the above room's communication committee to the BBC's future research.
If the license is held - and I'm not sure that it would be a good idea to this message or a long-term idea - it should, at least, be limited to the production of programs that others do not and do it.
The Voicea is sent to the most important time of speech, since it is intended to collect as much support as possible.
The thought that nobody else would seem to be a programme, it's ridicule, it's clearly higher.
Johnson said: "I don't understand why return tax should finance programs that could also be funded without State support.
The Voice is one of the same and the other EastEnders, without forgiveness in the house.
Other channels, as they say, would give anything about it.
I don't understand how this is about the shipment of the public service.
I don't think it's going to be weakening any BBC.
The serialist Johnson, conducted in the channel for 2004-2010, said that BBC is guilty of the forests "for the purposes of people working in this area, and because they believe that it is the best way to achieve long-term support."
He commented on BBC's most recommended series, remembering the comments of Tony Ballin's former director. He used its 2003 MacTaggart book in Edinburgh to suggest that BBC was mysing series like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC's smallest public public public services programs "involve BBC4, which often cannot measure the number of viewers, but BBC is therefore fulfiling their responsibility area and can then be able to make 4 billion of punctuary expenditure, when defence, that 'the fact is that we do all these unknown programs that no one considers'."
They're putting them into the place where no one will never be looking for them.
Johnson said to the committee: "I want you to search for the most back-up system who receives the most opposite to it.
Of course, you all think, we all think that 150 reds have a lot of opposition in the year, but I don't know if it's the place for people who have 150 pounds of money, because they're not going to use the BBC.
The former director David Elstein, David Elstein, who also confirmed the committee as a stage, said that BBC should re-evaluate its temporary task to "inform, training and comfort Reithi".
He said that only a small part of the BBC's production is now classified as a education - he said that the numbers are 1% of television production and 0.1% of the radio - and that it should take a model of Australia and Canada's general radios and change their task to "intelligence, selection and comfort".
What would be towards partnerships, Elstein said that BBC should focus more on events like Proms-consistent, which, according to him, are shown on only some of the people in the television, and join with commercial companies so that all of these would be considered online.
"Audience" allows the brain management of the brain cells through the sound systems
The video shows how the sound switchs change the direction immediately when the sound-impress is part of them.
Researchers have increased countries with genetically modified neurosystems so that they can be controlled by sound-to-up.
Small sugars change the direction immediately when they get the sound imple, which is too high to hear the human snake.
Impulses operate by switching genetically modified business nerve cells with ultrasonians reacting skins.
Relevant to the article: Researchers read and write brain activeness with light
The researchers said that the madders show a new, sound genital name, the functionality of the method, which can be used to activate certain brain, heart and body cells outside the body.
Screecanth Chalasani, investigator of the Salk Institute in California, reported to The Guardian that a method can be replaced by a deep absorption, which is an invasive action to lead to the brain injury to therapy of Parkinson’s disease.
Sugar disorders do not normally react to ultrasome, but Chalasani found that when they around the liquid with a small microscopic complex, the situation changed.
He realized that the balls confirmed the ultrasonal ships that then go into the land.
Verified ultrasonalities affect the TRP-4-ion channel, structures that are in certain cell visions of some countries.
The vote sectors will receive these ionians to open and activate cells that they are enabled, reported in the Nature Communications magazine.
In order to prepare ultra-sum control sugars, Chalasani has modified countries genetically so that part of their commercial cells are TRP-4-ionians.
When Chalasani used ultra-related mathematics, the microscopes confirmed the sound vessels and interfaced the maths where they skipped the modified commercial hero cells.
The method has some same designs as optogenetics, a pre-sufficient tool that gives scientists the possibility of being able to nervous on the top of the cells and remove the lights through.
However, Chalasani says that sonogenetic use may have some interests in comparison with optogenetics.
Unlike the light that must be sent from the teaching to the long-term desires of the brain, the low-speed ultrasonal sectors can pass through the skin, so they can be sent to the brain on the face.
"We know that geneitherapy and therapy virus may be possible by using the targeted human neurocellulars to react at the moment in certain neurologs in clinical treatments," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on cells produced in body cells and insulin, he added.
It's an illegal competitive instrument for your home!
The reports can be the shock of the British weapons trade
See the video of Amnesty International's weapons.
Awesome killer machines!
Nickles, shooting shooting cars!
Booms!
Electronic smells that cause pain but do not leave!
The joyful language of the image and series does not doubt that this world’s largest weapons news is a slight parodi that Amnesty International has produced to emphasize the challenge of the British government to trade arms for the Defence and Security Equipment International Exception at London's day of the festive area.
Objective: DSEI's weapons: Administrative administrations are reached in London
A special campaign also shows many proclamations that require more accurate knowledge on bus and metroways.
"True Information, Travelstack on DLR lines on September 15-18?" Another question is used to use London's land source and product character, as the DLR board has changed into a bank image.
In September, weapon traders arrive to DLR... customers are requested to help stop the weapons.
These 300 declares are the works of artists whose work had been represented in the Museo of Cruel Designs (in the museum of the designs of Jupiters).
Collective named Special Patrol Group has helped publishing statements around London by using "Ad Space Hack Packs" packages. This includes six red packs of six cocktails, which are called "the main hands of the third part of the world's advertising state of the whole bus package".
Transport for London has not been disappointed by this unlawful "just-relatedness".

Cruel Designs and University of Essex’s newspaper Gavin Grindon, artists ask more and want to bring political work to the outside publics of the gallery.
Many artists have started working with the activeists in oppositions when they have found that they must go to the outside world if they want their art to affect society.
A second weapons trade proclamation welcomed the workers in the metro.
Amnesty's video has been viewed over 1000,000 times during the last 24 hours. It was found freely by the VCCP advertising office, and also a graphic designer and background manager had worked freely.
VCCP's creative director Matt Lever's found that weapons were not mentioned in any law - and also in the calendar of ExCeL were empty - and he thought, "Let them the campaign they try to avoid."
They were thinking of the more realistic corporation of the newspaper, but "the more stopping oil pressures things with light colors and animation."
"They have done a fantastic work when helping us to raise questions about an unlawful competitive instrument to sell", says Amnestyn Tom Davies.
Now, the United Kingdom government must take action and ensure that competitive instruments are not sold legally by our own homes.
Perhaps all the creative arts are associated with the weapons of ExCeL when showers trade fantastic beautiful products.

Eight golden rules for living in students
11 years later, when I was 19 years old, I changed to a student, and I still believed in baret and moral relations, but now I remember the people's people who I'm excited, and several, long-term motions.
Most of my learning can intensify eight simple rules.
Change in the house may be an entirely fearful one who uses any nerve.
It's shocking in the box: tell me where you're home, you're looking for a interim and what you think about Corbyn, and why "I really don't love Marmite, or hate Marmite because it's just a sweetness Haha me finding in my room."
Take a life.
And help others to spend the spirit... questions and aspect of interest.
It leads to discussions and helps you find those you like, and not those who do not want to speak even if your eyes are in the fire and they shared shammits.
Give people a place.
People’s rooms are often changed as cocktails, leaflets and most commonly as temporary places, but they are also places where people swallow and correct their bathrooms.
With regard to the question: Don't even imagine your university in your couple
The colleague is a strict place for the introverse.
Your care should be relaxed, but many households are formed by the culture of a different walking room, which is friendly, socially and leads to live friendships.
It can mean hell to somebody who try to relax.
Nothing in this culture allows you to say, "I want to be friend with you, but you have to get away that I can get back to the energy that the consumer has discussed with you."
Try to know when a student's friend has been cut into socialization, and maybe send text message to the door instead.
I'm going to tell you about the computer when I'm talking about the computer.
A guy of my student's residence was aware that if the door wasn't in the lock, he was called in.
He saw a lot of things.
It's sweet through clothing.
Because you start university at the top of Lepomestern, people's doors with a suklaal board and their own presentation affects some less strange, less "health to the neighbourhood, I smell you something, now sweet when I ask you personal questions" -50 class.
The offering of self-employed kitchen is an excellent way of friendship.
Your family partners will have an obligation to talk, and may be that they may continue to combine your face to surprise the shock.
This really depends on whether you know the clothing.
Unfortunately shocked skin-shoes, likely people can only get to sleep when the computers.
Eating food is a common crime in students' residences.
I'm sorry to get somebody's pool is to store, but what if you're just taking the milk for your work?
Ask and check the milk owner.
It's just possible that they give you a promise, even if they're swearing inside.
If someone stole your cases, it's ridiculous, and it's gonna be sympathy, but try to look at the older than my bedroom, who stole his milk for punishing those who stole it.
He's in prison now.
You won't be meteorized so that people can't sleep or learn.
It's not just to be a honourable man, but because you're like it's the word's smelling a sweeter.
When my girl visited her neighbor, she asked if they could call his drum and bass music quietly, because he had three hours in the morning and had a tenth morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally silenced at five a morning, the girl was friendly given their bed two hours before they put their own music to shoot, closed their doors and went to the thirty - hour.
It wouldn't be romantic if your wife's coming to turn into the same house with you?
Or translatedly, if you would not be unbelievable if you would have a household in your future mate, you would be slaughtered together, and then you would have seen him every day and may have lost all your friends with him.
Surely the heart wants what you want, but if my warm household is not really your mate, you could even try to talk to your mind.
In a slight moment when you notice that someone has left his open to cut off in his room, the border of the smell and the distortion is more than what it affects.
It's fun, but it's in the moment.
You can give you a useful and pleasant teaching safety by hiding something, but don't ever shoot anybody's room with a hammore and shampoo.
Lock their doors and the keys to the waters that you then put in the packaging, but don't take their ownness on the sight as two times.
Foreign students in the landscape of a pesticide shock in Kite - as a shocked shooting house in Salo
On Saturday morning, a pesticide attack in Kite, Northern Karjala, was done at the home of the foreign students.
Unlike the police had previously told, there are no employees in the case of low-security customers, but already in Finland the bedrooms of foreign students, the teacher of the Gospel People's Dictionary, Hedi Lucicle.
The age of the nation's employees and walls were slaughtered in racist marks, such as shootings, and one of the ageing windows has been slowed through the metal, reports the East Swedish police.
According to Luigiel, the building of the young people as a Teenager of Socio-Community Education in the country was estimated for ten people at the time of the attack.
"It was a weekend and adult people are free to move, so a part could be in another place," says Lucifer.
The National Collection has a degree of people from 12 different nationalities.
They are already in Finland some time students, as well as new low-security demanders.
All in the shooting shooting buildings have an a-spot.
Some students are at the primary school of adults, parts of professional education and part of the school of Finnish," says Lucia.
A-status is so declared as a continuous residence, which can be granted for four years in Finland once a while in some time in the foreign country.
The Eastern Sweden police investigated the attacks as a harmful crime and home peace crime.
Accordingly, the event was considered to students as a lunch of information, where there was also the need for quotes.
There's no panic here, and nobody wants to get out.
We have been twenty years old foreign students, and this is the first time when something happens to happen."
It's a shock that the battles have been shocked out of the wall.
As a technician, they were at least three men, and they were moved on a skilled car.
I think it's a young weekend of the headquarter when this is now on the roof.
There's nothing more serious than it," Lucifer says.
The hospital has also been decreased in the hospital that has been decreased from the receipt centre.
The meeting happened last week.
This is what the MTV reported on his website last night.
On the wall of the hospital was drawn by a shock and written in English "You are not welcome".
This is a crime report to the police.
Verification 15.9.02 The corrected police is about the age and status of the people living in the building.
The government slows the Y-june Carjalla, the travellers in the nest, "I'm swearing the idiots."
From Helsing to Raasepor, the Y-june walking to Karja, stopped walking in March.
The new shocked passengers to the beginning of that shock at Helsinki’s headquarters.
Some of the undergrounds attacked the volunteers, said to Torbjörn Bengtström.
That's stupid because the number of people grow all the time and workers need rapid and close contact in Helsinki.
This can't be able to take anything else than political will or the lack of it.
Bengtström says that the HSTV video is coming even if in the main city of Tractors.
Also, in the new country, there will be a change in the shooting.
On the main side, the H and R junctions are combined as new R lines.
The position of the pool in Jrvehead and Nuppulinna in Tutusula remains disabled.
The Ministry of Trade and Communication and VR published the information on which the Ministry shall purchase bilateral transport during the next contract period.
Your contract period is changed in yearly changes and delaying routes are in the whole country.
The last three-year agreement shall be adopted by the Monetary Affairs Committee.
The Ziunian Bengtström considers that the State's jungle swimming currency is a short-term operation.
Similar errors are made before and repeated in a very systematic way.
Then it's going to be on the shooting.
The Y wine also uses other than raresporians and citizens, since it is fast and takes several positions.
A spood Annina Pöyrye slaughtered the city’s swimming area for the longer journeys.
"It's named a strike to those who have to be planned to re-educe their way," he said, "in the pain of the Y junction.
It's a little facility.
The rain rail will be connected to the new shipping connection that replaces Y-june Helsing's transport in the HSL (HSL) region, i.e., until our church.
This provides increased costs to HSL, in practice, to the expenses of the region and to their taxpayers.
"We are now going to find different options and their impact on services and lift prices", said the Director of the HSL Suvi Richtnime.
The costs are still unable to be assessed accurately.
My report reports that, on the basis of the number of passengers, HSL has paid the Y-year year for a million years, and the Ministry has been much more.
The R-lines on the main side will leave two positions between them.
Instead, in Ainola and Sauna Kale, the number of swimming pools is doubled.
The whole country has 28 small positions and several roads.
The Minister has no longer purchase bilateral transport for Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Ceuruu and Dyunesky-Haapamayeki-Sein.
It's Joensuu path that's been delayed for the routine of Pixsuitki-Varcus.
Reduce the roads in Riihimaki-Lahti, Hanko-Karja, Kouvola-Cooka satama and Cayani-Oulu.

The value of the contract is about 27.5 million euros per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote the chapter on the timeliness of the capital book: "Marx supports the prostitute"
In 1818-1883) and in 1867-1894, Karl Marx and its final industry, published in 1867-1894, the crisis of the world economy, writes SKP's ex-president, who is known today by Urjö Hakane.
"He will take more serious than a long time," writes Hakane in his exhibition.
Marx's opinions on capitalistic development, internationalization and development of all the areas of life, focus on capital and the growth of the capital and imaginative capital have been shown as a surprising cities.
The list of writers based on capital seminars is also found by Professor Aalto-syliopy, a valued Economist Sixten Korkman.
The book Korkman writes Marx's timely "know and ever."
But isn't it the Director of the Office of the Ancient Research Institute and the Delegation of Life?
No, no, no.
In the phone, Korkman tells us that he does not like Marx as a time-budgetary budgetary, but more interesting social theories.
Today, society knowledge have differentized and specialized, but Marx was philosophy, historics, socialists, economic partners, journalists, political attractions, and literature hours.
"Attachmental concept is that the historical history tells the wrong views of the dead men," Kurkma begins.
It's true that Marx's prophecies were strictly in the sweet.
Although Marx understood the creation and significance of the industrial revolution, he took too long decisions from the initial capitalism, but Korkman was deemed.
But Korkman is seeing the value of the radial installation of Marx.
"There is more relief in Marx that he asked good questions," he says.
Now again, we are discussing on the interests of Marxin, such as the share of security.
"Marx may give inspiration to the one who wants to understand the grand image, the technologically changed world", Alkman analyzes.
But what the government should decide tomorrow does not help Marx.
He thinked that capitalism was an unexpected case that should just stop.
Still, Marx supports Korkman's thinking that he's inherited.
"In the 1970s, Marx couldn't read," Korkman says.
"It's all the capitalisms of the land and the tropical and the other donors, but more than one another."
Today the debate is more multilateral and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political pressure of the next year.
"Another social media should be known to Marx's thinking world, like other classics," says Korkman.
The United Nations requires military courts in Sri Lank
The United Nations requires the establishment of the Special Court of Justice to investigate the military ratios made in Sri Lanka in the internal war, reports the AFP.
In the United Nations report of 1983-2009 on internal war databases, it appeared in a mid-week after a long delay.
The report is accused of armed weapons, both of Sri Lanka and of the renowned rebellion.
In the internal war, Sri Lanka is estimated to die at least 1000,000 people.
There's no checking of information about the victims.
In particular, in the last few months of the long-weapon attack, the United Nations report should be examined honestly.
The report of the Sri Lanka’s weapons condemns the complaints, struggles and systematic sexual violence, which would like to be the victim of men as women.
According to the report, the capitals were accused of evacuation of public and children as fighters.
The report states that both parties were accused of murder.
Sri Lanka replied in the mid-week that it would intend to organize the investigation itself, but would not allow the establishment of the Court of Justice because of the foreign judges.
In the I-Cheque of England, the social media was able to switch.
In a mid - week swimming language in the mountain, Syxy was a long visiting language, which was the largest part of the English.
The English art tested more than 16,000 experiences.
In the test, it could be written in materials, even though social media.
Based on his own experiences, we should consider whether social media make us unique and unfortunate.
Alternatively, the letter from the English word 150-250 could be shown to the advisor of the network newspaper.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt answers the Finnish Leel's lepotuol.
He asked how parents should look for the things on the side of the young ones.
The whole substance was four subjects which had to choose one.
“It was the most difficult,” notwithstanding the three subjects of the Swedish class in the English magazine My Lybeck.
In the third issue, Jose Manuel Barrosol was only one of the former President of the European Commission.
The fourth issue was pretty nice to Lybeck.
It was supposed to write a pale call for the reasons why enterprises should pay young people to work.
"At least in our school has been performed in writing talks," Lybeck says and evaluates the whole experience "too normal".
The Finnish - or Swedish experience has responded to the questions of the texts that, for example, adapted the summer to climate change and the processing of large data.
In the medium week, some long Russian students were also written (168 students), Germany (124), French (52) and Spanish (27).
The scene continues on Thursday in the mountain, the second home, or the Sweden or the Finnish test.
The trials in the literature are normally organized, or the mind of the payers does not affect it.
The Supervisory Institute encourages experiencers to search for appropriate transport contacts in time to enhance cohesion.
An additional time can be obtained if you can show that a late accident has not been caused by its incertitude.
Trade on weapons was stolen in the lab
The school was stolen in the midday afternoon for the trade in the town of Horlon.
The police said that the robbery was shocked in shocked clothes and the faces of a shocking command pipe.
He's a normal security and about 30 years old.
According to the police, a man had a staff on his hands and got a small amount of money.
We're investigating this as a robbery.
The police's ten-year-old players will be able to reach Helsinki's support party other than Finland.
The opposition to the operational decisions of the government will be supported on Wednesday, the police predicted.
According to the predecessor data, even ten thousands of people can arrive.
The members of the SAK, Akavan and STTK are meeting at 11 p.m.
The police also believes that it's a part of the vision.
Instead, the police at work is the task of dealing with alarms and other police activities, including the safeguarding of residues.
Railway routes are closed from motor vehicles around 9 p.m. to 14 p.m.
Only the alarm paths will be solved in the area.
From your mouth of the hakane is cut off from the trail line of Kaisanima, from the mouth of Manerheim.
Does Helsinki's police office enough, supercommissary Seppo Kujala?
Repeat, at least it looks like it's enough.
I don't want to take care of the police work.
The Helsinki says that Kuchway is coming because of the statement, the support parts from the other Finland.
I don't know what the police's shooting shooting.
"It's a compartment coming, but we're going to work in our own way," Kujala says.
The police calls us to avoid private cars at Helsinki Center on Wednesday.
Assessing that the worst transport cost is at the level of Hakanie's nuclear center.
A reliable transport is expected from morning until the beginning of the morning.
Change the after-feater from Finland, Helsinki has also arrived a lot of opportunities buses.
They're not going to decide to the Rautator.
The bus will remain in the next time.
The final journey will then be walking to the place of mind", says Kujala.
It's also a stop to the Helsinki army movement.
The police's view here's a positive half.
The case of a trail transport, which is normally in these grandchildren meetings, will now be handled on its own part.
The organizations of the opinion have reported to the police that Helsinki may be ten thousands of opposers of the economic policy of the Government.
The police's waiting for an emergency, peacefully.
At least there are normal workers or unemployment -- normal citizens.
Yes, the Finnish people are reasonable and peaceful," Kujala says.
A number of Finnish parties are also organized on Wednesday.
The vision of the first day is very exceptional. Do you remember these laws and minds?
It is often interesting and exceptional.
For example, it does not find a very good comparison of the Finnish political history, says the professor of the Sociology of the University of Jyunesky, professor Martti Sigine.
You're not wonderful that the swimming swimming protest is.
If it wouldn't do so, it would shoot the hands before the government, he says.
A good legal government has attacked the traditional nuclear points of the Finnish corporates, and also towards the importance of the development of the Finnish well-being State.
The rule of the government is missing in the right of the contract.
This is a lot of degrees that we really try to get the shocks.
It also has a place to look at the ball.
For example, the games are needed, for example, to not have the support of all payers at the beginning of the Sunday.
The new is now the sharp division of which the mind will be held in the team that the age would like to participate in the opinion.
In November 1993, the unemployed ones of the Finnish meetings were welcomed by the committee.
If the summary is looking for a comparison point on the Sunday, it could be an unlawful departure report, the Murrostorstai organized in 1993, says Sicin.
In the middle of the deeply organized Murrostors, a 200,000 unemployment was collected.
The Eco Ahon (kesk) government is compulsory from the employment market crisis to another.
It was said that the Finnish government and the payment organizations had never been the same bad as during the foreign government of Ahon.
Now, the government and the swimming movement are still worse than in the time of Murrostors.
On the other hand, the Finnish government has ever so much foreign government, the Single says.
The current government coalition is still interested in this way that it is so strictly justified, despite the fundamentality of the Somalia.
Another time was some elements of old job movement.
The place is expected for several thousands of mental players on Saturday.
Meditation also stops public transport and closes possible daily and schools.
The difficulty of mind receives undivided support for payers, it may be for the biggest years.
In Helsinki, the last few years has been organized about 300 incentives per year.
They're going to be loaded.
Traditionally, in Finnish's opinions, it has been particularly peaceful, although the workers have been overlooked in the past few years.
Traditionally, the Finnish opinion is inclined to the conflict, to be lawful.
Reviewers are trying to avoid damage or destruction of property, says the Sicherous.
However, the end of the 1990s had new tubes.
It's changed in the culture of spectrum.
The EU's membership was nervous to shoot farmers, and the police was able to get their own shock.
The Paloman Law held three months in 1998.
The spectacular laws were also pilots and flight drivers.
Do you remember these ladies and minds?
Metal and electrical strokes of the 1970s
The most significant laws in the 1970s were a metal shuttle in 1971 and the power and electrical shuttle in 1977.
The Metalism Law participated in 700,000 metals.

Travellers opposed the EU 1994 and 1999
Polices were launched in the protest of farmers in the EU in 1994.
"Cyprus teaches, EU stops," was one of the attacks.
The farmers in Spain slaughtered tonnes.
The EU Summit of Helsinki also held in 1999 to protest and to smoke shelters in front of the meeting place.
Hospitals Lawed 1983 and 1995
The nurses were arrested for about a month in 1995.
The first time they were in law in 1983.
In 1995, a number of cases of death occurred during the colored Law.
Tehy was threatened by laws and caregivers in 2007.
The threat to combating the civilization has finally speeded negotiations to arrive.
Medical doctors lacked 2001

Students moved in 2013

The Debates Police will determine the committees of the Finnish Republic to the Austrian police
The Austrian police has requested help from Central Labour Police in the detection of the diseases registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped in Asterheim near the German border of a ship that had 42 refugees.
There's no information whether the rich was possible to travel to Finland.
I was all right in the kitchen.
We've got an interference with the Austrian police.

Foreign Captain, former drug skill and upporic businessman - the story of five secret drivers
Upportic king, a violent boat shipping, a typical shippinger, and himself as a good taxi pocket.
For example, such people practice human transport to the European Union.
A criminalist at the Trenton University, Andrea Di Nicola, and provider Gipaolo Musumeci, who met ten secret drivers and these "clients", and the book of their Death Travel Office appears in Finnish this week.
In the book, they submit the lonkels of human transport, submit proposals for solutions, and submit secret drivers from the different doors of the business.
HS will present five of them.
I'll get out of them right away.
On the east of Tunisia, the islands do not touch foreign tourists, but many Tunisia are directing there to the sustainability.
Instead of their location, the islands are also excellently suitable for the shuttle transportation, since their trip to the Lampedus island of Italy is only 120 miles (50 km) away.
Because of the comparison, the oldness of Helsinki Tallinna is about 85 km.
There, in the village of El Attaya, is Emir, my captain to smoke and six children.
The ships are part of their shocks, but the fisherman is more productive to transport people.
And Emir has done it in a swimming, ten meters of wood ships already with hundreds of accounts.
If the ship is full of it, it's going to be 40 people.
One trip from Emir takes about 8 000 euros after the expenditure.
The orders have five helpers that are looking for him for customers around Tunisia.
Customers come from many countries, but during the Arabian period, a huge number of tune wanted to flee for disappointments.
Then, the situation was calm until it turned back to a refugee crisis later.
Customers are coming from the maintenance to the Kerkenna Sea in small groups.
Order makes them empty to the houses as long as it's good.
Food is given so that customers are right and still in life.
The message will pay about 75 euros from night, and if the customer ends with money, it's their problem.
We're going to go to water in the middle of the night.
First night, we'll be shooting out of the island, then stop, waiting day and next night to Lampedusa.
Sometimes marine use is hard, and in 20 meters highways, passengers smile and smile.
In the meantime, the human leg has been cut in half hours, and Emir will go back to the back.
Emir wants us to be afraid.
That is why he pains his customers, and at least claims that he is deceived by the gangsters of the spirit.
He says in the book that when the police once missed him, he took all his passengers over the ship and told them to take them to the nearest island.
"I've seen customers from the shock and I put them over the ship," Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come from the south of Zahara.
His landmen have to hear that he's going to be worried about this.
I'll get them out now.
They have to show immediately who's going to be here.
A normal taxi wheel
Goran is just a normal taxi visit in Bogovia in Serbia.
His taxi isn't very good - start engineer, and it has been seeing the best day.
However, the main thing for Goran's customers is that the tax is exceeding and that it moves to the Hungary border.
Bogoviağ is about 500 pounds of small populations from Belgrade to a lunch of about 60 miles (60 km).
It is located in the area of the safeguards centre, which is mainly intended for families.
From the center of the surrounding forests without their family traveling men in the shopping, low and abandoned cars that everyone has now been able to find or build.
The forest also lives in families that have not been caused or otherwise left for security in Serbia.
Some are also in private meetings, but it is public secret.
Gora's troops find the largest part of his customers.
These are often swimming - through the Balkan road requires a large number of borders over and weeks walking in a difficult swimming area, often in mountain areas and darkness.
Finally, people are deceived to the Bogovia region, the largest part of human transport.
The Cyctics of Goran are mostly slaughterers, Afghanians, Pakistanians, Iraqians and Kurdess.
The best customers are the serialists, he's telling them in the book.
"They say it once and it's enough," Goran's smell.
He said that the Africans are trying to smile.
Goran doesn't like that.
It's all the way.
First, it will be agreed to the prices for example 300 euros, then they will calculate it to 200 and provide 150.
Gorran emphasizes it to be a good and good man.
I'm not interested in money.
I'm just doing my job and I'll help people," he says in the book.
Goran tells his jobs to be more than others and to spend from the Hungary border only 50 euros from people.
The path is 300 miles [300 km], most of the pleasant motorcycle.
The colleagues ask for a third or square price.
Goran is worth EUR 500,000 per year.
It's not a big sum to the secret driver, but the annual income in Serbia.
Serbia has decided that taxes cannot be transported nearly 12 km from the Hungary border.
Goran doesn't care about it: he knows the ways and the pools and takes his swimming pool from the border of a mile.
Then he shows his customers the right way and smells out.
In the work of the laptop
35-year-old congoleans are called Settler, and it is not just a lempinum.
He really has a protestant church in the capital of Uganda, Kampala, which is a large number of believers from Kongo, and a small center that helps Kongo’s children.
In addition to the preaching, the Meeting Saloner is covered by a secret transport business where people are transferred from Kong to Europe.
He's looking at his work of the ladder.
It's important for the sender to look good.
He smells his skin several times a day and take care of the smell of white pools slowly cut down the low shock.
The sender driver is proud of the new Mercedes, its land car and three motor drivers.
When the settler is not preaching, he organizes people from Kong to Uganda and forward to Europe.
At first, the customer calls some of the five sentences on the phone number.
He suggests that the border will be supported by the morning, hide the money visionally, and shoot the border over any of the traders that are walking.
In order to obtain a security applicant or a refugee station, the Uganda authorities must report that there is, for example, home from the North Kivu war regions, and that violence has been flewn in their home.
Often it is true, but if not, the Sender will organize a new identity to the customer.
An old personality certificate will be deleted and the state is obtained by another.
That's what you're going to do with the Sender's contacts in the Uganda police.
The customer will then be managed to the same place where certain security applicants go: the procedure for security, the establishment of citizens organizations, finally to the UNHCR of the United Nations Refugee Organization.
The embassy feels burocratic, because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He counts on each other: the request to leave Uganda's police pays about 100 euros, the handling of documents to the humanitarian organization at about 150 and the process of change, for example, 4 500 to 7 000 euros in some European countries.
Footballs and floors

Tom chooses the suitable skill to make sure that it's just on the way to England, not even in Hollanti, and he's shooting a safe swamp swap.
It's going to be quiet, so they're going to wake up.
Sometimes the snake is drunk with you, but then the snake is more calm.
When the road is clear, Tom shuttles his customer to the aluminium folion, similar to that in the kitchen it is a snake or a snake around the kitchen.
It should prevent the police's heat scanner to notice the hidden.
Some use the same purpose with shoes filled.
Tom leaves his customer's rich and gets out of the place, hopelessly, that at least before Britain, you don't have any secrets.

However, 150 meters before the land, his power was hindered.

The Master of the World was shocked when the Alliance was put into the Norwegian snake: "The Great"
The Norwegian Countries Petter Northug has exceeded at least one of its colleagues.
The Northug and the Norwegian Countries have cut all over and cut off the sports agreement last year.
Although the Union has offered Northug better agreement than other sportors, it has not been reduced to a multiface of world masters and Olympics.
As a result of the agreement, the Norwegian Countries decided to close Northugin from the cup of the world for the coming time.
The decision was grateful for the two-eenth World Master Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad that the union was put into a snake.
"Thank you've been addressing a squeeze," Jacobs wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We can't allow one attractive Sporter to defeat the favor of the union sponsor", he continued.
The Norwegian Railway and Northugin Railway is about the money.
Northug would apparently want to be part of the years of the country team so that he could show his own sponsor.
Jacob said he was happy to represent an alliance that also cares for the future generations, and does not give one sportsman’s styles.
He also recalled that the union has given Northern as economic as well as other privileges for many years.
I know that because I was part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one sporter has completely different rules than just because it's the best.
Northug published its own information in which he convinced his desire to be sported in the Norwegian colors for the next time in the world cups, as well as later in MM and the Olympics.

Media student: Sipila takes the risk of zy
According to the civilian communication, multiple channels are needed, and the telephones of the Prime Minister are one channel in other groups.
This is also necessary for the channel of this direct speech.
This will not be the last time, Sipila said to the committee of the committee.
Sippie did not want to evaluate how often the way it is to be repeated by the Prime Minister's television and radio phones.
According to the civilian, it is not necessarily necessary to continue on the Yle channels.
If the other channels are reported to be channels, then we're looking at it.
Now use this channel tonight, Sipila said.
According to the German economic status, it is serious that it requires the maintenance of television and radio telephones to the citizens.
This quote, which is now speaking, is a time complex and requires a deepest basis.
That's why we finished this channel, Sipila tried.
The conversation is sent at 21.05-21.20 and on TV1 and the radio in Finland.
It can also look at the General Arena.
The sippie takes a zy-risk
The media researcher hopes that the Sipilian television phone does not tell the most commonly translated government.
Is it an effort to take the right to define the public debate more closer to its own hands and to refuse the debate on the negotiations of the public regulations? Mr Anu Kovunen, professor of the University of Tukholm.
Soin's silenced comment was to say that he does not observe the media agenda, nor allows it to determine himself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these matters do not join each other.
I understand that the commercial media has been crazy about the report of Sipil.
It would be strange if you don't react the media.
Communications of political headquarters are not reporting in democracy.
The representatives of the Media are definitively trying to do not to be taken into account by political responsibilities.
According to the test, the telephone is a great risk for Sipil.
In the conversation, it should be introduced into the table something new and special to comply with the exceptional high expectations set to the speaking.
Does it offer more than we have heard today?
Or can he speak to different slowness, different ways, or say something new?
Kovunen says that if the promise is only the same older, it must be wonderful why such a great man has done and Yle gave it an exceptional time.
In general, it is a risk to bear in mind if there is no particular situation, but the phone of routine in other groups.
The Risk is that the Ule is a communication of political or commission and government, which is certainly not in compliance with the General Intress or the general line.
Of the civil open glass
In the future of the civil debate, it is also important that the Prime Minister, unless it is said, highlights the media researcher.
Tonight, you will see where Sipila is missing and where it is not, says the research coordinator of the University of Skills who heard it.
I heard that the TV call is open from Sipil, because this is how it will be possible to bring his own views out without the shocks.
This means that the message will receive a great public without a journalist filter, other than in the information situation where the suppliers can submit critical questions.
He's talking directly to the people.
However, it is dangerous that the media comes from something wrong, because it is not possible to submit a question.
I hear it's very important to how Sipira appears on TV... a valuable shock, shoot your hands.
He compares Sipil to the father's fatherhood, who now tells the people what to do.
If Sippia is going to make it well, it can work.
Your situation is different than when the government would inform some of the matter, because this man is like speaking directly to another person.
This (US President Barack) Obama and the partners are regularly remitting.
Exceptual
Political researcher Erkka Railo believes the Chairman's speech to citizens as an exceptional.
He said that this has not happened for decades that the Prime Minister is speaking directly to the people.
A slight time requires exceptional means, Railo says.
The investigator believes that the Prime Minister wants to obtain the Finnish churches in the way that they are delayed.
The payment organizations are organized on Wednesday and Monday against the activities of the Government.
On Twitter, President Paavo Arhinmöhki, President of the Left Unit, said that Sippia could keep his speaking on the state of the country as an advertising of the Chief Minister in which we will also be able to discuss.
The President of the SDP Antti Rinne (sd.) reiterates its appeal to the Sipil dialogue.
There's no time for monologues now.
Shortly half years of ice.
Infinity you can't hide, Rinne write on Twitter.

The Finnish UFC star struggled for the violence of young people: You can hate at time
The credible volunteer Macwan Amirkhani published a video on Facebook, which is especially swallowing immigrants to youths.
Makwan Amirkhani had a painting age against the shocks of young people.
Amirkhani, born and five years of age with his Finnish family, has gained both their professional negotiations in the most valued UFC series.
Amirkhani tells me that he was received a message that was requested to look at some instagram pieces.
The account has been downloaded videos where young people fight extremely violently.
Amirkhine tells me that he's been struck by a young man's infringement.
Amirkhan has more than 62.000 followers in Facebook.
The shoes shoot the land, sit on the other side and shoot eyelessly without thinking about any of these consequences that happens when you do this videos, Amirkhani will update.
It's hard to defense
Some of the youths visible on videos are immigrants.
According to Mr Jarmo Heinus, the police Commissioner of Helsinki has loaded videos to social media both immigrants and jewels.
We're named that you're fighting over the street.
You do so more difficult about the life of many other immigrants here in Finland, the Turkish Amirkhani.
Amirkhani recalls that Finland has pages that are looking for immigrant crimes.
These individual cases have come to very badly.
It's a little hard, kids, to defend you again.
You should remember that you're still visiting the country and you're here for a long time.
That's a little different way to thank you for being here, Amirkhani says.
My Amirkhine encourages young people to remember closerly.
If they sometimes come into a race, you can blame it yourself.
Let's think about a couple of times before you go with that, ladies.
Amirkhani says that violent action gives panics to race.
You're gonna have a time of hate that I don't like myself.
In other words, you have a time badly, and you don't have any improvement, Amirkhani decides.
SAK puts its part in the pack of emissions - Lyly: decisions on Monday.
The President of SAK, Lauri Lyly, reports on Twitter that as Monday, the Ombudsman's Ombudsman's position to submit to a optional list.
Lauri Lyly commented on the STTK proposal on Twitter.
In the past half week, the STTK Office reported to the Government of its proposal to achieve the five percentage of the production blocks required by the Prime Minister Juha Sipil (kesk).
The President Sture Fäder believes that the government will accept the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akva are all behind the proposal.
However, it required that the largest payment organization SAK behaviour to its previous position.
The President of SAK Lauri Lyly, on behalf, commented on this matter on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Committee is treating the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, the SAK is looking for solutions to open the market, and that the position of the compulsory laws is required for an agreement of active parties.
Lyly recalls that the proposal by the Prime Minister of the Civil Government for a social agreement was not replaced by the SAK.
Cyprus has previously disrupted negotiations on the Community Treaty when SAK has not agreed to join the five percent to the objective of productivity.
Comments: The majority is threatening to smile - "Think it's a little awesome to smell skin"
Anything it's a little awesome, if it's already in my table, writes Pecca Tinane.
The tunnels vary in their loans.
Does it mean to smile the government or then agree with it?
On Monday, the Chairmans of the SAK condemned sacred hate against the Government of the Republic.
The entire Finnish was threatened to shut up.
The smell swimming to the aquatics.
Professors OAJ threatened schools and daily schools.
At the same time, OAJ denied: a school or a daily school is not completely closed.
In the medium week, President Antti Palola (sd) of the Office of Agency STTK was agreed.
He reported to his government’s contact and launched the Prime Minister Juha Sipila (kesk) requests optional presentation for five percent of the production period.
The President Sture Fäder (kok) immediately tried to report that his appeal paper is already ready.
At first, the SAK office was not part of the slaughter.
President Lauri Lylyn (Sd) is difficult to agree when the Chairmans of Alliance just on Monday ordered to spend the earth on Saturday.
Finally, however, Lyly reported that the SAK Labour Commission was assembled in the next Monday to discuss the situation and that the SAK searched for solutions to open the market.
In order to make a common spectrum of payers, the SAK should intend to accept the five-percent production area as a goal.
No wonder that Palola STTK has relationships with the government of Sipil.
Leader of STTK's social impact, Jukka Ihanus, who is in the right hand of the Pale, acted as the special assistant of the Central Ministers Matti Vanhase and Mari Kivininiman.
Palola also found that the age of the government has been improved all the time.
It's not, but Palola's outcome took a little clean away from the Finnish standers who were swallowing the brand of the ACT's Piirain (sd).
It's a little awesome to smell the skin if it's already in the table with my adjustment paper.
Modified at 8:00: Added information about Lyly's comments.
The Russian shocked Finland as a bad father, "This can't be repeated."
The Russian Dutch President, Sergei Naryshkin, has criticized Helsinki's Etyj's meeting.
The Russian Dutch speaker Sergei Naryshkin believes that Mongolia is better than Finland.
In the capital of the Mongolian city, in Ulan Batori, the Parliamentary General Meeting of Etygi, in which Naryshkin gave wide comments on the Helsinki Summit.
The Finnish did not allow Russian policies to the European Union, such as Naryshkin, to arrive at the meeting - the matter which the President had taken to remind the providers.
We believe that it was opposed to the values of the parliamentary democracy and the principles of the open dialogue.
This can't be repeated, Naryshkin pressed the news office according to the Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin criticism was addressed to the United States where he was also engaged.
The sanctions are a political suicide from the EU, the Naryshk declared.
The Mongolian delegation became complicated, so Naryshk continued the Finnish strike with the shoe and thanks to the Mongolian "excellent organization".
I am sure that the parliamentary General Assembly is structural and positive results - unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leader understands that the parliamentary dialogue does not have obstacles.
Naryshkin has met the meeting in Ulan Batori (kok) which has already discussed with the Russian delegation.
League is a real playoff game: "Maalis in stretch"
Tappara and Luke will continue to be shocked today in Hacamet, when both are coming on the other day of birth.
Janne Lahti predicted that he didn't see the prestigious dinner party today in Hacamet.
Tappara went last night at the Coupe in a 3-2-hour flight of KalPa.
It was a man, because the gold group in the last few years was the worst of the two seats of the slaughter.
I've been more mobilious.
The Ramaian visitor of the Blues was shocked at zero point, and the slaughter slaughters were so old 2-3.
The hard game, the lands in stretch, if something plays the same game as the last year, the Luko attacker Janne Lahti predicted plans on the following pages.
The telescope has been formed with a very slight playoff printer.
The Tappara has been shocked in two past periods of just the final site of Luko.
A seventh squad has been required to solve the solution.
In the past few years the Luke took a series in the fourth game, but Tappara led into three next rings and ends.
The groups' groups do not have major changes, except the number of groups.
Both of the cassarits struggled yesterday, today.
On the pitches, Mika Noronen makes a place to Tomi Karhus, and Rasmus Rinne is replaced by Ryan Zapolsk.
Visuality: A painted spectrum in recently starting
The Chairman of the Sports hoped to write an inconsistent part of the Rail Case, to write from St. Silvennow Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote a Rocky showing a headquarter.
Instead, he was in a sense of put into the fields of pregnancy to Apollo Creed, World Master of Baptist.
Rocky had a great sympathy, even though he finally lost a tract.
30 years after Rocky the next night, Mika hopela wrote a non-profit motor in Pora.
The unnamed and wooden patent has been a surprise to all the SM-Financies in 2006.
Somebody was full of unnamed as Rocky, but sweet sweethearts.
It was White India, Porin Matt and Pele Pelt.
The players swallowed their head red and shocked irokes.
It's a blond of hope.
The maintenance of the TV JP Jalo calls a trainer as Newmann.
You took the winning gold.
I hope there was one of the heroes.
The handbook hopes that this time's renewal works in the same way as ten years ago.
The man who works as the Sport Director has built the slaughter of the wicked sons of the slaughter.
Seir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been drunk in the beach like Rocky's sugar food on the sweet.
Masi Marjamen, Miko Vitase, Juha Kiilholman and Matti Kupary are in some other places than in a strike game.
The hope has forgotten that Rocky VI's headquarter presents Pecca Railway.
Karri Kivi has crossed the Rautacalle Sean Conners.
The Railway Case is the same majority in Rocky as Connery had been at the original exhibition in 1976.
There's nothing else to Rocky's in the rail fabric.
Railable filosophics do not contain swimming and small slowness.
He values hard games, but it's a different thing to play hard than a smooth.
In recent years, Esseen Garret Stafford took the Tappara Jere Carjack's head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but the Rautacall was put on a man in the bed.
He didn't get a minute!
We're just playing those who do.
I don't accept that game and it does not belong to the kitchen where the Rautakal was using after the game to the Sunday National.
The team of this time has been built a strange.
There are kids, veterans, police and targets.
The best keys in the age of the game have no practice.
It's not wonderful that the principal trainer has chosen an artist.
How much have you been able to affect players, Peace Radakal?
In recent years, the events affected the purchase and, unfortunately, the situation in the market had been over time, and the Railway was diplomatically answered.
I'll be on the castle.
The 1953 Road model is wisely interested in transferring to the hope to sports.
The men's agreements ended in the warm.
In three ligaties there are a lot of losses on the floor of 1-6.
I hope I wouldn't have emphasized the handle of the subsequent part.
Olga Theone shows the mother of Sipe Santapuk
Olga Temone's showing that if she had met her husband as the Middle Teen, they had nothing to do with them.

What more I have known about my real example in Sirka, it is easier to show a role to lose.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful for Monday that he trusted the role to me.
Olga had met Sirka before film project, but then two has been closed.
They've met, talked on the phone, and they've been sent to them.
Sirka has helped a lot.
We've been using a lot of different circles through their history.
Cirry also to be happy to understand that the Drama is drama and the truth may have a little color.
Olga emphasizes that Sirka was almost the only one who believed that the island would become the largest in Finland.
The 1990s had a long and a real anxiety.
It was a small probability that somebody really did, but Sirka had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga tells us that he had heard from Tuku's much about this young man already before film plans.
However, the history of parents has been a little different.
Yes, if you're 15-year-old, how many parents really know what you're wooden.
Olga reveals that his own youth was completely different than the wicked snake of Henoa.
Olga was an arch and thanks for a girl who hadn't had a movie with Youth.
And so he could have been able to shut up.
Olgan said he has been doing so much to cooperate with the Middle East for ten years that the great joint project is not scared.
Everything's always got a superhy.
Now the whole production group will go for month to descriptive in Heino.
In the meantime, a couple who lives in the age is expected to be slow because of their little children often at night also home, because the interim is not too long.
We'll rule the whole Henow for a month.
They have taken us so warmly, just asked what you're going and when it's empty.

In October, the pictures of the films produced by Timo Mountain and Teo to Delete start at Antwerpen near the AED Studio sites and sustain the eight weeks.
The manager Timo Bergensola is going to Belgium for the next week.
You're not scared of the budget.
I've been sick!
I've got such a ratio of the filile's manuscript, because I know what's going on.
All of the working groups feel that they do something unexpected.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even if the time is strict, it's not scared.
I'm more exciting than I'm, and I'm not expecting that I can show to the public of this piece, he's talking to the weather.
At first, the budget of the film was decreased by 8 to 10 million, but in the development of the manuscript, the budget also increased.
Budget is great, but it's a great store.
However, the movie should be identified by 100 million, since each image and efficacy are so calm.
It's now all been wrong so strict that there's no finding.
The film production company Iron Sky Universe has started today in a mid-week of a funding campaign and a group of funds, which is payed for the annual rate of 4-8 per cent.
The final rate shall be determined as a question and offered during the campaign.
After two years, the company returns the law.
The photos of the action show Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Junttia or cool?
Disabled logs will return to packs
Throughouts of the trends have recently corrected deficiencies.
Another time ago, a modern shooting switch switch slowed clearly and grand logs like Cross in the manuscript.
The marking of the skin or the t-payder was seen as a shirt.
His time is changed.
Sport has become the right model megatred, and so too old, well-known sport spectacles such as Adidas and Nike have risen to the shoot of cool.
And as often soon as it is, the border of the skin and the trend is shocking: if there is a right shoe, it becomes irone and cool.
First, a normal core train, or a smooth model, where trends were surprised by recommending the most smooth basic clothes that could be separated from the mass.
Now, it is put into the corner, instead, already on the base of the cabin, with the logo of the manufacturer.
What's the biggest and more traditional, it's better.
In addition to logs, for example, the identified Railways, the favorite team games and the New York Yankees bridges have made a return to refunds.
The start of the fake line Calvin Klein logos are well detailed now.
Tredi seems to be moved from a sport mark to a ice bridge.
For instance, the slowness of the seats of Versaz clears what is the sign of the clothing concerned.
Would you be ready to show logs in your shoot?
The Russian politician published the evidence: I didn't know what I felt in the bank!
According to the reports, a special interval would have occurred in Nizhni Tagil, which was considered as Russian Arms Expo 2015 for the war industry.
The Russian media has recently issued a colorful allegations, which indicated that the Russian Ministry of Emergencys had to move from the large number of Zotovia tanks for five hours.
So Zotov has done everything to thank the information.
He even published on his own public Facebook pages an image where he seems to be shocking a panzer vehicle in particularly good tunnels and not at least on the basis of their pictures is something of a shock or anger.
It's a shooting pool.
It begins that I didn't go inside to a fighting barrier, but it was a rhythm of PC-3.
I'm the former soldier. I'm the Prime Minister. I'm serving Ural.
I went inside, watched around me, and came out in peace, Zotov said the Comosomolska to Pravda.
I didn't talk, and I really didn't take five hours in that place, he said.
The Russian army TV Zotov explained, in his show, the new technology of Russia, because he himself is the former professional state.
That's why I'm interested in what's inside the balls, and I'm a chance for our technology.
And I came out through the bathroom, he said.
I've been in all the tanks.
And in the next show, I will be able to visit all the tanks and all the shooting snakes, Zotov promised.
Zotov also shocked as a sweet prosecutor on this subject.
One idiot wrote, and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside, and I came out.
I'm long and sluzhba, but nothing like that I had spoken to a tank, he said to the Russian sluzhba newcast to the radio.

Dancing Copper: IMF will warn too much
The Finnish Country Report, today published by the International Monetary Fund, has long-term views of the Government and the Ministry of Administration.
The system has patented Finland's structural reforms in order to achieve the economic problem.
The IMF believes that the reduction in overwork and the decrease of payment rates supported Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be necessary for the whole agreement system and the unemployment security.
According to Pasi Cooppama, the main economy of the Danke Bank is agreed to be the same, but small differences are also found.
In the opinion of the IMF, there are a lot of post-communications to the government, but, on the other hand, a warning is also found on what should not be too much cut.
For example, these are infrastructure investments, which are the counterparty said to Taloussanomi.
The Growth projects would also support IMF to implement in the timetable as quickly as possible, so that they support weak economic growth.

Finnish will be reached only more lower safe applications
The Swedish Migration Agency has already recognized in February 2015 that even hundreds of children who have come to the country are lost annually.
In other words, SVT and Dagens Nyheter have reported on their net pages that the Swedish Migration Agency has lost hundreds of lower demanders per year.
The supervisor of the Migration Agency Juha Kannelland tells what is the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is that the same situation in Finland?
How much of the applicants will lose "land below" in the year? - In Finland, in 2013, a total of 156 insurance applications were made alone.
They've lost nine.
In 2014, the applicants were made in 196 and lost 11, the Cannelland reported.
In the context of the defects, the applicant may find that the applicant has already registered in some other country applicable to the Dublin Regulation and may have been reported in the full-year age there.
Thus, the applicant may be more attractive to lose than to continue to be treated in Finland and to be returned to a country responsible for the process of the application.
Any of the losses will also be found later when they are looking for a safe place from another Member State.
In 2014, the applicants of safeguards were all 3651, with 134 applications, due to the fact that the applicant probably had changed from Finland, so adult safeguards lost 123 in the last year.
Is the number of growth?
To 6.9 of this year, we have reached a total of 586 for a lower security application.
The total statistics of lost low-commerce applications this year are not yet, but the number of low-commercies has therefore been informed and has been clearly increased in the effect that probably also affects the number of losses.

He's done in the case.
Orpo, regarded by the EU Ministerial Refugees, reported on the practices in which safeguard applicants have been managed through Sweden through the North Summit.

Psychology advice: This is how you tell children about refugees
Many parents have recently come to consider how to tell children about the situation of refugees in Europe.
Or do you want to tell me anything?
There is no need to be a public talk, a member of the SPR crisis group, a psychological advisory Ferdinand Garoff.
The smaller children are supporting protection, and, for example, they do not give the news alone.
Small children can't always understand their eyes, and it can't be able to smile in mind and smile, he says.
However, if a child has disrupted the newspapers of refugees or has heard otherwise, it supports speaking.
The debate is good to visit the child's starting points and listen closely to what he asks.
The fear of the child may be surprised.
They are not necessarily those who are older thinking of him.
The child's not gonna be scared of it, even if he himself was worried and feared.
Small children follow the conduct of their parents.
If parents themselves remain peaceful during the conversation, their children also experience their security.
The grandchildren are likely to break the conversation of refugees in schools, friends or networks.
Parents should be good to take them a matter to talk if you think about the child.
The fact is that all humans do not have good things in the world.
Parents can be able to consider how to do this in our family.
But is our mind that the world is finally safe or unsafe?
Parents may also have different trends of education - some may want to protect their children according to the possibilities of suffering.
On the other hand, if a family is also talking about difficult matters, the child will have a model of how to handle the challenges in the future of life.
This can be useful for him.

If they are removed, it may cause problems in some other phones, Cook makes Buzzfeed.
Cookie did not mention what Apple iPhone applications operate with other software.
There are other programs that do not work so.
So with time, I think we can develop the way to allow the user to remove them, you add to cookies.
According to Cookie, Apple is investigating the matter, because the company does not want to torment the memory status of the iPhone phones of users.
In August, inflation in the euro area was 0.1 per cent.
In August only 0.1% of the annual year, the EU statistical authorities reported Eurostat today.
The prices increased downward energy.
Eurostat checked this a couple of weeks behind 0.2 per cent of the predetermination is a little lower.
In July, inflation rate was 0.2 per cent.
In August 0.9 per cent was 1,0 per cent of the basic inflation.
The Eurostat's pre-value for basic inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy was 7.2 per cent in the euro area in the last month than a year ago.
A total of 28 countries in the EU was the average inflation in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1 per cent.
In August, the majority of the European countries, 1.4% of consumer contracts, increased in Malta.
In Cyprus, inflation was at least 1,9% of prices.
In Finland inflation was 0.2% of the mining mark according to the EU harmonised price index.
The inflation of the euro area is still far away from the objective of the European Central Bank (ECB) which has two per cent increases in the average period.
The ECB predicts the euro area for the average of 0.1 per cent for this year.
The next year increased to 1,1 per cent, the Central Bank was in the beginning of September in its new inflation developments.
The United States, Fed, is trying to declare the money policy next.
The next turn of the United States starts the fastest after the year, but more than three years after the Fed Central Bank again began to increase its rate.
And in the financial market, the dimension will start on its part before the next slaughter.
Fed has been able to start its emphasis in this week and last year by the end of the year.
Thus, the next fund may be pressed by the most fastest of its slowest ends and by the expense of the financial markets before it.
Or at least if the world's large economic and financial markets operate as they had been, and if they react to the currency of Fed's money as they have done before.
These guidelines have been concluded by the German Bank in London market research strategies for Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in its broad-term research on the market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed more than 60 pages of Long-Term Asset Return Study for the international research report for large customers last week.
The strategies set out in the research and report do not believe to know when, in particular, Fed starts to increase its rate or what happens in the economy and on the market then.
Instead, they present economic statistics through their realities and accounts how economic and markets have previously been conducted during and after them.
In addition to historical observations, they will consider how the main changes in the economic and financial market are now in the same or other model as in the time of previous recommendations and what might be followed.
It is obvious that the economic and financial markets are now more grateful to sustain higher rates than once before the 1950s.
Maybe it's not a year.
The leaders of the Fed's monetary policy and its golden fluctuation are long-term and starting injuries that the time is starting to be skilled to the expense of the heights.
The first emphasis for over nine years may be incurred in this week.
The matter will be addressed in the mid-week and at the time of the open market committee of the Federation to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
The previous time Fed noted that the Fed funds in June 2006 was called.
At the end of two years, relative regular, but once again, a series of highlights of 0.25 per cent units, with Fed increased by 1.25 per cent of 5.25 per cent.
The symptoms of the financial market began in 2007 with the most dangerous financing of the United States, and years later the financial crisis was the global pressure of the Judge Day.
In 2009, the largest tour was taken.
Recently, serious contractual applications of the financial market and real economy began to be slower than after the previous Fed's emphasis has been typically carried out.
However, the tests were higher and slighter than once ago the lamb of the 1930s.
The German strategies have decreased the increases of the world's largest economics and rates, as well as the translation of the financial markets from the beginning of the 1850s and always from the beginning of the 1800s.
Fed's highlights and their economic and financial impacts have been made clear since the 1950s.
At the beginning of the first emphasis, it has been the fastest time less than the year, mostly less than three years and average less than three and half years.
The rate of the financial market has been concluded two years after the start of the Fed's highlights.
Fed has risen in the mountain and has been calculated in the mountain at the beginning of the 1950s towards the cycle of pain.
Each time has been deleted from some of the other parts, and the reporter has examined a relative necklace, so it may soon conclude the effects of the following emphasis.
Strategics also recall that this time many things are different.
And we're not just gonna be better.
Rate too long on too far
The reasons resolved by the financial crisis could not necessarily be obvious to find out even in decades of research.
But three of the reasons that are leading to the crisis and its growing destruction are inevitable to find out:
(1) Fed, the ECB and other largest central banks in the euro area had to be too long on the end of the 2000s.
They were placed after the technology, and they growed the following.
2) In the various parts of the financial and real economy, the measure was collected for decades and, above all, the too large amount of responsibilities increased in the impact of the financial policy of central banks.
It was the largest debt of the economic history.
3) In particular, the disadvantaged detention of the financial sector involving the majority of the financial markets in the majority of the largest curriculum shares of the economic history in the interests, the most debts and benefits.
In fact, it is unlikely that in the amounts of more complex bonds, the financial markets were rarely dangerous and insufficient when Fed and other central banks were last upwards.
The financing structures covered by the bonds have not developed as the time after the highlights were started and the costs of the financing were turned to increase.
The risks were being carried out as a financial crisis, and it would follow a great deal.
Greater ball and more bonds
The German strategies do not consider what is happening as follows, but give the subject to the summary, for example, the following items:
1) Fed and other larger central banks have now maintained their financing policy as much longer than before finance crisis.
If the rates were too long before the crystals were too long, they were still slower now.
2) The debt has not been long as ten years ago, but the bond is now more grateful than the expression.
Thus, the obligation of the financial and real economy has not been decreased, but now in different parts of the economy, the debt is slower than before the financial crisis or half of them ever before.
3) Another part of the liquidity flows from the central banks has remained in the financial markets and the main values and ownerships of the funds and ownerships, as soon as possible, has remained in the financial market.
And not only the Latin tunnel strategies in the financial market warning marks, but they also noted that even the United States economy has not yet begun to the financial crisis and to the weakest model that has been made in the past for decades.
The euro area's economy is, of course, in any case.
In other words, the reality is insufficiently slow but corresponding to the financial markets and the risks relatively larger than before the financial crisis, when Fed next began to switch its money to more closerly.
Maybe the French Bank, the Société General Strategy Albert Edwards, is not so strange as it can affect its future image.
He has already prepared international investor customers for the following translations:
First, Fed will raise higher prices, and then the finances will be slow - and soon Fed is time to shoot finances from the most largest QE currencies.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) manufacturing computers and Results will even reduce 33000 jobs.
In the case of HP's undertakings, the company reports.
HP is shared in November by Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Consumer Enterprise and a centralized HP Inc. company.
HP staff was the largest in 2011, with 350000 employees.
Last October, the staff has been deleted to 302000.
The company's book of $2.7 billion ($2.4 billion) simple costs.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise reduces 25000-30000 employees.
The reductions of consumers remain in 3300 over three years.
HP intends to transfer its operations to low-cost countries so that 60 per cent of its employees would be low costs in 2018.
The company reports that its balanced business is already so that one of its customers does not meet more than ten percent of its business results.
In other years, the three significant customers were 65% of the commercial results.

General: Minister Berner has operated in the government of the tax party company
Mr Anne Berner, Minister of Transport and Communication, has been a member of the government of the tax company.
I generally believe that the company is involved in such a tax plan.
This is the Saltri II LuxCo company of Luxembourg, a member of the Government of Berner in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg trade register, Berner is still officially a member of the government.
Berner himself says that he left a membership in May this year.
I checked this, and it's enough that I left the difference.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registering chains will occur in the appropriate timetable, Berner says in the general discussion.
Membership after fusion
By means of the Luxembourg company, the ownership of the Swedish Kerhrs company is managed.
Kerhrs is a parking manufacturer who fusioned the Finnish Parker with Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner operates in the government of Karelia-Upofloor in 2010-2013 and after fusion in the Khars government and in the Luxembourg company.
Instead, the ownerships of Kerhrs are walking in Luxembourg through a multi-portal ownership structure.
Berner says to Yle that he accepted the government's membership in the luxemburg company on the request of Kerhrs to be the second largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been with Hartwall Capital in the government of Karelia-Upofloor.
For the company, a partner was found in Swedish.
This company owned the capital shareholder in Luxembourg.
I realized that my own task was to care for the implementation of the capital of the Finnish family company.
It is important that we be worried that the production of capitals of our Finnish enterprises will be taxed in Finland and the next point was secure in this regard, says Berner.
Berner says to Yle that Hartwall Capital's ownership does not connect tax plans.
According to Berner, a complex ownership structure used for taxparts is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kerhrs had the capital fund for Triton for ownerships already prepared by the luxury holding company.

STTK is preparing the alternative work-friendy package
STTK began to prepare optional packages for the churches of working life by the government.
The management hopes, including other payment centre organizations.
According to President Antti Palola, this is the point of view at the spring of the Monday.
Optional methods to reduce the price of work will be returned after it.
Everyone understands that life continues after Monday, Palola observed the meeting of the organization on the table of the prosecutors.
Assessing that the Central Union (EC) is not prepared for discussions.
The Economists estimated that the change in the competitive package of the government will pay to the employee from EUR 30 million, when the second half of the package is 2.700 million.
I don't know whether there's a large innocence to visit the discussion if there's one relationship with a hundred.
Palla: Renewal contact was to be constructed
Prime Minister Juha Sipila (cesk.) has hoped options for the middle-week, since the government has to give its own package information to the committee and to initiate the preparation of reforms.
I don't know if the timetable was realistic.
The discussion contact with the government is, according to Paloa, exists, and it has been the whole time to build.
In particular, the operation of Sunday shareholders on the STTK Office is a painful place in Palola.
The system requires that the government be revoked on a legal law which would be implemented by part of the clergy.
According to the STTK, it does not make sure that the alternative package would be prepared with the SDP.
Paymenters will be gathered afternoon in Helsinki to oppose the last week of the government's work-friendy package.
The packaging packaging of the first age of diseases is cut off, overworks are settled, sunrise costs are reduced to 75% and the leakage is decreased.
The STTK emphasizes that the central organizations have called the payers for the reporting, and that it has not been the purpose of organizing law.
Thanks for the Acavan Fräder
The President Sture Führer thanks to the notification of the STTK for the preparation of a alternative package.
According to Fjeder, the STTK will now be the same line with Akawa, as Akava has already been the most important optional models for the Government's presentations.
Fjeder hopes that SAK is also obtained as a alternative package, as without the SAK package is not sufficient.
President Sture Fjeder hopes that, according to the future of the SAK, the leader of Lauri Lyly will prepare a presentation for an alternative for operations.
Antti Palolan STTK told his new proposals in the mid-week.
We want to change security and worktime banks.
The open week has been prepared for a long time of its own presentation, which is ready to consult the Government of the country as a alternative for operational transactions.
Akava has been ready to consult all the time, and we have already written alternative models for the Government's presentations.
We are willing to look at the conditions of the service relations in particular.
On the other hand, we want to change security and worktime banks, reports President Sture Fäder.
The Fhader hopes that also SAK will be on the Akava lines, as has been done previously in the mid-week.
Without the SAK package, it is not sufficiently strong.
Now we're preparing a model that comes together to the government and workers of the country, Fjder says.
The Labour Committee shall be meeting at 15 p.m. on the possible content of the Agreement.

The Green Left of the University of Tampere, Vivan bingo pocket for the night.
The Prime Ministers have previously maintained exceptional calls during the Middle East and the wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipihu speaks very exceptionally to the state of the Finnish economy at 21.05 p.m.
In 1932, in the case of the preceding Prime Minister, Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the Prime Minister in holding a famous radiophone, which means the start of the end of the country's headquarters.
Then the President and the Ministers had several radiophones during the winter and continued war.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho did President Mauno Koviston instead of the new year, but it was more ceremony.
In 1976, President Urho Kekonne stopped the telephone law.
One phone, a monarchist mine
The civilian talk has risen on the criticism of the whole day and the thoughts of what will be expected.
The President of the Left Unit Paavo Arhinmöhj said on Twitter that "Child was able to keep Sippia speaking on the state of the nation as an advertising of the Prime Minister in which we could also be able to discuss the conversation."
According to the Green Vive, "unit's already seen.
The leadership belongs to dialogue, listening to people.
In Facebook, the SDP's Courts judged that "monarchist's monarchy: the Prime Minister tells the people what is best for it".
Antti Rinne, President of the SDP, argued to the Sipil dialogue: "Another half years of validity.
There is no preceding occurrence from the Prime Minister of Media with opposition.
It's tried.
What is @juhasipila afraid?
Public Service
According to the Government Council, the Cyprus speech has been shocked and sustained for about 15 minutes.
According to the SAK, it was noted that the President of the President of the SAK was sent by Lauri Lyly and Jyri Headman of the EC.
It's a general appreciation for the presentation of the Cyprus talk.
We hoped this, and we found that it was the task of the public service to promote all the Finnish publicity, the line of the General Director of Publications Ismo Silvo Yle in the news.
Like us at the time of the Tempels
The conversation has also been shocked.
Tonight, you'll be enjoyed in a good time, kids will be shocked and shooted better.
Mom's putting the sight's trick and his father agrees with the skin.
From nine o'clock, it's been quiet to the television as before me at the time of the Timony," writes blogger Saku Timone.
"Does the Prime Minister Sippia also speak why the Finnish government has seen millions who hidden its capitals in taxpayers, which put other laws on the arms of the tax partners and claim to the people that it must be shocked when the State has the end of the money?" asked Pia Lohikoski.
What Sipila says, one of the opinions presents the green left of the University of Tampere, Viva.
It has been published in Facebook.
Do we hear the same boat, the common carbon, the speed of living and the spirit of the team?
Pumps and skins are ready, at 21.05 p.m. it starts and channels are TV1, Finnish radio and Yle Area.
Assistant in Guardian: Western countries combat the Russian proposal on the exclusion of Al-Assad
Over three years ago, the Russian offer that President Bashar al-Assad would have been obtained from the power, reports President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to the Atheist, the Russian UN source proposed a plan which would have been slowly disfellowshipped with the power of Al-Assad.
However, the Western countries did not consider the proposal because they believed that Al-Assad was falling in some weeks.
The Agency discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.
In the two-second discussion, the Russian sender Vitali Tshurk read him in three paragraphs: the opposition between arms, opposition and al-Assad must immediately be implemented.
I know Zhurkin.
Not necessarily we are all of the same agreement, but we are able to discuss openly.
I told him what I've done there and he said that Alas, Marty, is sit, so I'll tell you what we need to do, the Assyrian is remembering Guardian's discussion.
Diplomatics do not comment
The expert reports the Tshurkin message to the United States, the United States and the French, but nothing happened.
Tshurk did not confirm the content of the discussion, but Ahtisar says that there are no two words.
The United Nations diplomates also refused to comment on Ahtisar's claims, but said that Al-Assad's troops had already done several civil murders and key opposition groups for all agreements which would have remained in power at that time.
Sir John Jenkins, former Director of the Middle Eastern Ministry, is addressed to the disorders of Ahtisar, because his experience has not been in any stage prepared to discuss Al-Assad.
Officially Russia has supported Al-Assadia for the whole war.
Against the argument of Ahtisar is that Tshurk spoke about the Moscow’s government.
If he had told me about the Tshurkin talk, I would have answered that I would like to hear the same President Vladimir Putin so that I could take it seriously.
In the case of Jenkins, he would also be suspected that Putin had been pleased to keep the power of some Al-Assad supporter.
The fleet of our own works
During the negotiations of the amusement, about 7500 people died during the Syrian crisis.
According to the United Nations argued, the number of victims of death exceeded 2200,000 in the beginning of the year.
More than 11 million people have been flying from their homes because of the war.
We should have stopped this disaster.
Revocation of refugees to Europe is our own work.
I don't see any other option than bearing good care of these humans.
Now, we'll pay the account we've caused, Athenarie says to the newspaper.
Securities applicants' arrangement center in the Toronto
The Planned Northern European Union's Administration is likely to be established in Tornio.
The debate would be based on the construction of the Toronto in the centre of the city.
The Ministry of Inlands has been looking for an appropriate place to improve the control of flights from the Swedish border.
Helsinki’s news was found that the department had already decided to present school construction decisions to the Ministry.
According to Sauli Hyöppis (see.) the Chairman of the city department of Tornion, it does not consider its place.
When the whole department had not been together and the português wanted an official decision, we decided to invite the delegation to decide on this matter on the next Monday, he expresses the STT.
There was 36 delegates in the debate situation of 43.
The Headquarter opposed 13 delegated.
It could be expected to be a positive decision, and it is said.
According to Timo Niiyaze, the city was communicated as an unrelated Sunday, and soon it was reacted quickly.
The Community would be able to evaluate 500 safe-place customers once.
The experts have been examined that it could apply to such use.
The location must be divided from the border, so it would also be active, older.
Cyprus is still hoped to opt for churches on the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipila (C.) the public's defence of loans was only a part of the government's aim to calculate the cost of work.
However, the Government is deeming to adopt an alternative package if the market organizations are able to agree with it.
In the committee, Sipila reported that he had not been linked to the working market organisations.
He also did not know how serious organizations are looking for a way to replace the ways for the churches of work that the government reported.
If such a treaty is born, we will take it without any other joy with a whole package.
The defence of loans would think that Sipil would operate as a way, as it was almost all payers, other than the operation of the government's Sunday.
Labour market organisations could be appropriate for the operation of salary funds, as they are registered instead of the law on the job contracts.
The government reports these visions as a mid-week to the committee of the working chairs as a communication of the State Council.
The proposals of organizations should be informed before.
This isn't the final shop.
Legislative work is going to move, or swimming, and it's going to be more harder for the whole time.
It's a good time now.
There's no long way in these matters, if you want to, Sippia's shape.
In the last week, the list of governments has, in other words, a change of final and hellater for free-term years of work without delay.
Furthermore, the payment of the first diseases is covered, the overworks are decreased, the sunrises are reduced to 75 per cent and the losses are decreased.
Reforms are carried out as a compulsory of law in the end of the vocational associations, which has been renewed by a strong view.
The Ombudsman Centres organize action on Wednesday, as well as many professional associations have declared political laws.
The Delegation of Ministers adopted the expansion of the magistrate stock
The Delegation of Ministers agreed unilaterally but a few of the Northern Koivu Oy, or the expansion of the magic.
Assessed the fact that the project was more grand and more than the first time has been spoken.
Even the urgent timetable is shocked.
It was a little surprising that the conditional need was not known for a year ago when it was decided on the previous expansion.
In this stage, the expansion of the stock was approved to the investment programme of 400-450 square meters, but the money will be decided to be the most important part-time report.
On the other hand, 1500,000 to 200 000 euros were discussed, but the technical director Erkki Ikonen reported that the price would be estimated for EUR 3000,000.
Investment was encouraged by providing work and tax revenues to the location.
The honor has no risk, since the company pays the investor's switch screen, Watsa Division (p.p.).
Turn to language in Joensu
The commercial management of your shipment is previously switched in its position to produce swimming language names in Joenzua.
The new decision is important and right to think about the traditions in the whole country.
Joensuu will not be proclaimed as the capital of the language, because it is not historical foundations, nor the skilled language is a creative part of the identification of the region.
The language speaking in the edge of Jeensua has been more part of the western slaughter.
After a new decision, the centre of the city will not be swimming language channels.
However, the city of Joenzue is possiblely well-decisively prepared to use a swimming language, for example, in the information tables and on the market.
Similarly, the city recommends all other operators.
Although Joensuu is officially a single language community, it also supports the use of the language in an openly now when the multiculturality lives and is strongly changed in Northern Kirjala.
The Language is still special aspects of the country, as well as Joensu, the entire Finnish forest capital.
Each of them can be very useful for the multi-markting markets.
The disadvantages of good contacts strike the power of the country
The transactions of the merger contacts are shocking the earth’s life force with a strong hand.
Transitional communications directly affects the environment and competitiveness of the country.
And it affects whether we can be overlooked here and work, President of the city of Joensue, Kari Kari's miracle.
He also puts out an aircraft that has also continued to be taken in the report.
It is important for the whole country that our opportunities are not to reduce state power measures as now existing.
It should be considered that the effects of these transactions should be reduced, for example, on employment, to be stressed.
The deterioration of communications causes additional problems to the university of Eastern Somalia in terms of attractiveness.
Indeed, what best services are here, such as business and home conditions, it is easy to get students and employees, director of the East Summit University.
He notes that bad transit contacts also affect an investigation that is very moved and traveling because of the study.
Marko Junkkarin said that the marketing of the university at the present time is difficult, because the transit contacts are weak in the university.
At this time, about half of the students of Eastern Soomen University come from the outside of East Suome.
Around 10-20 per cent of them is the New Year, which is explained in part by the bicycle connection.
The Jeensue became one of my sons to the war of Ziun.
The view of the country's war project of Joensua is apparently unilateral, but one of the spectacles is also in the group.
Mr Pentti Centralsallo (s. image) presented the Government at the summony of the project, but its proposal was unfavourable.
The government adopted the President of the city, Kari Kari, a resolution that is still amended at the beginning of October before the meeting of the Cities's delegation, which gives a final opinion at the same time with all other committees.

The kids kicked into the castle, one didn't go down, the boys lifted out of the place
The Saviation Office left a swimming snake to a 12-year-old swimming swimming snake that wasn't opened from the castle.
Your condition was born at Tornion in Ketoti, half the eve of the night.
There is an old wood of two-fold wood where there are no threads in the bowl.
It was not prevented by a child who decided to switch up the castle of the house on his side of the radioamers.
The other kids got the same way down, but not one.
It was the fact that others switched from the place and passengers alarmed the place of the Savior Office to help the last shops to be safely residued on the ground.
FedEx's business shipping two, calculate the visions of the 2016 year
FedEx reported the deteriorating results from the last fourth century, and the department switched the whole yearly resulting test, as a result of the deterioration of reporting services and the higher costs of its rural services.
The company also said that it would be paid for about 550,000 sex-generators for the days of the departure.
In the past year, FedEx reported that it is being rewarded by 500,000 sex-sexercisers for the last time.
The share of its share was about 2,5% of the expense for 45 minutes prior to the mid-week.
FedEx Corp says that it will wait for the next end of May for 10,40-10,90 dollars, which is less than 20 cents less than previous prophecy.

However, the increase in the network trade has improved the results of FedEx Ground.
In the latest fourth country's trade change increased 29%, but the results of the operations were in principle the same because of the expenditure and insurance of the largest packages.
The income of the Express unit was better because of the higher base payments, while re-transport costs were higher.
Accommodation passing about an hour before FedEx's shares are counted by $3.85 or $2.5 per cent to $ 150.15.

The heads of the United States Central Bank are settled this week by two days in waiting for a long meeting, whether it has been time to increase the control rate for the first time for nearly ten years.
Secondly, the twelve meeting room of the Central Bank is the seaside from the United States.
The map is remindered that President Janet L. Yellen and his colleagues must set up the economic interests of the people in all other ways.
The Congress has been calculated by two responsibilities in the Central Bank: they must maximize the employment of the United States and keep the prices seriously.
However, after the largest floor, the leaders of the Central Bank have agreed that there is also a third non-scribed mandate: economic stability.
Indeed , this third requirement may be a resolving factor in the public decision which is so strict that it may not even be predicted.
Although the majority of the information shows that the growth of the economy is stable, the latest death on the global financial market may have already been made by the officials of the central banks in the front of the prerequisite way to increase in the insecurity, and it is fearing how it would affect if the funds rates of the Union would even be tested in the fourth percentage units.
"Overy understanding the labour market and inflation are the first and most important things that are followed," states Lindsey M. Piegza, the principal report of Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But if they are looking for the right to leave the rate, increased insecurity on the world markets is sufficiently qualified to expect yet," he says.
The decision of the Central Bank has not been reached to a common understanding, which is something to bring nervousness to the economy.
According to the outcome study of Bloomberg, about half of the economic reporters predict that the rate is higher in this week.
Financial markets are still expected that the Central Bank will be delayed, as the main indicator states that the growth possibility is only 30 %.
This refers to the account of the values market, if the Central Bank increases the level, unless the principals would then be able to shoot the shooting by promising that the next rate will not be taken in the next few years.
In time Dow Jones industry average - indexed 228.89 points, or 1.4%, at the new chapter 16.599.85.
It is expected that the Central Bank holds the level before this week, reports John Lonski, Moody's Capital Markets Research Group reporter.
"I'm surprising if the Central Bank gets up the heights right now," he says.
If the publishers highlight the heights, "we must see much difficult in their lines to support the financial markets so that they do not lead to panics."
Other experts claim that the total level would calm the financial markets because it would remove the incertitude of when the Central Bank operates.
Only a month ago, the Central Bank was affected by a high rate in this month in the fourth percentage unit, thus taking the first small step towards the situation of money, which would ensure the stability of the United States.
In general, it has been said that he expects to increase the level this year, despite the need for liberalians to require more economic development in its elections.
Although the creation of new jobs was short in August, the growth in the labour market has been stabilized this year.
The rate of unemployment in the last month was at 5,1 per cent of the number of seven years and near the level of the Central Bank to be the full-scale limit.
The growth of the wages has shown signs of shocking.
Although inflation is still under the 2% annual target of the Central Bank, the Central Bank has significantly affected the price of the oil.
The economic "excellently higher rates and also need to take into account the strict situation of the labour markets", states Ian Shepherdson, Pantheon Macroeconomics company.
However, the financial markets around the world struggled last week when China defended their wealth.
Dow Jones in the industry - index even 16 per cent of its mixture, when investors feared that China’s long-term economic growth was also a global growth.
The markets have reached some amount in this month, and the Dow index is now almost 10% below the mixed level.
On the basis of the fact that the rate of the rate must be increased, the market is an additional compliant equality, which is reported as the higher rate is to be increased.
"Unless these events of the financial markets and the last weeks news on the weakness of China's economy, the heads would clarify the level at this meeting," says Stephen D. Oliner, UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate, and the official of the former Central Bank.
Now he foretold that the decisions are expecting at least a month to have better effects of view.
"Natural effects to the United States economy are particularly uncertain, and they do not have any information on the use of the results of the Chinese events," Oliner states.
The international economic well-being is not the maintenance of the Central Bank, so it should therefore not affect the decision.
However, the use of the Central Bank of the Union has been the world's money authorized.
In recent years, the impact of the Central Bank has been unplanned.
In 2013, the President Ben S. Bernanken, the conviction that the Central Bank can increase the amount of money, caused motions in the world's markets.
In the world where markets and economics are still in advance, the officials of the Central Bank are expected to be on the other hand, also consulting other central banks and experts in order to achieve a better view of the world's economy.
The decision-making process of the Bank is "ther artistic than science", says Zachary Karabell, Head of the World Strategy of Investet Inc.
The Federal Reserve Bank (Federal Bank) of the Virginia State in Richmond, President Jeffrey Lacker noted in this month that "the Central Bank has previously overcome its financial market trade, which has affected the different economic factors".
The Federal Open Market Committee, which has taken decisions, has requested an impact, and Lacker, a voted member of the Committee, is a example of decisions between 1998 and 99.
The Asian economic crisis caused a reference value by the Central Bank at 0.75 per cent unit during the three meetings "in spite of the limited and identifiable effects of the United States economic growth", Lacker says.
Years later, the Central Bank shocked these operations.
The bank also should set an economic stage to the only time of a large crisis, as the markets destroyed in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, the English Central Bank (Bank of England).
Lastly, the voice will not be close to its level, and Posen states.
"No one wants to do a situation where the rates are scared because the markets are harmful," said Peterson Institute for International Economics President Posen.
The law of the Member State on the Central Bank (Federal Reserve Act) remains to be included in two requirements, and is not the economic stability, as long as this is, they do not think it should be prevented.

Food can help low-scale diabetes
According to a new study, the benefits of the 2 diabetes of the bleeding system may be at least five years.
However, it is still too premature to say whether these slowly limited diabetics are longer than those who are treated in other ways than in operation.
"The receipt of mortality data is long." Dr. Robin Blackstone states. He is a reporter who wrote for a new study of JAMA Surgery during the period of time.
The use of different methods in the barrier operations should be reduced.
They reduce hunger and limit food inhibitance.
In years, bariat operations have been effectively identified in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of those participated in the study have been hospitally meat, and their pressure index (BMI) has been 35 or more.
BMI, or the weight level, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If the MIB is over 25, it shows that somebody is superpressive, and if the MIB is over 30, it is considered to be excessive.
You can calculate your own BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new research, researchers in the Mexican Min-Sheng General Hospital hospital used from 2007 to compare two barriers surgery surgery operations, random interference and reducing the landscape, the medical treatment of the type 2 of the diabetes, which were slowly limited.
The investigation showed that the average BMI of operational persons was from 31 to 24.5 at the end of the Fifth year.
At the same time, those who were treated in other ways than operations, BMI remained the largest part of 29.
With 36 percent of the heavy persons, diabetes improved totally and 28 percent of them.
As a result of comparison, in the medically treated group diabetes improved only by 1 per cent and by some 2 per cent.
In addition, blood pressure, triglyserides and "fat" LDL colleagues "was generally taking better in the best surgery group", writers explained.
Studiers also followed hemoglobin A1c levels of patients that reflect blood sugar in a long period.
Hemoglobin A1c should remain in less than 7 per cent and write researchers.
The rate of hemoglobin A1c post-operation was around 9 per cent to about 6 per cent.
However, in the medicine group, it remained stable in about 8%.
However, this best "glyke control" which improved hemoglobin A1c levels did not reduce mortality during five years, reports to Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu collegone.
The research group also compared the average results between two different types of operation.
In the five-year context, when compared to the group in the slow-sized skin, the group in the slow-scale was declined more weight (18,7 and 14,2 kg), hemoglobin A1c was more (3,1 % and 2,1 %), and the total diabetes remission (46,9 % and 16,7 %).
The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix says that, although research does not seem to be a lifestap or an operation after five years, there are studies on Swedish, where the surgery has led to the worst of life with the worst humans.
The Swedish investigation reported that less likely to die 15 years, with a group that had experienced more traditional treatments.
Although a new study does not appear to improve operational patients, Blackstone says that the results are encouraged to those who are under 35 BMI and who are interested in the operation.
"The results of the expertise are just resolved by showing that transaction is safe to the group of lower pressure indexes", and it does not engage in the risk of death or renal disease, he says.
More than Blackstone, both patients and their physicians should take a very serious weight at the stage when BMI is 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long before we take this seriously," he says.
I believe that when humans have collected these genetic changes that constantly prepare his body for excessiveness and diabetes, the elimination of the situation is very difficult.
"All can't come to Europe" Dalai Lama - RT News
Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept any additional of the refugees that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is found from the Middle East.
The Chief of Buddhism has requested the end of violence in the homes of refugees.
Dalai Lama was discussed in his speaking of refugees in Oxford at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the British visit.
Dalai Lama said that in the current situation, the whole humanity needs should be placed by individual nations or even before the earth.
He also stressed that although the response of Western European countries to refugee crises is not sufficient, it is also inadequate.
"All can't come to Europe," he said when he talked.
Although Dalai Lama exceeded the action of Germany and Austria in the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"I'm glad to worry about several thousands of refugees, but it must be considered a long-term solution: how to these Muslim countries can bring real peace and real development through education.
The most important thing is to consider how we can reduce the killing of their country.
We need to reduce the use of power.
The use of power has never solved these problems," he added.
On the basis of the question of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and said that the United States's violent response was caused by the rail events.
"After the 9/11, I presented in my letter to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem is to be found through violence.
I know that his motives were good, but he used strength, and it took unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
In the past four years, the elimination of the processing substances of children has increased into neon-linking.
In other parts of the United States, the toxicization data reported that nearly 400% of the increase in alcoholic manipulation substances were strongly increased after children under 12 years of age, reports Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, the director of Georgia drought information, reported to the infectious data of desinfying substances under 12 years of age, increased from 3266 cases in 2014 to 16117 cases.
"Belows are interested in these products more often and slowly certain percentages of them are to be a copy of ability", reported the CNN.
He said that some children drink the desinfying substance with a purpose when some of them want to make an impact on their friends or respond to the challenge in social media.
YouTube has videos where tein-years drink desinfying substances to get a pleasant increase.
According to reports, desinfying substances have been desinfected to alcoholic sugar to get more stronger drink.
The desinfying products of desinfying substances may affect younger children.
"The child doesn't think it's bad about him," said Lopez.
Many of the most interesting (concerns) are those that have been added.
There are substances of desinfectization that are very attractive in the mind of children.
The desinfiation substance may contain alcohol from any 45 to 95 per cent.
Especially small children are needed only a few drunkens for alcohol injury.
"It's a very intensive alcohol," Mr Stephen Thornton, director of the University of Kansas Medical Medical Information Medical Information Administration Office, reported to Fox 4: in Kansas City.
So you wouldn't leave the viscoshot to spend on the table, but the hand-infection substance will be abandoned and if children are interested in it, it's a fast way to drink much of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six-year-old girl, who just a few years ago slaughtered four skins of skins in hands of desinfying substance in the school, and was carried it to the first tree.
His blood alcohol was .179, which is two times higher than adult rats, reports primary polyclinic doctor Chris Ritchey, who handled the girl in the Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was able to walk when he arrived in the first tree.
The doctors followed him the night in a different hospital of children with potential brain diseases, since alcohol was cut down and shooted with her head, Ritchey told.
"It was really terrified," Ortoria Scott said to CNN.
You might have killed my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use alcoholic products or desinfying requests and transfer from the desinfying substance from children.
In addition to alcohol drugs, some desinfects have been combined with deaths.
In 2013, two emerging women died with the desinfection substance containing an unreported substance.
Health authorities understood that the product contains methane, murdering substance, nor ethyl alcohol that had been reported as an active substance.
In January, in the northern part of the New York State, three four-class classs planned to be shocked by proclaiming bacteria to the classroom, the police reports.
The teacher is very allergic in the hand of the desinfiation substance, and it was a tongue with its nature.
The police must prevent the plan as a "comfortable smuggling" and leave the ruling action towards schools.

Derek McInnes acknowledges that his team, Aberdee, was unfortunately cut together with the game against Hamilton Accies, but made it possible for Adam Rooney's first party's punishment pocket to reach its seventh original ligation, which followed them on the table five points above Celticia.
McInnes says, "No there was no team that would have won anything, then it was a pocale or liga that wouldn't have winned games in this way."

INSTRUCTION in Scotia remained within the period between May and July, while the unemployment in the whole of the United Kingdom increased 100,000 people in total 1,82 million.
Scotland unemployment rate 5.9% is higher than 5.5% in the United Kingdom, the National Statistics (UNS) chapters.

Scotland's Secretary David Mundell commented on these last numbers: "The long-term plan of the problem is to build the basis for the more stronger economy."
About a year ago, Scotland has taken a historic decision to remain part of Isoa-Britannia.
In these 12 months, Scotland labour markets have improved, unemployment has increased and unemployment has been calculated.
Why I am witnessing in Oklaho?
If no legal income will be occurred, I'll see today when a man is done.
If so, and I hope not, I'll sit down in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary press at the time Richard Glossip's murdering shoes.
He has asked me to be one of the four official Witnesses of his death.
I replied the request in January through his best friend, and even though I was confused, I agreed.
I'm starting to smell this day near it.
So why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the death penalty all the story.
It would offer a unique view.
The employees have the possibility of monitoring distortions in the United States, and because the applications are often more than free places, the participants are selected through a tragic value.
Oklahoma has reduced the places covered to the media for the twenty-five reference.
Whoeverever will be chosen is looking at the event in a while.
I can't do that.
I'm going to sit near the nearest friends of Richard Glossip, and I have also created him my own contact during my months and through a two- and mixed visit.
I like a man.
We're often angry when we talk.
The prison authorities say that I can’t be a Witness and a supplier, so I must not have the memory book and a cry to save my views.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
One Western supplier accused of my independence on Twitter.
Here's a teaching.
Tell the prison story that she wants, so you can participate.
I chose to the supplier.
He agreed that "I could have made it better for you," but it is still agreed that what I do is wrong.
Richard Glossip has been different with some of my words and my writing things.
He doesn't tell me what I should write, and I wouldn't do so even if he said.
I told her that he could just remove me from the Witness list.
But he wants that there is an international translator who writes about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity helps the opposite direction of death penalty.
Huffington Post's reporter Kim Bellware is near me.
If you want to know more about the conversation, you can listen to my series of podcast expenses.
I'm not going through all the details again.
I can't make sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
After his work, Barry Van Treese's murder, they would have made him a guilty.
But I think it's a very strong chance of not being accused of murder.
I certainly believe that death penalty was not sufficient.
I think it's wrong.
And so this is the look I'm looking at him to die.
I can't say I'm completely indefensive.
There will be other providers who are concerned about it.
I'll be able to see what you feel when the man I like is going to die without need.
The man was shocked away from the Canning River after a smooth police team.
Canning Vale's officer remained shocked when he shocked a man out of the Canning River.
From Perth's home, a man's company was shocking the police's appeal went into a shock when he found himself out of the shooting water only on the shooting of the police that tried to "beat him back to the beach".
The Canning Vale police was called to Beckenham for an unlawful detention.
When they found a doubt, they tried to shoot them through the Canning River.
But he didn't get too long.
"He stood in the water, saying, "I'm not going to go, get me." Says the older superstar Shandell Castledine.
The officer Lachlan Perhavec did not want to grow up his unit, so he used more safeer tactics: "I'm a police negotiation."
"Something people do a lot of trouble when trying to escape," said the parent overseer Castledine.
Master's modeller Ben Cousins is an example of mental pressure.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid infringement and tried to take Swan River joe over.
He didn't have been successful in the company, but inspired locally to start playing Ben Cousins - Biothlon's design.
Peter Moody claims that the officials are trying to steady him and threaten to stop competitiveness
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victoria's employees have tried to solve his stability in his stories last year, and it is threatening to stop competitively.
He accused of officials and Racing Victoria’s donor insurance by claiming that they have a personal campaign to start with him.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is the best competition, and that he has become a difficult situation in the unexpected positive cobaltment of the Lydar.
He has been talking about stakeholders for a half years, and he didn't want to say "that would look like a defective."
"I didn't have to say anything, and I've been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes it's so disappointed that all of them are slaughtered again," Moody said.
They knew that the situation continued.
Sometimes it must only react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I have said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to spend my head in the power and I want the owners to think I'll do my best before them.
When they start thinking about another thing, I don't have to continue as a trainer.
Then I should think what I'm doing to my license.
Before Moody hit the bomb in the Racing.com site in which he told that the Unschentable Division had tried to steady his shoot.
"Third years ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sit in the room with a man, I'm named her asking, and they offered her work on my store if he's talking about what I'm doing there.
Of course, they're looking at me as an hour.
If that's so, they're going to have to disappear their lawyer, because they've failed to do my catch.
Robert Roulston, Racing Victoria's former President, David Moodie, the current president of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, the current director of the Victoria, were all of this and are now discovering.
Should I start thinking that this is about personality?
Did Victoria Racing finally decided to be a men and may be to move responsibilities to others other than trainers about what happens in the field?
I'm in the field?
I'm so angry in the field?
Maybe people think so.
Maybe they must take my licence and work me on discrimination, and I don't doubt if the matter that I say may not be possible to think about it right now.
But I'm on that point now, I don't care anymore, and it's swearing me.
It really hurts me.
I regret them to make a decision which is responsible for them.
I have my family support, and I can translate my way to this.
The deterioration of the trainer has increased the long-term cobalt study of Lidar, and the late abandonment was to state that it could "hitting its license over the table".
Moody, who is known for the training of Black Caviar, has called the Rule on the Treatment of Thursday Measures to be "speakable" after the legs of swimming or swimming smells of horses, which are unregulated.
"It is against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility of it," he said.
One of my employees made a mistake to change his feet.
That could have been a sweet last night.
That could have been it yesterday, like it was.
It was on the breakfast.
Moody may have a prohibition of competitiveness for three months because of the treatment of skin day, which the employees started the study.
It's ridiculous.
People who put these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We all understand that the rules are needed, but this has been too long." Moody said.
In Cobram, a convicted driver is arrested
The police's arrested a man who was accused of being slaughtered at a weekend in Cobram.
Travellers were carried on the Royal Melbourne Hospital Hospital, when the car slaughter slaughtered to him on the Morray Valley on Saturday morning.
The police told that the driver had gone, and he wasn't stopped to help the fertilized driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia was reported to the police in Shepparton.
It will be accused of stopping the accident, the disruption of the aid and other transport vehicles.
The trainer, a 40-year-old man Cobramis, is still in the hospital and his situation is serious.
Melbourne Storm trainer Craig Bellamy attacks competitors in presses
Melbourne Storm trainer Craig Bellamy has criticized two NRL-rubbyligan mastersuthers that his teams would be part of the "interruption".
Sydney Roosters' trainer Trent Robinson said the "print" of separate maiden Storm on his own side when it surprisingly wins the final castle in Sydney on Wednesday evening.
Brisbane Broncos Manufacturer Wayne Bennett shocked a shock with a reference to Stormi after he wined North Queensland Cowboys at the finalising kitchen. Bennett called the game as a "view window" and said that two teams of Queensland weren't "sweet excited".
Bellamy defended his teams and said they only focused on "contacts".
Bellamy adds that his confidence adds two trainers to Storm, as it means that they fear the loss of their team.
"This will always be a conversation... I didn't hear about Trent Robinson's pressure when we lost 24-2," Bellamy said in the middle week.
I can see that we haven't changed anything in our defence system or in our technology all year, and in the past six weeks we've just pushed up contacts, and it has made us successful.
Trent has been in the team three years, and she's apparently have a great team to prepare, so he's probably not able to lose, and this had a little reason for him.
Hassan how this will always be talking about this year.
Bellamy deceived the thought of Bennett "smiling rumby" by recalling his mentor that the trainer of St George Illawarra Dragons wins the mastership in 2010 by playing "this."
Wayne's talking about a shocking rushby.
She wanted to compare the game on Tuesday night on our lunch night and tell us how depressing their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember 2010 how St. George was criticized often by the fact that it is a stupid team, and Wayne said that it could not be less interested.
But now he has a team that is able to play a swimming ruby, especially when he has fast young friends.
You want to play such a game when you have the types of players.
He took it in the middle of 2010, now he wants to play everybody with his sweet snake - not who's in the team with friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt, so that he can play so.
I'll be more reliable when they say such things because they're a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think we were opposed to the most important games.
Bellamy also noted that the game between Storm and Roostersi was more puzzle than played between Broncos and Cowboys.
Broncos game was certainly good game, I didn't have seen it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two more lands, but is it a shocking ruby?
Or does it deceive the defence line and leave the country?
It's about lines for me.
If they mention us, it means that we can play against them.
Stomer has a free of this weekend, because they have already winned home games at North Queensland Cowbosses or Cronella Sharks's pre-finishing night at AAMI Park. Lips will come to sale next Thursday.
Serbian $200,000 for drug reasons
A man who is threatening the possibility of living in Queensland from the 40 cocaine kidnapper undertaking, has been released against $200,000.
Marko Macsimvic, a 29-year-old man, was one of the five men who was arrested last month after the police of the Alliance had posted 100 pounds of drugs to the Solay Jaid that came through South America through Vanuatu and was held in August in Coomerya.
Maksimov was seen to see others who were accused of the whole morning, and then he met them in the Coomera Roadhouse coffee where the police found 40 pounds of the Toyota Echo car.
Although Macsmovicia threatens the potential life-based business of the amount of cocaine management company, his lawyer claimed that there is no evidence that Maximov tried to keep the entire amount in its control, and that he could be fully in the coffee because of its unclean reasons.
The Supreme Judge Peter Flanagan was concerned about trying to run.
"He has strict contacts to Serbia.
He's traveling to Serbia often," she told the court for a half week.
In the case of the Criminal Court of Justice, Maximov lied to the police from the place where he lived.
Massimovic’s mother and father’s parents together offered $2000,000 to ensure his release.
"The lighting certificates of both persons is clear that the setting of $20,000 is a real economic race of them," judge Flanagan said.
But it wasn't enough to stop him unexpectedly before the court, he warned.
Maksimov was granted to the police daily and maintained its foreign transmission ban between Australia and Serbian.
Stevan Hogg used a girl's phone to touch pedofils to send pictures
Pedofil used a 11-year-old girl by requesting images for children's use.
Stevan Hogg took a girl in bed with this phone and then registered into the network message service where Hogg received several photos of the children who sent him another user.
The girl wakeed up later, noted that the phone was lost and found it on the hand of Hoggi.
The girl investigated his phone, and finds an enormous message after she immediately told his mother about it.
When the police came to see five pictures, investigated the computers on the place, and found "required" network applications for applications that were used to search for images of untrained swimming children.
Then Hogg said to the police that he had done this "to shoot pedofils" on the Internet before he said "If he would be the police to fear them."
He said to the Court of Justice of Dundee: "He said that there is an advisory, that he is depending on the fear of people.
He agreed that he had performed the top computer but said that it was only because he wanted to do his police so that he could smell pedophiles.
He was asked about the discussions with an unknown person who sent his pictures, and when Hogg asked the person to send additional pictures.
Hogg said that he only did this in the meal.
He said he'd have to get sick, and he wants to look at the pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added: "When the girl found the pictures of his phone, she shouted his mother, your treasure and smile.
Mom saw the shooting pictures on the phone, and then he met the accused.
She was discussed, and she told me that he was accused of using computers and Playstation to speak to her girls who showed him more young.
Ward Road in Dunde, 23-year-old Hogg acknowledged the accused of preparing or taking images of unlawful children on the last 14th June of the year. He ruled by the rule of this year on 25 January and left the Court of Justice on 24 March this year.
The politician Gregor Sim asked that Hoggia would not mean sex-related registers, since it could be claimed that his crime was not “the important sexual elements”.
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal has sentenced in October so that the social office has time to prepare background reports.
It was granted to Hoggi in this case, but in other cases he has been arrested before the process was processed.
He was added to sex-training registers before the date of judgment.
Zimbabwen Robert Mugabe took a false talk to Parliament
Mugabe’s older leader of Africa has fallen in the doors of the speaking year before.
He wasn't hurt, but the video described on the fall has spread the virus in social media.
I also have opened the parliamentary views of the arguments of the lawyers that they had been sent unnome death situations in which they were warned to rebuild Mugabe during his speech.
In the past months, they burned and stopped him in interviews when he maintained the conversation on the state of the country to Parliament - which speech he repeated.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) controller of the Group Force Innocent Gone said in its seven opposite policy telephones text messages that were warned by Mugabe's conversation.
"Numero, from which the message was sent, is not answered, but the title of the message is 'death'," Gones reported to the suppliers after the conversation of Mugabe.
The report was warned by the Members concerned that the deficiency ends to Parliament and when they are out there, Parliament's unfairness is not possible.
The supervisor of the group said that the party, leading to Morgan Tsvangirai, is "in care" of the threats against its policies.
Hewlett-Packard reduces even 30 000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard has been expected to operate 25 000-30 000 jobs in its reorganization and consumption in business services.
After this year, HP will be distributed to two post-listed enterprises, separated by the more rapidly increased business equipment and services of their computer and printing transactions.
The expected job operations are at least 2.7 billion dollars costs from the fourth fourth, as stated in the HP information.
"This restructuring measures will enable the new competitive and sustainable consumption structure to Hewlett Packard Enterprise", said Meg Whitman, President of HP and Director of Agency, which leads to the unit after the post.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than the current HP, and we'll have a wide and deeply selected service that helps firms to move into the new business", Whitman said.
As a particular company, our possibility to respond to the needs developed by our customers worldwide is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be more than $50 billion annual business, and it is "desperate to produce integration of technological firms without comparisons" to companies, in the information of the company.
The company that Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard had prepared from Stanford University University in the 1930s to prepare electrical needs. The company operates in the car rental named "Ploo-Upland".
HP has been used through a huge reorganization to determine the transition of traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is a second larger computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest technological companies in the United States, and its distribution is the last sector based on the faith that strictly limited enterprises will be better implemented.
Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says that team friends have to support the injured Jack Wilshere before the dinamo Zagreb game.
Wenger has also stressed Wilshir that now is just September and that he's planning according to the plans, there's no reason why he wouldn't be up to Christmas to play again.
In this best case, at least four of the next English games, and when considering its background, it is insecure if he participates in European masterships.
The biggest regret in this last problem is that Wilshere was the end of the last few years to be stronger after the individual swimming, and he remembered the old skin before the beginning of the years.
"This isn't threatening urine," Wenger said.
It's a shock that didn't have been improved with honor.
It's nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It doesn't connect to his necks or any more weakness that he had.
This may take place of medical view, but, as well as Wenger, the attempt to play the player to return through it is always the risk of the worst.
Adjustment has also an inadequate model.
First Injuries Ltd’s research shows that Wilsher had 23 different weaknesses after he debited six years ago.
Moreover, in the past five years, he has played 157 liga games only in 65 games.
In view of the increased totality of Arsenal since 2007-08, the sixth period of the eighth of the Valoliigan teams that have lost the most days for the breast.
Wenger admits the possibility of wednesdays, but Arsenal believes that their past few years' improvement continues.
"If you're returning from the worst may be a long time when you need to strengthen body and purchase competition," Wenger said.
Jack's enough young enough to get over it.
I hope that his body will be stable, I'm sure that it's going to be, and that he's got to be done as a snake.
Wenger is prepared to run his team when Arsenal starts the game of the Mediterranean liga in the mid-week against Dinamo Zagrebia I played after Sunday after Chelsea and the next half-week to Totenham Hotspuria.
Hector Bellerin and Aaron Ramsey haven't traveled to Croatia, which means that Matthieu Debooky and Arta are probably at the start.
Wenger can also set Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud Aftero Monreal and Theo Walcotti.
"I'm trying to hold up the balance and to give the breath to the skilled players," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear F-lok continued support, the Maximir Station in Zagreb is the most fearful European station.
Dinamo also has not lost 41 battles after they produced their own "unfortunate" campaign in the past few years.
Stadium was shocked in the midnight, which was forced at 3.2 Richter's stage.
It was ten in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has been learning about the dedication of the Messiah in the past few years against Monaco, and he has reasoned to lead the team to the winning of its first European cup.
"This motivation is great," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved it.
We were very close to 2006, but, on the other hand, we were realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not a dealer.
FriendsFest: Comedia series that taught us serious things about friendship between men
It is so slightly how similar descriptions are not in the series, especially when considering the need for men to open the need to be worse than ever, and the numbers of young men’s self-assault by higher than for a reference year.
In 2013 the suicide was the largest death in men 20-45 years in Britain, and it is three times more common than women.
In the company's problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) reported the men in 2015. The goal was to challenge the culture that prevent men from seeing help if necessary.
A friendship is at the moment of faceing this challenge.
In this study, more than 2000 students of high school and classic students were referred to in decline consumption, and a study states that the person is able to get two times, if sufficiently higher percentage of his friends were "healthly minded".
Similarly, those who had not been deceived, the probability of apparition of potential mental health problems faced severely if they had healthy friends.
But so that friendship can work, it must first be available.
In this social media, the style ends into content and the interface of the answer is often more important than the significant contact.
Our digital life has doubled the need to affect strong, happy and successfully, although in reality the diversity is dominated.
The values that psychologists call for outside: money, imagination, social status. All this happens in internal values - the personal growth and friendship costs that affect our mental health more.
And as a billion video player explained very much, the money really does not get greater happiness.
Frendi's greatness was just that it was translated to this focus.
Their work was not defined, but, above all, their personality, which has clearly differed as friends of the age.
Joey and Chandler’s several desires, a slightly sighting football in those moments, Ross’s age -- these drugs came to know that yes, men may be similar to this whole, although they often suspected to study their feelings completely.
As the volunteer of the Samaritans Organization explained to me: "When I listened to people who are depressed and self-enforced, I really understood how small the effect of a friend can improve the situation."
Many of us are experienced that they can't talk to friends.
The old thought of "speaking out" is strong, as well as the feeling that if it opens the problem, we will see as weak.
Frendit is one of the series that will be in mind when I try to provide more long-term survival frameworks.
That highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
Although I am an unfair, external position on the other side of the phone helps people at the moment of disappointment, long-term support will be closed, from a personal family and friends network.
And so if you participate in the Comdy Central FriendsFest in this weekend, and all the descriptions are planned for the honour, why don't you take your friends to coffee Central France?
Or what's better if you see somebody in Starbucks?
You can't never know how much your friendship can be.
Frendits will be sent to Comdy at the end of the center, all 236 parts, participate in #FriendsFest
Di Maria makes it swallow and helps PSG to heat on the Malmwo page
Angel Di Maria celebrated Blaise Matud and Edinson Cavan against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria made the ligate of the Master's ligature by helping the Swedish teams in Malmay.
Besides the fight report and the reactions on the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain began a liga game at the end of the 2-0 vote against Malmö in the park of the Princess.
In the debyte of the Master’s liga, in the late four minutes of the matrix showing the way to the French ligators, the team stripped a number of opportunities before finally adding its fronts to Cavan’s attack in the 61th minute.
Paris, which was at the same time with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish ligamester, because the game was not only a subsequent place, but also improvement in their fourth final games in the last three circuits
But even though PSG was shocked, there was no classic game in this case, because the Laurent Blanc team Zlatan Ibrahimovic was shocked in front of the land and then changed from the field.
"Their liability is not easy to win home or visit, so 2-0 is to produce problems to the opposer and seem good in statistics, and it's a good start, even though we have things that we have to do this time", said White.
That's good.
We wanted to win and win, even though we were not able to make one or two more lands.
Ibrahimovic returned to the couple's team together with three changes after the 2-2-th Game Game in Liga 1: at the end of the weekend, but he left the Di Maria's guard in four minutes.
When he moved from Manchester from the United States in the past month, a argentian slaughter was called a man to the new level of PSG in Europe, and he proved why to drink Marco Verratt's food in the back of Malmah's defence line and then shocked the beautiful last of Johan Wiland's network.
But if someone was waiting for PSG's easier and great winning, he was going to be disappointed.
The Malmoo was a nine international player and a Visual Defense and two players in a deep central.
But the team did not offer any other attack than Nikola Djurdjicin's 34-minute shooting, which went through the shooter of Kevin Trappi.
Instead, the PSG came between the slaughter and the bad end of the slaughter, especially from Ibrahimovic, which in all five enterprises had failed only to be the first side and after that Cavani put the ball into the counterparty of Ibrahimovic immediately at the beginning of the second half.
However, he was much more effective when he was making a presentation to his colleagues, and just at Ibrahimovic’s eating Di Maria sent a trip to a round pocket that was shocked around the Wiland's landscape around 52 minutes.
Another slaughter was shocked by the Uruguayn Cavan after Ibrahimovic was shocked before Maxwell’s slaughter.
The hope of Malm’s back to the game, and only Wiland's magnificent fighting from the right shooting David Luis had the end numbers down before the changing of Ezequiel Lavez was abandoned in the entire end of the game.
The trainer Age Hareide later welcomed that the PSG was the same level as his team. Norwegian said: "The last time we played the Meeting liga was in December last year."
Then we have just played the Swedish link that is not the same level.
It's not enough for warning negotiations.
Nostan's got to Paris.
This was a great game to them.
Glencore collects 2.5 billion dollars for sales of pieces
In Switzerland, Glencore, who had suffered from the price consumption of basic products, collected a medium week of $2.5 billion by sale of shares in its broad wage plan.
Glencore, listed in the London Post, reported that it had sold new parts about 1,6 billion of red to reduce its debt.
The company that lost 57 per cent of its market value this year is fighting with the costs of devastating baskets when China's economic expansion is slowly demanding and destroying all markets.
The remarks pointed out the value of Glencore shares in London in the mid-week trade rates.
The shares increased 2.77% of 131.60% of the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69% higher.
Glencore had shown in the past week a part of $2.5 billion in the share of its shareholding plan to cover its $30 billion in about the third.
The company solds a new share capital in 125 peak shares, which was 2.5 per cent of the reduction of its decision-making price.
The company sold 1,3 billion parts, with a total of 9,99% of the total value.
In the same time, the prices of coal, coffee and other benefits have reduced 20-40 per cent.
The White House confirms the visit of Xi Jinping to Washington
The Chinese President Xi Jinping, at the end of the month of the United States, has been confirmed by the White House in the opinion published.
The first official visit of X to Washington takes place on 25 September and is the response to the President Barack Obama last November at Peking's visit, said.
The President of the United States and the President Michelle Obama are organizing the X and the Party to the Pen Liyuan tonight after they have held bilateral negotiations.
"President X's visit provides the opportunity to extend cooperation between the United States and China in several common interests in global, regional and bilateral matters, and at the same time it gives President Obama and President X the opportunity to discuss structurally on issues with differences", was added.
The visitor who was published first in February, Xin is expected to be exempted in Seattle to meet several United States technological leaders before he continues to reach the New York City and the United Nations General Assembly.
Obaman and Xin are expected to discuss a number of Kyoto issues, including the concerns of Washington's inquiry of China's greenhouse network security and the increased land-related proposals in the Sud-China coastal waters.
Matt Damon reduces the diversity in the film
Matt Damon took together with Ephie Brown, a African filmer, in their center of the distinction that, according to Damon, did not need to be able to do so.
The exhibitor experienced in the Greenlight project on Sunday of HBO's Sunday, has stopped brewn in this emphasis on the needs of various views to the extraordinary maintenance of the chosen project.
"When we talk about the distinction, it will take into account the showers in the film, it is not a series," said Damon.
The shocked Brown reacted uncomfortablely, the comments "Ooh! Wah. OK," as the comments of the Martian shower left to the air.
Other producers Ben Afleck and Farrelly's brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss a series of finalities.
"I want to encourage people to think about any driver then is how they treat Harmony's personal fashion," he said at the beginning.
It's the only dark shoes that his white partner's kicked.
The Dear White People producer requires the right to control the film to the finalists Leo Angelos and Christian Brancaccio; Damon responded tightly that their guideline "this would end to give us something we don't want".
When the debate was sent, social media was expelled by the comments of Damon.
The Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his angry to the film entitlement by writing: "Matt Damon speaking about the only dark one of the rooms on and explaining the differences to him is NEW YOU.
After its publication, the television collected more than 5000 retwice and 4000 love.
The comments of Damon are part of the time in which a precise random presentation in the media is at the front of the social debate.
After the white police killed a teenager Michael Brown in 2014, The Black Lives Matter moved into a landwide and invited legislators and authorities to stop coloring people to discriminate practices.
In February, the songer Prince refers to the movement of the album candidates to the Grammy payment of the year.
"The albums still have a meaning," he said.
Like the writings and the blacks lives, the albums still have a meaning.
Black Lives Matter's leaders recently published an opinion to respond to the Fox News TV address to Elisabeth Hasselbeck's question whether the group should be a group of hate.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love," the leaders said.
It was often reported that Damon is together in the group of preachers, producers and media muggles, called by the pope’s visit to discuss the picture of the Catholic Church in the west.
It's doubtless if he accepted the call or already met the pope.
First American Ninja Warrior Master crossed
Professional players and athletes, Isaac Caldier, became the first sportor who wins the American Ninja Warrior, and was rewarded for a million dollars.
At the end of its seventh time, the competition programme has never been a competitor who would have found all the parts of the programme.
In the last series of two men, Caldiero and Camera Geoff Britten, survived to the last round.
The last mission was about 23 meters of poverty in 30 seconds.
The British kicked first and tried at the time of the challenge, which allowed him to become the first sportor of all times, which tried the four renewing part of the American Ninja Warrior. But Caldiero tried three seconds more faster than the challenges that had done by her winner.
Caldiero gave the discussion to E!News difficulty after the victory and was still shocked on the winning of a million dollars.
"There is this wonderful thinking when I have never known or lived as up to $10,000 in the year," said Isaac to E!! after his payment.
So I can't even imagine what this comes to... the inconsistence is unconscious.
The producer, Kent Weed, attended to discuss The Hollywood Reporter's final list and why Britain does not receive more money, even though he is the first competitor of all times that has been able to pass.
According to the rules, the money goes to the most fastest person.
"If more people get away, money gets the money that has the fastest time," Weed said.
Even though money is a great reward and change in life, he has a great feeling of satisfaction.
I don't think he feels beautiful because of that.
He's just so happy that he's done what he did.
His fans have overcome him.
He's a great guy, and I'm good for her family.
He's his son and his wife's hero.
Geoff said to me, "If someone had to win me, I am happy that it was Isaac."
And I think I would think Isaac would have been thinking like if this would have been on the other side.
American Ninja Warrior returns to the eighth period of which descriptions will be started in the summer 2016.
