How long are these events going on?
And all the nerves should be treated in this way, especially in your age.
and with the covenant.
and blood pressure and colesterol must also be checked.
And are you being calm now?
And do you feel this skin nucleus now?
And are you also breathing difficulties?
And can you tell other events you're natural with this age?
And how high you have reached?
And I'm also a stone.
And I was a little skin and stone.
And I feel the weight weight of today.
And this is the rhinitis summer.
and smell the smells
And I think it's a little smell.
And I want you to explain the place of your skin.
And they also smell.
and with your diabetes reway
And do you know, my smell feels like a sweetie?
And do you know, people always stone to my way?
And you're feeling nervous
And you're saying there's pressure on your face.
Whoever in the family has heart problems, heart disease, heart attack, colesterol high, high blood pressure
Is there any events or other problems that you look at together with the otot nerves?
Is there anybody who is ill like you at home with the same experience?
Do you feel another experience?
Did you ever feel awesome?
Are you still feeling nervous?
Because it's the summer.
But we can’t be able to overcome the cardiac nerves from the heart.
But the most important problem now is the nervous of this skin.
And I'm feeling hard to breathe
But I know many stones to my direction
But we need to handle each nerve with very seriously seriously.
But can you now breathe well?
I really forgot the cause of this skin.
Does it feel like somebody smells your pain?
It's still smelling as a breath
Do they suffer the same way?

Do you feel slightly breathing together with that experience?
Are you aware of what the experiences it deserves?
Do you see the image?
It's a lot of heat today.
But I run a diabetes test
But he has a little similar to me.
How high your hair?
How is your blood pressure?
If your smell continues
If you're a hundred or more
If you think you need a better examination
I'm smelling yesterday.
I'm also a little sweet.
I'm smelling yesterday.
I feel nervous here, on the shoe.
I was also breathing.
I'll send a picture to you
I'm feeling nervous today

You can drink tachipirina sweet.
Mary, how many days have you experienced this event?
You're saying you're feeling nervous.
Sometimes, I feel nervous.
All right, if there's another event with this event except the nerves.
Or is someone sit on your face?
Nearly similar to stones, stones, head pains, and otots
Right in the middle of my face.
Show on this picture where you feel sick.
'Cause you're calm
So do you think that some of these events may be related to pregnancy?
So your kids have the same way?
Tell me about your nerviness

Currently increased corenavirus disease (COVID-19) in the EU/Wilayah European Economic and English Raya, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The accumulative case of corenavirus disease (COVID-19) shows the same trend in the EU/European Economy and England that states that, although it is different from the country, COVID-19 pandemics are developed quite rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, the country, the hospital and the intensive medical units, it should be necessary to increase its capacity to implement COVID-19 patients who will need health care, especially intensive medical care.
On December 31, 2019, the pneumonia class was not known in Whan, the province of Hubei, Tsikong.
On 9 January 2020, the Centre for the Disease and Prevention of Theoking reports this disease agency is a new cornavir that is now called a syndrome of acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, diseases affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection called heartnavirus (COVID-19).
To this day, some 80 percent of COVID - 19 people have suffered bleeding diseases, infected with or without pneumonia, with the majority of these infections.
About 14 percent of the cases, COVID-19 develops to be a weighter disease and need a hospital care, while other 6% of the cases have a critical disease that need intensive medication.
Mortalities of patients in the hospital resulting from COVID-19 per cent.
In this study, we studied the internal COVID19 United Europe/Economic Wilayah Europe (EU/EEA) and England (UK) and compared it with internal trains in Hubei Province, Tskong.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK with the number of cases in Italy during 31 January-15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA and UK
After Chicago, COVID-19 suffered more long - term geographical preaching and dinamical COVID-19 in other worlds today follow the pandemic dynamics in Chicago.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declares COVID-19 as pandemic.
In Eurosurveillance 2020, published on 5 March, Spiter et al. reported the first Europeans with the case of COVID-19 confirmed on the basis of the WHO case.
In the EU/EEA, the first three cases were confirmed by France on 24 January 2020 to those returning from Whan, the province of Hubei, Tskong.
In March 15, 2020, the case COVID-19 has been identified throughout 30 EU/EEA and Ingris Raya (UK), between 31 December 2019 and 15 March 2020, including 39.768 cases and 1.727 deaths, with 17.750 cases and 1.441 deaths from Italy only.
Receive cumulative and cumulative digits of COVID-19 cases
In the Centre for the Prevention and Administration of European Diseases (ECDC), the number of cases of COVID-19 reported to each country worldwide has been updated every day at 8.00 p.m. This number is only available from official resources such as the State Health, national and regional health authorities, and WHO.
This data is used to evaluate COVID-19 trains in the EU/EEA and the UK, and compare it with trains in Italy.
As the prevalence of the COVID-19 active case, we have been counting the cumulative inside by 14 days, so as a number of COVID-19 natural journeys, in each EU/EEA and UK, in the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also paid the cumulative number of cases reported to each country until March 15, 2020, at 8.00 compared to the Italian case during the period 31 January-15 March 2020.
COVID19 in EU/EEA and UK
Currently the CVID19 case in the EU/EEA state and the UK follows the train in the province of Hubei (Tiokong) (Guarb 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK in full, the COVID-19 cumulatives began to increase around 21 February, and increased around 28 February 2020.
This train is mainly employed by the rapid increase of the cases reported from Italy, but all the other EU/EEA States and the UK shows that the same COVID-19 accumulation trends (Applause).
Image 2 shows the volume of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK compared to the volume of cumulative in Italy during the period 31 January–15 March 2020.
The data argued that, until 15 March, 15 EU/EEA and UK reported the total number of cases compared to the total number of Italy cases three weeks ago or less.
We have indicated that the number of cases of COVID-19, which are reported rapidly increased in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Trens that are predominantly in the COVID cumulative in the 19th century suggested that pandemics increase the speed compared to all countries.
This disappears from the stage of countries, social health responsibilities, and the possibility of the definition of cases between States and the different protocols to choose patients that should be tried to confirm COVID-19, including testing.
At the beginning of March 2020, physicians in the Italian region explaining the situation around 10% of COVID-19 patients need intensive treatment and media sources report that hospitals and intensive medical units in this region have reached maximum capacity.
Today, the data of COVID-19 case investigation in hospitals and/or intensive treatment units at the EU/UA level are only available for each 6% and 1% of cases (not displayed).
However, data should be collected in a systematic way to detect current survey data focused on the number of cases reported and the number of deaths.
The study carried out in 2010-2011 shows great variations in intensive bedrooms and medical care in Europe, starting from 29.2 in Germany to 4,2 per cent of the population in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 places of intensive care and health care for 100,000 people in 2010-2011).
The model scenario relates to health capabilities, with the prevalence estimation of the COVID-19 case for each EU/EEA countries and the UK related to risks >90% decreasing the intensive sleep capacity, was provided in six ECDC risk assessments on COVID-19.
As far as the case is classified in certain regions in the EU/EEA and the UK, and the hospital and the intensive medical units are usually serving the population of specific regional service, information on cases and where the intensive care is better available at the Wilayah University for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
Research from Italy and the current train in other countries shows that COVID-19 pandemics are very rapidly developed in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals, and intensive medical units should be prepared for the SARS-CoV-2 communal transmission scenario and increase the number of COVID-19 patients that need health care, especially intensive medicines, as happens in the random region of Italy.
As indicated in the rapid risk assessment of the ECDC recently, rapid, projective and comprehensive approach is very important to delay the SARS-CoV-2 service, with training from the approach to the mixed approach, because the increase of the rapid number of cases, as prevented, may not give enough time to the producers of decisions and hospitals to understand, accept, and adapt the correct answer if it is not applied before.
The rapid risk evaluation also focuss on social health steps to reduce pandemics.
There are opportunities for the country to enhance their control efforts to delay SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on health care.
If failed, the EU/EEA other health systems will be likely to face patients who need intensive care within a few days or weeks before.
The disease of the heartnavir 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the syndrome of the acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2), has been killed by more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in the Cyclope and other places in the world, which caused disasters to humans.
Like his homogenetic virus, SARS-CoV, which causes a thousands of people to SARS in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmised from the sleeves and causes a similar phenomenon through a similar mechanism.
Nevertheless, COVID-19 has lower risks and mortality than SARS, but more than young people, and more men than women.
As a response to a rapid increased number of publications about this new disease, this article tries to give the exact and comprehensive work on rapidly developed research subjects.
We're going to discuss the basics of epidemiology, ethiology, virology, diagnosis, medication, prognosis, and prevention of disease.
Although there are still many questions that haven’t been asked, we hope that this effort helps us understanding and preventing this threatening disease.
The Semi Museum Festival, on 25 January 2020, has become an event that has never occurred and was not forgotten to all the Tionghoa people who were commanded to stay at home during the release and a few weeks after it because of the new virus disease.
This virus is very homologized with the heartnavir (CV) which caused a deterioration symptom of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; so it was called SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the disease caused by CoV disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Whan, Tskong, and quickly spread to the whole country and almost 50 other countries around the world.
By 2 March 2020, this virus has affected 80,000 COVID-19 cases, with more than 40,000 patients being collected and 3,000 patients died in the world.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is "destruction of number 1" and potential deterioration is stronger than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.nbi.nlm.nnv.gov/pubmed/), at least two months since the first report on 7 January 2020, which determines the number of virus isolated from some patients, more than 200 have been published about COVID-19, including virology, epidemiology, ethicology, diagnosis, and medication.
This triumph is to include the progress of the research on the new subjects that are quickly developed.
Maybe we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other diseases caused by CoV, the syndrome of Eastern Foods (MERS, changing in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about prevention and prognosis of diseases and some other questions that aren’t complained, but urged.
Based on traditions, CoV is considered an unlegal pathogen for humans, especially 15 percent of the piles 4.
However, in this century, we have seen a very pathogenic CoV for humans two times, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each of us brings an initial wave in Chekong in 2003 and Saudi Arab in 2012, and soon distributed to many other countries with horrible morbidity and mortality.
This is why COVID-19 is now the third phenomenon of CoV in the recorded human history.
As shown in Gbr. 1.1, the pneumonia class was first not known from Whan on December 31, 2019 to the National Health Committee of the People of the Cyprus.
Seven days later, the CoV was launched.
On January 15, 2020, the first case of Whan was reported.
In the meantime, the epidemics were rapidly spread to towns, provinces and neighbors.
On January 20, the health infections were reported, which states that human transmissions may happen.
On January 23, a district carnaval was treated in the city of Whan, and the whole public was stopped.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on this disease reports that, from 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 patients are directly contacted with the Whaan sea food market, which are considered as the first place of the infected animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared that this vision is an emergency of global health.
During this report, this disease has been distributed to the whole Tskong and almost 50 other countries throughout the world.
Because the situation is quickly developed, the end and the illness of the wealth must still be set.
On 11 February 2020, a multiplay study at 8.866 patients, including 4.021 COVID-19 patients confirmed, provides more updated epidemic images (https://mp.visxin.qq.com/s/lBi-HX_rHPX1Qa2bddA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people at all age, but especially at the age of 30-65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of people older than 50 years old, only a few under 20 years old, and only 14 infections under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 more male infections (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 grows in class, especially inside and around Hubei.
COVID-19 spends at 5 (2-9) days from awitan to diagnosis.
Rate incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The time-time starts from the swift until the death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
Basic reproduction (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of infections increased exponentially before 23 January 2020, according to the massive transport time before the Semi Museum Festival in Cuba.
Mortality with cases confirmed by 1,44% (95% CI: 1,10-1,86%) and mortality is agreed to all patients at 3,06% (95% CI: 2,02-4,59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are the type of herald (pria), age (≥60 years) and weak pneumonia.
CoV is a large subfamily of a gathering virus that contains a single sense of RNA.
CoV can be shared as four genes, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with alpha and beta-beta known as human infections.
Thyroprotein or spy (S) collapsed with its cell receptor, enzyme of angiotensin 2 (ACE 2) and peptidel 4 (DPP4) each for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and the fusion is broken.
The virus genem RNA is released into the plasma site; after the replication of the virus, genome RNA is part of accumulated hycoprotein and nuclear protein forms virus contained vessels, which then experiences fusion with plasma burning to release virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genome was reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new cov-type beta with genetic symptoms more than 99.98% among the 10 samples that are collected; the sample was taken from the original location of the Huan sea market in Whan.
Geneticly, SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through transmissive elektron microscopes, SARS-CoV-2 parts were found in the very type of human breathing epitelium.
Human ACE2 was found as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, SRS-CoV-2 protein connected with human ACE2 than its link to SARS-CoV protein, which corresponds to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes an infection that is not separated by SARS-CoV infections in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form new descriptive protein that is based on orf3b and protein that is separated with orf8 passwords.
SARS-CoV-2 protein orf3b may play in the pathogenesis of virus and IFN expression inhibition; however, orf8 has no known functional or motivative domain.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al. reported the chryo-EM ACE2 structure to the human resolution 2.9 in complex with the transporter of amino asam B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which has an open and closed conformation, was obtained in the form of dimer and ACE2-B0AT1 complex can connect two S proteins, which are evidence for infection and coV infection.
B0AT1 can be performed with the appeal in the drug separation to test SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Original and interface
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known from the skin and each transmissed to humans through snakes and skins.
Through the SARS-CoV-2 philosogenetic comparison with other coVs, the melwar is considered as an original SARS-CoV-2 because this new virus is identical to two types of SARS-CoV-SARS from the skins called SL-COVX45 and SL-COVZX21.
However, there is still no knowledge of the intermediate phenomenon that helps to defeat the species to infect human infections, and transmise routes should still be explained.
Ji, et al., consider the snake as a snack of virus to humans that include homologs re combination in S - protein.
According to a study, research in Guangzhou, Tékong, suggested that the tensions, the mammalians are long-commercies used often in traditional Tionghoa drugs, have been potentially under the 99% genetic homology in CoV found in the county and SARS-CoV-2.
Nevertheless, 1% of the differences in the whole genome are still a large difference; therefore, the results of the concrete evidence are still not available (Gbr. 3).
SaRS-CoV-2 physics is not known.
In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can hold for 48 hours in a smooth environment and up to 5 days on 20 °C and 40% to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar qualities.
It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 sensitive to the ultraviolet sine and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; eter, etanol 75%, the infection containing chronics, chloroforms, and other mild chloroforms, but not clorhexidin, effectively enabled virus.
In general, the whole human population has no immunity against SARS-CoV-2, and that's why it's a reaction to this new virus.
Today, there is no primary study report on immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
That's why we can only refer to another CV research, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Gr. 4).
In general, after invasion, virus is known by the immune system through the pola-sensitive receptor (PRR), including C-type lectin-like receptor, Toll-like-receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
Through different paths, virus introduces inflammatory factors, dendric cell massure, and interferon type I (IFN) sinesis that limites the use of virus and accelerates antigen fagosite by macrofag.
However, N protein on SARS-CoV can help virus to avoid immune response.
Shortly later, adjustive immune responses join the fight against this virus.
T limfosis, which includes CD4+ and CD8+ cells, plays an important role in this defence.
CD4+ identical cell B to produce specific antibodies against virus, and CD8+ cell killed a virus infected cell directly.
T support cells produce pro-inflammatory sites to help protect cells.
Nevertheless, CoV can slow the T cell function by introducing the T - pharmaceutical cell.
Moral immunities, including comprehension, like C3a and C5a, and antibodies also important in combating virus infections.
For example, the antibodies is isolated from patients who have been healing MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the reaction of the immune system produces a large number of locally free roots, which can cause severe damages to the pull and other organs, and, in the worst scenario, the fall of major organs and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infections, which are based on widespread classs, are more about the lansia with abuse diseases and pregnant women.
In most cases, a person who is packed by virus in a large number of or whose immune functions are hindered to have higher infections than others.
The estimation of the SARS-CoV-2 rate rate is 1-14 days, most of the 3-7 days based on the first study of 425 cases in Whan.
However, a study of 1.099 cases shows that the rate incubation period is 3 days and starts from 0 to 24 days.
Newer study, as explained above, shows that the invasion period 4.8 (3.0-7.2) is based on demographic 8.866 cases.
In the meantime, health authorities adjust the effective karantine time based on the most accurate incursion period to prevent infected persons, but without injury, transmitting virus to others.
As a public practice, people who are switching virus or infected are usually required to be carnatine for 14 days.
Should the weather be long until 24 days?
In the last time, COVID-19 is mostly the main and early age of COVID-19, with or without any other events such as sweet rocks, nausea, slowness, head pain, rhinorea, dada, diare, nausea, and swallowing.
Some patients have been disappointed and/or hypothesis a week after illness.
In serious cases, the development of patient diseases rapidly continues to become a syndrome of acute breathing, sectic skin, metabolic acids, and coagulopathy.
Patients who have a heavy and/or an acute breathing and nervousness, although without pull disorder, should be affected to the virus for diagnosis.
Demographic study at the end of December 2019 shows that the rate of the skin is 98 per cent for the heat, 76 per cent for skin stones, 55 per cent for diameters, and 3 per cent for diare; 8 per cent of patients need ventilation support.
The same event was reported in two recent studies, which were studyed on family classs and classs that are caused to transmise from the asymptoms.
In addition, the demographic study in 2012 shows that MERS-CoV patients also experienced heavy (98%), sweet rock (47%), and (55%) were spnee as the main stage.
However, 80 per cent of patients need ventilation support, much more than COVID-19 patients and consistent with higher COVID latality.
Diare (26%) and smooth disease (21%) are also careful of MERS patients.
In SARS patients, heavy (99%-100%), heavy rock (29%-75%), wasspnee (40%-42%), diarea (20-25%), and skin disease (13-25%) was shown as the main loss and ventilation support required for about 14%-20% of patients.
By 14 February, COVID-19 mortality is 2% with the case confirmed by 66.576 throughout the world.
In addition, the SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% of 8.096 cases confirmed.
For MERS, based on demographic studies in June 2012, the mortality is 37% of 2.494 cases confirmed.
The previous study reports that R0 SARS-CoV-2 reached 6.47 with a trust interval (CI) 95% larger 5.71-7.23, while R0 SARS-CoV is only 2 to 4.
SARS-CoV-2 comparisons with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in events, mortality and R0 given on Table 1.
These figures show that SARS-CoV-2 has higher ability to disseminate than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but did not note MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Therefore, the challenge is to control SARS-CoV-2 pandemics greater than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pandemics.
Awitan is often seen in one family or one of the groups or vehicles like a bus.
Patients often have travellers or travellers in Whan or other shocked regions, or contact with infected persons or patients in the last two weeks before swimming.
However, it is reported that people can take virus without showing the events of more than two weeks and patients collected from the hospital can bring another virus, and that makes a career to increase the care time.
At the beginning, the patient has a number of peripheral white cells (such as limfosis) normal or reduced.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood rate < 4x109/L, which includes lymphosis < 1×109/L, and so many aminotransferase assets and a increased virus found in 1,099 patients of COVID-19.
Enzymes of heart and otot and myoglobin increase in blood in some patients, and C-reactive protein and final blood level increased in most patients.
In patients with weight cases, so much D-dimer increases, the product of fibrin switch that exists in blood, and the level of lymphosis decreased progressively.
The photos of the touch were found in the largest patients of COVID19 and are based on bilateral snakes or gloves opposites in the powder.
Patients are often experienced with atypical pneumonia, acute skin ceder, and syndrome of acute respiratory (ARDS).
When ARDS arrives, tax infrastructure, heating accumulation, and progressive fibrosis is a significant improvement in gas shopping.
Disfunction of pneumonites type I and type II decrease so much superficial and increased surface pressure so that the pulmonary ability to develop and increase the risk of pulse corps.
Thus, the worst findings of the toracs are often paralel with the worst degree of disease.
In February 18, 2020, COVID-19 pathology analysis shows that pneumonics, shocking hialin, and interstitutional lithosis infiltration, and synistic cells are many of the patients who died because of this disease, in accordance with virus infection and ARDS, and similarly with SARS and MERS patients’ s pathology.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 by reaction of transcriptic polymerase (RT-PCR) as the main criteria for COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, because the fair negative level, which can accelerate epidemic, the clinical manifestation began to be used for diagnosis (which is not only dependent on RT-PCR) in Chicago on 13 February 2020.
The situation is similar to the SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, combination between illness, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiologis discovery is very important and a need to make effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group explains the SERLOCK technical use protocol based on CRISPR to detect SARS-CoV-2, which identified the RNA SARS-CoV-2 synthetic fragments on 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 input microliters) uses the cell rat for less than one hour without needing a complicated instrument.
Fortunately, this new technology can increase the sensitivity and experience when checked on clinical samples.
Because of the lack of new experience with CoV, specially the doctor offers support to patients with COVID-19, while trying to several treatments that have been used or previously issued for other CoV treatments such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
This therapy includes therapy that presently exists and potential therapy with antivirus drugs, immunosprision, steroid, plasma of healthy patients, traditional Tionghoa drugs, and psychological support.
Even plasma from patients who have been healed to use in therapy.
Pharmacies develop antibodies and vaccines against this virus.
At the beginning, SARS-CoV-2 attacks the pull and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 at lower levels, such as gastrointestinal and gymnastic systems.
However, disfunctions and breastfeeding are the main threats for patients and death causes.
Therefore, the support of breathing is very important to reduce the situation and save life, which includes general oxygen therapy, high oxygen oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depends on the risk of disease.
Patients with heavy breathing should be supported by oxygen of extracorporeum (ECMO), or cardiopulmonary pine, which is used for heart failure or breathing that threatens the soul.
Furthermore, e-lying guards, prevention and sectic infection and vital organ protection are also important for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
Reactions of the more known immune system affected the swallowing of the website to the SARS and MERS patients.
Site sites are the forms of systematic inflammators which are defined as a number of website releases, including TNFAL, IL-1ś, IL-2, IL-6, IFNAL, IFNś, IFNī, and MCP-1.
The Sitokins introduce immune cells to release a large number of free roots that are the main causes of ARDS and the failure of the major organ.
Immunopression is very important in the struggle of the website, especially on a serious patient.
Corticosteroid and Tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL6 antibiotic antibodial anti-IL6, had been used to handle the site skin.
Other immuno-use pressures for sites include immune response modules which are established by T; IFN- Gamma, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; website signal 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroid, as an immune, used many in SARS to reduce inflatory damage.
However, steroids of high doses are not useful for a weightened pulmonary in the SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, steroid can affect weight effects, especially osteonecrosis, which are extremely affected by prognosis.
Nevertheless, short-dose corticosteroid gifts are encouraged to be given with care to a critical COVID-19 patients.
During this postwriting, there is no effective antivirus therapy that has confirmed.
However, in intravenous cases of remdecivir, the analogy of nucleotide, has been intrigued on a patient from the United States in COVID-19.
Remdecivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, first for diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg.
Later, remdecivir also shows inhibition against other unique RNA virus, including MERS and SARS virus.
Based on this, Gilead provides this slight for the Cuban to make a number of tests on the SARS-CoV-2 infections, and the results are very forgotten.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-alpha, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin has been recommended as potential therapy for patients with acute breathing experience.
Diare, nausea, insulin, heart disorder, and other side reactions may occur after combination with lopinavir/ ritonavir.
This therapy interaction with other drugs used by the patient must be shocked accurately.
plasma from patients who have been healthy and antibodies
There is a long history of the blood gathering of patients who have been healed from the disease to treat other patients who suffer the same disease or to prevent healthy people.
Indeed, patients who have been healthy have so many relatively high antibodies in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulin (Ig) covered by lymphosis B to combat pathogens and other foreign materials, recognising unique molecules on pathogen, and immediately generate them.
Based on this, plasma is collected from blood from a group of patients who have been healed from COVID-19 and were placed to 10 serious patients.
They improve in 24 hours, separated with reduced inflation and virus illness and increased oxygen in blood.
However, verification and clarification must be made to adjust this method to use a large scale before the specific therapy is developed.
Moreover, other than the approximative effects, some plasma infringements should be considered accurately.
For example, antibodies can have more immune responses and cause symptoms of release of sites, which are toxicity that threatens the soul.
The concentration of antibodies in blood is usually low and plasma needed in large numbers to care for critical patients.
Development and production of specific antibodies with sufficiently fast to combat global epidemics.
Therefore, more important and practically isolate cells B from patients who have been healed and identified genetic codes that produce effective antibodies or effective antibodies separation against the important protein for virus.
In this way, we can easily improve the level of antibodies production.
TCM has been used to treat several diseases in Tsikong for thousands of years.
However, most of the effects depend on combinations of various components in the form, which different forms depend on the diagnosis of diseases based on the TCM theory.
Most effective components are still not known or not clear because they are difficult to switch or verify the component or their optimal combination.
Now, since effective and specific therapy for COVID-19 is not available, TCM is one of the main alternative therapy for patients with heavy sperms, or for those who are cleaning from heavy disease.
For example, capsul Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen were directed for COVID-19 therapy.
The high level of increase in COVID-19 patients is predominantly associated with some of the provinces of Chekong, which uses 87% of its patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hungarian (50%), while the province of Hubei, which has only 30% of COVID-19 patients, has a high level of improvement (13%).
However, this comparison is still very important because many other factors, such as numbers and risks of patients, have to be identified in a evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and friends performed a study compared to western drugs (WM) only with WM and TCM therapy.
They found that the time necessary to restore the body temperature, the loss of the speed, and the swimming swimming slower in the WM+TCM group is compared to the only WM group.
What is more impressive, the level of sperms (from weighting) is far lower for the WM+TCM group compared to only WM groups (7.4%) and the lower mortality of the WM+TCM group is compared to the only WM group (8.8% compared to 39%).
Nevertheless, TCM’s efficiency and security are still waiting for testing that is better controlled at larger levels and in more research centres.
Another interesting thing is to decrease the working mechanism and clarify effective components in the TCM or combination therapy if possible.
Most of the patients who are expected or confirmed by COVID-19 feeled very fearful for a very devastating and even the death of this disease, and those who are cardiac also feeling angry, suspicious and wrath.
More, infections such as heavy, hypoxia, and stone, and effects of therapy, such as insomnia that caused corticosteroids can cause more anxiety and mental pressure.
During the early phase of SARS, several psychiatric morbidity, including depression, fear, panic attacks, psychomotors, psychopaths, deliriums, and even secularities have been reported.
Discussion of contacts and carаніnia, as part of the social health response to COVID-19, can make people more calm and feel guilty with the effects of abuse, karantina, and stigma about friendship and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided for patients who are expected to be COVID-19, and who are contacted with them, and the common community that they need.
Psycology support should include multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with routine and correction on SARS-CoV-2, and the therapy plans, and use of professional devices and applications to avoid contacts close to each other.
Effective vaccine is very important to report the transmission of animal and human reservoirs to genital heat and often spends on antivirus therapy in the control of epidemics caused by virus.
The efforts have been made to develop protein S-based vaccine, which long and effectively makes transborder antibodies and/or immunities protected against the SARS-CoV.
For SARS, living vaccines have been evaluated on the test animals.
Nevertheless, the effectiveness of this vaccine candidate on the lansium and the latal challenge models and its protection against the infection of zoonotic virus must still be determined before the clinical study begins.
This may be because SARS was 17 years ago and no new case was reported since that time.
Instead, the sporadis and the MERS class continues to happen in the Middle East and spread to other regions because there is still a zoonotic source in the end.
The vaccination strategy has been developed for MERS using a deactivated virus, DNA plasma, virus vector, nanoparticles, similar virus particules, and protein subunit and part of the test animals have been evaluated.
Vacuum development against SARS-CoV-2, which is safe and effective for non-immunitional people, is a very urgent task and important task to monitor the continued epidemic control.
However, this difficulty is not easy because a long time to develop vaccine (18 months rates) and a named CoV variation.
As a new disease, COVID-19 began to show its full clinical travel in thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient can be healed without any other cases.
However, in similar with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also related to high morbidity and mortality in patients with serious cases.
Therefore, prognosis models of disease are very important to the health care office, especially in the area with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies that have been reported so far, the following factors can affect or be related to the prognosis of COVID-19 patients:
Use: Use is the most important factor for SARS prognosis, which also occurs for COVID-19.
COVID-19 was mostly 30 to 65 years of age with 47.7% of the patients over 50 years in the study of 8.866 cases, as explained above.
Patients who need intensive care have adverse and complicated compounds and significantly older than older patients who do not need intensive care (mean 66 years older than 51 years) who are agely as prognostic factors for the end of COVID-19 patients.
The type of malnutrition: SARS-CoV-2 more infections for men than women (0.31/100,000 than 0.27/100,000), as explained above.
Compoundness and complexity: COVID-19 patients who need intensive treatment have more likely to experience acute heart disorders and arithmology.
The heart event also produces the main cause of death to SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also be reported to associate with a co-language with ACE2-positive, which can affect heart disfunctions to patients in COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and illness are very correlated and affected by one another.
Abnormal laboratory: C-reactive protein card (CRP) in blood reflects inflamation or network seed and is deleted as a factor of potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy, and restoration of therapy.
Coralization between CRP and the improvement and COVID-19 prognosis has also been deleted.
In addition, increased dehydrogenase lacquer (LDH), aminotransferase (AST), alanin aminotransferase (ALT), and kinase creatin (CK) can also help predict the final results.
These enzims are expressed very high in various organs, especially in the heart and heart, and are released during the disorder.
Therefore, these enzims are traditional prescriptions for disfunction of hearts and hearts.
Main clinical event: Photos of toracs and temporary clinical development should be considered together with other things to predict the final results and COVID complications.
Steroid use: As explained above, steroid is an immuno-privacy that is useful as therapy for infectious diseases to reduce inflammatory damage.
Since high doses used in SARS, many survived from this disease finally suffered by avascular osteoncrosis with disabled life - and bad quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroid should be used in low dose and short-time duration of COVID-19 patients.
Mental pressure: As explained above, during COVID-19, many patients are extremely stressed because they have to run a long - and uncertainty career and see the death of neighbors and their neighbors.
Psychological advice and long - term support should be given to help this patient removed from stress and return to normal life.
Based on demographic studies so far, COVID-19 seems to have different epidemic images with SARS.
In addition to the correction in the lower respiratory systems, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively be effectively at the supervisory levels and cause a slow or without a infectious shift, like other CoV that causes pillars.
Thus, at the beginning or incubation phase, infected patients can produce virus in large numbers during daily activity, which caused great difficulties to control epidemics.
However, SARS-CoV transmissions are trusted when the patient is serious and most of them did not happen at the beginning.
Thus, the COVID-19 change is now much worse and harder than the SARS.
Today, the great effort is being made in the tsunami, including the Whan regions and the cities around and the carnaval continued almost all the population with hope to send SARS-CoV-2 transmissions.
Although this action is extremely corrupted by the economic and other sectors in the country, the new number of patients are reduced, which indicates epidemic reductions.
The most optimistic estimates declare that the wave will end in March and the period of the decline of 3-4 months.
However, some other don’t have the same optimization.
Paul Hunter et al. estimates that COVID-19, which seems to be far more delayed than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al. makes a model for predicting the end of the epidemic and declare that SARS-CoV-2 can infect two thirds of the global population.
Canadian research group reports that SARS-CoV-2 was identified in mid-conca and healing patients who have been healed and returning from the hospital for 2 weeks ago. This indicates that re-identified virus can be re-episodes, like influenza.
However, the promising signs happen in Cuba, if it appears to be reduced by the new number of cases, which shows that the current strategy might be successful.
Ebola was predicted first will cause a million cases with half of death.
However, with the career and the slight isolation, this disease can finally be controlled.
Maybe, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 reduces its ability to infect and finally lost or become a virus is not too pathogenic that can meet humans.
Comparison with COVID-19 with SARS and MERS (Gr. 5).
SARS-CoV-2 is very easy transmitted through stones or skins, and may also also be through direct contact with virus contaminated materials.
This virus was also found in the fascination, so that it's likely to get new transmissions, the transmission of fess-supports.
Recent studies in 138 cases report that 41% of cases may be caused by noocomal infection, which includes 17 patients with other diseases previously and 40 health care.
Thus, specific prevention should be made to protect humans, especially health care, social workers, family members, workers, and even persons who are concerned with patients or infected persons.
The first defence line that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is through the use of the face mask, the weight mask and the N95 respiratory mask (nome series 1860) helps to control the virus care.
The lowest mask is to ensure that those who have potentially infected are not next to the air or to put it on the surface of the material, where they are discovered, they can be sent to others.
However, only N95 mask (1860-year series number) which can protect against inhalation of virus with a 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% virus can be completely enhanced; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in the size, both wide ranges around 85 nm.
Because particules can even betracked five mass that are one, health carecase directly connected to patients must use N95 (series number 1860) and not weight maskers.
In addition to mass, health care provides a slow isolation switch to reduce the contact with the virus.
Virus can also infection someone through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected SARS-CoV-2 even though he puts N95 mask; virus may be entered into her body through the sight.
Therefore, health care providers should also have to keep a swimming slipper or swallow when working with the patient.
For the public community in the area that is cut or shocked, it is very recommended that everyone clean the hands with more commonly infected pigs, try to stay in the home of swimming karantina, and avoid contact with those who have the potential to be infected.
The three legs are convinced to keep the path from the patient.
This is an effective method to reduce the risk of infection and prevent virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for human world, its high homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, must be a great warning for the Tacomotic, which has a strong impact on the SARS phenomenon in 2003.
However, on January 19, 2020, the Director of the Heavy Disease Center declared the people that this new virus has low preaching quality and reproduction capacity from humans to humans and prevention and defence of this disease is not a problem.
This report is very excited to the fear of the people, especially when the whole country is preparing the Semi Museum Festival, so that the critical time is to cover still small diseases in Whan.
The management of diseases in the Cyclopedia should take care of this and make a great cure in the future.
For example, this body should be more careful when making public statements because every word is observed by the people and can change their attitude and decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to information from clinical information than waiting for official report from doctors or officials; (3) more limited the use of epidemic potentials at the beginning, and is not trying to develop public training; and (4) more often extend targets and effective use of public standards on epidemic diseases and testing and increased social response systems periodically.
COVID-19 was caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus that began to shoot at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, the ships have been distributed to the whole Cyclopedia and more than 50 countries in the world at the time of this post.
Because this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 phenomenon gives the pressure of COVID-19 as the SARS renewed.
However, there are clear differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are very important to maintain epidemics and treatment of patients.
COVID-19 is more than young people and more about men than women, and death levels are also higher than young ones.
SARS mortality is higher than COVID-19 (10.91%).
COVID-19 patients transmise virus even when they are unexpected, while SARS patients generally transmise virus when they are sick. This makes more difficulty in maintaining the service of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains most of the reasons for SARS-CoV-2 to distribute more and more than the SARS-CoV.
Rutin RNA to check SARS-CoV-2 may give negative results in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, the healthy patient can give a positive return to the virus examination.
This finding increases the risk of the virus’s preaching.
With so fast progress in the COVID research, some important problems should still be addressed, that is:
Where is SARS-CoV-2 coming?
Although genetic homologs were found largely 96% between SARS-CoV-2 and two CoV-SARS like skins, we are still not able to find that SARS-CoV-2 is from the skin.
What kind of animals have to be in the interface to smile virus from the original snake, say sweetness, to humans?
Unless we know the answer numbers 1 and 2, we can't send transmissions effectively and changing can return every time.
Although molecular and biochimia moderation shows that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with ACE2, how is the virus exactly entering into the breast cells and affecting the next pathology changes?
Is this virus also connected to cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we can't reach a fast and correct diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic go?
How is the virus genetically developed during transmission between humans?
Will this pandemic become the pandemic of the whole world, ending like SARS, or renewing periodically like flu?
The answer to the above questions and many other statements is important, but it may require time to find it.
However, no matter how much it is, we do not have any other choice except to stop the epidemic soon as possible to return to normal life.
Sonototic virus in human heart
In thousands of years, mutations and adjustment have developed co-evolutions of the heart viral (coV) and its spices, including humans.
Before 2003, two human coVs (HCOV) are known as slightly illnesses, such as slightly.
The syndrome of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the syndrome of Eastern Atmosphere (MERS) reverse the situation and explains how HCOV infected and threatened the soul.
The SARS-CoV-2 culmination in the centre in the end of 2019 has made CoV back sorotan and surprised us with higher transmissions, but with lower pathogensity than his brother, SARS-CoV.
HCOV infection is a zoonosis, so the understanding of the origin of HCOV will benefit from us.
Most HCOV originates from the heavy, and in this animal, virus is not pathogenic.
A number of HCOV reserves have also been known.
The identification of animals has direct implied in preventing human diseases.
Research of coV interactions on animals can also provide an important monitoring of CoV pathogenesis to humans.
In this work, we shared the public image of the current knowledge of the seven HCOV, focusing on the history of its discovery, and the origin of his zoonotics and the transmission of the antarses.
The important thing, we compare and reverse the HCOV from the evolution and re combination of genome.
CV 2019 (COVID-19) is now circulated in this context.
Furthermore, the slight training requirements and the impact of virus evolutions on diseases are also disordered.
Coronaviridae virus (CoV) originates from the family Coronaviridae, consisting of a group of RNA’s swimming, positive insulin, and unique.
This virus has the largest genome with a size of 26 to 32 kg base between the RNA virus called "CoV", because its morphology is like a stomach under the electronic microscope.
Based on its structure, CoV has an insigned genome that has similar paintings.
About two thirds of the genome consists of two largely open (ORF1a and ORF1b) which are switched. The two are translated into polyprotein pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyprotein has more crews to form 16 non-structural protein, called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome consists of the openly read (ORF) for structural protein, including tontons or spécimens (S), rolled or developed (E), brushed (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
The number of specific specimens of specific captive proteins for certain birth lines are also carried out by various generations of coV lines.
Based on the differences in protein, CoV was classified as four genes (alfa-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV); between the four genes, the genes of coV have the most largest HCOV and are further shared into four descendants lines (A, B, C, D and D).
philogenetic books show that the skin and the manufacturing animals are a major source of gene alfa-CoV and cota-beta-CoV, while the ungarns are the main CoV gamma and delta-CoV reserve.
Thousands of years, CoV continued to cross the species and some coVs have become a major pathogen for humans.
Until now, there are seven human coVs (HCOV) known.
Among the seventh virus, HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL63 are alfa-coV.
Other five beta-CoV includes HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, acute cardiac heart virus (SARS-CoV), Eastern Atmosphere syndrome virus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, and HCOV-NL63 are generally caused a bleeding skin, such as pills and/or diameters.
Instead, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are extremely pathogenic, resulting in infections under weighter weight infections to relatively more patients and have higher opportunities to develop a syndrome of acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and manifestation in the outside of the powder organ.
Strain HCOV-229E first, B814, was isolated from the age of patients in the middle of the 1960s.
Since then, more knowledge was gathered through a deep study against HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, which both causes own guests.
Even this concept has been widely accepted that HCOV infections are generally not dangerous until the SARS is happening.
The SARS event in 2003 was one of the most devastated phenomenon in the current history, which infected more than 8.000 people with the number of deaths of about 10 percent.
Decades later, the syndrome of Middle East breathing (MERS) stripped the epidemics continued in the Arab Semenage with sporadic preaching to various other worlds.
HCOV new 2019 (2019-nCOV), which is called SARS-COV-2, is an epidemic agent of 2019 heart disease (COVID-19), which has decreased life over 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 to 3 March 2020.
The alarm is hidden and the world must prepare himself for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic that will come.
The seven HCOVs all have a synthetic origin of the skin, the tissue, or the conservation animals.
Many evidence supports the original evolution of all HCOVs from the helmets, and in the wolf, CoV is accrued with good and non-patogenic, but shows great genetic angry.
COVID-19 epidemics have resulted in medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for Tacomo and the whole world.
The philosophy of HCOV showed a number of work to understand the scope of natural, skill, and deployment factors have been moved to the species.
This study can also lead or make the search for reserve animals, navigation, and applications of SARS - COV-2, which have an important impact in the preceding preaching time.
In this deal, we gave a general image of zoonotics, antarsperies transmissions, and HCOV pathogenesis.
We are specially encouraging and discussing the general subject that HCOV induced virus is usually non pathogenic in its natural reserve, but become pathogenic after transmissioning antarses to the new ship.
We also investigate the HCOV evolution that transmission capacity is often separated by the decrease of pathogenicity.
The end of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also distributed in this context.
The animal coV has been known since the end of the 1930s.
Before the HCOV-229E strain B814 first of the sequenced patients’ gymnasium, various coVs have been isolated from various infected animals, including skins, skins, dogs, skins and dogs.
In some last warnings, seven HCOV have been identified.
A short history of HCOV in chronological orders (Table 1) is an information instruction.
Strain HCOV-229E was the first is isolated from the patient’s napkin infections over the year 1966, which was then adjusted to be established in the WI -38 pull line.
Patient infection HCOV-229E shows selesma skin, which includes heads, skins, leans, and shooting pains, with smells and stones that appear to be 10 to 20 percent of the case.
Next in 1967, HCOV-OC43 was isolated from the culture of organs and serum routes in the brain that is still shocked.
HCOV-OC43 clinic infection description seems to be similar to the infection caused by HCOV-229E, which symptomatically cannot be differentiated with other respiratory infections such as influenza virus A and rhinovirus.
HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 are distributed to all the world and the most transmissed cloud during the winter in the climate area.
Of course, the time of invasion of these two viruss is less than one week and is followed by the illness period for about 2 weeks.
Based on a voluntary study of humans, healthy ones who have been infectioned with HCOV-229E have experienced a quickness.
Only a few patients with a heavy body reverse system that shows the infection of the weight of breath.
SARS, who is also known as "pneumonia atipis", is a pandemic resulting from the first HCOV that is well documented in human history and his ethiological agency is SARS-CoV, which is the third HCOV found.
The first SARS case can be able to return to the end of 2002 in the province of Guangdong, Tsikong.
The SARS epidemic has been reported about 8.096 cases with 774 deaths, which are distributed in many countries and earthquakes.
Without the superbs, each case may cause some two secondary cases, with the incubation of 4 to 7 days and the top of the virus illness appears in the day 10.
Patients who have been infected by SARS-CoV have initially experienced mialgia, head pain, heavy, league, and smell, which are followed by disfunction, stone, and breathing as a further level shock.
Limfopenia, unnormal heart function test, and creativity increases in kinase is a lack of laboratory in SARS.
Infringement of alveolar difusion, epitel proliferation, and makrofag increases are also associated with SARS patients.
Next, about 20-30% of patients need intensive treatment and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to lower breathing, some organs including gastrointestinal, heart, and gins can also be infected in deep cases, usually with a web skin, which can be deleted, especially with the weakness of patients.
The first time the virus was isolated from the powder biopsis opened by the number of patients who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, great efforts are made for HCOV research.
HCOV-NL63 was isolated from the child of 7 months from the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
This virus was initially slowly affected by small children, lansians, and patients with weak breathing diseases.
Correction, concomitivitis, heavy, and lazy bronquiolitis are seen in diseases caused by HCOV-NL63.
Another independent study explains the same virus isolation from the age of eight months that suffer pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it is identified in the Netherlands, this virus is actually distributed throughout the world.
It was estimated that HCOV-NL63 represented around 4,7% of the public breathing diseases and the height of the event was in the early summer, summer, and winter.
HCOV-NL63 was associated with obstructive ringites, also called crup.
In the same year, HCOV - HKU1 was isolated from a 71 - year - old man who had been careful for skin and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
Besides pneumonia and communal bronquiolitis, HCOV-HKU1 was reported with regard to the exacerbation of the acute asylum.
Like HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E, and HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 was found throughout the world, causes raw nutrition diseases.
Four HCOV communities have all been matched with humans and generally have small probability to change to a very pathogeneous disease. However, the overall case is happening because there is no known reasons, such as in the subtype HCOV-NL63 more viral cases recently reported causes the infection of skin skin infections in the tsunami.
Of course, when you get the ability to move effectively and keep yourself in humans, virulency and the pathogeneity of HCOV, it also decreased.
MERS-CoV was the first time isolated in 2012 from the 60-year-old patient powder who suffered acute and fever in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the cases confirmed the laboratory come from the Middle East, the impor case has been reported in various European and Tunisia countries.
Other actors have occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 cases confirmed.
MERS clinical manipulation is similar to the SARS clinical manifestation, which is circumcised with progressive acute pneumonia.
Not like SARS, many MERS also experienced acute injuries, which only happens in MERS in the diseases caused by HCOV.
More than 30 percent of patients show the gastrointestinal disorders, such as diarree and disorder.
By 14 February 2020, more than 2500 cases confirmed the laboratory reported with high case death, 34.4%, making MERS-CoV as one of the most fearful viruses known by humans.
In the middle until the end of December 2019, pneumonia classists who were retrospectively related to SARS-CoV-2 infections found in Whan, the province of Hubei, Tsikong.
World Health Organization (WHO) states that the infection of low-scale infections is due to and caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a global health emergency and called the COVID-19 disease.
By 3 March 2020, 90.053 cases have been confirmed throughout the world, with the number of deaths of 3,4 per cent.
It should be recorded, that death in Hubei, Tsikong, was 4,2 per cent, while death outside Hubei is over 1,2 per cent.
SARS-CoV-2 causes heavy respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with heat, stone, and breast.
Diare is also visited by some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most weakest phenomenon, and it can develop rapidly as a syndrome of acute breath.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar because of high nucleotide urges, 82 percent, both slowed into different philosogenic trees.
SARS-CoV-2 pathogonisity clearly lower, but more than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects have been reported and may be a rapid role in the SARS-CoV-2 preaching work worldwide.
Compare and distinguish SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCOVs shows a very interesting difference and difference.
First, incubation and travel periods of HCOV are very similar.
In this way, SARS-CoV-2 follows the public train six other HCOV.
Second, COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and four other HCOV communities (name HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, and HCOV-NL63).
On the one side, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows the more commonly appeared image on HCoV Communities infections, which includes unspecific or even unspecific.
On the other hand, a small majority of the COVID-19 cases may seem like SARS-CoV infections even with a little lower ration.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission also shows an interesting pattern characteristics, with chemicals with the community and SARS-CoV.
On the one side, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission capacity is at least the same higher than the community HCOV.
On the other hand, there is no ability to transmission SARS-CoV-2 after some paths to humans still need to be checked, as SARS-CoV and MERS-CV cases.
Lastly, like other HCOV, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from a fees sample.
"If SARS-CoV-2 transmission is an important role, such as in the SARS-CoV transmission case, at least in some situations, that should still be explained by the next study."
What is also very important to be known is whether SARS-CoV-2 has summers like in the community case.
How, SARS-CoV-2 images, including transmise, pathogensity, and preaching on a few ways on humans, will be very influenced by the end of COVID-19.
Four HCOV communities that caused swimming phenomenon all have been in line with humans.
It looks like the other circle of the circle, it can say humans have been resolved with this four HCOV.
In other words, good HCOV and humans may be a spectrum of HCOV pandemics.
HCOV that causes weighty diseases in humans and humans who have suffered heavy HCOV diseases has been decreased.
In order to do this, HCOV needs to be adjusted in humans in the numbers that have to be able to start accumulation of adjustive use changes against wealth factors.
Thus, more long-term SARS-CoV-2 infected people, increased the probability of this virus is full of humans.
If the virus is good, the transmission to humans will be difficult to stop carantia or other infections.
For many years, four communities are divided into human populations and slowed up to people who are immuno-competenced.
This virus doesn't need a animal reserve.
Instead, the SARS-CoV and the very pathogenic MERS-CoV aren't incomplied with humans and their transmissions in humans could not be maintained.
Both of them need to maintain themselves and pay back in the zoonotic reserve and seek the opportunity to distribute to an outstanding human target, likely through one or a few intermediaries and applications.
SARS-CoV-2 has a similar image with SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four Communities.
SARS-CoV-2 is very easy to be transmitted like HCOV communities, at least now.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more pathogenic than HCOV communities and non-Sesatogenic SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
We need to see if SARS-CoV-2 will be fully able to be fully able to have humans and move into humans without reserve animals or interferences.
Before talking about HCOV animals, we need to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reserve, intermediate, and HCOV applications.
Animal acts as a HCOV evolutionary if there is a neighborhood and sharing high homologs at least a nuclear level.
The generator’s virus is normally aware of good and nonpatogenic.
Similarly, the restaurants have HCOV continued and in a long - time snake.
In two cases, infections are naturally infected and are natural barriers for HCOV or induced viruses.
Instead, if HCOV newly enters the quarters precisely before or around the time of the virus enters into humans, virus does not be accompanied with new and often pathogenic.
These intermediaries can function as a source of human infectious zoonotics and play a role in the application by allowing a virus to correct temporaryly, and then transmit it to humans to implement the scale of human infection.
HCOV can experience infections if it is impossible to maintain its transmission in the interface.
Instead, HCOV can also be accompanied by intermediate ships and even causes long - deficiencies.
In this regard, the wars became a natural reserve.
Epidemiological data declared retrospectively that the SARS case has a contact contact with pesticide animals.
The next seroprevalency survey indicates that the sales of animals have higher IgG anti-SARS-CoV prevalence than the public population.
The month (Larvata Paguma) and the animal dogs on the lives market are the first time identified with the SARS-CoV virus that almost identical with SARS-CoV.
This is not directly supported by the fact that no more SARS cases were reported since all the markets were killed.
Indeed, it is reported that the monthly breakfast of the wild or plant that is not paid to the market of the animals, most of them gives negative tests to SARS-CoV. This states that the month period may only act as an inter-application resource, but not a resorption of SARS-CoV naturals.
It should be noted that 80% of the animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies couldn't be observed that many small mammal species may also function as an anti-SARS-CoV application barriers.
All of these pieces seem to be the end of the SARS-CoV.
Search of natural animals for SARS-CoV is the next explanation of the closely closed CoV coV, called Rhinolopus the Rhinolopus family-SARS HK3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in the slope of the tsunami horse.
This was a positive test for anti-SARS-CoV anti-CoV and a few SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3-genics.
This coV and the other cows cows are shared with nuclear homologs 88-92% with SARS-CoV.
This study is a basis for a new concept that the bleeding is a shock for a new human pathogene appearing.
Some CoVs like SARS (SL-CoV) are also identified from the helmets, but only one, named WIV1, can be isolated as a life virus.
The enzim of angiotensin 2 (ACE2) change is known as SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1, which originates from the warm fascinating sample, appears to use ACE2 blowings, blowings, and humans as a receptor to enter into cells.
Interesting things, as SARS convalencies can deal with WIV1.
Together, WIV1 represents the most closest stakeholders with SARS-CoV in the sleeves, with a total of 95% of nuclear homology.
Without its height of Homology between these two viruss, generally believe that WIV1 is not a virus induced directly by SARS-CoV and the skin is not a reserve reserve reserve.
philogenetic analysis slows MERS-CoV into the same group with coV-HU4 sleeves and coV-HU5.
CoV-HKU4 cows and MERS-CoV use the same rain receptor, which is swepted by peptidase 4 (DPP4) as the income of the virus.
The polymerase RNA depends on MERS-CoV by philosogenetics closer to its sight in the cove-cove beaches identified in Europe and Africa.
Even now, there are no MERS lives found in the wild snakes.
MERS-CoV and its closest neighborhood CoV-HU25 are only shared in 87% of the nucleotide.
That's why the wheel may not be a reserve of MERS-CoVs.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East show that Arab birds have produced a seriesable result for specific antibodies that have deleted MERS-COVs, as well as the source of the Middle East in some African countries.
MERS-CV lives identical with the virus found in humans is isolated from the use of the origin of the Arab birds, and it indicates further that the skin is the real reserve part of the MERS-COV.
It is also important to note that the total massive virus with the phenomenon that is generally sensitive to the tests that were infected with MERS-CoV.
It must be recorded, that infection infected virus is not only through breathing routes but also through fecal-orient routes, which is also the main part of the virus of the skin.
Nevertheless, the question is still not answered because many MERS cases confirmed have no contact with an unrecognised fertility before the age, the probability of human transmissions or transmission routes are known that includes unrecognised animal species bringing MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nuclear homology with the RaTG13 slightly isolated from the facial Rhinolophus ring.
Like the SARS-CoV case and MERS-CoV, the difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to establish a relationship.
Another word, it may not be a reserve of SARS-CoV-2, except if the cowl-cover is almost identically found in the afternoon.
The SARS-CoV-2 animals may have been sold and killed in the Grosir Sea Sea Mark. Many cases starting in COVID-19 related to this market, which indicates that there may be transmissions of human animals.
Some recent studies based on meteorological sequences show that a small small group that is threatened by swimming mammals, known as a javanica, may also bring cows that are related to SARS-CoV-2.
The new CoV trend gene shared by 85-92% of nucleotides with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the coV is close to the RaTG13 with a higher 90 percent of the nucleotide level.
Both are grouped into two subgaris of SARS-CoV-2 viruses in philosogenetic trees, one of the receptor bond domains (RBD) more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with a number of amino accumulations of 97.4%.
What is counting, RBD SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is more different, although the level of homologic levels is at least higher than the whole genome.
The previous study on ill-training also reports the detection of viral constitution from the powder sample, which is also related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study applies to different currency methods and manual cuttings to produce part-sized genems consisting of around 86.3% opened virus genome.
We can't focus the probability of trending as one of the SARS-CoV-2 animals.
However, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 supports directly from the trend because the difference between SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-2-coV family beta-CoV-2.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 was closer than the direction between SARS-CoV-2 and the sight-CoV-CoV-2.
The SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary path is still to be set.
Although the highest homologs in RBD were found between SARS-CoV-2 and the co-coV family-SARS-CoV-2 trends, SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 shared the highest homologs in the entire genome level.
It is still special if it is said that its high level of chemical levels between RBD beta-CoV family-SARS-CoV-2 trends and SARS-CoV-2 are employed by the mediated convergent evolutions.
Hypothesis supports recombination between beta-SARS-CoV-2 trends and RaTG13 in third-seven animal species.
As an evolution worker, many recombination happens between CoV betes.
The researchers cannot still decide on the origin of SARS-CoV-2.
Besides the very pathogenic HCOV, originates from HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63, and HCOV-HKU1 have also been identified.
philosogenetic books indicate that HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-229E may originate from the celelawar coV, while HCOV-OC43 and HCOV-HU1 in the animals were found.
It was reported that the cov. celelawar named ARCOV.2 (Apocalypse Ridge CoV), identified in the three colors of the North America, shows violence near HCOV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E geneticly related to other helmets, named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was identified in Ghana, with Camelidae, is also the interface.
In order to clearer, the present knowledge of the HCOV animals known in the picture 1 and Table 2.
philosogenetic analysis has shown evidence of HCOV transmissions in history.
In 1890, when HCOV-OC43 slows species of heavy animals to infect humans, there are pandemics of breathing infections.
The history of HCoV-229E antarsperies is not too clear.
The alpha-CoV-coV of the HCOV-229E has been found.
Among them, there are alfa-coV alpha.
Some evidence support the transmission of virus directly from the skin to humans.
First, humans, not alphabets, which may be contacted with skins in ecological rings together.
Instead, humans have a warm contact with an alphabet.
Secondly, HCOV-229E is a variety of and non-patogenic alpha-coVs in the helmets, while co-coV alpha causes infected animal breathing disease.
Lastly, the alpha-coV alpha was not found in the feral animal.
That's why it's likely to get HCOV-229E's family alpha-HCOV can't be touched.
In fact, the skin is a source directly for human pathogenic virus, including rabbia, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not too surprising that the skin may immediately transmit HCOV-229E to humans.
Another possibility, while the alpha-coV was functioning as HCOV-229E gen long, the alpha and the Arab birds may function as an intermediate bar that transmitted virus to humans, almost like MERS-CoV cases.
MERS-CoV is a very good example of transmission of antarses from the skin to the Arabs and the Arabs to humans.
The original MERS-CoV evolutionary from the skin is known at the start of the virus and also strengthened by finding it later.
Clearly, helawar is a wide variety of virus species that is rich to combat antarspesia genetic fragments and transmissions of antarspesia.
A long-term colony, a strong social interaction, and a strong flight ability, is all the conditions that support for the drought to become an ideal virus provision.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has entered the Arab bird for decades.
This virus has been adapted to a stable and natural reserve of junctions that have changed from the bridges of the outside of the world.
MERS-CoV causes very slow diseases and maintains relatively low changes in this animal.
His sharp transmissions to humans happen, and humans remain to be the end of the MERS-CV because their transmissions can't continue.
Not like a role in MERS-CoV transmissions, where there is, in different SARS-CoV-2 transmissions.
In particular, the co-coV trends are extremely pathogenic in trends.
Steggling may be the end of the SARS-CoV-CoV-coV-cove beasts, similar to a shut in the SARS-CoV case.
In the opposite studies, some possibilities transmission of SARS-CoV-2 antarses from animal to humans must be calculated or accompanied.
First, the skin may only be a reserve reserve for the SARS-CoV-2 association virus that is almost identical with SARS-CoV-2.
Many can share ecological rings with sweats by purchasing or swimming stones.
Secondly, the trend could only be one of the intermediate applications for the new SARS-CoV-2 association virus.
Humans get viruses through the abuse and the consumption of the flesh.
Perhaps, many mammals, including animals of conservation, retail against SARS-CoV-2.
An antibodies survey against wild animals and animals must be carried out.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adjustment of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in the third species that are well connected with skins or trends.
Search of the SARS-CoV-2 animals still continued.
Within the various kinds of animals, three main factors of the virus’s side are also important to produce coVs to cross the species.
First, the relatively higher change in the RNA replication.
Compared to the single RNA virus, CoV changes can be considered as "speak" to "level" with a high rate low rate rate shift ~10-4 per year per event, depending on the adaptation of CoV to the new heat.
CoV has an exhibition exorbonclease, which affects very high, atenuation, or even invisible mutability.
Interesting things, similar nucleotide Remdesivir was known by replication of CoV through this exorbition inhibition and polymerase RNA dependent on RNA.
Remdesivir is one of the most promised anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that will be tested in clinical trials.
Nevertheless, the path of CoV is around a hundred times higher than its snakes.
Moreover, changes often have been higher when CoV has not been shocked.
Rather than SARS-CoVs that have higher variation, the SARS-CoV-2 change is actually lower, set up a higher adjustment level with humans.
Probably SARS-CoV-2 has been resolved with other charms that are close to humans.
Besides SARS-CoV-2, this also happens to MERS-CoV, which has been engaged in Arab birds.
In theory, small probability that genetic inhibition quickly makes vaccine and antivirus agents against SARS-CoV-2 inefficacy.
Secondly, the big RNA genome in CoV gives extra flexibility in genome modulation, to change and re combination, so that increases the probability of antarspesia co-evolution, which makes it possible to appear new CoV when appropriate conditions.
This is supported by many single reads and protein functions that are sent to the direction of the 3-th genome area.
Third, the template switching switch is slow during the replication of the RNA through the unique "select-salin" mechanism.
In a ship that functions as a shocking face, heavy training occurred during the transcrision of RNA CoV.
RNA opening and subgenomic, very homological, can experience recombination to form a new coV.
Natural re combination of philosogenetic books have been found on HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, as well as in animal coVs such as SL-COVs and coV-HU9 wheat.
Virus interactions in its skin with transmission.
Moreover, three virus factors mentioned above, the interaction with the heat receptor is another main factor that affects antarspesia transmission.
Here, SARS-CoV recombination is considered a special example, which also shows evidence of positive cells during the transmission of antarspesia.
Based on a comparative analysis between the SARS-CoV is a human-coV island, SARS-CoV was expected to have a rapid adjustment in various areas, especially with mutations to SBD protein.
The RBD Protein S CoV interacts with cell receptors and intensely become the target of the antibodies response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD was a amino axis to 318 to 510 in the S1 fragment, which is connected to ACE2 humans and its corecectors as an income of the virus.
RBD SARS-CoV has the ability to recognise ACE2 receptors of various animals, including skin, tissue, tissue, and raw dogs, to enable antarspesia virus transmission.
In fact, only 6 amino assum residues that have been different between human virus isolants and cylinders in RBD and 4 are located on the motive of receptor association to interact with ACE2 receptors.
SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which may improve the definition of tonic protein interaction with human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, two substitutions of this amino assom may be very important to adapt virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor with SARS-CoV.
The major 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein S unit implies the number of protein S with ACE2 human potentially changed.
Even a crio-EM study shows the numbers of human ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2-10-10 higher than the numbers between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV protein.
What is also important to be known is whether there is another corecector that might be needed for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCOV-NL63 is also connected to ACE2, but with different parts of S.
There are many other HCOV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCOV-229E and 9-O-therapy accumulation for HCOV-OC43.
These receptors may also play the role of this coV adjustment in humans after transmission of antarses from its animals.
Besides the cell receptor, the final results of HCOV antarsperies are also established by the dependence factors and other weapons.
These proteins between humans and natural reserves, such as bleeding, snakes, snakes, and brake animals, can be a failure to transmission antarspesia.
HCOV should take care of the dependence factors and blend the weakening factors to successfully be transmitted in antarspesis transmission.
In this way, molecular specimens in the important virus interactions should still be identified and disappeared.
The whole genome study is unbelievable to see the dependence factors and the deficiency of SARS-CoV-2 uses improved CRISPR technology.
New HCOV changing: return to the start of the box
The sharp coV has a great opportunity to appear to be a new HCOV.
In this case, the cowl-coV functions as HCOV longs.
Furthermore, rapid and genetic re combination has also enhanced HCOV evolution and functions as two important steps in this process.
For instance, a smooth or loss of new protein genes have a potential to modify phenotipe virus drastically.
Among the SARS-CoV accession protein, ORF8 was a major role in adapting humans because the virus of the SARS-CoV family-coV, which was dissolved, was found in many ORF8 proteins.
SARS-CoV, with the circles of 29 nucleotide removal, has been found on a strain that was isolated at the beginning of human epidemics.
This removal divides ORF8 as ORF8a and ORF8b and is expected to be a adaptive change that supports swimming training.
Furthermore, SARS-CoV may have a reconnection history with the alpha-coV lines of the alpha and coV gamma, with a larger number of smaller re combination areas identified in polymerase RNA dependent on the RNA.
Recombination location is also identified in nsp9, most of the nsp10, and part of nsp14.
Similarly, the re-combination between several generations lines was shown on the MERS-CoV epidemies, which occurred in the Arabs in Saudi Arabs.
Besides SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, re combination events have also been identified on HCOV other places where HCOV has suffered re combination with other animals in their non-structural genes.
It should also be observed that the combination of bovine cells can play a role in unregarded changes in viral genome, and it is likely to be restricted by the liberation of virus from the secular pressure, such as the marine immune system.
This effect is the loss of ORF4 on the HCOV-229E strain prototype resulting in the elimination of two nuclears.
While ORF4 can be died on the blonde virus with HCOV-229E, co-co-alpha-coV shows the unique nucleotide side that affects the number of gears.
Lastly, new HCOV evolutions are also employed by sell pressures in the reserve.
Increased or unspecificed during the coV infected chain, which shows an adjustment between CoV and the cowboys.
It seems to be anatomically and physics.
For instance, the infringement of the prophecy response to the skin would reduce the pathology that CoV has been effectively exposed.
Furthermore, the activity of natural killing cells in the helmets was identified because the control of NKG2/CD94 natural mortal receptor cells and the level of the highlight of the higher heto-compatibility of the primary class I.
Furthermore, so many reactive oxygen species (ROS) high from high heavy metabolic activity can cause coV replication and influence the control of exorbonease so that the pressure of cellular pressures is to generate very pathogenic strain of virus when entering into the new oceans.
The more pathogenic strain CoV can also develop through re combination, which affects protein or new protein plants to adapt the sea.
That's why, not an adjustment that three HCOV newly appeared in two last warnings.
CoV is not patogenic or causes a smoke in its reserves, such as skin and skin.
CoV has strongly controlled without taking a strong frozen reaction.
Here, there is a secret shuttle, and there is a serious cause of human infection.
The worst event is especially because the adjustment of more immune responses and the weakness of the site, with a weighter deterioration if the immune response increases.
On the contrary, the immune responses have been removed from the coV replication.
The same strategy to decide immune responsibilities may benefit from anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The answers of the interferon are particularly strong on the skin.
That's why, interferon type I, at least at the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 infection on humans, should benefit.
In addition, NLRP3 attractions are defective.
For this reason, NLRP3 inhibition with MCC950 may benefit from COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 was followed by the public system of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While the cota-coVs shared by 95% nuclear homology with SARS-CoV have been found, there are also 96% nuclear homology shared with SARS-CoV-2.
Although the shoes and other animals on the market were found to have an identical virus with SARS-CoV, the intermediate snake for SARS-CoV-2 was not found.
Beta-CoV trends that have been very homologed with SARS-CoV-2 have found, which shows that trends may play as one of the intermediate or co-coV trends may give gene fragment contributions to the final version of SARS-COV-2.
Although it's still questioned, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was made by humans in a good way or unexpectedly.
CoV returns to the attention centre because the SARS-CoV-2 waves recently.
CoV study in the skin and other animals have changed greatly our perception about the importance of the synthotical origin and animal reserve for HCOV to human transmissions.
Many of the evidence shows that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are from the wheel and transmitted to humans through the interface.
Remember that SARS-CoV infection comes from the contact between humans and swimming markets, perhaps the swimming markets and the killing of all the infections within it that effectively ends SARS epidemics.
With the same reason, the trends should be moved from the lake market to prevent zoonotic transmissions, remembering there are some driving lines of beta-CoV training lines close to SARS-CoV-2.
Nevertheless, the truth and the SARS-CoV-2 mechanism were transmitted to humans through trends and other mammals must still be explained in the study in the past period.
On the other hand, MERS-CoVs have been in the snake of the Arabs.
It works as an important transport tool and as the main source of meat, milk, skin, and wave products for local communities.
The Arabs are the largest parts of the Middle East and Africa.
That's why we can't kill all skins to control MERS, as done on the market of wild animals in Tacomcong to prevent SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop MERS changes, the compromise approach must be done to develop vaccine for effective inputs to MERS-CoV and is combined with other infectious control steps.
Before we have succeeded to remove this virus, new genotypes can appear and cause skins.
A variety of zoonotic coVs are in the green nature.
Indeed, the cows of the sophisticated cyclopedia have a lot of powers of zoonotics.
There are many possibilities for this zoonotic coV to evolve and experience recombination, which affects the appearance of the new coV that is easier to be transmised and/or delayed for humans in the future.
The culture makes wild animals in some places in the Cyclopedia must be left to reduce the unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the experiences of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, it should be applied to prepare and planned for better opposition.
In fact, many viruses have been on this planet since then.
These viruses are in their natural reserve until there are opportunities for preaching.
Although heavy has many cylinders supporting the health of the virus, human opportunities can be reduced if people are administered to leave wild animals.
Continuing surveys against mammals need to be done to understand more the coV ecology and its natural clouds, which will be clearly useful in preventing human transmissions and visions.
As a conclusion, the most effective way to prevent the virus is that humans should keep a distance from the ecological reactor of the nature of the zoonotic virus.
Some parts of the exhibition of SARS-CoV-2 are not found.
First, if we transmiss SARS-CoV-2 viruses into trends, the condition when we share the ecological replication is an important thing to be known.
Secondly, if the wheel has a more direct role in transmission to humans, how humans contact with the skin should be determined.
Third, if there is a third role to be a real interference, the way the mammals interact with other species, including humans, sleeves, and trends, should be explained.
Finally, because many mammalians, including the animals that may be retailed against SARS-CoV-2, have to do a good test infection and survey.
Without the wheels, trends, or other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its input virus that almost identical can be identified in its natural sheet in the random time.
Continuing research in this area will take part in the SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary route in animals, with an important implication in prevention and human COVID-19 prevention.
diagnostic "first case" and "confirmation case" COVID-19 needs to be done
On 6 February 2020, our team published a rapid board of advice for diagnosis and diagnosis for the new coronavir 2019 (2019-n-CoV), which is based on our experience and became a good reference to combating pandemics throughout the world.
Nevertheless, heartnavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, illness and knowledge increased on the basis of the findings that are ongoing and clinical practices; therefore, the strategies of diagnosis and diagnosis continued to be updated.
In this letter, we responded to one of our comments and provides the most recent diagnostic criteria for the "first case" and "confirmed case" based on the diagnosis and the diagnosis guide for COVID-19 (seventh version) issued by the National Health Committee of the Republic of the Cyprus.
In December 2019, the new coronavir 2019 (2019-nCOV) has caused a bleeding, which is currently formally called the heartnavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and that virus was given the name of the heartnavir syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO explains COVID-19 as pandemics.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infections, our team has developed a rapid board of advice and it has been published onlinely in the Military Medical Research on 6 February 2020.
It has been a lot of interesting attention since the publication is published.
However, it must be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, the stability and our knowledge increased on the basis of the finding of a research that is continued and of clinical practices; therefore, the strategy of diagnosis and diagnosis also continues to be updated.
As a example of the Diagnostics and Appropriation Panel for COVID-19, issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Health Committee of the Tibet (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), from 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020, this committee has issued a total of seven editions with a number of contexts have been changed sufficiently.
We accepted the comments from Zhou et al., they introduced a proposal for simplicity shooting based on their clinical experience.
In their work, they added new evidence for our department and became valuable for this pandemic throughout the world.
We supported the results of their work that we deserve and express our appreciation.
Nevertheless, the results of their work also require the diagnosis and the diagnosis of COVID-19 (seventh test version) and the latest study.
Based on the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the second case requires a combination of one of the epidemiological images with two clinical manifestations to make comprehensive analysis, or need to detect three clinical manifestations if there is no clear epidemic flow:
epidemiological course: 1) traveling or traveling in the city of Whan and its surrounding, or other communities where the COVID-19 case has been reported in the last 14 days before the geographical experience; (2) contacts with the SARS-CoV-2 (Positive Nuclear Review); (3) contacts with the patient who have been surveyed or breathing from the Whan city and the area around them, or other communities where COVID-19 has been reported in the last 14 days before the geographical information; (4) renting with the classic confirmation (≥ 2 cases with the surveys of Whan and the surveyed zone in 2 weeks, local houses, such as the country).
Clinical manipulation: (1) breast and/or breast-feeding; (2) COVID-19; (3) the total volume of white blood cells shows normal liquidity rates, decreasing or decreasing at the early stage.
The confirmed case diagnosis should be based on the previous case with one of the following pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) the real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) all the genem shows high homogeneity for the known new corevirus; (3) positive for specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in the series test; or changes in specific IgG-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from negatively become positive, or increases the rate of ≥4 liver at the time of recovery.
We can see that the real-time Nuclear PCR test in the sample of breathing or blood is added to the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020).
The patogenic detection of the blood sample was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and the fifth (8 February 2020); then, a series of evidence was added to the seventh edition.
This change is based on the further research of researchers to search for the optimal nuclear detection of the axis for rapid diagnosis, and the sample of napkin samples including blood-driving, which increases the perception of specimens, and supports certain antibodies positive results in the confirmed criteria.
Furthermore, there are more evidence that can remind us of watching the patient with athics and unexpected experiences.
That's why Zhou et al. should be updated because they classify people without clinical experiences as "low".
The skor systems also need to be verified in the practices and clinical studies in the present time.
As a prosecutor, we hope that more evidence will appear immediately and ask readers to give comments.
To diagnosis "first case" and "confirmated case", we recommend to follow and obey the most recent states in each country.
Our team will also update our career as a helpful time.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest number of deaths.
Last night, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 on that day.
It's the highest mortal number in one day of the virus results.

Gubernur Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the State party had extended the order to stay at home until May 1, May.
Trade in Australia reduces the lowest toilet tiles for transaction
On Monday and Saturday afternoon, Australia Woolworth and Coles' s shop networks reduced the toilet tickets limits to two and one pack for transaction at all national levels.
ALDI also applys the limit of one sir, on your day.
This shipping is sent as a message on the box and on the Facebook page.
The winners are reported to provide for the results of the fear of COVID-19 if the community had to make a swimming isolation.
On Rabu’s day, Woolworths also limited the sales of toilets to travel to home to one pack of message.
This change follows four of the packs for transactions that were previously implemented by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March.
In the media statement dated 8 March, Coles reported that with the payment of the four packages, "more shops are still lost in a hour since the shipment," and said the request "only happened." while ALDI, in a Facebook post on the day of Selasa, called "unexpected".
Seller's "sneaking fat" last week, says one of the men who talked about Woolworths.
Costco shops in Canberra also limited the numbers allowed to two packs last week.
In order to avoid deterioration, Coles urged the larger cost of the smoker and increased the frequencies of the shipment, Woolworths made further preparations, while ALDI prepared for the work of the special Rabu’s promotion at first.
Russell Zimmerman, the Executive Director of the Australian Persistent Association, said that the career tries to improve the preparation, but the local government limits for the driving period make it difficult.
He warned the production costs, even when he tried to satisfy the requests, and more special promotions.
On the day of Selasa, ALDI announced that because of the exit of the preparation, some shops could not be able to make a special Rabu.
In a news.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a ritel copy from the Queensland University of Technology, said the shop contained every night.
He stressed that the toilet tissue is a great volume of goods that the number of its products is low and, if they are sold, make a lot of spaces in the rats so that the slowness of the items is more intense.
Coles and Woolworths think that if there are many items in the rat, if products such as toilet tissue and advertising can be [disabled] and are in large numbers, the panic may be minimised, the Russian roomman is expensive through the ABC news office.
The products of the toilets Who Gives a Crap said on the Sunday, that they were missing.
Kimberly-Clark, which makes Toilet Kleenex, and Solaris paper, which makes Sorbent, tried them to work 24/7 to keep the passport, according to News.com.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reports that some owners offer free toilets to the first swimming shop in Melbourne, while more slightly been established because the buyer took a shop for the weekend of the Wednesday.
The Edition of NT News, a day in Darwin, constituted eight pages that are intended to be cut and used as a toilet.
The commercials are just refused to apply the limits, according to the Australian ABC report on 3 March, they said they were not planning to apply the loan limits.
Russell Zimmerman adds that other products are also in high requests, including maskers, sweet food, hands and skins.
Similarly, in the outdoor of Australia, at the Minggu sun, the British supermarket Okas was limited to the sale of Andres’ toilets to two packs with 12 grams.
World Health Organization (WHO) declares COVID-19 as pandemic
On Rabu’s day, World Health Organization (WHO) declares the changes of COVID-19 -- diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2-co-cardiovascular heart.
Although the word "pandemi" is just aware of how many diseases have been distributed, not how dangerous that case, the WHO noted that it is necessary to encourage the government to act:
All countries can still change this pandemic journey.
If the country is identified, tested, treated, isolated, and mobilizes its people as an answer, the Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of WHO.
We looked very well because of the preaching and the spirituality of our life, and of our concerns, the degree of persecution.
According to Dr. Tom Peace, the director of the United States Corporation and the Prevention of Discrimination, this pandemic has been "a bird ever happened."
He said, in the record published by CNN in February, "except influenza, there's no breathing virus that will ever be taken from her slaughter to the global preaching."
Ghebreyesus declared the same view, saying, "The spirit has never seen pandemics that the heartnavirs were shocked."
He continued, "and we have never seen pandemics that could be checked together."
The new status of the WHO was to follow the decision in January, which declares that this ship is a worldwide healthcare.
The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectional Disease, Dr. Anthony Fauci, says about this wave, "It's, this phenomenon's going to be bad."
The Associated Press reported that at least 126.000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, which affected more than 4.600 deaths.
The heartnavir pandemi 2019-2020 is the pandemic of 2019 heartnavir disease (COVID-19) which is being continued and resulted in the syndrome of acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
The change was identified in Whan, Tzekong, on December 2019, as a worldwide health health security, which has been identified on January 30, 2020, and was stated as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
By 10 April 2020, about 1,61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and regions, which affected about 97.000 deaths.
About 364.000 people have been healed.
The case fatality has been estimated for 4% in Cyclopedia, while the whole world starts from 13.04% to 0.08% in New Zealand.
The public experiences include shoes, stones, and snakes.
Complexing can include pneumonia and syndrome of acute respiration.
The time from shipping up to the slightness of about five days, but it can start from two to four to fourteen days.
No vaccine is known or specific antivirus treatment.
The main care of symptomatic therapy and supports. Prevention recommended includes cleaning of the hands, closing the mouth when the stones, keeping the path from others, and spend and isolation for people who are expected to be infected.
The authorities in the whole world have responded to the limitations of travel, carnaval, night, night, workplace controls, and facilities.
This has caused a deterioration of global economic economic impairment, the deterioration, or the restraint of cultural activity, political, religion, publicity, and the deterioration of materials that have been improved by panic purchasing.
Schools and universities have been well closed at the national and local levels of 193 countries, which affected around 99.4 per cent of the students worldwide.
Misformation about this virus has distributed networks and there are xenofobia and discrimination against the Tionghoa people, people with the generation and vision of East Asia and Southeast Asia, and those coming from the area with a meaningful virus case.
Infringements of travel and heavy industries, air pollution and carbon emissions reduced.
Health Authority in Whan, Tokyo, reports to the pneumonia Classe of Hubei, which was unknown on 31 December 2019 and investigated early January 2020.
These cases are mostly associated with the Grossir Sea market, and that's why the virus was expected to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that causes infringements called SARS-CoV-2, new virus found and associated with the heavy cornavirus, the cornavirs strikes, and the SARS-CoV. First person with a shock was known to be ill on December 1, 2019, and there is no clear relationship with the late market class that then mentioned.
Among the initial classs reported on December 2019, two thirds were found with the market.
On 13 March 2020, an uncertain report from South China Morning Post suggested that a case can be issued on 17 November 2019, at a 55-year-old age of Hubei Province, may be the first. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, with a new case of decline in Tibet, the new number of cases in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, has increased in Italy, and the new number of cases outside the Pacific for the first time.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially among people with a more rare experience.
By 26 February, relatively little cases reported among young people, with 19 years under the age of the world are 2.5% of the cases. The chief of English researcher Raya, Patrick Vallance, believes that 60% of the British population must be infected before the group could be completed.
The case acknowledges the number of people who have been tested in COVID-19 and the results of the test have been confirmed positive according to the official protocol.
By 23 March, there are no countries who have tested more than 3 percent of its population, and many countries have made official rules to not test people with relief, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Swiss.
A study published on 16 March found that in Chicago, until 23 January, 86% of COVID-19 infections were not detected, and that this undocumented infection is a source of infection for 79% documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March suggested that the infected numbers in Italy are more than the case reported.
The initial estimation of the base of reproduction (R0) for COVID-19 is 1,4 to 2,4.
A study published by the United States Correction and Prevention Centre concluded that the number may be 5,7.
Most COVID 19 improved.
For non - healing people, a period from the development of the experience until the death of 6 to 41 days, with the most common 14 days.
Since 10 April 2020, about 97.000 deaths were related to COVID-19.
In Chikong, up to 5 February, about 80% of death occurred in people over 60 years and 75% have previously existed health injuries, including cardiovascular and diabetes.
In fact, the fatalities resulting from COVID-19 may be far higher, remembering the official number of people who died without testing, for example, at home, at the hospital, dsb.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of loss rates of death during the pandemic slows the official COVID death rate with factors of 4 to 5 times slow.
A woman's speaker for the Centre of Administration and Discrimination (CDC) AS acknowledges: "We know [the number of deaths] is lower than the real number", a statement that was encouraged by the unscientious report on too low impact in the United States. The involvement of too often appears in pandemics, such as the epidemics of H1N1 in 2009. The first death is confirmed in Whan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside the Techkong was held on February 1th in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.
By 28 February, outside the Czech Republic, more than one of the deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By 13 March, more than fourteen countries and regions of the earth have reported death, in every part, except Antarctics, which are generally used for the number of mortality.
This changing is based on regions and periods, and is influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health system, the options of treatment, the time since the first change, and the nature of popularity such as age, the type of health, and the whole health. The death ratio of the case illustrates the number of deaths that are shared in the number of cases that are diagnosed in a specific period.
According to Statistics Johns Hopkins University, death ratio against cases globally is 6.0% (97.039/617.204) for 10 April 2020.
This ring is different according to the region.
In Cikong, death ratio against case decreased from 17.3% (for people with the incidence of 1-10 January 2020) was 0.7% (for people with experiences after 1 February 2020). Other figures include case fatality (CFR), which reflects the diagnosis of people died by certain diseases, and infected fatality rates (IFR), which illustrates infected persons (diagnosis and undiagnosis) who died certain diseases.
This statistics are not connected to time and follow a certain population starts from infection until the case is resolved.
Some academics have tried to count these figures for certain populations.
Center for Evidence-Based Medicine University of Oxford estimates infected fatality counts to pandemic totally between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The rates of this distortion are on the result of the first testing of COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical investigation that analyzes the deterioration of the CFR-disciplines.
WHO states that this pandemic can be controlled.
The channel and the end of the shipment are not clear and may be different according to the location.
Maciej Boni from Pennsylvania State University states: "Don't even be controlled, the skins normally cut down and then start to decline when the disease is available.
But it is almost impossible to make a real project on when it happened."
Medical doctors of the senior government of the Chiong Zhong Nanshan believe that "This change may end June" if the whole country can be mobilized to follow the WHO recommendations on steps to stop the virus preaching.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski from London University of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine states that SRS-CoV-2 "is continued to smile, probably until one or two years."
According to the Imperial College Research, which was conducted by Neil Ferguson, physical and other steps would require "as available vaccine (possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner from the University of Vanderbilt said, "I think that this heartnavir is likely, because it is very easy to transmise, can lose all of it" and this disease "more can be changed to summer disease that comes back every year."
The virulence will depend on the reverse of groups and the level of change.
COVID-19 experience can be relatively unspecific, and the infected person can be infected without a phenomenon.
Two most common specimens are a 88%) and a 68 per cent of skin stones.
A less common gesture includes deterioration, breast-feeding production (flegma), loss of love, breathing, skin and otot, smelling niggers, head pain, smell, heoptics, diarrees, or aresis. WHO states that some of the six people are seriously sick and suffering of breathing difficulties.
Center for Diseases and Protections (CDC) AS notes emergency experiences include breathing problems, imprisoned pain, slow-swallowing, distressing, walking and skinness; medical attention is immediately recommended if these events appear. Development of diseases can be more serious, symptoms of acute breathing, sepsis, sects, and death.
Some persons infected may be asymtomatic, without clinical experiences, but with the results of confirming infection, researchers recommend that those who are close to the infected person should be monitored and checked to ensure uninfected.
Tionghoa’s people estimate the asymmetric reason from some to 44 percent.
Incubation period (inter infection and infection) usually disappeared between 1 and 14 days, most often 5 days. As examples of incertitude, the number of COVID-19 inhibitors that lost the initial 30%, then reduced to 15%.
The question of how this illness is still broken.
COVID-19 was particularly convinced in the nearly contact time and through a small piece of stones, stones, or speaking; close contacts are contacts between 1 and 2 feet (3 to 6 feet).
Research found that the stone that is not covered can lead to a cutting of 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 feet (27 feet).
Some researchers may also be discovered by smaller droplets that are longer in the air and are used when they speak.
Droplet can fall in the mouth or nest of a person close to her, or may be shocked into pulls.
Some medical processes, such as intubation and pulmonary heart resolve (RJP), can make the breath secret changed into a aerosol and spread through the air.
Preaching can also happen when someone touchs the contaminated surface, including skin, and touchs the eyes, nests, and mouth.
Although there are concerns that virus can spread through the fascination, the risk is lowly convinced.
The tsunami government shows the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 transmissions can be failly transmissed. Virus the first three days after the emergency, although the preaching work may happen before the event of the vision and at a further stage of disease.
People have made positive tests up to three days before the slogan, which may be reported about transmissions before there was a meaningful event.
Only a few reports of asymtomatic cases confirmed by the laboratory, but asymmatic switch has been identified by some countries when investigating contact surveys.
The European Disease Centre (ECDC) states that although it is not clearly how easy this disease is, one generally infected two to three other people. This virus can be kept on the surface for hours until days.
It was found that virus can be detected up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and in the card of 304, one day in cards, and more than four hours on fire.
However, this variety depends on the heat and temperature, and the conservation and other animals have been tested in the COVID positives.
No evidence that animals can prohibite the virus to humans, although the British authorities recommended to clean the hands after contact with animals, as after contacting with the surface that may have been affected by the infected persons.
Coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, the first time is isolated from three pneumonians related to the classic case of acute respiratory disease in Whan.
All the cyclings of SARS-CoV-2 newly related to the heartnavir in the nature. In the outside of the human body, this virus can be destroyed if it was covered by the household, which decreases the wide range of its protection. SARS-CoV-2 is close to the first SARS-CoV.
The virus is supposed to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis reveals that the cornavirus is genetically classified with the betacoronavirus gene, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (B generation gallery) together with two grains of bleeding.
This virus has 96 per cent in the entire genome level with other blonde cornavir samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Tionghoa research found that only one amino axis is different in certain parts of the genome between the genetic virus and the human virus.
By now, the whole genome comparison is found to the most of 92% of the genetic ratio between the heartnavir and the SARS-CoV-2, not enough to prove that the tension is the SARS-CoV-2 barrier.
Virus infections may be diagnosed during the time based on anxiety, but confirmation finally performed by the reaction of polymerical transcryption (rRT-PCR) on the secret infected or infected CT cycling.
A study compared to PCR’s CT in Whan shows that CT significantly significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specifically, with a lot of skilled plants with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, American Radiology College recommended "CCT cannot be used for separation or as the first line test in COVID-19 diagnosis."
WHO has published a number of RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, which was first issued on January 17.
Testing uses polymerase transcrisis transcriminatory reactions in real-time (rRT-PCR).
Testing can be performed in the sample of breathing or blood.
It is usually available for a few hours to a few days.
A number of laboratorys and enterprises are developing a serological test that identifies antibodies.
For the 6 April 2020, no one of these serial tests have been able to accept its use in a comprehensive manner.
In the AS, a serological test developed by Cellex has been agreed to use urgently, only by a certified laboratory.
Radiographic and tomographic cyclings (CT) are characterized in persons who have symptoms include the foundation of asymmetric glass peripheral glass and there is no low efficiency.
Italian Radiological Society is providing international network databases for the finding of enterprises in the case confirmed.
Because the bombs with other infections such as adenovirus, PCR clashing has a limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in Quekong compared with the CCTs and shows that although less specific for infection, infection is more rapid and more sensitive, so it is recommended to be considered as a separation tool in the epidemic area.
Convolutional neural networks based on structural intelligence have been developed to detect virus discrepancies with radiographic and CT.
The strategy to prevent this disease includes maintaining a goodly comprehensive personal cleaning, cleaning the hands, avoid touching the eyes, necks, or mouth before wearing the hands, and using a tissue when stones or sweet and smell the tissue right away.
Those who may have been infected are recommended to use a wheat mask in the public.
The physicians are also recommended to prevent the distortion, and the governments in various regions have limited or struggled to stop all non-excellent journeys to and from countries and regions.
However, virus has reached the preaching stage of the community in most parts of the world.
This means that virus has been distributed in the community, and some community members do not know where or how they are infected, and health care careers that can be treated are recommended to make standard prevention, contact prevention, and eye protection.
The use of data placed by the Government’s phone for this purpose has caused privacy problems, with the explanation of Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations that recommend this survey.
Several applications have been implemented or initiated to use voluntaryly, and on April 7, 2020, more than one of the teams operate with private solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth to record the approach of users to other phones.
Next, users will receive a message if they are close to a positive one for COVID-19.Reference to the way to prevent infection; for example, the nest and the inefficacy of the tumor drugs.
There is no COVID vaccine, although many organizations are working to develop it.
Blind hands are encouraged to prevent the preaching of illness.
CDC recommends that people often clean their hands with skin and water during at least twenty seconds, especially after the toilet or when the hands appear to be sweet; before eating; and after heat, rock, or drinking.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus was killed by a swimming house skin that destroyed its protective snake.
Moreover, CDC recommends the use of hands of alcohol based on some 60% of alcohol, based on volumes when salt and water are not available.
WEE encourages people not to touch their eyes, necks, or mouth before they cut their hands.
The surface can be decontaminated using a number of raw (in one minute of disinfected patent for the decrease of the body), including ethanol 62–71%, isopropanol 50–100%, hydrochloride 0,1%, mass hydrogen 0,5%, and povire-yodine 0,2–7,5%.
Other wheels, such as benzalconium chloride and gluconic chloroxyd, are less effective.
CDC recommends that if there are cases of COVID or confirmed in general facilities, such as offices or places of child investigation, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, public areas, electronic devices like tablets, keyboard screens, remote controls, and ATM machine used by the driver, it must be infected.
The health organization recommends that people close their mouth and nest with a skin that is cut or use a tissue when stones or skins, and then immediately remove the tissue.
A large mask is recommended for those who may have been infected because the use of the mask can limit the volume and the distance of the espirator droplets that are distributed when talking, sweet, and stones.
WHO has issued instructions on mass time and ways.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Makers can reduce the tendency of people to touch the face with the unclean hands, which is the main source of torment."Masker is also recommended to use by people who care for others who may suffer this disease.
WHO recommends the use of mask by healthy people only if they have high risks, such as people care for COVID-19, although WHO also acknowledges that masker use can help prevent people to touch their face.
Some countries have already started to motive masker uses to the community.
In the United States, CDC recommends the use of non-medical faces made from the kitchen. It specifically recommends medical mask uses to healthy communitys, especially when nearly (1 metres (3 feet) or less of) with others.
Hong Kong recommends swimming maskers when using the public or living in many places.
Thai health care provides an encouragement to make a kitchen mask in the house and clean it every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia refused his people to get out of the public place without putting the mask or closing the nest and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all his citizens to put their face mask on the public to protect themselves and others.
Austria’s government defeats every person who entered the toserba to put the face mask.
Israel asked all his citizens to use the face mask when they were in the public.
Taiwan, which produced ten million mask per day since Maret ’ mid - day, requires trainers and buses to make the face mask on 1 April.
The panel stipulates the use of the face mask every time out of the house, and recommends the use of the sight mask for those who are not able to buy the face mask.
In Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore, the faces were largely used.
The social burden (which also called physics) is a infectious action intended to delay the care of the disease by minimising the contact close to the individual.
Social loan methods include carantia; travel payments; and school centres, workplaces, stations, teaters, or expenditure centers.
People can apply social dispensing methods by living at home, resolving travels, avoiding many regions, using skills without contacts, and maintaining physical directions from others.
Today, many governments are prosecuting or rebuilding social burdens in the lands that are affected.
The maximum number of people who are recommended by the United States governments and health organizations are quickly reduced, starting from 250 people (if not known about COVID-19 in a region) as 50 people, and then became 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany rejected meetings in the public area which includes more than two people. Lansia and people with medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, breathing disease, hypertension, and higher immune systems that have risks of serious diseases and higher complications recommend CDC to be possible in the area that may be only in the local areas that have been discovered in the community level. In March 2020, WHO and other health authorities began to replace the term "social deficit" to explain that it is a goal to accompany with physical contacts with the remaining socially, virtually or far away.
Using is the term "social department" stressed that people have to isolate themselves completely socially and not urge people to remain involved with others through alternative ways.
This recommendation includes the encouragement to have sex with people who live with you and have no virus or virus experience.
Isolasis is in the home recommended for those who are diagnosed with COVID19 and who are expected to be infected.
Health agencies have issued the primary instructions for the right-based isolation, and many governments are prohibited or recommended that the carnaval be established for all the populations living in the earliest area.
Carantina's instructions are the most strict for people including high-risk groups.
Those who may be employed by COVID-19 and those recently traveled to the country or region with the great recommended COVID-19 preaching career for 14 days since the last time possible.
Strategy in the processing of shipment is conservation or suppression, and mixture.
Prevents are made at the beginning of the stage and aimed at investigating and isolating infected persons, and to make other steps to control infection and vaccination aimed at stoping the health of disease to the whole population.
When it is not possible to maintain the preaching of illness, the next efforts are toward the mixed steps: these steps are taken to delay the preaching and to reduce the damage of the health and society system.
Combining conserving and mixed action can be done together.
Superation requires more strenger steps to reduce pandemics by reducing the basic reproduction counts to less than 1.0% of the development of the menu disease is trying to reduce the epidemic height, which is known by cutting the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of control in health services and provides more time to develop vaccine and treatment.
Non-profit interviews include individual prevention actions, such as hand-making, with face mass, and career-making; steps in the community's levels that are intended to deal with physical discharge, such as school closing and deleted the meetings; community association to promote research and participation in these interventions; and environmental steps, such as supervisions. Another drastically intended to integrate the courses in which it is to be done, as well as the whole city and membership of the movement processes.
Other countries also implement a variety of steps to resolve the virus.
South Korea identified the massive and local carnaval and warnings of infected persons.
Singapore provides financial support for the infected persons who make the carantina slowly and puts a great deal for those who failed to do it.
Taiwan increased the skin mass production and condemns medical incredibly, and the similarity to England and the United States shows that mixtures (slow, but not stop the epidemic preaching) and suppression (reducing epidemic growth) have great challenges.
Optimum mixed rule can reduce health care to 2/3 and death until half, but still affects hundreds of thousands of death and health systems.
Supply can be selected, but it is necessary to keep the virus in human populations (or to the available vaccine, if this is the first thing), because if not, the slower will be slowly retreated when the suppression steps are deployed.
The long-term intervention of pandemics brings an impact on social and economic affairs.
There is no specific anti-virus drugs agreed to COVID-19, but the development efforts are being made, which includes already existing drug tests.
Consumption of fluid drugs that are freely sold, drinking enough water, and refrigerator can help decrease.
Depending on the intensity, therapy of oxygen, intravenous heat, and the support of breathing may be needed.
The use of steroid can decrease the condition of patients.
Some of the previously agreed measures for the treatment of other virus diseases are being used in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also states that some "traditional and home-based dealings" can depend on the events caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO said that enhancing capacity and adapting health services to the needs of patients of COVID-19 is the basic step in response to the care.
ECDC and the European Regional WHO Office have issued offices to hospitals and health services first to discuss resources at various levels, including focusing on the laboratory service for COVID testing, if it enables to defeat the election process, separate and isolate the positive COVID-19 patients, and to increase intensive treatment capacity with personnel training and increase the number of ventilators and beds.
There are various theories of the origin of the first case (called nol).
The first known new carnavirus case can be found on December 1, 2019 in Whana, Hubei, Tsikong.
In a month, the number of heartnavir cases in Hubei increased.
These cases are largely associated with the Grosir Sea Sea Market, which also sells lived animals, and one theory says that virus comes from one of the kinds of animals; or, in other words, virus has a zoonotic origin. A pneumonia class with unknown causes were known on December 26, and was sent by Dr. Zhang Jixian in the Province of Hubei, who told CDC Jianghan Whan on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the Headquarters of the Hospital Hospital Whan told their friends about "S.H.I.E.L.D."
Eight of this doctor, including Li Wenliang, was warned by the police because they distributed false deficiencies, and otherwise, Ai Fen, was arrested by her face because of the warnings that were exiled.
The Committee of the People’s Health of the City then issued a statement to the public on 31 December and told the WHO.
Many of the unrecognised pneumonia cases are reported to the health authorities in Whan, which then investigated at the beginning of January. At the beginning of the year, the number of cases increased two times a half day.
At the beginning and middle of January 2020, virus distributed to other provinces of Tsikong, was supported by migration during the New Year of New Year and because Whan is the center of transport and main train stations.
On January 20, Tikong reported about 140 new cases every day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The following official data shows that 6.174 persons have experienced in the 20th January 2020.On March 26, the United States have cut the tsunami and Italy with the highest confirmation cases in the world. By 9 April 2020, more than 1,61 million cases have been reported throughout the world; more than 97,000 deaths of the world and more than 364,000 healing.
About 200 countries and regions have at least one case.
Because of pandemics in Europe, many countries in Schengen are limited to free and controlling borders.
National estimates include relief steps, such as karantina (individually the order to live in the house, orders are protected in place, or region karantina) and night. On 2 April, about 300 million people, or around 90% of the population, are located in a region of the United States, more than 50 million people in the area of Philippines, about 59 million people are in the South African region, and 1.3 million people in the region of India.
On March 26, 1,7 billion people around the world have been in a number of areas, which increased up to 2,6 billion people two days later, shocking around the world’s populations.
The first confirmation case of COVID-19 can be re-expressed to the date of 1 December 2019 in Whan; one report that has not been confirmed shows the first case on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observes the pneumonial case class because of unknown reason on December 26, which was reported to his hospital to the Jianghan CD on December 27.
The initial genetic testing of patients on December 27, 2019 indicated that the heartnavir is like SARS.
Administration to the public was issued by the Whan City Health Committee on 31 December.
WHO was known at the same day.
When the knowledge was done, the doctor in Whan was warned by the police because "promoting the desires" about the wave.

Some train stations and horses have also been closed.
Epidemide is fast with Chunyun, the main journey related to the new Year liberation.
A number of events involved by the central government and the region, including the New Year Festival, and the Swedish company also maintains a closed shop and a wise place, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many of the New Year events and widespread places were closed to prevent the masses meetings, including the prohibition of the city in Beijing and the traditional temple.
On 24 of 31 provinces, cities, and twelve districts, the authorities launched the New Year liberation until 10 February, and ordered most of the workplaces to not be reopened until that date.
These are 80% of PDB countries and 90% exports.
Hong Kong increased the overcome of diseases to the highest levels and announces the emergency situations, closing school to Maret, and cancelling the New Year Section.
Visitors in Europe and Latin America reduced 40%.
North America’s and Middle East operators experienced 50 to 60 percent.
This also affects the 33-43% populations, and the walking line to the Maret month's business center is compared to February.
The workshop in the whole world's business center has been taking further steps, such as sanitation improvement, the latest deployment to check the temperature of buyers, and the restraint. According to the PBB Economic Commission for Latin America, the residues that are caused by the pandemics can cause those who are in extreme poverty in Latin America increased between 14 and 22 million people in comparison with situations without pandemics.
In January and February 2020, during the Whan’s epidemic summit, about 5 million people in the Cyprus lost their job.
Most of the 300 million employees of the Cuban migrants are starting in the homes in the middle of the province of Hubei. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sell government assistance.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the curnavir wave may lose 47 million jobs in the United States and the level of expenditure can reach 32%. The region of India has resulted in ten million migrants (which was paid through the daily salary) experience. The survey from Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of the homes in Canada had lost jobs. About 900,000 workers have been lost in Spain since they were conducted in the middle of March 2020.
During the two months of March, the number of four million French employees advised for temporary insurance and 1 million British employees have a universal credit scheme. Another half million companies in Germany have seized a subventional scheme for its officials, called the Cursework.
Germany’s departure schemes were adopted by France and England.
In the world, the artistic projects and cultural heritage are largely affected by pandemics, which affects organizational and individual operations, well as workers.
Art and culture organizations are trying to visit their high mission (which often been established publicly) to provide cultural heritage access to the community, to protect workers and society, and to support art if possible.
In March 2020, in the whole world, and at different levels, museums, shops, audience, and other cultures were closed without limits of time, with shipment, events, and their visions are deleted or decreased.
As a result, intensive efforts are made to provide alternative services through digital platforms, and the slowing of other recent and very rapidly developed diseases are the slaughtering of the academic services, the major history, and other social events, such as music and concert festivals, technological conferences, and the workshops.
The film industry also experienced an inquiry, and it was pronounced that the celebration of the Holy Feast in Rome, which falls in the last week of the past Christian rebellion, was deleted.
Many of the extents encouraged Christians to stay at home and not attend Misa on Monday; some churches provide radio service, direct network or television, while others offer drives or grounds.
With the closing of the Church and the captain of the Catholic Chief, and the Holy Spirit of Christ’s officers, other religious authorities also disrupted the service and restricted the public meetings in churches, majids, synagogue, temples, and gardens.
The importance of the Iranian Health Safety announces the celebration of Thursday salary in the area that was covered and then closed, while the Saudi Arabs refused to stop the foreign landscape and its people to the sanctuary places in Mekah and Madinah.
This is the most significance of the worldwide calendar since the Second World War.
Most of the major events were deleted or sent, including Liga Champions EUFA 2019-2020, Liga Premier 2019-2020, EUFA Euro 2020, NBA summer 2019-2020, and NHL summer 2019-2020.
This was the Olimpiade Museum of the Hot 2020 plan, which was initially started at the end of July; the International Olimpiade Olympice Committee announced on 24 March that the event will "reset up until 2020, but will not be more than the summer 2021." In the whole world, casino and other games were closed, and the direct movement of pokers will be deleted or disrupted.
This causes many advertising to the network juice, many network sites reporting the improvement of the new defence industry, which has also affected the entertainment industry, with various groups of music towers or cancel the concert tours.
Many big teaters like Broadway also give all the events.
Artists explore several ways to continue to produce and share work through the Internet as an alternative to directly advertising traditionally, such as direct networking concerts, or make "festival" web based for artists to share, publish, and publish their work.
Many of the Internet’s heartnavirs have been distributed networks with many people who spend to humor and view their attention in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the COVID19 changes, there is a increase in the prize, xenofobia, and racism against the people of Tionghoa and East Asia, and against the people of the regions affected in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Inspekts of fear, disaster, and devastation are most important in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asian-Pacific regions.
The report of February (the majority of the cases still limited in Tikong) records the racial signs of the world’s groups that Tionghoa’s people intend to receive virus or accept what they claim to be a unique reward.
Some African countries also experience the improvement of the anti-Tioncock.
Many of the people of Whan and Hubei reported discrimination because of their territory.
There is a support for the Tionghoa people, both net and ring, and for people in the virus zones.
Exercising the development of ships to new hotspot countries, people from Italy, the first European country of serious COVID-19, could also be a rape and xenofobia. Citizens in countries include Malaysia, New Ireland, Singapore, and South Korea first signed requests to prevent Tionghoa's countries to stop disease.
In Japan, #ChineseDontComeToJapan has become a train on Twitter.
Tionghoa’s and other Asians in Britain and the United States reported the increase in the race prevention and attack.
President of the AS Donald Trump is critical because it is called "kornavirus" as "Virus Youkong", the term which the critics considered race and anti-Tiokong.
The inquiries in Ukraine attacked the buses that brought the Ukrainians and the invasions from Whan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from the Middle East India, who are limited to the Tickcock, and learned in major Indian cities, were reported to have a devastation related to the heartnavirs.
President of Bharatiya Janata's State unit in the Western Dilik Ghosh said that Tikong has destroyed the nature and "This is why God replied to them."
The statement then was threatened by the Technical Consulting in Kolkata, calling it "booth". In the Cyclopedia, xenofobia and racism against the non-Tionghoa people are struggled because of pandemi, with foreign people are described as "foreign sheep" and forbidden to "slaughter".
Many newspapers used by paying improvements have removed it for parts or all of their heartnavirs.
Many scientific publishers make a skilled skilled with open access.
Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on the practicing server, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for cardiac acid 2019 (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods to detect existing virus and to detect antibodies which are produced as infected responses.
The existence of virus in the sample was confirmed with RT-PCR, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and was designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus.
This test is used to confirm new or still active infections.
Antibodies detection (serology) can be used for diagnosis and population surveys.
The use of antibodies shows the numbers of persons who have been shocked, including those who are too able to be reported or who are not shocked.
The mortality of diseases that are valid and the level of the population’s revolving groups can be determined by the results of this test.
Because limited testing, until March 2020, there is no country that has any legal data on the prevalence of virus in its population.
By 23 March, there is no country that tests more than 3 per cent of its population, and there is a large variation in the number of tests done by countries.
This variability may also affect the numbers of cases that are reported, which are likely too high in some countries.
Using polymerase transcryption reactions back to the real time (rRT-PCR), this test can be performed in the sample of breathing that is allowed by various methods, including the use of nasopharing or sputum sample.
The results are available in a few hours to two days.
The RT-PCR use that is performed in shocking can only be used in the first week of illness.
The idea is that virus can lose in the shooting when it continues to be active in the pull.
As an alternative, the samples can be taken from the breast in the second week with the use of the shooting cards or materials that are removed through the rock.
One of the initial PCR tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020, used the transcriptory polymerase reactions to the real time (rRT-PCR), and forms at least 250,000 test tools to distribute by the World Health Organization (WHO).
England Raya also developed tests on 23 January 2020. South Korean Corea develops SARS-CoV-2-based PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus) pendence tools on 28 January 2020.
This device is searching for "E" gen that takes all the heartnavirus, and the gen RdRp specifically for SARS-CoV-2. In Tsikong, BGI Group is one of the first company that receives the urgent use of the National Medical Product Service for SARS-CoV-2 instruments based on PCR. In the United States, the Headquarters and Processing Center (CDC) distributes the Panel of diagnostic RT-PCR Real-Time of New 2019 (20-20N-CoV) health laboratory through the International Resource Resource.
One of the three genetic tests in the old version testing tool provides unconvinced results because of reaction errors, and the number of tests in the Atlanta limited, which affects less than 100 samples per day processed during February 2020.
The test use of two considerable components can not be determined until 28 February 2020, and recently after that, the State part and the local laboratory are allowed to test.
This use is approved by the United States Drugs and Food Office on the basis of the Darurat Use Authority. The U.S. Trade Lab began to test the beginning of March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorrp announced that COVID-19 testing is based on the national level.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics makes COVID-19 testing available nationally on 9 March 2020.
No quantity limits are made; recovery and recovery must be done in accordance with CDC settings.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the Virology and Biotechnology Centre of the VECTOR State.
On 11 February 2020, this test was listed by the Federal Office for Health Surveillance. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic was reported to develop tests for detecting COVID-19 infections. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA for testing that can be performed in 3.5 hours with high volume so that one machine can perform approximately 4.128 tests in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, FDA issued an urgent use authorisation (EU) to Abbott Laboratory for testing at the m2000 Abbott system; FDA has previously issued the same authorisation to the Hologic, LabCorp, and thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepty also received from the USFDA for a testing of about 45 minutes.
FDA has accepted testing that uses isothermal nuclear axis expanding technology that is not PCR.
Because there is no need for a number of temperature change cycles, this method can only result in five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Now there are approximately 18.000 machines in the AS and Abbott to increase production until the production of 500,000 tests per day. The use of monoclonal antibodies that are specifically connected to nuclear protein (protein N) is developed in Taiwan, with hope to give results in the period 15 to 20 minutes like fast influenza test.
A booking launched on March 2020 concluded that "foto toracs has a small diagnostic value at the beginning of the beginning, when the CT [tomography computers] finding may have already been before the geographical vision."
Specifically set on CT includes the options of bilateral multi-local multi-lobar grounds with peripheral, ascimeters, and later distributions.
Subpleural domination, crazy paving, and consolidacy are formed by the development of diseases.
In Whan, a study compared to the PCR with the CT on the original point of pandemic shows that CT is more sensitive than the PCR, although less specifically, with a lot of tuberculosis with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT cannot be used for separation or as the first line test in COVID-19 diagnosis."In March 2020, CDC recommended PCR for initial separation.
The level of immune response to infection is the antibodies of IgM and IgG.
This can be used to detect infections in individuals from about 7 days after the experience, to determine immunity against diseases, and in popular surveys. Meditation can be done in the central laboratory (CLT) or with a point-of-care test (PoCT).
Automatic system with high results in many clinical laboratorys will be able to do this, but it will depend on the production levels for each system.
For CLT, normally one personal bloodspecimen is used, although a number of specifications can be used to follow immune responses.
For PoCT, generally one of the skin bloodspecimens are used.
Not like the PCR method, extraction step is not necessary before the investigation. On March 26, 2020, FDA indicates 29 officers who provide knowledge to the agency as necessary, and that is now possible to distribute their antibodies tests.
On April 7, 2020, only one test adopted by FDA on the basis of the emergency use authorisation. In the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics obtained European diagnostics for their testing tools that can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against virus in blood samples.
The ability to test up to some hundreds of samples in a few hours, so far more fast than the conventional PCR testing against the virus.
At the beginning of April, the England of Raya found that there was no antibodies test tools that it was purchased enough to use.
Hong Kong launched the skema that the first patient can stay at home, "Aurorate department will give the risk of the patient to the patient," they spend into it, sent it back, and obtain the test results after some time. NHS of England states that the NHS is in the second case testing scheme to avoid the risk of the patient to discard others if they come to the hospital or should be disinfected in ambulances if used. In the test test for the previous COVID-19 case, a professional health force will take the appropriate test.
On March 2, Germany’s National Association of Statute of Health Insurance physicians said that Germany has a capacity of about 12.000 tests a day in the road station and 10.700 tests have been performed in the past week.
The costs are responsible for health security if testing is requested by the doctor.
According to President Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, a floor test was offered in several large cities.
On March 26, 2020, the number of tests carried out in Germany was not known because only positive results were reported.
One first laboratory survey explains that at least 483.295 samples have been tested until weeks 12/2020 and 33.491 samples (6.9%) were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers in the Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested the samples of 64 patients together with the samples and only tested more if the sample was found positive. In Whan, the laboratory of emergency was a 2,000 meters called "Huo-Yan" (the Mandatory: fire, or "Mapi" in Indonesian language) was located in 5 February 2020, which can be performed by more than 10,000.
With its building watched by the BGI Wang Wang Jian and feed five days, the moderation shows that the case in Hubei could be 47% higher and the costs associated with the carantia can twice delay if there is no testing capacity.
The Whan Laboratory is immediately followed by the Huo-Yan laboratory in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities in the whole of Tibet.
For 4 March 2020, the total capacity of the day is a total of 50,000 tests per day. Multiple source design that is removed by Origami Assays can test about 1.222 patients' samples for COVID-19 by using only 93 surveys. This project can be run in the small laboratory without a robotic flow.
Within the month of Maret, infringements and reactions that have not been declared have been a slave for massive testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom of Raya, and the United States.
Because of this, a number of researchers are trying to explore the sample testing protocols which includes samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genome for further testing. On 31 March, the Arab Emirat is reported to make more heartnavir tests for capital population than any country, and are ready to increase the test scale to reach the major population.
This results through combination of plot tests and the laboratory of the massive population of group 42 and BGI (based on the urgency detection laboratory "Huo-Yan" in Taykong).
It was flying in 14 days, this laboratory can make hundreds of thousands of RT-PCR tests a day and is the first laboratory that has this scale outside the Ticket.
several test receptors that develop parts of the genetic genetic profiles of the heartnavir are developed in the United States, the Czech, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
World Health Organization approve Germany's reception for testing tools sent to countries lowly without resources to develop themselves.
Germany’s response was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Defence Centre has not been available until 28 January to delay the available tests in the United States. At the beginning of the United States, the Cyprus and the United States are in line with the control of the test tools; these two countries and Australia are not able to provide sufficient testing to meet the requests and recommendation for healthy firms.
Instead, the doctor said that the extensive testing available in South Korea helps to reduce the new carnavir service.
Testing capacity, most in the Swasta Sector Laboratory, built in a few years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization recommends the improvement of the test programme as the best way to delay COVID-19. High request for testing because the broad virus service causes hundreds of thousands of tests to wait for work in the AS swasta laboratory, and the production of uses and chemical reactions is genius.
In March 2020, Tikong reported the issue of the testing tools.
In the United States, the testing tool developed by CDC has "defat"; then the government removes the birocratic claims that prevent swasta testing. Spanje buys the test tools from the Shenzhen Bioeasy Co Ltd company, but finds that it was not appropriate.
The company explains that the unreasonable results of the failure in gathering the sample or using the test tools correctly.
Spain's master said they will spend the tools that gives wrong results and replace it with other test tools prepared by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test tools purchased by the Czech Republic of Tskock gives the wrong result. Slovakia purchased 1,2 million tests from the Tacoma that is not correct.
The Prime Minister Matovič recommends that this test tool be removed to the Danube River. The Kara Ateist from the Turkish Health Council said that the test that has purchased Turkey's "high-level" and they don't "use it".Inghily Raya purchase 3,5 million tools from Ticka, but at the beginning of April 2020, they announced that the instrument could not be used.
Testing, followed by the carаніans of people who are the most positive and speaking to people who have a positive SARS-CoV-2, gives a positive end.
The first death site of COVID-19 in Italy, a study in Vò Italy, made two tests in the whole population of 3,400 people, with about 10 days.
About half of the positive ones have no phenomenon, and all the cases found in the karantina.
With the extent of the trip to the community, the new infections were discovered at the same time.
With aggressive contacts, travel payment, testing, and karantina, the corenavirus 2020 in Singapore, are increasingly slower than other countries without extreme restraints, such as the expansion of the restaurant and the ritel company.
Many events were denied, and Singapore recommended the people to stay at home on March 28, but schools were reopened right after the release on March 23.
Some other countries also have pandemics with aggressive contacts, travels, tests, and karantinas, but with non - aggressive areas such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistics found that more states are tested, relative to the number of death, have a less lower case fatality, perhaps because these countries are more able to determine those who have a smooth or without anxiety.
WHO recommends that countries who have no test capacity, and national laboratory with limited COVID-19 experience, send five positive samples of COVID-19 and ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO laboratorys to confirm the test.
From 16 laboratorys, 7 were in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the next quarter, the “Positive testing” column is influenced by the testing rules of the country.
The country that is only tested in the hospital home will have a higher rate of positive results than all of the people who are testing, or they show the same spectrum or not.
Put your hands, also called cleaning hands, is the action of purifying someone’s hands that aims to eliminate skins, oil, microorgans, or other unwanted ceremonies.
Push hands with skin consistently on a particular "critical situation" throughout the day prevent many diseases, such as diarrea and colera, which are sent through fatal routes.
They can also be cut to breathing diseases, such as influenza or seal, if they do not cut their hands before touching their eyes, necks, or mouths.
Five of the critical day in which it is very important to clean the hands with the skin is: before and after a large cut of water, after cleaning the pocket or replaceing the pocket, before kids, before eating, and before and aftering preparing food, or feeding meat, fish, or swallowing.
If there is no water and salt, the hands can be cleaned with a skin. World Health Organization recommends cleaning the hands:
Before, when, and after preparing food.
Before and after visiting the sick people.
After replacement or cleaning the children, they are just using the toilet.
After cleaning nest, stone, or skin.
After touching animals, animals, or animals.
Medical cleanness involves cleaning practices related to medical processes.
Put your hands before giving medications or medical nurses can prevent or reduce the preaching of disease.
Main medical goals cleaning the hands are cleaning the hands of pathogen (bacteria, virus, or other microorgans that can cause disease) and chemical materials that can cause danger or disease.
This is especially important for those who care for food or work in medical fields, but also for the public.
Pushing hands have a lot of benefits of health, including minimising the influenza preaching, heart virus and other menu diseases; preventing deterioration of diarrea; reduce breathing infections;
and reduce the number of children's mortality in the house.
The 2013 study shows that the improvement of practical cleaning of the hands can make a little increase in the increase of balita children.
In developing countries, the mortality of children resulting in breast diseases and diarrees can be reduced by identifying simplicity of behavior, such as cleaning their hands with skin.
This simplicity can reduce mortality rates to almost 50 percent.
The intervention that encourages the hands can reduce the case of dialects around them; this intervention can be done by providing clean water in the low - control area.
48% of the case of diare can be related to the hands of the skin. Put the hands with the pigs is the only way the most effective and worthy to prevent the diare and infection of the acute breathing (ISPA), as a way under which the house, school, and community in the world is done.
Pneumion, which is the main ISPA, is the cause of a number of deaths of balita children; this disease causes about 1,8 million children a year.
Diare and pneumonia caused almost 3,5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, make the hands with a skin before eating and after using the tuberculosis, the earthly habit can save more vital or any medical action, and reduce the death caused by diarree to almost half of it and death resulting in the acute respiratory infections to the fourth century.
Bringing hands are usually connected with other health action as part of the water program, sanitation, and cleanness (WASH).
Put your hands also protect themselves from the impetigo that is sent directly through physical contacts.
Small effects cleaning the hands are a cleaning of hands that often can cause skin damage.
The study carried out in 2012 in Denmark found that the cleaning of the hands more can cause the skin and skin condition, which is known as hand exams or demativity, which are mostly in the health officers.
Bringing the hand too often appears as one of the obsessive-compliant gangs (OCD).
There are five critical occasions every day when the hands of the skin are important to reduce illness by fatal, namely: Before and after the use of tuberculosis (small water, small water disappear), after cleaning the child (pook) before the child, before eating and/or preparing food, or preparing meat, fish, or swallowing.
Another important time to apply technically cleaning the right hands of preventing sickness is before and afterward to take care of illness; after smells, stones, or snakes; after touching animals or treating animals; and after touching skin.
In many countries, the level of swimming hands is still low.
A study on the cleaning of hands in 54 countries in 2015 found that 38.7% of the household swimming hands with salt. A 2014 study shows that Saudi Arab has the highest level with 97%; the United States almost in the midst of 77%; and the Tskong at the highest level with 23%. Now there are some methods of change in conduct to improve the adoption of the conduct of the behaviour in the critical time. The groups of students are one option in the country of the developing countries to enhance the cost of children.
The Fundamental Health Programme of the Department of Education in the Philippians is an example of the ability to support child health and education.
The use of skin drugs twice a year, added by cleaning the hands every day with sands and connecting teeth every day with fluoride, is the title of this national program.
This program was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The use of microorgans of skin is forced with salt or detergence in water.
The main work of skins and detergenes is a reduction in the swimming and enhanced power.
The water is only unefficiently skin manufacturing because of milk and protein, which is organic cotton components, is not easy to cut in water.
Indeed, milk and protein smells are helped by sufficient waterlines.
The skin, because its qualities can be used back, may be able to contain the bacteria available from the previous use of the bacteria.
A small number of studies that investigate the bacteria’s movement of skin skins into contamination found that movement could not happen because bacteria is slowly swimming.
However, the CDC continues to say "the thickness of its expense from the face without being cut into the hands more pleasing."
Anti-Backs are strike to healthy communities in great way.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of antiseptics or infections that are better recommended for antibiotic organisms in nature.
Nevertheless, anti - baker samples include general anti - baker agents such as triclus, which have a list of strain organisms with large detention.
So, even though antibiotic strains are not affected by antibacteria, this skin may not be sequently placed.
Besides the surface and the skin protein, the formulation that can contain assam (assets, asylum, meat assets, pH) as pH, aasi with active antimicrobics, and more skin conditioning ( vitamin, skin, smell, extracts, green).For comparable analysis of the Massive Health Facility of the Oregon University of Oregon, it is the only effect of its effective sample with high temperatures of consumption in which weighs withvolving tensions of diseases and cleaning bacteris from hands.
Hot water to clean your hands is not enough to kill bacteria.
bacteria grows faster on the body temperature (37 °C).
The warming water is more effective than the cold water in extinction of natural oil that holds cows and bacteria.
However, after many, scientific studies show that the use of warm water does not have effects in decreasing the number of microbials in their hands.
Hand - or anti - sceptics is a cleaning agent that is not based on water.
In the end of the 1990s and beginning of the 21th century, the purification agency of the hands of alcoholic smokers that are not based on water (which was also shocked with the hands of alcohol, antiseptic hands, or hands slaughter) began to be known.
Most of these cleaning agencys are based on alcohol or ethanol isopropyl, which are formed together with an intelligence such as Carbomer (acrilate polymer) into gele or with skins like gliserin, to make it sweet or sweet so that they can be used and to reduce the effects of alcohol reducing.
Mass hydrogen production enhance more antimicrobial activity, which contain at least 60-95% of alcohol is an efficiency killer.
Alcohol testing killed bacteria, random bacteria against many drugs (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis bacteria, number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccination, influenza, and hepatitis).
Alcohol testing which contains 70% alcohol died 99.97% (log 3.5%, similar to 35 decibel) bacteria is 30 seconds after the depression and 99.99% to 99.999% (log 4 to 5) bacteria in the hand of 1 minute after the manufacture.
The analysis of the hands of alcohol is almost not effective to the type of norovirus (or Norwalk), the most common cause for the menu gastroenteritis. Hand antiseptics or alcohol smokers in the number must be used to break or close two hands completely.
The front and the back of two hands and the hands on the eye and the distance of all the fingers were shocked around 30 seconds until the light, the bus, or the ring glass.
The U.S. Disease and Protection Center also recommends that the hands of the shock hands, especially when the hands are shocked.
Increased the use of an intelligence agency because the use of rapid use and killing activities against microorganisms, however, it should not be used as the right hand cut, except the skin and water.
Hand-based alcohol use can often cause skin skin skins, except if emolines and/or skin causes are added to the form.
Reducing effects from alcohol can be reduced or avoided by adding gliserin and/or other emolines to the formula.
In clinical tests, alcohol - based analysis with emolines makes iritation and skin violence far lower than skin and antimicrobic deterioration.
Alergy contacts, urtic symptoms, or hypersensitiveness against alcohol or additive sects occur in dilute alcohol.
The lower delimitation causes contact delimitation that smells to be the power of this product is compared to cleaning your hands with water and skins.
Although effective, non-air agents are not cleaning their hands from organic material, but just disinfecting it.
For this reason, it is not possible to swim and water in preventing many pathogens of the preaching work because the pathogens are still in their hands.
The use of alcoholic use of the free arms depends on its materials and forms, and according to historical history, this product is significantly worse than alcohol and alcohol.
Recently, the formulation that uses clorid benzalconium has a continuous and cumulative antimicrobatic activity, not like alcohol, which has been decreased after the renewed use, maybe because of the reaction of progressive effects.
Many of the communities are lowly able to purchase a skin and use a skin or a land as a place for them.
Abu or land may be more effective than just water, but less effective than skin.
One of the concerns is, if contamination with microorganisms, land or abu may increase the care of natural diseases.
Like skin, the abu is also a desinfect agent because, if water contacts, the snake will form an alkalin fluctuation.
WHO recommends a skin and a snake as an alternative when the skin is not available.
Technology cleanss the right hands based on the recommendation of the United States Diseases Control Center for prevention of diseases includes the following steps:
Hands with heat or cold water.
Water flows recommended because it could be contaminated, while the temperature of water seems to be unlikely.
Take a hand with a lot of skins, including the hands, the fingers, and under the skins.
The saun sets a skin from the skin, and the study shows that the skin cleans the hands more accurately when he uses a skin than when he uses only water.
Gook at least 20 seconds.
A shock of creating a skin, which helps to remove the skins from the skins, and to smell more than a long time.
If it is exactly under the water, it will be slow.
Rounding inside the basket can make the hands of contamination back.
Slide with sweet bones or let me swallow in the air.
The low and low arms are more contaminated, and the swimming distances are shocks, hands, zones between fingers, and under the shoes.
Cows and cups that are missing can store micro organisms.
Losion is often recommended to keep the hands off; skin skin can cause skin disaster that can increase the risk of infection.
A number of lower costs can be made to facilitate the cleaning of hands when water and/or salt is not available, for example, driving water from giards or bottles which are depending on and swimming and/or using a skin, if necessary, in the developing countries. In the situation where the water is limited (e.g. school or the area of the developing countries), there are a heavy water solution, such as "types" and other lower costs.
The typical type is simple technology that uses water bottles depending on the skin, the parents operated by the feet to bring some water into the hand, and the snake.
Effective handing is an important part of the process of hand cleaning, but there is a debate on the most effective form of handling in the public toilet.
More research shows that the card was far cleaner than the electrical hands found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study carried out by Westminster University, London, and has been provided by the European Tisue Symposium card industry, to compare the level of card cleaning, heating aircraft, and more modern aircraft.
After cleaning and shrinking hands with heat air, the total number of bacteria was found increased in 194% in the finger books and 254% in the hand screen.
Rating with Jet aircraft causes the total number of bacteria to 42% in the finger books and 15% in the hand screens.
After pulling and cutting hands with the card, the total number of bacteria increases 76% in the finger books and 77% in the hand screen.There are also testing to determine the potential of milk contamination for other tuberculous users and the toilet environment because of each type of relief methods.
Jet aircraft, which slows air from units with speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), can switch a microorgan from hands and units and enable other tube users and toilet environments to up to 2 m.
The use of warm aircraft distributes microorgans up to 0.25 meters from the ring.
In 2005, in the study carried out by TÜV product and environment, various methods of evaluation of the handling.
After handling, the following bacteria changed:
There are many handing manufacturers, and the handing has been compared with the relief using the cards.
Bringing hands using the hands of the hands is an alternative during driving if there is no salt and water.
Alcohol testing should contain at least 60% of alcohol.
Medical treatment was long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis found its effect (1846) in preventing hospital disease.
There is an electronic device that provides backwards to remember hospital workers to clean their hands if they forgot.
One study found that the infectious level decreased with the use of the device.
Medical hands are performed at least 15 seconds by using salt and water in many or glass to assemble and cut each side of the hands.
The arm must be shocked with the fingers each other.
If there's a shooting under the shoes, the skin can be used to avoid it.
Because the smell can keep in the water that is in the hands, the hands need to be spent with accurately and swept with clean powder.
After the ring, the card was used to switch because of the water (and open the door if needed).
This avoids the hand-contamination of the surface.
The aim of cleaning the hands in health care is to avoid the microorganization of pathogenes and to avoid the abuse of it.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the poorly burned hands still on a level that could not be accepted in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses continue to forget to cut their hands before touching the patient to derogate microorganisms.
One study shows that cleaning the right and simple hands of the other simple processes can reduce the level of blood infection to 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a picture that shows the standards of hands and hands in the health sector.
WHO’s main cleaning concepts can also be found on its website for public comments.
Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can correct and correct hand cleaning if the validity of the rules is needed.
World Health Organization has five times to clean the hands:
After packing into body blood/heating
before aseptic task, and
After the patient's treatment. Advancement of anti-septic chemicals to the pig (any" drug "animicroba" or "animicroba") functions to kill handsome materials.
The function may be shocked before the slaughter or in situations when the antibiotic guards are very slow. In order to shoot the hands before the stroke operation, it requires because it is possible to be locked and dissolved without touching, clorhexin or yodium cleaning, steril switch to reduce the hand after cleaning, and steril to switch and other steril instructions to clean under my mine.
All the clusters have to be released.
This process puts the hands and arms down to the smoke, usually 2 to 6 minutes.
It's not necessary for a long time of cutting 10 minutes.
When it comes, water in the hands must be shocked to not flow back to the hands.
After the finishing hands, the hands were buried with a steriled bone and a sleeve snake.
In order to reduce the grain of the preaching work, it will be better to clean your hands or to use the career before and after the treatment of illnesses.
For the control of stafilokocus infections in the hospital, it was found that the greatest benefits of cleaning hands are of 20 percent of the first cleaning, and that additional benefits were very few when handing frequencies are increased over 35 percent.
Bringing with a common sugar affects more than three times the infection of infected diseases to food than the cuts with antibacteria. Returning between the hands of the alcohol base and cleaning the hands with the antibacteria with the median 30 seconds shows that alcohol skins reduced 26% more than the anti-bacteria.
However, pigs and waters more effective than alcoholic hands to reduce the influenza of A H1N1 and difficult Clostridium influenza from hands. Intervention to enhance the cleaning of hands in health care can include education for the staf on cleaning the hands, increased the use of alcohol based, and written warnings and lyrics to the staf.
More studies have been conducted to know the most effective interventions in various health care statistics.
In developing countries, wearing hands with skin was acknowledged as a precise way to achieve good health and even good nutrition.
However, at least the water supply that can be handled, salt, or facility in the households, schools, and workplaces makes it possible to achieve the universal skin behavior of the hands.
For example, most of the African regions, since their hands are near the private toilet or the public toilet, although there are options available to make a wise hands.
Indeed, the weakness of the hands can also happen because of a swimming habit, not because there is little skin or water.
Promotions and encouragement to clean your hands with a swimming snake can affect the rule, enhance the benefits of the hands, and make changes in the conduct of long - term population.
In order to walk effectively, control and evaluation need.
Systemic experiences against 70 studies found that the effective community approach to the improvement of the LMIC's hands, while the social income campaign is unefficient. One example of school-sharing hands is "Third Stars" by UNICEF that encourages the University to take simple and valid steps to ensure students to clean their hands with sauna, between other sanitations.
When the minimum standards arrive, the school can move from one star to three stars.
Construction of handsome places can be part of the workshop of hands that use reduce children’s diseases and deaths.
Another example of the improvement of the emergency campaign that tries to achieve the purpose of change of behavior. 2019-2020, UNICEF encouraging the sweet emotions of the hands.
Some studies investigate the cost effects of totally cleaning the hands in developing countries with the prevention of Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) or a lost year.
One triumph shows that encouraging the hands with salt, significantly higher costs of water and other sanitation.
It's the importance of pulling the hands for human health, especially for people in a retail situation, such as the new mother born or soldiers in the hospital, first known in the midst of the 19th century by two hand sanitation ports: Dr. Hungary Ignaz Semmelweis working in Wina, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, "weapon-modern care" in England.
At that time, many still believe that infections are caused by a mixed mixture or a bad air.
In the 1980s, a change through food and infections related to health care makes the United States Control and Prevention Centre more actively emphasis on the cleaning of hands as an important way to prevent infection.
In 2009 and COVID-19 pandemics in 2020 increased the emergency in many countries, it would be important to cut their hands with a skin to protect themselves from this menu disease.
For example, the "technical cleaning the right hands" is depending on the side of the hands in the public toilet and on the toilet of offices and airports in Germany.
The expression "Clearn the hands of something" means to say that someone's counterparts are responsible for something or involved in something.
The explanation comes from the chapter of the Bible in Matthew, when Pontius Pilatus cleaned his hands on the decision to engage Jesus Christ, but he has become an explanatory expression in the British community.
In Shakespeare’s work, Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to pursue his hands to pursue the implanter nodes; the act that shows his fault about the crime that he did and because he has told his husband to do so.
It has also been known that after remembering or mediting on unrelated acts, the smells are more often cleaning their hands and smelling the instruments of cleaning their hands.
Furthermore, those who were allowed to clean the hands after that meditation have smaller opportunities involved in compensation that "lifts", like being volunteer.
The religion commands the purification of hands to the purpose of purifying and symbolism, the copper of the hands, which uses water, but without snake to clean the hands, is a ritual part of the hands cleaned in many religions, including the Bahá'i'i, Hindu, sweet and the native are in Jews, the Lavabo in Christians, and Wudhu in Islam.
The Gentiles, the Jews, and the Islamite pronounced their hands after using the toilet.
In addition, Hindu, Buddhism, Sikh, Jews, and Islam imposed their hands before and after dinner.
Labour danger control for COVID19
Labour risk control for COVID-19 is the health and health methodology for controlling the dangers of cardiac disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The right dangeral management in the workplace depends on the location of work and jobs, based on the risk assessment of the stock source, the level of disease in the community, and the risk factors of each employee that may have been higher COVID-19.
According to the AS Work Safety and Health (OSHA), the work of low-risk work has a minimum contact with the public and other working partners; for this work, it is encouraged to prevent basic infections, including cutting hands, to move employees to live at home if hospital, ethics of breathing, and to conduct training and environmental infections routinely.
The risk of smuggling work includes work that requires close contacts or often with unknown persons, or are expected to suffer COVID-19, but may be infected because of disadvantages in the community that are on or international journeys.
This includes workers who have contact with the public community such as schools, the environment of work with high popularity, and high volume rites.
The dangeral management of this group, except the basic infection prevention steps, includes windows using high-efficiency air rings, safeguarding against the farm, and provide self-protection tools when meeting COVID 19.
OSHA considers the health and body power of people known or expected to suffer high-risk of COVID-19, which increases the risk of high-risk when workers make a aerosol accommodation process, or take or handle specifics of those known or inevitably suffering COVID-19.
The risk management of this worker includes technical controls, such as ventilation pressure space, and self - protection tools that are appropriate to work.
COVID-19 may have a number of disappointments in the workplace.
Workers may not come to work because of sickness, need to care for others, or fear of the possibility of swallowing.
Trade patterns can change, well in matters that are requested or in ways of obtaining these things (e.g. expenditure out of the busy hours, through driving or floor).
Finally, the transfer of materials from the extremely affected geographical region of COVID-19 can be deteriorated, and infected disease reverse plans can be used to manage protective action.
The plan considers the risk levels related to various jobs and jobs, including funds, risk factors of house and society, and risk factors of each employee, such as old age or chronic medical condition.
The article also provides the necessary arrangements to address the risks and the urgent plans for situations that may be caused as a result of the wealth.
The responsibilities and the plans of victory of diseases may be supported by national or subnational recommendations.
The goal of wealth adverse includes reducing the deterioration among the staf, protecting people who are higher risks for bad health complications, maintaining business operations, and miniming bad effects on other entities in the tax.
The rate of risk of sickness in business communities affects the adverse action.
Girarki’s dangeral control is a lot of jobs used in health and health of work to defeat danger controls based on its effects.
When the risk of COVID-19 could not be able to avoid, the most effective management is the technical controller, the administrative management, and the last self-defence tool.
Technical regulations include isolation of workers from related dangers of work without depending on the conduct of workers and may be the most heavy solution to apply.
Administrative arrangements are changes in the rules or processes of work that requires workers or employees.
Autoprotection tools (APD) are considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but can help avoid parts of the board.
All types of APD should be chosen based on dangers on workers, which are placed properly as (e.g., breather), be covered with consistent and right, checked, careed, and instead of time, if necessary, and disappeared, cleaned, and stored in right or removed to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Health and Work Safety (OSHA) Administration, low - risk work has a minimum job contact with public and other working partners.
The basic prevention steps that are recommended for all places of work are often cleaning the hands, stimulating workers to live in a home where hospital, and if the monitoring includes covering stones and gardens, providing networks and swifts, preparing jobs from far or work with the time of coming/decimal, if necessary, telling the workers to not use the tools and instruments of others, and making routinely working and environmental infections.
Quick and isolated identification against potential persons is an important step in protecting workers, employees, visitors, and others in the workplace.
Center for Diseases and Protection (CDC) AS recommends that workers who have an emergency illness have to live at home until they are free of heat, warm signs, and other experiences during at least 24 hours without using soft oil or other drought drugs, and to ensure that illnesses are able to live at home to care for hospital members, and to know this rules.
According to OSHA, the risk of shipment is included work that requires close contact or often in six feet (15.8 meters) with people who are not known or who are expected to suffer COVID-19, but may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 because of the distortion in the community around business location, or because a new person is making international journeys to the extensive COVID switch.
The workshops include contact with the public community such as school, environment with high-population and high-level rationality. Technology for this group and high-risk group include the high-risk filtering of high-efficiency filtering, improvement of ventilation levels, physics deployment such as guarding, and establishing drive-thru or shipping windows for the server service. Administrative purpose for this group and group high-risk group includes high-ranking employers who live in the house, switch up with virtual communications, make up workers with time/developers, interviews, interviews of the technicians of the expertise of the technicians and researchers of the U.S.A.S.A.S.A.A.
Workers in this group of risks need respiratory.
If someone falls ill in the flight, the right control to protect workers and other travellers includes separating ones from another with six feet, showing one cabinet to care for the sick person, and offering a face mask for the sick person, or requesting him to shut his mouth and neck when stones or smells.
Canadians must hold medical skins once they are driving ill or touching the body’s weight or the surface that can be contaminated and may be the other protector tools if the ill-feeding smells suffer, the continuous stone, or the difficulties of breathe.
Hands and other materials should be removed into the lively dangers box, and contaminated surfaces must be cleaned and swepted after it. For commercial ships, including ships and other travel ships, the dangers of control include traveling if sick, isolating themselves, and informing medical centers on ships immediately if someone has a shock or other shock when it is on the ship.
Ideally, further medical care is made in the kitchen that is isolated, depending on the service in the community, for the school and for the child’s education facility, the CDC recommends the decree of cutting or medication if the infected person has been in the school building.
If there are distortions in the community at the minimum level until it is possible to apply social reliefs, including: cancelling field visits, meetings, and other large groups, such as physical education, sound class, or eating in cafeteria, increased the speed between tables, time coming and slowly, restricting non-experienceal health offices, and use separate places for children with similar flu.
If there are high wages in local society, along with social relief strategies, can be considered for school deployment, for law enforcement officials who do daily routine activities, the risk of health is directly lowered by CDC.
The law enforcement officer who should contact persons with confirmed persons or otherwise COVID-19 is recommended to follow the same instruction with urgent medical technology, including using appropriate self-protecting tools.
When close contacts occur during the arrest, the employee must clean and dissolve swimming and swallowing tasks before returning to use by using a swallowing or a householder, and follow the standard operating process to control, defeat, and to control and closure the swallowing smells.
OSHA considers health energy and certain body rooms are at high levels of risks or higher levels.
High-risk work includes health, support, laboratory, and medical transport powers that are equipped with a known patients or are COVID19.
This work is a very high risk of age when workers make a aerosol acquirement process, or take or handle special specimens from, known patients or COVID-19.
Aerosol accommodation processes include intubations, stone industrial processes, bronkoscopi, several processes and dental examinations, or invasive sperms.
The body work of the high-ranking room includes workers involved in preparing a body known or in the case of COVID-19 at death; this work is very high when workers make autopsis. Additional technical arrangements for this risk group include isolation room for a known patients or other than COVID-19, including when aerosol accommodation process is done.
Special negative pressure windows may be appropriate in some health care and body rooms.
Spesimen should be addressed to the prevention of the Biological Safety Level 3.
World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the patients who come to separate in different waiting rooms are based on their cases of COVID-19. In addition to other APD, OSHA recommends breather for persons who are working in 6 feet from aware or otherwise infections of SARS-CoV-2, and those who do aerosol accommodation process.
In the United States, the N95 filtering respirator, which is agreed to NIOSH or which is better used in the context of the written and comprehensive care programme, including tests of adjustment, training and medical investigation.
Another type of respiratory can provide greater protection and increase the health of workers. WHO does not recommend the totally closed skin or copperal because COVID-19 is breathing disease and is not shocked through the body.
WHO only recommends a scratch mask for the scripting officers on the incoming point.
For those who take care, care, or treat COVID-19 patients without aerosol processing, WHO recommends a heavy mask, guards, or faces, skins, and hands.
If aerosol accommodation processes are performed, heavy mask is replaced by N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Remember that APD non-compliance in the world, WHO recommended to minimise APD ' s needs through long-term medical services, physicians like discharge windows, with only those who are involved directly in the medical care can enter the rooms of COVID-19 patients, using only APDs that are required for specific tasks, continue to use the same breather without driving with many patients with the same diagnosis, enhancing and coordinating the APD passion, and not encouraging the use of mass for people without gender.

[Covid19] Remember the burdens and prepare the future
TANGGAL/WATE: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LISENSI: CC0: No right protected
We find ourselves in a wonderful situation this month.
COVID-19 epidemic is what makes clearly the global human relations and the responsibilities we have each other.
We have never experienced its challenges, but we know that our best response depends on the form of empatia, the same work, and the construction of the global community, which is the heart of this organization.
A friendship and concern that we have witnessed in all the workshops through emails, calls, and abroads is a extraordinary validity of the outstanding humans, which we have been very lucky, to work with them.
Thank you and my pride could not be able to call you as a work partner.
Last week, someone shared my appreciation for our work.
They recall me how important it is for the world today to access Wikipedia and how strong this is for this important source to remain online for all people.
Your job allows this to happen, so you can make sure this site remains walking, help our friends pay, or help to keep our community security.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, especially today.
That's the moment when not only the work we're doing, but how we do, it's going to make anxiety to the world.
Because the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some important changes about how we work together, which will start next week.
Adjustment to our work and office
Like Robyn previously, the teams met last night to discuss our approaches and checks for a few days and months in front.
In that conversation, we discussed what we think is the right answer to the challenges we've faced and the best way to keep the organisation's continues in the past.
We want to avoid pressure and support our mission for long - term degrees.
If you need to reduce the labour, it's okay.
For all staffs, contractors, and contract workers:
Our daily work is about 4 hours every day, or 20 hours a week, until further information.
We don't set a free day, if you can work more at normal hours, this mission needs you.
However, the world cannot be predicted today, and you need to take care of the loved ones, the cost of the need, or go to the doctor, your peace is our priority.
We didn't take your job time.
If you're sick, don't work.
This should not be said, but we said it.
Unnecessary sickness or PTO can not be necessary, well know your manager and help your team to revise your calendars and fields to ensure the main work areas that can be resolved.
(If you are positively diagnosed with COVID-19, hope to know Bryan in T & C Options so that T&C can help you with support and ensure that your situation can be careful of your management.)
The strict partners who are based on the hour will be paid full.
We told it, and again, to respect our committee to the contractor partners and staf based on hours.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their work hours when normal.
This includes if you are sick and can’t work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many use the work as a way to strive toward the world around us.
The work we're doing can give much satisfaction, especially in these times.
Again, what is especially your own care.
Our request is you're communicating with your manager so that we know what to expect and can take appropriate action.
Some workers are considered essential.
There are some jobs to continue walking.
SRE, SDM Operation, Reliability & Security, and Danish Departure team, among others, make important jobs that may need further support.
We're going to start the process with all departments to evaluate this goal and to discuss our focus to support the most important things for our mission.
There's a lot to do for all of us, we'll only focus on the most exensive project.
The late moment will be nothing for the future.
We're not planning to follow the defect after this pandemic.
You will not be expected to work pleasantly to fill the time that is now unrealistic.
We realize that the situation changes and will try to set up a new target and time line if needed.
What about the APP (year plan)?
To adjust with the new realities and the spectrum of daily working hours, we intended to adjust time line for the 2020-2021 Yearbook Implementation.
We mean, to examine the length of the 2019-2020 plan, which allows more time to make a precision so that workers can priorize important jobs, self-supports, and cardiac nurses by communicating them that they need or want to work with the workshop more than a few weeks before.
This time line is very reduced by the work and the pressure of plans in the whole organization.
We will give our proposal to the next weekly Board and update the delegations and the team at the next step, soon after we got confirmed.
Thank you for your leadership in this matter.
Status, pages and offices
Last week, we've been told that one of our partners based on SF may have paid COVID-19.
However, as we were very concerned, we worked with antivirus manufacturer to disinfect all the surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They use antivirus fluid in the hospital to infect all surfaces, lobi and all lifts that can access our floor.
The buildings apply the protocol of recognition of their own salvation by using product that supports the salvation of the supervisor.
We were glad that the office would be ready to use when we decided to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which has shared the COVID-19 protocol to us and all the staf members based on the DC.
In the past week, our DC office has moved to the far - full work station, along with the board shared with San Francisco.
As we were known by some of our friends based in NYC, we were also talking about how we were going to be located in Brooklyn.
This debate still continues, but it may be struck.
Some of our partners work far away for the first time.
Our partners who have been working long ago realize that it may be necessary to adjust, and they want to give you suggestions:
Basement of the longest room for one or two hours.
If a longer session is needed, consider how to share it into a few days.
Define a clear partnership, a agenda, and send the previous publications.
Make videos as default, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate cooperation and connect directly.
The leadership to facilitate each other, a person to ask for questions and to record a conversation list, and someone to help make a contact record (or make a collaborative recording).
Send e-mail to technical support if you need a comfortable header.
Use your peace compensation to buy small food.
Join #remoties in Slack to talk to a partner about the shared job.
SDM Operation team is looking for a web-based ergonomic owner for supporting the improvement of the job distributed throughout the Yasa.
Last week, we requested all the communities' currency funds to abolish the public chair, such as Edit-a-thon, until WHO declared the pandemic ended.
We told them that we understood our requests for restraint and other distortions can make them impossible to complete the activities of the channels agreed and that no one would be given to be discovered because it should be taken or edited.
The next week, we will continue with further comments on the Wikipedia and the regional and the other thematic conferences.
In general, the shadows of the whole global community seem to be a deterioration in the results of this angry, but somewhat are able to focus on the explanation and ability to focus on their own communities, such as Wikimedia and others.
On the other hand, the CRT is trying to prepare pages at Meta-Wiki to provide room for communities to shut up and follow our communication with them.
Keep connected during the COVID situation19
We'll send an invitation to your calendar to the Mis at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for special stage.
We will use this time to share additional payments, answer your questions, and get time to connect each other.
We're in this situation together and we want to help our best.
During that time, you can continue to get information from this email and all the extensive information related to COVID-19 in the Wikipedia Office.
CRT will continue to update this page and ensure all information is on one place.
We also tried to keep the routine communication with the staf living in countries that are now encountered significantly.
If you have questions about your travel, academy, main work, or difficulties about the shipping, or others that may need help, do not wonder to tell you and work together with the CRT.
We've been here to help provide support and become contacted according to the needs.
If you have secret or sensitive problems, please send e-mail to Bryan Judan, Director of Global SDM International Operation.
Do not have any change in our work and responsibilities.
On the contrary, this change is that our work and our obligation may be adjusted in the way we have never done before.
This change is the important steps we're convinced to support each other in this situation so that we can continue to work, provide support for our movement, and provide the world's service.
The work that we planned before will be there waiting for us when the time arrives.
For now, this is the time to support each other and create a room for an important job that will come in a few weeks and may be a few months before.
We need you all to realize it, so we want you to care for yourself and your family so you can work as well as if you need.
Finally, please smell your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and other leader teams (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
b'Enzim angiotensic 2 (ACE2) change is a enzim that is situated on the outer surface of the cells (branching cells) in pulse, artery, heart, ginal, and usus.
ACE2 has an enzyme of angiotensic revision (ACE), which reduces the number of angiotensin-II and increases angiotensic (1-7), which makes it a goal to treat cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also functions as a point in the cell for some cornavirs.
Human ACE2 versions are often called hACE2.
The enzym of angiotensic 2 transference is a metaloenzim containing a ring situated on the surface of the endotel cell and other cells.
Protein ACE2 has M2 peptidase terminal-N domain and domain transporting asam renal-collector terminal-C.
ACE2 is a protein burning a single type of I, with actively enzymized domain on the surface of the cells on the pull and other networks.
ACE2 extrasel domain is separated from the transmise domain by other enzims, known as sheddase, and foreign protein being released into the blood line, and finally is acquired to the urin.
ACE2 is situated in most organs: ACE2 is cut into the blowing cells, especially the alveolar pull cells of type II, the integration of small uses, the endotel and vein cells, and the artery poles in most organs.
MRNA ACE2 expression was also found in the serum cortex, striptum, hypotalamus, and brain barrier.
The ACE2 main function is as ACE designer.
ACE divides angiotensic hormone I as angiotensin II vasoconstrics.
Finally, ACE2 cuts the amino-fenilalanin terminal of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-His-Pro-Phe) and hidrolism as angiotensin (1-7) vasodiilator (H-Asp-Arg -Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also differ a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9] -bradikin, ampin, neurotensin, dinarfin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also sets up and burns the net amino axis SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As transmember protein, ACE2 functions as the main point in the cell for a number of heartnavirs, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-CoV (virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, S1 protein connections with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 enzyms with ACE2-enzyms on the surface of cells affect the endosis and virus translocation and enzyms into the endose in the cell.
This virus income also requires protein S by TMPRSS2 protein series, which is currently investigated as a potential therapy. This makes hypothesis that the increase of ACE2 in cells may help infection.
However, many professional society and regulatory authorities recommend that ACE inhibitors and standard ARB continue therapy.
A systematic and meta-analysis interview, published on 11 July 2012, found that "the use of ACE inhibitors causes a 34% decrease in the risk of pneumonia compared to control."
Furthermore, "the use of ACE inhibitors also reduces the risk of pneumonia to patients who have higher risks for pneumonia, especially stroke patients and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors is also related to the decrease of pneumonia related mortality, although the results are less strong than the entire pneumonia risk."
Human re combination (rhACE2) is expected to be a new therapy for acute pulmonary, and it seems to increase the hemodynamics of pulmonary and oxygen saturation in the powder with a syndrome of acute breasts introduced by lipoplescaride.
The time of rhACE2 in humans about 10 hours with 30 minutes of work except the long (durance) 24 hours.
Some discovery shows that rhACE2 may be promising drugs for patients with intolerance against the classic renal-angiotensin system (CPR inhibitors) or to disease with angiotensic II in the blood surgery. rhACE2 infusion has been evaluated in clinical tests for the symptoms of acute respiratory symptoms.
b'Application of COVID-19 is an application designed for helping contacts to reverse the 2019-2020 heartnavir pandemic, the process identification of people ("context") which may have been connected with infected persons.
Many applications are developed or developed, which are obtained by official government support in some regions and jürishes.
Some workshops to build contact talk applications have developed.
The privacy problems are questioned, especially related to systems based on the location of geographical users.
A alternative that is not too excited of privacy includes the use of the Bluetooth signal to note the nearness of the user with other phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple urged together that they will integrate functionality to support the Bluetooth based application directly into the Android and IOS system.
In Cikong, the Government of the Tibetian government, together with Alipay, has distributed the applications that can the citizens to examine whether they had contacted COVID 19.
This application is used in more than 200 towns of Tikong. In Singapore, it was used for a application called TraceTogether.
This application is developed by the local TI communities, issued as an open source and will be issued to the government.
This application is developed by the Communication and Technology and Health Meeting.
By 14 April 2020, the application is still waiting for the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government states that the contact talk application is in the further development stage and will be available to be distributed in a few weeks. Similar applications are proposed in Ireland and in France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are taking into consideration the application based on TraceTogether Singapura and BlueTrace applications. Russia intended to identify the geofencing applications for patients living in Moscow; this application was designed to ensure that they do not leave their home.
Ross Anderson, Technology of Security at Cambridge University, mentioned a number of practical problems that may occur on the application system, which includes false positives and likely to be less effective if the application data are limited to a smaller population.
In order to address the concerns about the preaching of the "koronavirus" applications that are cut into or dangerous, Apple sets limites to the organizational type that can add related heartnavir applications to App Store, but only limited to "remi" organizations or have a good reputation.
Google and Amazon applied similarly.
Privacy supporters express their concerns about the use of the massive survey using the heartnavirus applications, especially about whether the survey infrastructure that is made to handle the carnavirus pandemic will be stopped after the threat of the start.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have expressed the limitations of such surveys.
This organization declares eight requirements on the government project:
monitors shall be "all laws, need and proportional";
the requirements of the control and supervisory need to have the sun class;
the use of data should be limited to COVID19 purposes;
data security and anonyms must be protected and correctly protected based on evidence;
digital surveys should avoid increasing discrimination and marginalization;
each part of the data with the third side shall be defined in the case of the requests;
must be protected against the abuse and the rights of the citizens to respond to disorders;
Participation means all "me important interests" that include social health and initialization groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters withoutout Borders (RF Reporter) also issued a list of checks.
The Google/Apple plan intended to address the problems of the surveillance continues to be removed by removing the playing mechanism from the device operation after no longer needed.
Some countries use network - based locations, not applications, in order to avoid the ability to download applications and ability to avoid talking.
In Israel, it was accepted by a network.
The solution based on the network that has access to the local data has an significance of a significant privacy problem.
However, not all systems with the center server need to access personal locations; a number of privacy protection systems have been made and have been using the center only for communications (see below).
In South Korea, the unreasoned application system is used to contact.
Instead of using special applications, the system collects information from various sources, includes the data of the playing devices and card transactions, and connects this information to produce knowledge through text message to those who are infected.
In addition to using this information to warn potential contacts, the government also provides information on this location available to the public, which is allowed to change the information privacy laws after the MRS in that country.
This information is available to publicly use a number of applications and websites. The countries like Germany are considered to use the private system that protects the privacy systems.
By 6 April 2020, the details haven't been removed.
Contacts which protect privacy are an already map concept, with a large number of research literatures starting from at least 2013.After 7 April 2020, more than one of the teams operate with private solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record the nearness of users with other phones.
However, PEP-PT is a coordinating efforts that contain centralization and developing approach, and not a single protocol. Developed protocol includes Detail protection of the Developed Privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Separate Contact number (TCN, previously called Contact Name, CEN), Protocol and Privacy Sensitive Sensitive Mechanism for Selective Contacts (PACT), and others.
In this protocol, personal data that can be identified have never left the device, and all triggers have occurred on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab develops SafePaths, platform to use private technologies that protect privacy when gathering and using locations or interconnections to investigate COVID-19.
This is based on the study of the white "Apps Gone Rogue: Personal Privacy maintenance in an epidemic" issued on March 2020.Other way is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company that has developed private technology and its initially established on MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses safe hard technology to allow users to share locations and health data sensitive with other users and administrators without offering the data privacy.
On 5 April 2020, global TCN coalition was established by groups who have the same approach and are a large number of protocols to reduce fragmentation and enable global interoperability for the discussion and warning applications, which is the main aspect of a comprehensive review.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that they had made a BlueTrace protocol used by its official application as an open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, a company managing Android and iOS platforms, urged the initiative to launch contacts, which they will claim to protect privacy, based on the combination of Bluetooth Low Energy and privacy cryptographs.
They also have the specification of the high-technology used in this system.
According to Apple and Google, this system is intended to be started in three stages:
The slaughter to enable the government to make a official corn-virus-protection application that protects privacy
The integration of this function directly to iOS and Android Google and Apple are planned to address data guidance problems and surveys continue to continue to distribute the system through the operating system, then remove it in the same way after the threat.
b'Reposition of medicines (including new purposes, new profile, or new task on medicine or therapy) is the use of drugs that have been agreed for new treatment, as well as for different diseases or medical conditions for the start of the development of drugs.
This route is the course of scientific research that is now being done to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatment.
Another research includes the development of COVID-19 vaccines and convalesen plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 contains around 66 proteins that can be a drug target, each protein has a number of link-related sites.

Remdesivir was made and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola and Marburg Virus infection. Then, Gilead Sciences found that Remdesivir has antiviral activity in vitro against some philoso-, pneumonics, and cornavirs.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is that there is resistance through mutation that can cause more serious diseases and transmissions.
Some early tests show remdecivirs may have high genetic service against resistance. There are some clinical tests that are ongoing, including two clinical tests carried out by the Cleveland University Hospital, assigned one for people with sick disease and one for the sick sick.
There are three clinical tests that are continued for intravenous C vitamins for persons who are careful for skin and COVID-19 heavy pain, cut two plasmas of control (Tiokong, Canada) and one without control (Italia).

b' vitan COVID-19 is hypothetic vaccine against cardiac disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although there is no vaccine that completes clinical tests, there are many efforts to develop the vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, according to WHO, vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, this disease will not be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates are in the April Fase I security study.
COVID-19 was identified on December 2019.
In 2020, the great expansion spread to the whole world, which affects large investment and research activities to develop vaccine.
Many organizations use genome that are published to develop vaccine that may be possible to combat SARS-CoV-2.
In April, the CEPI initiative explains that what is to be observed in the development of vaccines is speed, production capacity, preaching on the needs and global access.
In April, the CEPI research reports that 10 different technology platforms are in research and development during the beginning of 2020 to make effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main goal of the platform to the security study of Fase I, including:
Nuclear assam (DNA and RNA) (developing Fase I and vaccine candidates: Modern, mRNA-1273)
Virus (developing Fase I and vaccine candidates: CanSino Biologicals, vector adenovirus type 5)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, the total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early development stage, with 78 confirmed as an active project (79, according to Milken Institute) and 37 other, but with a few available public information (not being planned or designed).
Uji testing Fase I-II testing security and immunogenity, usually fairly done, plasma control, and in some locations, while determining a better effective dose.
Fase III testing usually includes more pesticides, including control groups, and test vaccine effects to prevent diseases, while increased the effect of the optimal dose.

Some vaccines have theerolog effects, which also called unspecific effects.
That means that these vaccines can benefit from the outdoor disease that they are inflicted.
More uses in Australia tried to follow 4.170 health officers.
There is likely to be vacuum in development that will not be safe or effective.
Initial research to evaluate vaccine's enthusiasm use of specific COVID-19 animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic tissue, other laboratory animals, and non-human primary primary, shows the need to relief steps to reach the biologically savings level 3 in the process of life virus, and international coordination to ensure standard salvation processes.
Vacuum against SARS and MERS has been tested in nonhumanous animal models.
By 2020, there are no drugs or invasions for SARS that are safe and effective to humans.
According to the research issue published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS is the priority for governments and community health in the whole world.
When MERS becomes prevalence, SARS studies that are convincing can be an useful template to develop vaccine and therapy against MERS-CoV infections.
In March 2020, there is one MERS vaccine (based on DNA) which completes the I clinical test on humans, and three other vaccines are in the process, which all are virus vector vaccine, two adenovirus vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts describe the theory of conspiration which declared virus on COVID-19 have previously known and that vaccine has been available.
Patients identified by various social media posts refer to patents that are for genetics and vaccines for other heartnavirs, such as SARS cornavirus.
b'Penyakit cornavir 2019 (COVID-19) is a menu disease due to the syndrome of acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The public experiences include shoes, stones, and snakes.
Other events can include illness, otot, diarree, smooth disease, loss of hate, and skin pain.
The time from shipping up to the slightness of about five days, but it can start from two to four to fourteen days.
Although most of the cases affect the disorders, some developments become a virus pneumonia and the fall of major organs.
By April 17, 2020, more than 2,24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and regions, which affects more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568.000 people have been healed, and this virus is particularly distributed by humans when there is close contacts, often through small divisions or droplets that are produced through stones, skins, or swimming.
Although it is slowly slowly, the droplets are often falling on the ground or on the surface, and they do not slow up to the far.
They can also be infected by touching the contaminated surface and touching their eyes, nests, or mouth.
On the surface, this virus can remain up to 72 hours.
This virus is very decreased for the first three days after the emergency, although the preaching may happen before it appears and after the next disease. The standard diagnosis method is with the reaction of polymerase transcrimination in real time (rRT-PCR) to the use of nasofaring.
The use of mask is encouraged to people who are expected to be viruses and careful for them.
Recommendations on the use of mask by the public society; some authors recommend that not use the mask, part of the recommendation of use, and some other cause the use.
Today, there is no vaccine or specific antivirus treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmissions of disease have been recorded in almost all countries in the WHO six regions.
The virus infected person can be infected without a phenomenon or experience a phenomenon such as flu, such as skin, stone, skin, and breath.
The emergency situation includes breathing, nervous or slowness in the skin that continues, swimming, swimming, swimming, and swimming face or smell; the medical currency is immediately recommended if these events appear.
Successful breastfeeding, such as sweet, angry, or smelling pain can be seen, but more slowly happens.
Gastrointestinal events, such as smells, smells, and diarrees, are predominantly in many specimens.
Some of the cases in the first Cyclopedia were only with a painted illness picture and palpicion.
In some people, illness can be developed in pneumonia, insufficient organs, and death.
This time is called incubating time.
The incubation time for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but it can be cut from two to 14 days.
97.5% of the infected persons will experience in 11,5 days of infection.
The role of an unrecognised person in the cure is not completely known; however, early evidence shows that they may contribute to the preaching of the disease.
Today, the proportion of unrecognised infections that are not known and are not identified, with the Corean Control and Prevention Centre (CDC) reports that 20 percent of all cases have been confirmed remaining unexpected during the hospital care.
The Cikong National Health Committee began to join cases in the event of 1 April; from 166 infections on that day, 130 cases (78%) did not show an event during the test.
Sputums and wild waters can bring muscles of virus in a large scale.
Speaking with slowly frees more divisions or droplets than normally speaking.
A study in Singapore found that the stones that are not covered can lead to cuts up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although this virus isn’t normally bleeding through the air, the United States National Science Academy shows that bioaerosol transmissions may occur and decrease the air that is placed outside the room, people produce a positive sample for the virus RNA.
Some medical processes, such as intubation and pulmonary heart resolve (RJP), can make the breath secret changed into a aerosol and spread through the air.
Although there is anxiety that virus can spread through the fascination, the risk is low, and the risk of the virus is lower, even though the preaching work may happen before the event appears, the risks are low.
The European Disease Center (ECDC) said that although it is not clearly how easy this disease is, one generally infected two to three others. This virus can be kept on the surface for hours until day.
It was found that virus can be detected for one day in cards/cards, until three days on plastic (polypropylen) and cart (ASI 304) and up to 4 hours on fire 99%.
However, this variety depends on the heat and the temperature.
The skin and detergens are also effective if they are used correctly; the skin product depends on the tuberculosis of the virus, deactivates the virus, and releases it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other areas, such as chloric and glucoonic glucoonics, are less effective, in a study in Hong Kong, green water sample was taken in a medium days after the shock began.
In five of six patients, the first sample shows the highest virus load, and six patients show the highest virus load on the second day test.
Coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new weight-related coronavirus coronavirus, which was the first time isolated from three persons with a pneumonia related to the classic case of acute breathing disease in Whan.
All of the SARS-CoV-2 viruss are newly in the heartnavirs of the natural.
In the outside of the human body, the virus was killed by the hot house, which destroyed the safeguards. SARS-CoV-2 is close to the first SARS-CoV.
The powder is the most infected organ of COVID-19 because the virus has access to frozen cells through angiotensic 2 (ACE2) enzyme, which is the most weakest in the alveolar cell type II of pulse.
This virus uses a special glucoprotein surface called "spike or tonjolan" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter a frozen cell.
The acute heart is found in 12 percent of the infected infections in Whan, Tskong, and more often in serious diseases.
High cardiovascular rates because there is a response to system inflammation and immune systems during the development of diseases, but myocard can also be related to ACE2 receptor in heart.
ACE2 receptor has been expressed very high in the heart and involved in the heart function.
Insiden thrombosis (31%) and vein tromboembolics (25%) were found in patients with COVID-19 infections in the ICU and may be related to bad prognosis. Autopsis to people who died because COVID-19 found alveolar difus (DAD) and inflamation inflammation in the powder.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for the respiratory episode that expresss ACE2, COVID-19 patients have a systemic hyperinflation skin.
Specially, T cells that crossed GM-CSF patogenics are completely correlated with monosync controls that increased the IL-6 inflammators and the severe powder patology in COVID patients-19.
Liquid filters have also been reported on autopsis.
WHO has implemented some test protocols for this disease.
The standard test method is the transcription of polymerase transcription back to the real time (rRT-PCR).
These tests are usually performed in the samples of breathing that are allowed by nasopharing; however, the samples of original or smuggling can also be used.
The results are available in a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but two blood samples are taken by two weeks, so that the results have a small time.
Scientists of Tahikong can isolate this heartnavir and resolve its genetic sequence so that the laboratory worldwide can develop a testing of polymerase reaction (PCR) independently to detect infection by this virus.
On 4 April 2020, antibodies tests (which can detect active infection and if someone has previously been infected) are in development, but not much use.
The Cyclopedia experience shows that it was only 60 to 70 percent.
FDA in the United States approve the first point-of-care test on 21 March 2020 to be used at the end of the month. The diagnosis of the Hospital Zhongnan University Whan recommended the methods to detect infection based on clinical images and epidemic risks.
Multilobar multilobar plural options with the distribution of perifer, asimetris, and later many were found at the beginning of infection.
Subpleural domination, crazy paving (related lobular seed with alveoleal variation), and consolidation may appear to a degree of disease development.
A few data are available on microscope leaks and COVID-19 pathocyology.
The main pathology experience on autopsis is:
Macroscopi: plouration, perikardites, pulmonary consolidation, and pulmonary edema
Four types of virus pneumonia can be observed:
Refrigerator pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumonia pneumonia, big atypic pneumonia, interstitutional inflamation with lymphosistic infiltration, and generating a lot of bicycle cells
Heavy pneumonia: alveolar difused (DAD) with alveolar exhibition.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and heavy hypothemia.
He is a prominent tub in the health rate: food exported on the alveolar wheat and interstitial flowers of pulmonar fibrosis
Deceiving intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoiretroblastic reaction
Prevention steps to reduce the possibility of infection include in the houses, avoid many places, often cut the hands with the skin and water at least 20 seconds, impair good breathing hygiene, and avoid touching the eyes, skin, or mouth with unclean hands.
CDC recommends to close the mouth and nest with a tissue when stones or skins and recommend the use of part in the pocket if not available.
Hygiene’s hands corresponding after stones or snakes are encouraged.
CDC recommends the use of skins from public places, partly to restrict the distortion of people without gender. Social dispensation strategy is intended to reduce contacts with many people, with the way to shut schools and jobs, circumcising the journeys, and deleting large meetings in public places.
The swimming farm includes at least 6 feet or 1,8 m.
There are no drugs known that prevent COVID-19.After vaccine is not available until the beginning of 2021, the main part of COVID-19 treatment is trying to reduce the epidemic height, known as "Curva".
CDC also recommends that people often clean their hands with skin and water during at least 20 seconds, especially after the toilet or when the hands appear to be smooth, before eating, and after heating, stone, or drinking.
More CDC also recommends using hand-based alcoholics containing at least 60% of alcohol, but only when salt and water are not available. In the unnecessary trade hands area, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In this formula, antimicroba activity originates from etanol or isopropanol.
The massage hydrogen used to help switch bacteria in alcohol; this is "make active vessel for hand-sepsis."
Gliserol was added as a smooth.
People are treated with support, which can include heat therapy, oxygen support, and support other relevant vital organs.
CDC recommends people who hope they're taking a virus to use a simple face mask.
Oxigenity burns extracorporeum (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of breathing failure, but its benefits are still considered.
Surely, life - style and healthy food patterns are recommended to improve immunity.
The WHO and the Commission of the National Health of tsunami have published the recommendations for the treatment of COVID-19 infectious infections.
Intensive and pull careers in the United States have recommended the care of various departments to provide free resources, or IBCC.
By April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
A number of medical powers recommend parasetamol (asetaminofen) more than ibuprofen for the first line.
Prevention should be taken to minimise the risk of virus disruption, especially in health care rates when making processes that can produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
The CDC recommends that this person be placed in the island of Tular-Udara (IIR) in addition to the use of standard prevention, contact prevention, and tumor prevention. CDC recommends the control for the use of self-defence tools during the pandemic.
The tools recommended are: APD, respirator or face mask, eye protector, and medical hands. If available, breather (the face masker) is better.
N95 respirator was agreed to be industrialized, but FDA has authorized this mask to be used on the basis of the Darurat Use Authority (USA).
N95 respirator was designed to protect from air swimming parts like a powder, but the effectiveness of certain biological agencys is not intended to use that is not mentioned in the label.
If the mask is not available, CDC recommends to use the face protection or, as the last effort, its own skip mask.
Most of the COVID-19 cases are not too weak until they need a mechanical or alternative ventilation, but some of the cases are very weak.
The type of breathing support for persons who have unrelated COVID-19 are active for persons who are careful for the fire, and there are evidence that intubation can be avoided with high flows or bipotitive air pressure.
One of these two methods was not known to have the same benefit for those who are critical.
Some doctors would like to continue to use invasive mechanical ventilation when available, because this technique is limited to the aerosol service compared to the higher skin.
Many countries do not have a hospital bed with a swimming capital, which limits the health capacity of the system to handle plot-free numbers of COVID-19 cases so that they need shocks.
A study in the Cikong found that 5% in intensive treatment units, 2.3% need mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In Zikong, about 30 percent of COVID-19 insurers were finally engaged in the ICU.
Mechanical ventilations become more complicated with the syndrome of acute respiration (ARDS) occurred in COVID-19 and oxygen increased.
A ventilator that can do the pressure control mode and high PEEP requires to reduce oxygen flows as well as minimise the risk of pulmonary and related pneumonics.
High PEP may not be available on old ventilators.
Studies on the medication potential started in January 2020 and some antiviral drugs are in clinical tests.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drug development may require time until 2021, some tested drugs are agreed to be used or have been in a further testing level.
Antivirus can be tested by people with serious diseases.
The workshops recommended that the WHO is involved and in the testing of potential effects and safety. FDA has provided temporary authorisation for convalence plasmas as an experimental treatment in the cases of a person is very or threatened.
The plasma convalesen does not perform clinical studies necessary to prove its security and effectiveness for this disease.
In February 2020, Tikong initiated a single application to handle this disease.
User is requested to enter their name and ID number.
This application can identify close contacts using monitor data so that it can detect the risk potential of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If the risk potential is detect, applications are not only recommended by a single card, but also tell local health officers. Available analysis on the phone data, phone medication technology, telephones, and technology used to investigate the infected persons and those in contact with them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed the security office to investigate the telephone data that was expected to be carnavirus.
It was taken to treat the carnatine and protect those who may be contacted with the infected citizens.
Furthermore, in March 2020, German Telekom shared availability of telephone data to the Federal Government of Germany, Robert Koch Institute, in an investigation and prevention of the virus.
Russia uses visional technologies to detect carantians.
Italian Regional Health Commissioner, Julio Gallera, said he was told to know a phone operator that "40% of the people still moved to the place."
Germany’s government did a hackhone in the weekend of 48 hours with over 42.000 peers.
Furthermore, the President of Estonia, Kaljulaid Kerst, makes a global search for creative solutions to the carnavir.
Many may experience pressures in the results of the carantina, travellers, treatment effects, or fears of the infection itself.
BBC tested Rory O'Connor that said, "The improvement of social isolation, sustainability, health concerns, stress and economic perfection is the perfect deterioration of mental health and social health."
This disease can continue with a little or without anxiety, which differs from other public breath diseases, such as pills.
Of course, in two weeks healing cases, while those who suffer serious or critical diseases may need three to six weeks to be curated.
Pregnant women may have higher risks for COVID-19 infections based on similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 are still less.
In the worst person, COVID-19 can rapidly develop the syndrome of acute breathing (ARDS) which causes breathing failure, sectic skin, or massive failure.
Complete COVID-19, including sepsis, abnormal blood collection, and injury to heart, gymnasium, and heart.
Blood conjunction, especially prothrombian increases, is estimated in 6% of COVID-19 patients, while gymnastic functions appear to be 4% of this group.
About 20 to 30 percent of people with COVID-19 showed enzym increases (transaminase).
The same report states that the median time between the events and death is ten days, with five days being spent in the shore.
However, the patient moved to the ICU has a medium - day period between fire and death.
In a study that examined the first cases, the media time started from the beginning until the death was 14 days, with six to 41 days full.
In a study by the National Health Committee (NHC) of Tskong, men have the number of deaths of 2.8 per cent, while women have 1,7 per cent of deaths.
The histopathological improvement of postmortal pulmonary pulmonary phenomenon shows that alveolar disappearance is fusioned by fibromicsoid sujuds in the two pulses.
Changes of virus sites are especially in pneumonia.
Paused images differed from the syndrome by the acute napse (ARDS).
On 11,8% of death reported by the National Health Committee of the tsunami, predominant heart damage, with increased troponine or stopped heart.
According to Maret month data from the United States, 89 per cent of those who are insured have a detrimental condition, and medical and social resources may also affect mortality.
The mortality of the conditions vary because of the difference in the region, but also because of the difficulties of methodology.
The number of deaths may be too high.
However, the fact that death is the results of the past cases may mean that the current mortality is too low.
But Kok has the probability of 1.4 times greater than the serious COVID-19 and about 2.4 times more likely to need intensive treatment or death than those not but.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority has found a decrease of 20% to 30% of the illnesses, and the deterioration of the organs has shown injury.
This can also cause passport syndrome after healing.
In March 2020, it is not known if infections previously provide effective and long-term immunities to people who have been healed from this disease.
Immunity may be used if you see another treatment of cornavirs, but it has been reported that there is a COVID-19-related case that has been followed by a positive cornavir test a few days later.
This case is a worse infection, not a renewed infection.
This virus is expected to be natural and come from animals, through a public infection.
It was not known, but in December 2019, the preaching of the infectious preaching was almost all of the people.
A study against 41 cases confirmed the first COVID-19, which was published in January 2020 in The Lancet, explains the early date of the experience was 1 December 2019.
Official publications from WHO reported the beginning of December 8, 2019.
A few measurements are used to calculate mortality.
These variations are based on regions and time - and are affected by the number of tests, the quality of the health system, the treatment options, the first changing time, and the nature of popularity such as age, malnutrition, and health.
In the end of 2019, WHO sets the ICD-10 emergency code U07.1 for deaths resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infections confirmed in laboratory and U07.2 for deaths from COVID-19 that were diagnosed clinically or epidemic without confirming laboratory infection for SARS-CoV-2. The death ratio illustrates the number of deaths shared in the number of cases of diagnosis in a determinated time.
According to Statistics of University Johns Hopkins, death ratio against cases globally is 6.9% (153.822/2.240.191) at 17 April 2020.
Other increases include case fatality (CFR), which reflects the diagnosis of individuals who died from a certain disease, and the number of infected fatalities (IFR), which reflects the infected persons (diagnosis and non-diagnosis) that died by certain diseases.
This statistics are not connected to time and follow a certain population starts from infection until the case is resolved.
Although not everyone infected makes antibodies, antibodies can provide information on the number of people infected.
In the episentrum in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village with 4600 people, 80 (1,7%) already died.
In Gangelt, this disease has been distributed through the Karnaval Festival, which is distributed to young people, causes relatively lower mortality, and it is likely not all the deaths of COVID-19 are classified as COVID.
Furthermore, the German health system isn't injury.
In the Netherlands, about 3 per cent of the population may have antibodies, such as the blood donors are tested.
69 people (0.004 per cent of the population) were convulsed because of COVID-19.
The pandemics and the mortality levels are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher than men in the study in the Cyclopedia and Italy.
The highest risk for men in the 50s is at the age of 50s, with a risk of risk between men and new women not appeared at 90 years old.
In Zikong, the number of deaths for men is 2,8 per cent and for women of 1,7 per cent.
It is certain that the reason for differences on the basis of this kind of genetic factors and conduct may be a reason.
Immunological differences based on the type of smoking, smoking lower to women, and men who have a comhorbid condition, such as hypertension, in young age than women can contribute to a higher mortality to men.
In Europe, 57 per cent of the infections are men and 72 per cent of people died because COVID-19 is a man.
By April 2020, the U.S. government did not investigate data related to the type of COVID-19 infection.
Research shows that virus diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS affect men and women in different ways.
A percentage of healthcare officers who have higher women, especially illness, and they have higher opportunities to employ virus.
World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of this disease is COVID-19.
WHO leader Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explains that CO is short for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for the first time identified: 31 December 2019.
The name is selected to avoid references to certain geographical locations (e.g. T.T.), animal species, or group people, with international recommendation to prevent stigmatisation. The virus that causes COVID-19 is given the name of the heartnavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "CoVID-19" and "Virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communication.
Good sickness or lazim virus called "koronavirus".
At the beginning of Whan, Tsikong, the virus and the disease are called "koronavirus" and "Coronavirus Whan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and acute respiratory diseases as a temporary name for virus and diseases in accordance with the 2015 provision of which has not been used to use the name of place in the name of disease and virus.
Official name COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 was issued on 11 February 2020.
Because capacity limits in standard funds, some digital producers put health care materials such as baseline and ventilator components.
In one example, when a Italian hospital is very necessary to cut the ventilators, and the shopper could not give it in the time needed, a local firm, and covered 100 pieces that were needed in the last night.
After the beginning of COVID-19, the theory of conspiration, wrong information, and information about origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other diseases, which are fastly distributed.
Humanity seems to be able to distribute virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of virus replication in dogs, babys, and skins.
There is no drug or vaccine agreed to treat this disease.
International investigation against vaccine and COVID-19 is conducted by government organizations, academic groups, and industrial research.
In March, the World Health Organization describes "SOLIDARITY Trial" to examine the effects of four antivirals that have already been with the most promising joy.
The vaccine is not available, but many of them are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Research on SARS-CoV is used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are equally using ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies that are being identified.
First, research aims to make a smooth virus vaccine.
The use of this virus, well as an inactive or dead virus, aims to slowly take human immune response to the new COVID-19 infections.
Second strategy, subunit vaccine, aims to create vaccines that make sensitive immune systems against certain subunits to virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the research focused on S-spic protein that helps virus to detect a receptor enzym ACE2.
Third strategy is nuclear ass vaccine (ADN vaccine or RNA, new technology to make vaccination).
The experimental vaccine made with these strategies should be tested to know their security and honor. On March 16, 2020, the first clinic of a vaccine begins with four volunteers in Seattle.
Vassin contains inevitable genetic codes that are analyzed from the virus that causes disease. The increase in antibodies has been recommended as potential challenges to develop SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this method is still contraversal.
There are more than 300 active clinical tests in April 2020.
Seven tries to evaluate the treatments that have been agreed for malaria, including four studies on hydroxichlorokine or clorocuin.
The new purpose of antiviral drugs forms a major majority of the tsunami studies, with nine tests of Fase III tests on remdecirvirs in some countries with the summer time at the end of April.
In April 2020, the dynamism on clinical development for vaccine candidates and COVID-19 drugs exists.B which is being evaluated for COVID-19 treatments, including remidezivir, chlorocuin and hydrochlorocuin, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir are combined with a beta interferon.
In March 2020, there are temporary evidence for the joy of remdecivir.
Clinical increases are concerned with patients treated with remdecivir in emergency treatment.
Clinical Fase III uses are performed in the United States, the Tibet, and Italy. Klorokuin, which was previously used to treat malaria, was found in Chicago in February 2020, with the early results.
However, there is a search for an overview of the research.
The authorities of the Korean and tsunami health authorities recommend the use of cloroquins.
However, Virology Institute of Whan, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, notes that the dose is two times very dangerous and can be delayed.
On 28 March 2020, FDA issued an emergency use authorisation for hydroxichlorocuin and clorocuin on the physicians care for COVID-19.Thikong edition includes also interferon, ribavirin, or umifenovir to use anti-COVID-19.
Initial data shows that high-dose of ribavirin is required to reduce SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoksanida has been recommended to study further in life after showing SARS-CoV-2 in lower concentrations.Penelicians show that the initial primary antiprotein preserved by transmember protease serial 2 (TMPRSS2) is very important to enter SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with ACE2 receptor.
Studies on chlorocusine and hydroxichlorocusin with or without azitromisin have large limitations that have prevented the medical community to use this therapy without further studies. Oseltamivir does not reduce SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
The complexity of the website can occur on the COVID-19 weight of more.
Tocilizumab has been incorporated into the treatment of the Commission of the National Health Committee after a small study.
This medication is being tested at the second stage, not at the national level in Italy, after showing the positive result of people with serious diseases.
It is combined with a series of fertilin blood tests to identify the snake of the site, and it is intended to combat the web skin, which is expected to be the cause of death to some of the people who are deceived.
In 2017, interleukin-6 receptor antagonis was adopted by FDA based on the retrospective case for the treatment of the syndrome of the syndrome of the site reclame, which was introduced by different causes, therapy of CAR T.
Until now, there is no evidence of will and control that shows that tocilizumab is a direct treatment for the CRS.
Transfering antibodies that are deleted and improved by the system of persons who have been improved from COVID-19 to those who need it are identified as non-vascular immunization methods.
This strategy is tried for SARS with unconcluded results.
Virus neutralization is the working mechanism expected to be antibodies therapy can promulgate defence against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as seal toxicity, which depends on antibodies and/or fagostics, may also.
The form of other patholic antibodies, such as, use monoclonal antibodies, which are produced in development.
Convalesen serum production, which is part of the fluid part of the patient’s healthy blood and contains specific antibodies against this virus, can be improved for more quickly use.
Kornnavius pain, a group of warm syndrome
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Whan’s Headquarters, who later died and died because of COVID-19 after raising an emergency to the virus.
