A Republican strategy to join Obama's re-election
The Republican leaders justify their policies with the need to combat election fraud.
However, the Brennan Center's last for a mytho, confirming that election fraud in the United States is more rare than the number of people killed by the slaughter.
In 10 years, the lawyers of the Republic have registered only 300 cases of election abuse in the United States.
One is sure: these new provisions will affect the participation of the election.
In this sense, these measures are partly undertaken by the US democratic system.
On the contrary to Canada, the United States are responsible for the implementation of elections in each State.
In this sense, the majority of American governments has been declared new laws which are subject to registration or urgency procedures since 2009.
These phenomena were important after the elections of November 2010, where 675 new representatives could have been signed in 26 States.
Accordingly, 180 legislative proposals were introduced only in 2011, which limit the exercise of the election law in 41 States.
The new election laws require the elections to present a light and a evidence of the United States citizenship.
Furthermore, these laws are reduced by the periods for the premature allocation, which is invalid to declare the right to be registered as electioners on the election day, and state citizens vote the right of election for which a court act is entitled.
Before the elections of 2006, the US has no requested the electors to present a light image reference.
Indiana was the first state of the State which has taken one such demand.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the United States confirmed in 2008 the Constitutionality of the Indiana Act.
The Republican authorities intended to extend these practices to other States.
During the past two years, they promoted legislative proposals in 34 states with which the elections were obliged to provide a light image reference.
It is important that the US citizens, in contrast to Quebec, do not have an universal reference card such as hospital insurance cards.
In fact, 11% of the U.S. citizens have 21 million people have no information from a government authority to their State.
Furthermore, five million Novels have no evidence in 2012.
However, more than hundreds of dollars are often paid to the necessary evidence.
With the new restrictions, youths, minorities and people with low income are insufficiently affected.
In fact, 25% of African Americans have, 15% of the income of less than $35,000, 18% of the people over 65 years and 20% of the elections between 18 and 29 years do not over the information required.
That's still enough.
Students who are viewed as electors who give their voice to democratic candidates are not allowed in several countries to use their light image information issued by their institutions.
On the other hand, the same Member States authorize the members of Angel or Jagd Agreements to choose more for the Republican side to use these cards for elections.
For 2004, no Federal State has requested a proof of the citizenship for the choice.
Arizona was the first state of the State which introduced one such request.
Since 2011, twelve States have adopted laws that request the elections to demonstrate their citizenship.
These measures are aware of limiting the Spanish votes.
Because it is on the hand that two of three Spanish elections should prefer the Democratic Party.
Furthermore, the Republic of the Republic of 2011 has promoted laws in eight federal States with which the registration of elections was made on the electoral day.
Furthermore, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide their choices for help to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns have contributed to the registration of the elections in the general elections of 2004 to register about 10 million of state citizens.
Since the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the share of the registration of neo-electors in 2010 compared to 2006 by 17%.
Furthermore, the Republican legislators have adopted laws in five other federal states aimed at reducing the period for the premature period.
For example, in the 2008 general elections in Florida 33% of the electors who had previously chosen, Africans, although they are only 13% of the electors of the Federal State.
The same applies to the Spanish population.
The last one was only 11% of the choices, but 24% of the citizens who had previously chosen.
On the contrary, the white ones represented 76% of the choices were only 46% of the choiceers who were chosen in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their adjoints have engaged in the adoption of legislation which limit the registration of the electioners.
several legislative proposals were blocked by the veto of the democratic governance.
The U.S. General law engaged in implementing the most strict laws.
They were able to limit the damage partly.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have adopted laws that require the provision of a light image.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will, unfortunately, denied the exercise of the election law.
Democratic critics tend to adopt the part-political nature of the adopted laws and consider in them clearly the impact of the results in the countries employed for 2012.
A report from the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that those States who have adopted these legislation are 171 of 270 votes required in the electionsmen's body to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with consciousness that these amendments of legislation to the election system will have significant impact on the results of the election election in 2012.
But one is sure: these new provisions will affect the participation of the election.
In this sense, these measures are partly undertaken by the US democratic system.
Prostatatic fuses recognition: should the test be done or not?
The PSA test is wise, in fact, to sometimes mislead results, with false negative or even false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical attacks.
This leads to stronger teeths of the already undetermined men to carry out early recognition tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We received the opinion of two experts.
In the studies carried out in the United States, there were numerous factors between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and give clear recommendations.
A further study, this time from Europe, concluded that there was a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early recognition.
This study has also shown that after 12 years after overview, the probability of education of metastasis is up to 30 to 40% higher when no early recognition was performed.
Therefore, I recommend the test from a age of 50 or 40 years when you have a direct relationship who was already sick of prostatatic reabs.
There is also a higher risk for men in Africa.
The most important is to take the right decision when a cancer disease was recognised.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patients must really be aware of the risk of his cancer disease by showing the possible options in which prostat can be treated if it does not affect life quality at a long time level, and in these cases, they are decided to be actively monitored by disease.
Today, many men who have recognized cancer are no treatment, since their cancer is not aggressive and no threat for their life.
They are proposed for an active monitoring and are offered to be treated when the disease continues.
The criteria for a decision, who should be treated and whom is not.
I therefore recommend the implementation of the test.
However, it is most important to talk to his doctor to determine whether it should be performed or not.
In cooperation with the international urology society, Movember has developed a tool that is possible to evaluate the PSA test pre-empty and depth.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no wonderful means for prevention of cancer.
Despite the progress in the research, the adoption of a healthy life way remains the best way to reduce the risk, to heal.
It is estimated that 30% of cancer diseases could be prevented if all would eat well and move sufficiently.
"If no smoking anymore, this value would increase at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, speaker of the Canadian cancer society.
However, it is estimated that about 10% of cancer diseases are caused by disorders.
More remains completely unexpected.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tabak-dependence remains a priority, despite the decline of the number of smokers.
The smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of lungs cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It hurts the health of people.
"Actually there are 1,5 million fums in Quebec," the speaker André Beaulieu regrets.
Munitional data: 10 years after smoking, the risk of cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
According to Canadian Cancer Society, overweight and addiposites also promote the slowness of disease.
You seem to increase the risk for breast, grimmdarm, mastdarm, sperm, sweet peel and cold cancer.
"The research shows that a regular physical activity is protected during the whole life of grimmdarm cancer," he adds.
Food
The organization also recommends that the provision of red meat be limited.
In too large quantity it increases the risk of illnessing to a grimm or mass cancer.
It should also be measured.
The conservation of flesh by pulling, troops or salts may lead to the training of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body cells and lead to the development of cancer," he says.
Vitamine
In recent years, several scientists have studied the relationship between vitamin additives and cancer.
Their investigations are not clear now.
After the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E are opposed.
While a study has found the reduction in the risk of prostatatic drugs, another increased.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer was also not clearly shown.
Moreover, Mr Beaulieu emphasizes how important it is to speak to his doctor about his concerns and his family precautions.
"The implementation of an early recognition test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs Boson is analyzed
The proclamation of the likely discovery of the Higgs Boson last summer has brought a certain look, and this is for good reason.
We believe that this boson is nothing less involved in the mechanism that is responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last part of which the existence of the standard model - our best or "also less wrong" declaration of nature and the behaviour of the material - is predicted, but is still not observed.
But for the physician, it's not completely sure that it's really the Higgs.
We know without the shadows of a doubt that we have a real new part, and that it is strongly different from the standard Higgs Boson predicted.
Furthermore, this seems to be confirmed by new data that were presented this week in Kyoto in a great physical convergence, but there is no further data to be completely secure.
However, let's say that it's actually about the Higgs, because it's likely just a low risk to smile, and we're looking at what's going on.
There is a weakless law in this world, which affects that two objects cannot exist at the same time.
It is not possible to hide this rule - and try not to be too strong because you're gonna be hurted.
Because even if the physics is a very rare world, it is found that for them also apply a such law: the Paul's exclusion principle, which indicates that two parts can not place the same room at the same time when they are in the same "quantity state" where this "through" exists in the great and entire of their properties.
The physicians start to share the parts in two categories.
In an edge, the good citizens are called Ferrenia and obedient to the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the bosoms move, a bad band of anarchists who are nothing holy - in any case, not this principle, which means that they can actually stay at the same place at the same time.
The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Labors (which is absolutely surprising) in two groups: the mesons we are not being treated here and the "representatives" by which the great forces of the natural and with which the Higgs Boson would be somewhat related.
But it must be emphasized here that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures as you can.
If you are able to read this chronic, then only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banity: the photos or the "light part" that is the "boat" of the electronic magnetic power.
In fact, if a part of an electric load accelerates or changes the direction, the electronic magnetic field is exactly "stoped" in this place, like a kitchen stone that has been covered in a tea.
This "distortion" consists of an electronic magnetic wave ( light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and these waves are nothing else than a photo and therefore one of the bosons "Trader of power".
Field Stables
Similarly, for the Higgs Boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "stoped" so that this boss is shown.
However, the Higgs field is very stable than the electronic magnetic field; the rider must reach very high energy, a little comparable to a frozen tea, which could only be shocked by a very large rock.
The large Hadron Collider is a ring with a range of 27 km! - to reach such energy.
The analysis with the electronic magnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
They are in fact not all parts and not all materials that interact with the electronic magnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a paper would never hold on the refrigerator.
And the same thing, not all parts with the Higgs field: those who do do have a mass, while the others (as otherwise the photon) do not have mass.
What can all these research now be "good", Mrs. Plamondon asked?
For scientists, they will also review the standard model (SM) and enable physicians to examine all differences between observations and predictions of the SM.
Otherwise, there are many physicians who are most likely to hope that such divisions will be found, since the smallest difference is opening a door to a "new physical" and could stop some of the models.
It must be said that the last is still large, since there is no declaration for the weakness (ups!) and the dark material that forms about 80% of the material of the universe (repeat ups!).
However, the CERN has not been found in such derogations until now.
Impact
The impact of these research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to accept that there is no injury.
Furthermore, in the early 60s, the Laser’s pioneers did not have a deterioration in the Bell Lab that their work would solve such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the murdered physician Willard Boyle, who worked in the Bell Labs, where the Laser was established in the 1960s, and the 1962 himself developed the first long-term layer (the first were pulled) - already said that the laser was considered at the beginning as a "Laser player".
You're going to think about...
Furthermore, applications can also be provided from all instruments of research.
For example, Willard Boyle has developed a small light sensor during its optic works.
Although it wasn't the original purpose, this sensor today serves all digital cameras worldwide as "auge" and has put him 2009 the Nobel Price for Physics.
Of course, this does not mean that LHC's activities will have to change our life, but it means that you can never really know it...
Palliative Collections - the best way to die... _BAR_ Le Devoir
With its "Death in Honor" Committee, Quebec recently discussed the heavy question of the end of life.
The debate must be re-escribed in short, although a draft legislation is prepared.
However, there is still much to do in this important topic.
Le Devier tried to look closer to this.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. still lived in his apartment in Monteregia.
The prostatatic rabbit left him a duration of two years.
"He gave me five years of life, I did seven years," he said half in his bed for Palliativ Gadbois Victor in Beloeil, where he was coming on Friday.
"But it's always a shock, you can't prepare it," he says.
The disease makes her job: an unexpected weakness prevents him to go alone to the toilet and even to eat himself.
On the table before a sweet dinner sits, he wants to appoint to help himself at the food.
It is courageous even to smile and speak to the foreigners who are busy to him, bring him his medicines, and offer him a bathroom.
The courage of the ordinary death.
"My greatest desire is that you can heal my disaster, since this is humble," he shares.
A few hours later, the team found a medicine for this evil.
"In the course of our life we learn that a man pinks on the stair," said Peter Brodeur, psychologist at home Victor Gadbois.
Return in childhood phase is unacceptable for certain people.
"The matter of the ability of the person," a backup sets it.
Because many people who work in the Palliative Employee find great events in the midst of this decline.
Patients who are placed in the home for Palliative Gadbous Victor Gadbous are all suffering from cancer.
You have a maximum life expectation of three months.
In this stage they will not exceed by the doctors and sick sicks who care for them, no longer with such called "healths".
For Ms. A., 89 years of age, the worst fear to die "consciousness and smoking."
But because of the disease, I really learned to know my children.
"I have good kids," adds her.
"I didn't want any more in life," she says, before she accepts that you're putting her a mask that helps her at breath.
However, in the next days she waits for a last visit to her son who comes from Italy.
In the home of Victor Gadbois, you can offer a group of voluntary body workers and assistance in the feed.
The palliative work will then be used if there is no other possibilities.
To train the death author.
In Quebec, at 11.700 inhabitants a bed for the Palliat clubs.
It's very little when we take into account that we're all going to die one day.
Here the life is continued under the best conditions possible, says Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
You are granted to the death smile, after desire, a smell with Brandy or Pepsi.
Diabeticers do not need to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of the day.
Last night, we have served Mr. X a beer who died during the night.
Tonight, his son will strike the beer to feet of the deadly one.
"We help familyes and patients simultaneously", reports the Director of Traveller, Nathalie Savard.
In home Victor Gadbois is not a day like the other.
Besides a 93-year-old man who enjoys the last family meeting in the court and is well based on his headworks while you get up to his honour, a young man of 36 years died of his parents, his wife and his two young children in a tragic way after he tried to survive.
"First six months, three to five beds are always with cancer patients under the age of less than 45 years," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients in the home of Victor Gadbois come from their residence place, 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative duties
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative workers, i.e., to a lingery to the suffering of patients when the last time the end station has reached their lives, both home, hospital or home.
And several organizations, such as the home Victor Gadbois and the society for smiling palliative palliatives in Montreal is specialized more or less exclusively on cancer patients.
According to this huge inadequacy in the health care of Quebecs, several in the Palliative College specialized doctors are concerned about the adoption of a law on death aid and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifest has been signed by the prominent personalities of the Palliatian Coasts such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to consider their resistance to a such initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the health system Quebecs is not sufficient to ensure that all right to high-quality palliative workers are entitled to overcome death aid before you are accepted.
Soon, she says, I have seen a patient who had been in the emergency 14 days with great pain, without taking action towards their liver.
I am afraid that the patients only want to die because they do not receive appropriate health care.
And at the same time, several disorders have been treated by their patients, despite the worst prognosis, until the last day.
The survivors of Helen Richard were at least when she broke a shocking chemotherapy.
When I informed my officelog that I would stop the treatment, she answered me that she was sorry that I had taken the battle, she told me.
However, she told me that I was at the end!
No Onipotent Fletcher
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who have requested to die are grateful for this desire has not been given after their suffering from a team of palliative workers.
However, it should be clear that palliative employees in the treatment of pain are not omnipotent.
According to Elsie Monereau, Leader of the Palliative Commons of the Compagnie of the Mooreal Palliat Coast Montreal, 8% of the patients do not speak to a pain-related treatment.
Thus, at the end of the life, the doctors are often back to the terminal seed, which continues to cut the patients spotically or permanently until the time of their death.
We can't do so longer than if we do this side of suffering.
Patients without pain breath will always have the possibility of restraining this terminal decline.
Patients whose pain is not painful, all say the same word: "I want to die."
But this does not mean weakness, "I want you to smell me," but "I want to be cut off my pain."
The implementation of this report was possible because of a Canadian Health Institute of Journalism.
Real estate channels in Quebec
Employees of the Roadbuilding Agency, firms of the construction headquarters, fund firms of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia are told every day what they know about a great "system" in the construction, officers, politicians, employees and mafioso.
Industry, which was very costly for the tax number of Quebecs, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's wonderful how the system has been destroyed since you have taken drastic measures", says Jacques Duchesneau, deputy in Quebec and former leader of the police of Montreal.
The skandal was found by him due to an initial investigation of the distortion in relation to the contracts on road construction in Quebec, which had just agreed to the former Prime Minister.
The "Searchwater Report" was an direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and awareness of officers.
"Seen since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he stressed that the Ministry of Transports had divided a billion dollars to the contracts", because some of them were able to receive their instincts to share their share!
The Charbonneau Commission, "it has already taken two citizens", adds, in the hope that you have been able to "move the tactics behind individuals".
A 2011 called in life, permanent anti-corruption unit
The 2011 life-related anti-corruption unit is also undergoing great efforts with its troops to economic investigators, researchers and analysts of the government.
In addition, police members of the "Marteau Group" who have been influenced since 2009 that the "Canalization Cartell" of Montreal remains more continuous at the artificial explanation of the treaties...
In the last few weeks, she has pursuely investigated households and accused of fraud and corruption against communal mandates such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is the chief of a city.
The next list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who had come back from his office as the Chief of Laval, the third largest city Quebecs.
It is suspected to have repeated the exchange of public contracts in the exchange.
It was expressly accused of other engineering of Montreal's road construction office, as well as Italian entrepreneurs, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Z area.
Lastly, it has been overlooked by declaring the Commission the functionality of the "the system" for the maintenance of public contracts.
He himself has paid 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal for a committee connected to the Mafia, which transferred the money to the Montreal Union, the party of Master Gérald Tremblay.
Mr Z, in the years 2000, he has had the hand in the whole of the game by giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (a. 68,000 euros) to provincial partys, especially those who had been at the power.
He also intended to have organized a illegal fund for the former liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Canadianization contracts whose costs were artificially dismissed by him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption was unresolved.
The former engineer Gilles Surprenant describes this in the Commission in detail: in ten years he received the company's gifts, invitations to travel, golf turns, restaurants and Eishockey games, as well as the cost of $736.000 as a contrary for changing contracts, whose costs he was artistically allowed.
Other officers of the roadbuilding office have shown that they were smelling by keeping the accounts with false additional services artistically up to 30-40%.
He also accused a civilian party, Martin Dumont, Mr Tremblay, that he had regarded a shadow budget that fulfild his boxes with black payment.
As a result of these enthusiasms, Mr Tremblay came back in the beginning of November, which triggered Montreal in a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first members of Montreal, the alarm.
As Citizensman of the city district Rivière-des-Pririas, in the east of the island, she refused to sell a common basement that for $5 million was purchased and for 1.6 million to buyers in the booming real estate market.
70% black payment in the election campaigns
The survey, which is finally implemented, says that it is "in a faden that allows it to understand the functionality of the systems undergoing by Amics to stop the evil and to adjust the debts."
She says that the procedure is "awesome but positive".
However, we are to cut the wounds, which requires only one for Montreal's specific findings unit, as well as a supervisory to prevent the return of the fragile practices.
How to make it clean.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes on the other hand that "secure a few hundreds of millions of dollars have stolen", but especially the role of the "mandatists who are over the tactics" if they were not in the fraud!
From 70% black payment in the financing of the election campaigns in Quebec, he said: "I was said that this is only a weak decrease of reality."
The Government of Quebecs proposes to limit the costs of Parties to $100, which would therefore not change the situation: "When the electoral contributions are not strictly limited, black payment will be in the policy."
He recommends a complete revision of the system for the provision of public contracts and the financing of the parties: "We can't deeply fall; we can't cut the things with courage on the basis, we can rebuild the house on a stronger basis with more controls and laws."
If this story hurts the international view of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau calls for those who laugh to smile a look in their own court...
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
In this season you adopted a new scale with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
You can explain it through a personal view, but also through the new PSG dimension.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress on her side.
The technical staff has also given me a lot.
These elements encourage me every day to improve my game level.
And with a game it's easier.
Everything's going very fast in the football.
But I don't want to smell.
Since my starts in the centre of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine to my game period at Saint-Etienne, I have always made progress slowly.
So you use the competitiveness introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new access to this summer are intended to bring games very high levels.
You also know that every training unit is expressive.
This makes a player like me to offer the storms and want to give his best.
Moreover, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my game position.
He is supported by co-trainers as Claude Macelele, who played on the same position as I.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Surely.
Acinglotti engages in respect for all technicians.
There is no comparable person in Ligue 1 currently, and it belongs to the best trainers of Europe.
He looks back to a rich experience and has winned many titles with viewed bellys.
He had contact with great players.
I think he will win another title in Paris.
In January I had a encouraged conversation with him.
That's why I just took me out of an injury series.
The confidence he has put in me is also a statement for my performance.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In the Ligue 1, Lyon took us the place of the Pitcenter.
But we're in the maintenance.
One of our most important objectives is the League Champions: we have qualified us in this way for the acetelfinal.
What is the objective of the Agreement in this competition?
We'll try to come as far as possible.
From now to now everything is possible.
However, we will have to contact our words against very good European mentions.
First of all, we want to be before our first group, porto, so that we can use the back of the acetelfinal as a home game.
Can the PSG become a great European agreement in short view?
He's already got the budget for...
In order to become a large European agreement, Paris has to win and make a name long-term.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG provides the resources to adopt concrete forms of this project.
Would it be a great misconduct to not win the title in Ligue 1 as this was in the last season?
Of course, this would be a great deal.
This year, we really are in the heart of resigning this title.
In the last season, we were closer to it.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to bring the victory.
We have finished the season with a very strong performance.
We closed 79 points.
Normally, you should be master with 79 points...
But another manage, that of Montpellier, has achieved a better season.
I think this year is the right thing.
Even if the great mentions such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux ring around the title, I think we have the witness to win him.
Do you think the media is waiting too much from the PSG?
In view of what is invested and the player we have, it is normal that much of us will be expected.
We accept that completely.
However, if we win in a home game against Troyes 4-0, and we still find something we can imagine, this is a lot of frustration with security.
You're wondering what people still expect.
We could never win each weekend with 4-0.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to create a game concept.
A manship is built with time.
In the League Champion, we have proved strength.
Consider Manchester City, a unit that has not been able to qualify for the axel final, and has also operated huge expenditure!
With regard to the invested sums, you were believed to play break with 15 points prepassing!
This means that our enemy and the French mastership would be left out.
Lyon and Marseille, who weren't good in the last season, were boosted by this new PSG.
This shows that the link 1 is quiet.
I hope we will be the laugh winner in May and say that, despite all the difficulties, we have finally winned them.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
To be better talking about a "Zlatan" dependance.
This means that Ibrahimovic is a power stark and a lot of doors shoot.
That's why he came and proves that he's the star of the Ligue One.
All over there where he played, he led his eyes to be a wonderful player and a world star.
We respect both the player and the person.
He also respects those who turn to him.
What he did is really extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their game level.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders world, allows all others to make progress.
How have you experienced the EM 2012 with the French nationality?
It's like an enthusiasm.
It was in my heart to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, I stopped my injury to exclaim some time of game.
I've seen things that I've been strengthened.
Today I can make good games in the nationality.
This was my hope since I was baptized with the "Bleus".
What has happened in Ukraine, we have taught our teachings, and today we have to put an example of conduct.
What opinion do you have at the first months of Didier Deschamps at the sight of "Blue"?
He has achieved a lot of promised results.
We have a good position in the WM qualification group.
The national trainer is strict, close to the players and strict to win.
Like it was Laurent White.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
White had reached his goal by he had qualified us for the EM.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the "Blue" to Brazil.
Is this a shock game in Spain on 16 October (1:1)?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has been used for everybody else.
I have never experienced a comparable game in my career before this meeting in Spain.
With Bitcoin it is possible to pay and sell without bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between the parties.
Furthermore, as often in these technologies, a political vision is incredible: the conviction that the current monetary system, established by bankmonopols, leads to financial crisis.
Indeed, the Bitcoin founded by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (and in dollars, euro, etc.) and a protocol for safe exchange as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network, about 200,000 transactions were already understood.
Some thousands of websites accept Bitcoin as a spend or as a payment means.
After the Bitcoin course reached a maximum of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, he went up to $2 months later to $2, before he received about $10 today (the courses are listed on the Bitcoincharts.com website).
There is no particular impression in comparison with the world trade of real currencies or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown this interest in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "excellent currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "credits" that are used to advance in a video game that can be wined or buyed by games (and sometimes turned back).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, the trade is controlled and processed every time by a central authority.
With Bitcoin, all net notes are simultaneously maintainers of the account book, checkers, money employees and buyers and salesers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually located between two email addresses in a form of email.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address that guarantees the anonymity for each payment.
A series of data related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can examine the authenticity of the transaction.
Using the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the treated bitcoins are available in the public account book distributed in the entire network.
The decisive step is to introduce this new transaction in this book.
This is about a mathematical task that is started on the computers, with the winner who is a type of provisional central banking, the privileg has the privileg to add this additional line.
This is a sequence of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and clearly electronic finger expression.
The computer "adopt" the new transaction and adds a number before the whole "hacked".
The objective is to find the number that meets a special finger print (more no ones at the beginning).
If this number has been found, the other buttons can be checked freely whether it is the right.
The transaction is therefore permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any change would change the finger pressure.
If a user wants to pay two times very quickly (for than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions from the network would be validated and the other remains without linking, as both finger buttons have different.
The computer that has solved the task receives 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is regularly half, probably before the end of 2012.
The Bitcoins in the round are therefore limited to 21 million, but it is possible to share to a hundred billion system, which allows a certain playspace...
Furthermore, the difficulty of the task will be increased with each improvement of accounting performance.
The life of the network has already been high and deep.
The websites that provide Bitcoin services were attacked and stolen the Bitcoin devices.
"The useful weakness office does not relate to the actual protocol," says Peter Noizat, who just introduced a payment company with real money and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports about the possibilities of the currency by this anonymous service.
Nevertheless, Bargeld also declines this squad.
Important actors such as Wikipedia reject the costs of this type.
Others like the blog platform WordPress are accepted.
Soon Adi Shamir and Dr. Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel have analyzed the account book and showed that almost 80% of Bitcoins are not around.
A "Mega final sale" was started in November.
"Third thousands of dollars were entered", John Holmquist, who works for the Coinabul company, converted by Bitcoins in gold.
Peter Noizat, who is also the author of a book on this currency, believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His Paytunia system corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or an uncontact payment with a mobile phone, but Bitcoin uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions that are more tangible.
Furthermore, the holder has managed its identity and can therefore remain anonym.
The system can be easily implemented with handlers, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just need to specify a address that can be "food and recognised" by a phone, gives Peter Noizat who ensures that he has thousands of users.
It is a general trend where gearchic systems are overwhelmed for the most horizontally orientated systems.
"There will be some time until Bitcoin is carried out, but 2013 might be a point of shift", he prognoses.
The ECB, in its report, also proposes to re-evaluate the various today's high-speed risks in the case of success of this currency.
We're out of Afghan.
And then?
French troops have left their responsibilities in Afghan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the United States should follow the end of 2014.
It is at the time that the Afghan army reaps the ownership of their territory, and that the Afghan people decided their future without expecting everything from us.
We have particularly punished the Afghan farmers by seeing them as terrorists.
And himself with our 88 murdered soldiers, as well as the blessed and injured.
The Talibans consist of foreign extremists, former leaders fled to Pakistan, but often from farmers who reject a weakened foreign presence as at the time of the Soviet.
They want to defend their centuries of age and archaetic traditions, even if they have connected them to Zshihadists, Pakistan, Arabs, Usbeken and Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local urbans, the latter will not be there when the Western countries are discred.
The disappearing of the French troops from the fund point in Nijrab, which I have observed by a heavy with mandel trees that was financed by French credits correctly.
The overflowd car and panzer convoices of Hubschraubers have reached cabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014, there will no longer be awards of the Taliban in Kabul.
From 1994 to 1996, the conditions changed.
From that time, Kabul was empty and the country was overwhelming because of the struggle of the various groups of war.
Their authority was then considered as a kind of release and return to security.
The Afghan Women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the farmers overwhelmed by the Al-Qaida organization, but their situation has not been improved until now.
Ancient Mudschaheddin, the Afghan government and the present Taliban have the common desire to maintain women in a subdeputed position.
The most important personalities of the anti-Sweden war have come back to the power of 2001.
They have become businessmachers by calling the government's bases to sell them as a construction country to refugees from Iran and Pakistan and thus benefits from the massive American transfer of contracts.
They've been in contact, and most of them were not even involved in the fighters.
As I have heard in the campaigns, people want to be a government that does not commit.
Many young people want to leave the country, as those who could benefit American uses: Capital flight is considerable.
Young people have seated the war and their ideology.
During their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they have contacted the modern world, and have had their benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years; Kabul now has 5 million people, which is one fifth of the total population.
In the towns, state schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people who nor want to return to the obscurity of the only parties or to corrupt certain leadership forces will have to be provided for jobs.
All, including the weaponed parties, are covered by mobile phones; the television with its Turkish series that represent a modern world is seen.
A army is now.
Will the authorities under whose command authority they will be considered legitimate?
The former commander of the anti-Swedish fight is already trying to restore the million in the province that will be deleted by the central government.
Afghan, the country of mountains with strong local identities had to benefit from a certain decentralization in the example of the Western nations, but by decreasing the office of the Ministerial President, which has been since the Constitution of 1964, the United States wanted to make a centralized State with a strong presidential government.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, in particular to the elections planned for April 2014.
However, his country has been depending on foreign aid since the 50s and for a long time before.
Industries have not been rebuilding, functionable steel equipment are not available and important swimming systems have not been repaird.
All is imported; notwithstanding fruit and vegetables, nothing is produced.
The private initiative is taken priority.
In a country which was based on war for 30 years, it would have been necessary to control the infrastructure.
The plant was spread that Afghan had an incredible soil value.
This strengthens the impression that the Western countries were only in place to enable them.
Without energy to process the iron or coppery on the place, or without transportation vehicles for a mountain export is not possible.
The Chineses have already left the cupfermine of Mes Aynak, let the international architects (funded by the World Bank) make their expansions on the huge buddhist places and remain the most important employees of the province.
One day, it will be necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are widely dependent on the export and exports, restore normal relations.
The disappearance of the French fighter was concluded on 20 November.
The new Cooperation Treaty continues to provide traditional assistance: girls and youthymnasies, Institute for French at the Universitys, French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, agricultural and cultural areas, support of the Archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which has been established in 2012, has been established in twenty-thirds of mountain peoples with numerous common works and measures for the sanitation of agricultural agriculture and enabled a small French non-governmental organization to try to win the "hears and spirits" and to achieve the impossible task of the compatibility of aid and offensive actions.
These works, which were needed for many local workers, have helped to stress the standing: consumption, burns, drinking water, rebuilding, fruit trees, soil protection and increased agricultural uses.
What subvention do we allow for military expenditure from two billion euros?
A more comprehensive budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are often very hard in the height of more than 2000 meters.
In the message, twelve written requests for small agricultural projects from communities of the province of Capisa have been introduced.
In order to free farmers from the situation carried out by foreign groups, which is their own words, the continuation would be lower, well-controlled and directly related to civil aid to their benefits.
A Constitution with the Breakfasts in Egypt
This is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egyptians relating to the Constitutional declaration provincially granted to him the unlimited full power, more than you shared, he decided to put everything on a map.
For the surprise of all, he announced on midnight that the Constitutional Assembly will be adopted on the next day of its final vote.
Only one week ago, the Head of State had granted two additional months to the end of his work.
Egyptians have now been based on a text, which has been revised for almost two years, which weaks the institutional stability and leads to a legal interchange.
This new initiative has been made only for a further dissemination of the country.
For his enemy, the Chair in his "autocratic delirium" he continues to "speak his word" and "the right with feet."
On the side of his favorites, it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible and to accelerate the transitional process.
A reference should be stopped within 14 days.
A very short period of time that the brothers are forced to reject their projects to explain the Egypte's text section.
For the Presidents, it is also a way to restore its public and democratic legitimacy while the protest is in the whole country.
After confirmations in an interview with the American weekview Time seems to be convinced that Egyptians will be delighted.
Once the Egyptian people with this retreat will have a ultimate vote: "If you are right for my draft, or I hold the unlimited full power", the last should be finalized after the Constitution.
85 most Islamic members of this Constitutional congregation have adopted the text last night in a rare atmosphere.
The majority of the Liberals has not been followed.
Shortly before the Constitution's statement in the middle of November, they have not been able to apply their views.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or civil society have also treated.
To achieve the decisionability, all of the 11 persons, substantive members, were added last morning.
Some are very close to the mosaic brothers.
It is not surprising that the articles have been adopted in most cases.
On the other hand, the comments argued that the only opinion variety of the day... was expressed in the hour for prayer, since some members of the body of the opinion were that the Pendelarium of the Constitutional Assembly was not exact.
The text, which has been adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2 of the Constitution of 1971, which all attention has remained identical with the Constitution of 1971 and states that "the principles of the Charia are the main source of law".
The Salphistical Party, for which the establishment of the Islamic law is an important demand, had hoped to replace "the principles" by "the rules" which would have made a more strict application.
For Islamians, the fact that this article has not been changed, a evidence for their good will and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Speakness" reacts to the Liberals, which are only viewed as a propagan attack.
Because they follow the Islamization of the Constitution on other articles.
They have particularly recognized article 220 at the eye of the University of Al-Azhar, in particular with regard to the review of conformity with the laws of the Charia.
According to the Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, this is unreasonable, since "the people who are requested for an opinion have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here you can see the first sign of a theocracy."
The fears of the liberalians are also given by the fact that the next factor of this university should be less than the present.
"Actually, there is no concrete religious commitment.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the Burger State.
The majority of the legalists who have worked at this text are not Ulema, but academics who are trained in part in the French system," said Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctor's work on the Egyptian Constitution Transition.
However, it is noted that "as regarding Article 220, it may be a multiplicity, since the terms used are rejected to the religious word chat.
In particular, here is regard to the "Fiqh" [Islamic law practice, e.g. Red].
And in the future, the question of which civil leaders are competence to decide about it."
In addition to his religious aspect, the last night adopted text is strongly criticized due to the extensive power that he grants to the President of the Republic.
Moscow brothers argued that these comparisons with the former regime are significantly reduced.
Another conflict point: the forces of the army.
In accordance with the desire of the military, the examination of the defence budget will not be submitted to the Parliament but to a national defence Council.
Nevertheless, it will be prohibited by civil procedures in military courts as it has requested the associations to defend human rights.
The latter also share their fears regarding the text that they consider as an threat to freedom.
The real file of the Blasphemy will be maintained, and the lies are now banned, which serious consequences of the right to free opinion, especially for the press.
Nevertheless, there is no article on the protection of women, subjects Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
The only positive point of view is the prohibition of the torture by article 36.
This word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President had to be expressed at the television last night, demonstrations were planned for afternoon.
The representatives of the Head of State are marked on Saturday.
In Israel, the Ukrainian tourists expect the holy places, the Nabel of the world and a sea from the sun
The Yellow land joins the glory of Bible truths, modern comfort and an untrained nature.
AIF calls you the five most important reasons for a visit in Israel.
Remember before the holy places
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It means that all those who battle in this river receive God’s blessings.
Galilea is the place where Jesus completed his miracles: the change of water into wine on a wedding feast, the way to the water, the standing of the seahorm and the fishing cap.
Before here, Jesus appeared his disciples after the resurrection.
However, most of the sanctuarys are found in Jerusalem.
Faithful acting here is the suffering road or crossway of Jesus Christi (on Latin: Via Dorosa).
The path begins at the Roman Festival of Antonia, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old city to the Grabeskirch on the mountain Golgotha, where the crossing place, the savingstone and the Grab of Jesus.
Here, according to the Christian view of the Nabel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The Closter of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem is on the place where a Christian legend was taken according to the tree, from which the cross was made for the crossing of Jesus.
In Jerusalem, the most holy place of the Jews - the Klagemaues, the rest of a temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E..
Traditionally, people from different believer institutions leave a chain with desires that then go to compliance.
A travel to the height
The ruins of the Massada Festival formed the rest of the secret hike before the enemy, which the great Herodes of the Great in the year 25 C.E. was built for his family.
They are at a rock door in the mountains in 450 meters height above the sea level.
Only mountain increases can reach the ruins from their own power.
Everyone else brings a air seat to this historical hill.
In the north of the country, in 1600 to 2040 meters, the famous Ski area Hermon is located in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain, you'll get there with a shuttle bus.
The skipistes have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to a old legend, the Jewish gods were able to live on the Bergboard.
Visit unique museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
Only one trip can not be seen by all of them.
However, at least five of them should be visited.
The Israeli museum is on the Knesset (Parlament).
There are old Qumran manuscripts or rolls from the dead sea, found in stones in the Jewish wilderness, and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exponents.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also a value of visit.
There will be the collection of works of printers and expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modelleni, Chagall and Picasso.
In Akko you can visit the museum at Bad Al Basha, which protects several samples of old Turkish bathrooms with sculptures of the ancient visitors and bathrooms.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum where you can admire Dali and Rodin sculptures.
There are no museum leaders or subvention camps.
The entry is free, and the costs are basically rejected.
The fifth Museum, or the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, speaks of one of the most horrible chapters of the history.
The most excited department is the thinking of the children, which was built for the memory of the 1,5 million children that were destroyed in the concentrations and gas stations.
The entire darkness is in the presence of the room.
The stars are shocking.
And the names of the Jewish children and the countries where they die.
Ukrainian is also mentioned there.
Do something for health
The three most important areas of Israel are located on the woods of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
On each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, Delphine and Oceans.
It is surprising that in the Red Sea also is assembled in the winter months, since water temperature is not lower than 21 °C and the air is hot until 23 °C.
The dead sea is even warm and there will be worshiped over the whole year.
Moreover, this unnormal sea with a situation of 417 meters under the sea level is the most deepest sea of the world.
His twisted blue water has a high salt content, making it even unlikely on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is nice.
Visitors are present for treatments under use of salt water (natural salt water) and healing smell as well as the treatment of skin disorders, allergy, asthma, eczems, artritis, bronchites, sugar disease, and the assaulting of skin nerves.
Try the secrets of the age
These secrets join the old town of Tel Aviv, the town of Jaffa at the Mediterranean coast.
With this city, the famous sea road, the Egyptians, Syrians, Anatolians and Mesopotamias were linked.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to transfers, Noah built his archive right here, and Perseus saved here the beautiful Andromeda, with which he led to this place a long and happy life.
Tourists want to smell by the close gases named by starmarks.
Fortuna should keep the legend after all that cut the walls in the gas with their starmarks.
In Jaffa, you can visit new couples from all Israel and even other countries at photo terms.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herodes, you can strive through the Roman theatre and strive the celebration of the cross.
In Roman times Caesarea was the most important city of Judaas and the residence of the Roman Statute, including Pontius Pilatus.
In carefully restored theatres today are recorded concerns and operators.
List of features for tourists
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your bad English knowledge: about 30% of Israelites speak Russians.
The money in the travel is no longer in euros, but in dollars that can be changed in schekel (acctual change rate: $1 to 3.8 schekels).
In the city you're forwarding with the bus, but there is also a rapid road in Jerusalem and the only U-Bahn line of the country with six stations that connect the suburb to the top city.
It is precisely a sub-State Railway.
A driving within the city costs independence on transport 6 schemes, which is sufficiently inclusive for a driving from up to 1,5 hours.
According to the Jewish tradition, in Israel the Saturday began.
From Friday to Sun Thursday, markets and business are closed, and the public transport is resting.
And on Sunday morning the working night starts.
In many coffees, restaurants and guests, only more coffee food is used, which is excluded from sugar meat, sea products, fish without shoes and foods that include both milk and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between different courts with hammer and meat, suppers and desserts (also prepared with cocosmeat), traditional Jewish humus paste, various softs, fried bottles from pearl and herbs (flables) and fruits and vegetables.
In the streets of the cities of Israel there is no tragic dogs.
For this, there are many pleasant kitchens that are calm and unreasonable by the streets.
Tonight you can even see her sleeping on the tears of parking cars.
The cats like to be cut places and don't say No to Leckerea.
A car costs between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs additional $15 per day.
And bicycle delivery costs 15 schemes per day.
Income cards for museums cost in the cut 30 skele.
In numbers
In 2012 more than three million tourists from the world of Israel have visited Israel.
Most adventurers and visitors came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the United States and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8.000 Ukrainian tourists in the Gelobte country, with a increase of 51% in the comparison period in 2010, before the decrease of the visa obligations on 9 February 2011.
"The great and powerful" leads to Moscow: Migrants spare money for language
While Members and citizens are talking about the benefits of the law on binding language tests for migrants, crimes already act with false certificates.
Any year, 13 million guest workers get to Moscow, Sankt Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Lakes: Usbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkey.
Its only goal is to win money for the maintenance of the families living in the home.
On 1 December, a law entered into force, which should, as a result of each employee, make a test that makes the knowledge of the Russian language.
This scheme is only applicable to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the common housing economy and in the private trade.
However, the tests with time, according to the Federal Migration Authority, are to be obliged to be at the future for all guest workers.
This does not only require language tests, but also tests into Russian history and the basis of legislation.
Speech knowledge must be demonstrated for both maintenance and prorogation of work permits.
Exemptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian official language is.
In the same case, persons who have received their training products and diplomas before the fall of the UDSSR in 1991 are excluded.
Intelligence, problems and protection of rights
The totality of the tests will be located under the Egyptians of the Pushkin Institute for Russian language, the Russian University of the People's friendship, the Moscow of State University, the San Petersburger State University and other Russian high schools.
Migrants can delay the tests in all cities; now more than 160 respective centres have been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the test was supported by the deputy of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
However, before the entry into force of the law in the press, citizens questioned the following question: What does the whole cause?
What changes makes the provision to show speech knowledge, both for Russia and for guest workers?
In particular, it goes to reduce the number of employees.
"Thank now speaks about the protection of the rights of labour migrants," said the Chief of the Delegation of the Federal Migration Authority in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelew.
However, your rights must already be protected before their departure.
Only a organized recruitment will resolve for 90% the problems of foreign workers.
In problems, immigrants have no professional, education, language knowledge and medical observation.
Sebelew is convinced that a future immigrant, without speech knowledge, will be engaged in pregnant people with bad hopes that strike him into a dark, close barack, where he will swallow with twin-third months without food and documents and will be made up to 12 to 14 hours on day.
We reach many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home you will be promised, and when you come, you will be involved, get your places and don't receive the promised loan," confirms the Chief of the Tajik Migration Authority, Tolib Schwaripow.
Don't shoot, boss!
However, many citizens of Central Asian Republics who want to win their money in Russia are not only to dominate the language of the target country but also to express themselves in their own language.
Of course, it is not so debt than the evil: only few turkmen, skins and tadches can also lead to a reasonable basic education.
Because there is no more money in their families to feed the children, not to purchase their suitable clothes, shoes and schools.
As adolescents, they take the first opportunity to carry out money.
"It's difficult without speech knowledge", they give.
"You feel low and less valued."
Citizens' law stress the following important aspects.
The test is only to delay migrants with legal status.
If you don't have this status, there is no test and therefore no official work.
In the meantime, the majority of guest workers continue to be illegal in Russia.
"True Welcome" or "Access to Invalid"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to get an official status in Russia.
The reason is that officers and, of course, the speech difficulties.
Moreover, the legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubels.
A false registration can only be made for a half thousands.
The employees of the Russian police know that our documents are most false and we are not registered, and then there are cases of pressure.
"You want a hundred rule for cigarettes and tea", the Tadschik Umed Hushkadamow expresses against journalists.
"Don't look at the cost for wrong papers."
On the day in which the law was in force, it pointed out that not only the register documents of migrants could be false.
Some false certificates that demonstrate the conclusion of the speech test have already been obtained by the Federal Migration Authority.
The false papers were printed with a common color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive this: every migrant who hoped that he could save the tests, paid seven thousand rubels for the document.
This is more than double than the costs for the official test: this costs an employee three thousand rubels.
In addition, the most direct task is to protect the corruption system so that certificates are not simply purchased, both officials and citizens rights are agreed.
For the moment, guest workers who first by the test may be promised to receive time for a language basis course.
Furthermore, new agreements will be offered without language knowledge in fields where no active understanding is necessary.
Internal Ministry ignored illegal weapons market
Legal weapons for crimes extremely low
The Russian internal Ministry sets up a consolidation of the weapons law for private weapons owners.
Thus, the authorities react to the recent events: recently blessed in shoes on marriages and seven deaths at the round of Moscow judicist Dmitri Winogradow.
The police wants to prohibit the driving of non-mortal weapons in the public and the age of shooting weapons from 18 to 21 years of age.
The proposal supported the Chairman of the Duma Security and Corruption Committee, Irina Jarowaja, and promised that the changes in the weapons law are submitted in the course of the Duma.
Not all are satisfied that Russian authorities want to fight the problems through "slaughter's relationship".
On the Internet, a open letter was issued to provide the prosecutor whose representatives of various weapons associations are called for the authorities to take a distance from "sin-free reliefs".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, expressed by the criminal lawyer, Wasilij Lesnikow, the Russian service of BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, 142 crimes were employed with the application of the registered weapons during six months in 2012, while 1,168 thousand crimes were registered for the same period.
The promotors of the open letter are convinced that a consolidation of the law for the private weapons owner is not stopped to serve on the black market.
Currently, you can find the publishers in Moscow every possible weapons for little money.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs emphasizes that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Manufacturers: from the factories to the officers
The weapons have got over several channels on the black market.
There are five main channels, speaking about a former supervisor Victor Baranez, who was in the Ministry of Education and in the General Tab.
Screenshot of a website that accepts weapons orders
The first channel is the army or the army, i.e. weapons that were stolen during the battle in the castle.
"The weapons were stolen by both Russian officers and the cupcakes themselves," says Baranez.
On the second channel, illegal weapons will be stolen by orders of crimes.
Baranez explains that there are weapons that were stolen both from the police's weapons rooms as well as directly by the employees of the criminal persecution authorities.
Other illegal weapons are sold from military arms campers.
In many military camps, it was often explosions.
"As evidence that in some cases it was the Branding Office to shoot the lack of weapons," said the former military members.
A contribution to the black market has also been provided to the arms producers in accordance with Baranez.
"Another day there are numerous private refrigerator manufactures that do not hold international competition, and therefore weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow," reports the experts.
Another channel of the black market is the smuggle.
In particular, many pistols and arms come from poor countries like Kirginia.
"There is a own, sometimes manual production, as well as a mafia that organizes the smuggle", explains the former military members.
Where are the weapons?
Experts calculate the amount of each of the five channels in the delivery of the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was addressed by the Centre for Problem Analysis and State Management.
The experts analyzed reports of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Federal Service for State Statistics, Criminological Literature and publicly available information on portals on the subject of weapons.
The overwhelming part of the illicit weapons is depending on the investigators of the army and the legal protection authorities.
The report states that half of all weapons on the black market were "the obligation of responsibilities to do with their work with weapons".
The data of the researchers are 17% of the weapons from conflict areas, 14% return to the weapons production, and 5% are of illegal expansions.
A salesman of a weapons load that does not want to be nicely called, ensures that weapons that are found in illegal expansions have no longer purchased anybody else since they are born.
According to him, it is more often that handlers are slaughtered in a weapons camper.
Over a phone rid is buyed a weapon, for example a pystole from the type TT.
The weapon is released and transmitted through the shooting.
"The handler brings the weapons into the city and sell it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he said
"The police, of course, knows about everything and, therefore, leads to the plan to discover crimes, regularly controlling purchases at handlers offering illegal weapons", adds the sales advisor.
"With in the luxus load."
Sellers and sellers find the most commonly known ones.
I had seen my websites and blogs when someone was noted on me, and I predicted to come to the "Begowaja" Station where a person would wait for me, who took me to a certain place where we could negotiate the price.
The price for the weapon I've just been there
Army Commander Victor Baranez
"To purchase a weapon, I need a known person who has contacts," says the Seller. "I have so a famous person, but I don't trust him."
There are handlers on the markets, but there's a need to go and spend with a code like "Iwan Iwanowitsch, which allows to express that the daughter has lost a dent."
I'm even coming to some slagrinds about a famous whom I trust.
He gives me the slagringe only because he knows I don't forget him.
Newlins search for weapons in different ways.
Victor Baranez, an ex-military, tried to purchase illegal weapons in the middle of the 1990s, when he wrote a article on this subject.
The schemes did not change him.
He got a photo album in which "all possible" was formed.
"I felt like in the luxus loan," the military members remembered.
The buyer does not get the cat in the sack but can try everything.
I'm as potential customers buy not just, but drive with the seller in the forest, and there we'll set a goal.
"I can shoot there, and if I am convinced that the weapons have a good shooting, we're going to negotiate with each other," the expert describes the step.
Buy from sofa
Internet research machines show search results on websites and groups in "V contacts" where weapons are offered for different purposes.
There are no papers needed, nor personal meetings.
"He needs only the suitable amount of money", says the advertising newspapers on the website "Campfpitoles or weapons."
There are users to open your orders and ask questions.
Does it also sell for minors?
"Naturally without license," user "Iwan" asked.
"Search a TT. Moscow," says the Laconic question of "Fedorenkow".
The Federal Security Service recently slowed several web sites, and buyers who want to buy the weapons are going to the service to the network.
People come like hungry fish at feeding and countries then in Siberia and can see coal
Army counter and former military agent Victor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: the website is normally registered in the foreign area and the Russian laws do not apply.
The responsibilities take the orders.
The buyer gives the money over a bankauto.
"The answer he receives a photo and a description of the hiding of the weapons", reports the publisher of the common organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitrich Kislow.
Victor Baranez emphasizes that you can get empty on the conclusion and get back to the guest when you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently slowed several web sites, and buyers who want to buy the weapons are going to the service to the network.
"The people come like hungry fish at feeding and countries then in the siberian work camp and can look at coal," he says.
A Makarow for 100 US Dollar
In purchase illegal shooting weapons, experts must be acquired with prices from 100 to 900 US dollars.
According to Dmitrich Kislow from the "Pravo na oryzhie" organization, you can buy a pyrole from the Makarow type for $100 to $300.
You have to wait until half months.
The weapons are issued in military arms camps of oversights with medium ranges.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the number of crimes with illegal weapons in whole Russia in the period from January to October 2011 was 7% to 22.9.000, while the number of discovered cases of weapons, munitions, springers and plants was 7.8%.
In the United States, fat-food and supermarket employees are strict.
Each fourth US youth is ever sit behind the box of Mc Donald's.
In the past days, there were massive protests in the U.S. against low salt in Walmart and restaurants' branches like Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can predict whether the Protests will be further swimming or whether they are already out of the air.
Protests are supported by workshops and several links-based common organizations.
In addition to the increased wave- and fat-food employees, the Protest organizations follow the goal of establishing workshops.
This sector of the economy has not been workingly organized.
46 cents in the year?
The protests began winning week after thanksgiving, the so-called Black Friday, in the United States sells, which locked millions of customers, which leaded to handling.
To this day, some Walmart employees, with which there are 2,2 million people in the world, were divided into their work together with the workshops and the left active branches of the chain, whose target group is low and medium-sized income.
Walmart sells all products, from winds through jagdgeweh and autobatters to steel sweaters, eggs and milk.
The product in the Walmart Filiales is nearly 8 to 27% more favourable than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many of the low-payed Walmart employees have been buying only in their own workplace.
The prices and goods arrangements made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart is often able to sell the good only so good because the employees are badly paid.
The latter claims also about serious working conditions, for example, lacking gabel staples or handscanners.
The protest participants in the "Black Friday" requested payment increases and expressed their faults that the contribution to the health insurance was increased from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
A typical Walmart employee who pays the hour of 9.5 US dollars, couldn't give this increase, they said.
Scientists from the California University in Berkeley report that if the company increases the average payment of $12 hours, it would cost $3.2 billion.
These are about 1,1% more than they are sold for money now.
If Walmart completely turns the payment rates on the customers, everyone buys them only 46 cents more.
This would be for them in comparison with today's multiple expenditure of only $12,39.
Walmart's claims are satisfied that it was only in nine federal states to Protests and they did not have any losses to the company.
The Black Friday was on his cart from 8:000 ends on Thursday to midday, and in this period Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
Overall, the Walmart casses performed almost 100 million transactions in the "Black Friday".
The speaker of the company, Dan Fogelman, pointed out in an interview on the site of the left addressed Huffington Post, which in total "an older than five" Walmart employees understood the work and protested only "a further PR-trick" of the company organized by the Protests.
"Free Kasse!"
The Protests continued this week in New York, but their goal was not Walmart-filians (which did not wish in this continuous city and therefore there were nowhere), but McDonald's and other price restaurants.
McDonald's says that the company sells thousands of portions, and yet you won't have a hospital day, and you will not pay for your honest job!
Jumae Williams, member of the New York City Council
The minimum loan is at $7.25 according to federal and New York legislation at $7.25.
In Fast Food Restaurants, the minimum loan will be increased after and after, however, not too strong, and the average of its simple employees in New York 8,90 US Dollar gets the hour.
As far as she won no one in this tear city.
As far as it is possible to get so little money in New York, I am incomprehensible.
There was a time in which almost a fourth of all American youths after school at McDonald's theke was behind the theke, but the young people still lived with their parents.
Someone saw the main income source or planted to stay there longer.
Now, at interviews, I'll meet the permanent people of McDonald's workers who have to be acknowledged that they're going out with this loan and sometimes have to eat their children.
On the other hand, in the Wall Street Journal forum, there is a comment that notes the advisor that is unresponsive to get children if you don't know how to eat them.
The participants of the protest that began on Thursday at 6.30 p.m. before McDonald's was 40th Street and Madison Avenue, requested that the cassetteries and machines of fast-food restaurants receive a minimum wage of 15 US dollars, which corresponds to a doubledness of the current minimum lounge.
They continued to demand the training of workshops in the fast-food sector.
The U.S. Law prohibits the undertaking to strike this goal and to dismiss or delay fellow members.
On the other hand, the company management does not make it easy for them.
However, the creation of workshops in the Fast Food Framework is also difficult for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high personal flow.
Unfriendly
Lautstarke Protests were also found before many other Fast Food restaurants in Manhattan.
The high point of protest was a congregation on midday before the McDonald's at Times Square, where some local democratics spoke, including member of the city, Jumae Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it sell billions, and yet you won't have a hospital day, and you will not be paid for your honest work!"
The demonstrates also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, civilian candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "what should together support the Fast Food employees in order to receive a fair reward and achieve the economic well-being that every New Yorker wins!".
According to New York Times, this was the biggest action of her kind in the history of the American Fast Industry.
However, only hundreds of people in place were employed by Weitems, not all in the Fast Food Branch, where they worked at ten thousands in New York.
Not yet is to see whether the cell of these proteins will be mobilized by all the mass.
"The brain can only be slowly overlooked."
The theme of the enlarged reality in modern technologies is commonly understood by the line of a special bridge in recent time.
First, Google presented an functioning model in the summer at its annual conference, then announced in November that Microsoft also registered a relevant patent.
In conversation with the leader of the group for interactive 3D technologies in the Microsoft Lab in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, however, it is clear that the bridge for the scientists of the company was only a starting station.
It has the possibility to manipulate virtual objects in the air with blue hands and to create virtual surfaces.
- Please describe what research your group is.
- We are employed with the interaction of human and machinery, but we want to expand the borders of this interaction.
The majority of humanity has remained in the phase, where with pixels is worked on flash screens, which sometimes are touched.
However, we want to expect 5-10 years and predict the radical changes of this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are a progress, and today no xbox will be sold without kinect, as everyone is interested in movement control.
- What's going on in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, many still play on the flash screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could not be improved, and the output is not yet decisive.
We try to change this, working in real three-dimensional display systems on the basis of various technologies, including projections.
We need to leave the computer world in our physical world and make them more fascinable.
However, it is necessary that not only the user is recognised, but also its environment.
Then we could add the real world much easier by virtual objects.
And at first, we should lose this shocked Virtual Reality Help!
What do you think about language control?
She's popular, but isn't she not overlooked?
- She's not sure that the Allzweek resolution is not because they face questions on the privacy because they do not always want to inform all persons about his actions and desires.
Indeed, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but everyone in their specific necks.
For example, we worked in the field of control of objects on public places at a project in which we experienced with short and short-cut, instead of loading animals.
The beasts were recorded not by the object camera, but by a braking band that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, however, theoretically could be reduced to the size of a arm offer.
However, the future, however, belongs to mixed control types, such as gesty and language.
- How is that?
- We would ask me for example to rise this spudel doses?
They said it and said it at the same time.
- Normally, I just say it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to recognize.
- Do you want the user to adapt to what a machine can lead at any time and what not?
- Not anyway, but it's about a mutual approach.
I think that in the next time, in particular, we need to work on the development of new sensors, which will enable people to make reactions more accurate.
This can be, for example, laser scenarios, because they offer a good resolution, which is very important.
- What requirements do you start from your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors at modern cameras?
Is there no solution, depth or something else?
- This generation is basically a good start point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixel with a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main cases are not the megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and deep.
In this way, all current technologies are not enough for us, as the developers of the algorithms have more work.
It must not only be taken into account during the X and Y, but also during the Z axis.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
Human movements are extremely dynamic and open, the current 30 fps are too few for animals.
Stephen Betishes developed in our laboratory in Redmond with a regular delay of processing between 1 and 100 billion times, with the current commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of human and machines.
For my work, I needed exactly such a device, only without driving control and with more images per second.
- Should the number of cameras not be increased?
- Kinect currently works with three "cameras", with one of which actually is a infrastructurer and the second is a recipient for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a normal RGB camera.
It does not serve to calculate the length of the object.
More cameras could probably solve the problem...
Or strengthening the problem because more calculations would be needed.
It would be a flexible, cunect-specific system in which we could play with different cameras to determine how it helps us to identify a position in the three-dimensional position.
- If I'm right to remember, Microsoft, on the contrary to Google, presented his bridges, not the public.
Do you not think that, in terms of the application of the technology of extended reality, the brill has the best perspectives for every day?
- of course, it is not appropriate to keep a smartphone in the hand, but I think the greatest variant would be a "changing" reality in which we could switch through a cloud from the brill on the smartphone,
The brill is a personal gadget and there is its strength (Privates can only see you), but also their weaknesses, because an enlarged reality through Brille prevents you to work together with other virtual objects.
- Let's propose a minute that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is available not only by Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also by normal deaths.
There is a problem that is the critic of this idea often indicated: there is no feeling reaction!
The hands aren't feeling nothing!
What answers your group wants to give to this invitation?
In my discussion, I often say that the enlarged reality represents the seventh interaction between human and machinery.
I think that the eighth interruption could be through the integration of taxi approval.
A interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as an infinite projection.
She takes great pressure!
However, there are also technologies that are actually designed to give the "picturers in the air" something of hands, for example, generate the interference of certain Ultraschall rails in a particular point where the finger is located, a feeling that is still too weak, as someone put over the handballs.
There are also burns for hands that affect nervous changes in the fingers, and that is also a potential direction.
- Have you tried to list the brain?
Is it let it feel what it should feel when it's just seeing something?
- That's a good idea, so we didn't try it.
There is a further task that we have to fight for a long time, a person who is physically in a closed room, which is in place in an open, practically infinite space; here we work on concepts with land countries (other than in Fitness Studios), moved platforms and large clouds.
For now, the brain is only lowly able to overlook, and there are still many working years before us.
Indeed, the work on the area of virtual reality for a researcher is so attractive: In many themes, we are just starting.
ownership instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues to set the "Petersburger Avantgarde" project, which is intended for the inhabitants of the city, which forms the prior garden of art and culture.
On the list read, high-range representatives of Petersburger Artscene, whose successes were out of the borders of the city, and who are often recognized in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new herd of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the beats covered in red, at a time at the Russian Museum, once at the summer garden, once at the scene tests or on snakes.
Where the pictures of Kirill Miller are also posted, they find great human mass.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburger social philosophy artists who created new myths.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant personality of Petersburger Avantgarde at the end of the 1980s or beginning of the 1990s.
He is also a man of the city and smiling by his presence on the street his fellow citizens a laugh in the face and cares for them good laune.
Before recently, he took himself a drehorgel and became a Petersburger Drehorgel player, since he finally feeled ready for this difficult role in regard to his artists, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in Gelb or Turkey in the city?
I chose the red color as a model designer that is equipped with the optic and image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artists, image advisers and society.
In the society, everything that disappears from the grain, aggressions and bad behaviour.
But I want to talk to people through my promiscuations.
Each of my past prookations was a invitation to talk.
- How long did you know that you had to be mad?
- In an exhibition in the Newski culture, where my works were employed.
I mean, I have to go to this way.
Then the time of the old free, but not officially recognised times ended, and new and free times as I was incomprehensible.
I was pleased with the males of the new generation, so with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; then it was "Puschkinskaja 10", and then it was just one time.
It's me to the theatre, to mode, to music, in fact to all, except the literature.
And all this joined in your type clinic was important to stand in the center of the Petersburg culture where the best artists should be gathered.
In 1995 I placed a room in Pushkinskaja 10 and there was a musical-artist club for Boheme, the house of Petersburger Boheme until renewal.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzzzz, and I remember how Snur with his "Ucho Van Goga" project came there.
Snur and his friends read simple songs for play-back, tender trikots and also belonged to the recommended composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group began to play life, it became from her "Leningrade".
Suchtenberg modernized many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it started his great career, but he learned the bases with us.
The "D 137" gallery or the "Griboedov" club also have their origin in the art clinic.
Dorthin went to our employees and guests.
I am a hero of the last century, as a culture still means something.
In 2000 there was an investigation in the press on which it was called "Persistence of our city."
I won in the category "Charest of the Year" and I was starting at the top point.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a man of the truth, honestity and culture of the last century.
Today, it is easy to be famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without giving an cultural contribution.
Your work has an unreconscious style.
- Many of my images are real perlens and make clearly expressing the actuality and the intensity of the thoughts.
I'll have an exhibition with the "The Russian Museum as clowns."
Clowns are untime.
Before I was social, but now I'm worried and ready to be so.
In a clown, it's all and lost his tragic.
I love the Groteske, and I have great ideas.
Let us save the world, for example, prescribeing that everyone has fully closed.
Now everybody takes care of the clothing, oriented on the east and not in the inside of man.
But maybe you don't have to give a man the hand, but you should smell him in the face.
The exhibition disappeared by the clothes.
We saw you in the role of the city drewling player, a cultural city should have a hero.
Who, if I don't?
- Can you also be good commercial art?
- Today, commercial art must be careful, careful and smellful.
We see the scene of cultures.
Before the people were large groups: the Bohemians loved the one and the simple people.
There are micro communities now, and it is difficult to fall all.
I'm not a hundred dollars note that everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you're going to be.
Now every Kurtstar has about 100 bands.
- At Stas Michailow's arrival, but several thousands!
- The women left to him, where the sexual and social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people come and not 10 thousands, so there is less management, money, and everything is based.
I have a lift, and it's the most important thing to do with it, and not to destroy the achievement.
In my youth, I made such pictures that even in a series of works with Falk and Larionow.
I started with images that normally come to the end of the career.
Today there are often misunderstandings.
It means spiritual culture and consumption.
Consum has no culture, that's something quite different.
I am a man of the past culture and wept with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and dismissed money to be able to defeat.
That's the culture I'm favorable.
- Kirill, what's wrong with Petersburg?
- Good cultures.
They say, "Servants of the culture.
But not everyone of them can be cultural.
With the real strikes it was different, because the rings may not understand much of culture, but they understood that the right experts are necessary.
There are now good advisers in Moscow.
In Petersburg, we have whom the experts may be, but they will be disabled, since there are higher experts needing to evaluate the first ones correctly and free their way.
Now it's only the own shock.
The same applies to the error, however, with the difference that they honestly say that they do not take all the timely art and therefore look for other museums.
- What is Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the capital of the culture; there is much more culture and a corresponding pool in Moscow.
On our stones, art can only grow hard.
We need a cultural soil, for for example, we have more writers than readers, and that's not right.
In Europe there are many new people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
It's much less with us.
Arts must be back modern, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is financed by support of the city of Sankt Petersburg
Birth in the world
Earth is in danger.
Earth warming or consumption with killer steroid.
Karawans of space ships with earth-residents on board are searching for a replacement plan.
To save humanity, is the important question how we can continue in the weakness or on the replacement plan?
There are many options that I don't think.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least be hypothetical.
"After Mars and Venus," the scientist of the Astronomic Sternberg Institute Wladimir Surdin says.
However, while the conditions on Mars are compared to life friendly, a temperature of 500 degrees is dominated on the surface of Venus.
Life would be only in large size or in the circle of Venus, so in all.
The question of continuing plants in all were first treated by researchers in respect of Flora.
A half years ago, experiments were performed with plants.
The fourth generation of the horbited herbs did not differ from the earthquakes.
It followed the shift of insects, precisely of changing fruit flights (drosophila) in orbit.
In 1979, the Watch Tower was sent to the world to investigate how the deficiency affects the development of Embryos.
It developed a very normal kitchen.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the kitchen must find a stop; it must stand on its legs and start moving", explains the laboratory leader of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems, Wladimir Sychew.
Without a fixed substance, the cups will be shocked.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborn were completely declined.
The kitchen did not react to light and laugh.
Four days later they died simply.
"We left the cups ten times and then put the whole thing, because it is easy to work there with them," Wladimir Sychew observes to experience with the cups all over.
The last wheelchair with animals flyed in the orbit 16 years ago.
In spring 2013, the experiences are continued.
However, on the biostellite "Bion", there will only be similar kinds of sex.
There was a experiment with Rattes that were already nutged to all.
In principle, there was no special consideration in this regard.
"This was just with the biostellites, but again it was only a single experience, and research needs to be continued," notes Wladimir Sychew.
After the load, the world space radars have been shocked.
The problem of continuation of the world's space could not be resolved directly.
The task is difficult.
The animals that are retreated from their natural living space simply cannot follow their continued plantation.
On the contrary to animals, the human could be the principle.
Homo sapians are too attractive and can create a similar emotional background.
Such experiences are not performed from ethical considerations.
But women have been flying to all for 50 years.
The largest risk was in Tereschkova.
The most value of humanity is the women's body.
Our Möses fled from this, and no one on the earth could answer the following questions: Does it overcome the world space?
Can they bring a child to the world after this flight?
“Another answered this question,” says the room veteran Watch Tower.
In June 1964, only one year after its world space, the first woman’s cosmonautin, Valentina Tereskova, was a daughter.
The father of the child, Andreian Nikolajew, was also Kosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in all, Swetlana Sawizkaja, who was in Orbit two times and even worked outside the room vehicle, was a son.
However, it remains a risk.
We've only been very few cosmonautes in which everything went well after long flights and they've got healthy sweet.
"Besides, more dangerous is it itself at flights in the Orbit," concludes Cosmonaut Waleri Poljakow, the Herd of the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation.
But humanity must be looking for new ways in biotechnology, raw protection and producer artificial gravitation.
The hydrolaboration in the cosmonauth centre is a binding station during the flight preparation.
Here, in a Sweden situation, the cosmonauten rutine wins for the work in the open world space.
The water represents the weakness.
Even if adult water is pleasant, it is a foreign environment; but sweet water is a natural element.
It is like the small iotyander witness that life in the country was decreased to the ocean.
There is a relationship between the fact that a child is located about nine months in the slaughter of the mother in the fruit water, and that it can be easier to water.
In principle, it is logical, since the birth is just two weeks away from birth to the first skin.
"This is too little time to forget something," says baby-inducer Marina Aksenowa.
While weakness is a lot more natural condition for a newborn child, the woman does not have a weakness.
In the state of weakness, the muscle of bottle and beverage is slowly returned, and it also decreases the ability to express the child.
Well, we're going to do this by means of help.
For example, the birth could also occur in a special chamber to express the child.
"But what happened then?" said the uncertain question of Waleri Poljakow.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial weakness.
Without the earthquake, the organism can't form the skelet and muscles.
A newborn child in orbit cannot be shocked as an adult to train in a loading deal.
He will simply lack what is elementary for his life.
"This experiment, which we are in common, is the birth of a child in a foreign environment, leads us to a disability to bring a perfectly unjusted people to the world," said the director of the Bioethic Mission of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
Before the birth of children in the world is only theory.
But at any time, it will be reality when the earth's populations are cut into their roomships to a far planet that will be the home for her birth in all the birth.
NKU Chief: Control of the Black System injured by debts of policy
The Czech Republic has public contracts on good control institutions and adequate laws, however, returns to its application.
In the conversation for Aktualn.cz, the Vice-President of the Supreme Control Labour (Nejvyší controlní úśad, NKU), Miloslav Kala.
"A law has never been perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and this is my view not the case," Kala comments the current situation.
A similar result seems to be a common control through Czech and German tests.
As a negative practice game, he introduces the setting of Prime Minister Petr Nečas to sug. "Schwarz-system".
The Prime Minister said that the ODS would not defeat the employees with controls - is the system now prohibited or allowed?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is legally prohibited, then the President cannot just come to the government, and the control law which is now the control of the fulfilment of the law is in its activities," Kali states.
At the meeting of the Committee on Control of the Chamber, you have spoken about a joint Czech-Deutche project in which the laws of both countries relating to public contracts were compared with each other.
What was that concrete?
This is a parallel test that we have started about two years ago.
Only said, the European legislatives are determined how public contracts are undertaken, and the national legislation will build up, and finally there is still a practical application.
This has all been compared with each other, and although the test is not yet closed, we could find extremely interesting differences. Generally, the laws may even be something "stricter and perfecter", the real application is better in Germany in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not sufficient to keep new and more accurate rules, and it must also be considered with the actual application of the law.
How can the project be helped? What does you get from this project?
Indeed, such a common control could help us stop trying to pursue the laws and to reduce and deteriorate weaknesses, if this is not likely to be particularly positive.
Economy means to purchase something to a reasonable price (what is not always the lowest price) and exclude unlawful areas or criminal acts.
But the reduction of weak values for contracts does not guarantee that we achieve this goal.
Maybe it is even that we're just taking the system in this way with a excessive "papierkram" and those who are looking for swimming in the system, it's essentially easy to use the system than the weaknesses remained higher.
They are talking about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Republic.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority like our NKU here, or does the system work differently?
In terms of the authorities, the German Pendant on NKU of the Federal Accounting Court, which is similar to us and also has a college, which is only a different thing, but in fact both authorities are working similar.
The competences are also comparable to a certain measure, but Germany is a Federal State, i.e. these accounts also exist in the individual federal countries, which differs from our German system.
The BRH is only to control the federal resources, which corresponds to our state resources.
The public resources, which are managed by us by the areas and communities, are under the control of the country accounting rates.
What about German legislation is the easier than ours?
I would generally compare this without concrete information, but indeed, Germany is often called an example, but it is not possible to say that Germany is better.
Maybe it seems to be the tests better there?
That's not true, but as he said: I don't like such comparisons.
It is still noted that those countries who are an example have to fight also with problems.
On the other hand, they had no cooperation with our authority, did they?
What about the Czechian legislation, which importance had for your authority the renewal of the tax law, do you feel any effects?
In view of the fact that this novel is in force only a short time, it does not act in our tests until now.
Since our controls are slowly carried out, we need to receive a certain delay here.
The effects of the preparatory phase of the future controls are to be examined and analyzed, so we introduced the new control instrument "Evolution of risks of imeconomicness" and tested and analyzed by this almost 14.000 public contracts - will be surely affected by the changes, as we change the weakness values that have changed the conditions for certain types of description, etc.
Do you see the adoption of this law more positively, or is the system with further officercracy?
I think that this law will be a step in the right direction and hope that this adoption is confirmed.
However, the problem is that the rules are "stricter" and cannot be maintained.
The persons subject to a testing (e.g., in case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) shall therefore take account of any non-compliance with the payment law of the budgetary discipline.
What, then, is it a sense to make the law more stretched?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and misuse the system, and not punish those who have started a form error, which does not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system only makes the officecracy more pressure.
Where's the way out here?
First of all, let us tell what way it is not targeting.
The Prime Minister said unexpectedly that the ODS would not rejoice the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "shvarz-system" - what is exactly what is that?
Is the black system now prohibited or allowed?
However, a law must have its validity, and if something is legally prohibited, it cannot just come to the President of the Government, and the control law which is now the control of the compliance of the law is in its activities.
He can say: "We change the law and allow the matter," but he cannot say that we do so as if nothing.
The payment law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain procedures, and it is also right for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, however, it is also tragic when the bigger is excluded with the best offer alone because of form errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be used correctly - and that's what I think is missing.
On the roads, it is a single ice plate, but they are sweet.
On the streets of Czech Republic, there are partly snow and iron plates.
However, the roads are well travelable, with increased care.
Karlsbad
In the area of Karlsbad, the streets were well travelable tonight, united with dominated snow and iron plates.
Temperatures cut up -5 to -10 °C, on dayly, it should be something warmer.
In the region, it is no longer cut, and in the deepest levels only remains a thicker snake.
However, there are about 30 cm snee on the snakes of the earthquake.
According to details of the central road waiting, Nebels was limited to view.
The R6 speed roads and the roads of the first road class in the region are currently unlimited.
However, it is offered attention to bridges where the trains are required and slightly.
On the same occasion, all roads of the second and third road class, including the mountain streets, are available.
However, on these roads, they shall remain specifically required or experiencing neighbors.
In particular, in the higher levels, it has therefore been offered increased attention.
Bezirke Pardubice and Hradec Kralové
On some streets, it is dangerous because of the ice floor, in higher lakes, and in the mountains is located on the streets with a swimming swimming swimming swimming snake, the roads and train directions are shared on their websites.
The road measuring drivers warned the ice floor, especially in higher places in the pardubice district.
It can, in particular, be transported by the second and third road classs in the Lanšcroon Circle, Ustí nad Orlici, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Möto.
The roads I/43 and I/34 with Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snee is especially on the streets in the Riesenberg and in the Orlické mountain.
A exhibited snake is located on the streets of the circle Rychnov nad Knśnou and Trutnov.
In the east trees, it is overwhelmingly swimming or heavy today, and it remains widely free of shock.
The temperatures move between -3 and +1 °C, it eats a weak wind.
Nearly Pilsen
The roads in the district of Pils are well travelable today, however, locally has increased attention, and the pathway is adapted to the weather.
This morning is frozen, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below the fridge point.
Since it has been done before and then cut the temperatures, it can be on the streets to iron plates.
It is also necessary to count up with nebel, but the vision will be improved in the day.
These information are derived from the district railways.
The D5 cars are almost unlimited, but higher attention recommends road mediterranees between 80 and 131 km.
The trains of the first road class are overwhelmed, but frozen.
However, in the south of the circles and tachov, there can be ice plates.
The trains of the second and third road class are weighted, and therefore the reference to possible sections is also applicable.
The drivers should mainly be careful on the less frequent roads in the Bohmerwald area.
Olomouc
With sneematch, drivers today have to receive, in direction of the high places in the Oleomouc district.
After the use of shipping vehicles, Sneematsch remains on the path śervenohorské sedlo and on the road in direction Videlskå kśí.
Tonight snakes swimming roads to use, in the circle Šumperk, there are some information about the road management of approximately 3 cm new.
In the remaining areas of the area, the trains are mostly unlimitable.
"The Circs Šumperk remains in the high places even in the east of the neighborhood.
On the sleevehorsk passage, the drivers must be able to recall in direction Jeseník with sneematsch," said a worker of the road management Šumperk today towards the Agency.
Their colleagues in the circle Jeseník had to get out of the night, according to their information, the roads are free and naked to the levels after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc circle, the roads are unlimited, but the drivers need to walk carefully in wood boards, since the trains are still featuring here.
Bezirk Ústí nad Labem, Bezirk Liberec
In the northern pools, the roadways are noted as well as several badly available road sections.
Besides several places with snow or ice floor, the mountain roads from Telnice to Knínice are locked in the circle of UTTI N.K., according to the information of the transport police.
The temperatures remain in deep levels below zero, so that the snow and iron are on the roads. From the depths, especially in the south of the Bohem Mediterranean area, there are no problems reported, and the streets are normally swimming.
No traffic disorders have been reported.
It is noted, in particular, from the surrounding of Štśti.
According to the details of meteorologists, there were ideal conditions in the night - day over rain and swimming snow, in the night without swimming heaven and Frost.
From the main lines and from the road I/13 at the border of the districts Ústé n.L. and Liberec are reported bad transport conditions.
The switch of the road between Telnice and Knínice was needed because of the east pressed by the snowload to the trains.
Šimon Ornest: We want to collect positive energy on our concerts
What do you think about the need to happen in less than one month in the world?
This is one of those disaster messages that we like to start people so much.
With our band The Tap Tap, we make it easier and say that we are the only band of the world that can collect sufficiently positive energy to keep or prevent the world.
In December, you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the world interruption.
Can you present our readers the project closer?
This is a country-wide beneficiary session that we have planned for two years.
For this, we want to use the marketing potential of Maya Customer whose end is prognosed for 21 December at 11:10 a.m.
On the day before, on December 20, three concerts are located in Prague, Brno and Ostrava at the same time as at 21:00 p.m.
The end of the concert will be around the time, which is on the Kiribati Pacific, which is at a time zone of 12 hours before us, the Maya calendar ends.
Who's this idea?
Originally from me, afterwards, we have completed the idea together with our graphic Honza Augusta.
We do not only want to collect sufficiently positive energy to prevent the world's interruption, but we also want to think together with the public about the situation in which we give this world once our children.
On the end of Maya calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, Taschens and Key Chains against the world's interruption, with which the buying of www.e-tap.cz can also support us.
The band The Tap Tap has also included the sog. Hymne against the world interruption with the title "World interruption".
Soon today the hymne is very popular on YouTube. Does it also get to the Benefice Concerts?
Surely, even in the conclusion, it predicted that everything's crazy and that the world's interruption is not happening...
The Hymne is to be sing at all three concerts simultaneously.
The hymns will also live together in a direct maintenance of the Czech TV.
The text of the Hymne is of Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main image of Jesus in the video clip, also sing Xindl X with...
How have you come to cooperate with both?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultures, which involves that we realize many benefits events and concerts...
We are trying to connect these people intensively in our projects.
This has shown that most of us are interested in cooperation with us, and they have enjoyed it.
What is the purpose of resolving the concerts against the world’s transition?
For the establishment of the barrier free education centre Studeo, in which we worked together with the United Nations Tap in the Jedlička Institute for six years.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly employed by lectors which help them in different free-time activities.
Because the students themselves do not have the means to visit the lectors, we want to help them in this way.
In the context of the preparation of the Jedlička Institute, it is intended to be a building in which we enter with this project.
There are several groups and interviews in each concert.
What criteria have you seeked this?
We wanted to set up a program that applies to all generations, including children.
For example, in Praga, Chinaski, Lesbian support, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiśí Suchī.
Any more learn on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "great events" planned for the future?
In May we will first start to the Prayer's spring, and for this concert we also provide an interesting program with interesting guests.
The next year, we would like to be in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are once in the United States - would also like to connect this with income in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not just small, until you have already occurred in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
However, the Tap Tap is a group that consists of people with disabilities.
How do you handle these trips logistic and organized?
It's not so bad as it appears at the first time.
Five of our members are roll steel drivers, i.e. the roll shops have to be transported in the bathroom. Of course, we need to switch a lot of instruments and other bags...
Nevertheless, it has always been aware of any problems, ŠSA and British Airways had always been very well prepared to us that I sometimes have been a lot of surprise.
Even in Moscow, where we were, there were no problems.
With your foreign travels, you have a comparison as it looks like in the individual countries with barrier freedom, how you look around there with disfellowshipped people, etc.
How have you experienced these things?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, in which everything works better than us, we were just in Russia that everything is still in the east.
On the other hand, Moscow is not absolutely disbelieved. There is still uncommon if someone is in the Roll Steel alone in the city center.
There is not even a real sense that you have a roll staircase, for example.
Happily there are also crimes that are trying to deal with the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what sense we need to take up towards the developing countries?
There are still many things we're going back...
However, it is still noted that the improvement of the situation depends on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely normal that people also have serious difficulties move in the public room, go to the museum, and they can use toilets, etc.
But it is not just normal that there is a larger group of people actively in the social events, where we are a little predicted with the band The Tap Tap Tap to the West!
Respect in public freedom and barrier freedom is a matter, but only when our series of important sports, artists, players, politicians or lawyers are really starting to change the matter.
Together, this is only individual cases of particular desirable personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular. But if we return a few years: What has you motivated to build a band in 1998?
Since then, I started as an overseer in the Jedlička Institute where I met many young people who were interested in working with something intensive.
And since I'm a musician, and I'm playing Saxofon, I've found a music-AG together with a colleague.
Well, and with the time, this is the way our moderator, Láśa Angelovič, wants to say something other than control.
But in the last few years, the band was known, or do I?
It is true that we have helped the cooperation with known songs, and we have also started to get active for us.
We have become aware that if you do something and this is not seeing outside, the own performance in certain sense does not exist.
Thanks to the EU supporters, we can also provide good lectors, high-quality devices, etc.
Was it your goal to bring it so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I realized the potential that the things may be different.
In showbusiness, today most of them are copied.
This is logical in its way, since all new ones are regarded with care and only accepted after a longer period of time.
There are only few really unique things, and I'm going to say that Tap Tap belongs to it.
The first impression that the observer has most is, of course, suffering; this is just of course...
But this suffering is absolutely overwhelming because people with disabilities are not unique and abandoned things that we should regret.
There are people who live a full life and can develop, if they have the necessary resources.
I always say that if people with disabilities happen, this is not only a progress for themselves, but for the whole society.
Have it also helped you to be a stronger leader, how to hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you must not take compromise in many things and require a certain discipline.
But I think this is totally normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and when they find that they have two times the week tests, they need to complete preparation phases and carry a lot of time on controversial trips, then the shocking is quick.
But it works everywhere, in every band, that seriously works and wants to achieve something.
The Tap Tap has twenty members now.
How many of them were from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Laáśa Angelovič.
We're a open group, people come and go, that can't be prevented.
Whoever has the will and the joy of the kitchen is always welcome with us.
Find place on the day before the prognosed world break, Wednesday on 20.12.2012 at 21.00 p.m.
Events are: Incheba-Arena/Prag, Fleda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czechian bands and other musicians
All three events will be connected to the conclusion by Live-scling and it encounters a common interpretation of the Hymne "World interruption" of the Band The Tap Tap Tap.
The aim of the concert is to include the resources for the allocation of a multifunctional transactional education centre that should be in Praga in the Jedlička Institute.That: 25 million CZK
The entry costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free, cards are available for sale at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the world space.
Poland was held at a Council of Ministers of the European Space Organization of Member States as a twenty-first member of this World Space Authority, and Poland was the second member of the former East Block (on the Czech Republic, which was member of the ESA on 12 November 2008).
In 1994, Poland began close cooperation with the EESC and participated in several EES projects in the following years.
Poland’s way in the world space began much early.
Shortly before the Second World War, the Poland cosmos switched with the room, not always understood.
For example, I recall the presentation of A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 in Warschauer Observatory, in which the author thought from his pioneer work "Eingang to Cosmonautic".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (e.g. 1905) left the listeners cold, and after years, stores field still remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld wins in 1934 for "Eing to Cosmonautic" the price REP-Hirsch created by Robert Esnault and André Louis Hirsch.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), later, became a major defender of the astronomy and the space vehicle.
In Poland, he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis worldly recognised contribution to the development of the space passenger was acknowledged by one of the craters was appointed on the landscaped side of the month following him.
Prepared in 1925 in Poland was built a iron dryline for which a raketen operating was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rats should be used for starting or breathing of the dragons.
The information to this end is only from the temporary press.
In 1933, Poland’s infantry began to be treated with smokeed shocks.
The research work conducted the Comorka Techniki Usebrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
The documents provided show that the research was predicted until the stage of practical tests.
The investigation was then interrupted freely by the inmarch of the German War Force.
In 1937, in the press of the project by Ing. Rohozičski, a photo-electronic jagdraket was launched, and in the following year, the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietzna i rakietobomba lolnicza" of the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky.
Both projects have been discussed with military use of the Raketen operation.
Shortly before the war, all projects for military use of raketentechnology were coordinated by the Interim Science Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Committee Doradczo-Naukowy).
The Committee was established in 1937, but its work was completed by the beginning of the war.
Another article on space passenger appears after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Railway Society (Polskie Towarcystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first consideration of this company is carried out in November 1954 in the magazine Problemy, where four major items of the space passenger have been issued.
The article of Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the creation of a space transport company.
At the time there were the first projects on satellite technology, and it was expected that the research of the world space would have the future.
In 1956, the Polish Railway Company was prepared to join the International Railway Federation, founded in 1951, and in fact the PTA was a general member in autumn 1956.
The following year, the first President of the International Railway Federation was Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959).
This office was engaged until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA participated in the development of the extremely successful meteorological rats (Rakieta meteorologiczna), the first Poland rakes for scientific research.
The first guy, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first start was held on 10 October 1958.
Raketes with a maximum airline of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and were not totally 5 kg.
Later, a improved version of RM-1A was built, and 1959 began in the Bśdów-West aircraft tests with the RM-2 second stairway.
The rat was 1,4 m long and was about 11,5 kg.
A further stage of development should already be able to provide real scientific work - the rats RM-34 should reach a flight height of up to 14.5 km and be used to observe high winds.
However, in 1962 the further development was established.
Followers of the first rakes of the type RM were the meteor-1 rakes developed in the 1962-65.
The rats were designed as a two-through rat, its total length was 510 cm and the start weight was 32.5 kg.
From these rakes were developed three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differ in the size of the transport room for scientific instruments.
The meteor-1A rakes had a transport room with 0.4 litres, meteor-1B over 0.34 litres and meteor-1C over 0.62 litres.
The maximum airline was 37 km of all three types.
In the 1965-1968 Aviation Institute, the Meteor-2 Rakes was developed, which began the first aircraft tests in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a 10 kg use rate in an height of approximately 60 km.
Then the versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
In 1960, the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Commissions for Space Research) was also followed by the establishment of a national COSPAR committee on two years later.
Poland also participated in the World Space Research Programme with Soviet satellites, and in 1978, the Poland pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut.
The adoption of the Law on Common Works is not a solution.
In the past week, the Constitutional Court found the Law on Common Works.
This decision introduced a vital discussion in the public.
It is certainly interesting to consider the issues of a broader perspective.
The liberalized economic systems in the EU and globalized world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
Finally, this means that individual people's economies are in a permanent conflict.
This is why the principle of free trade and free, unlimited movement of the private capital, which is in hand with ungoing financial speculations.
On the basis of the great differences of the value of work (Travel) it comes to price trends.
This means that the manufacturer is a state in which it tries to exist in economic competition through imports of favourable goods by he "submits" the competitiveness to increase the market share in itself and increase its profits.
This means that most enterprises are to make their manufacture in the foreign, or to purchase their business, but it is a high unemployment in countries with comparable high work costs.
As the private capital does not have a social responsibility and does not have a responsibility for the unemployment caused by it, it is necessary to increase the State expenditure.
This will still strengthen the fact that the employees are absolutely unwanted to pay their taxes and to replace the general economic and social damage caused by them.
This situation is generally known so that concrete statistics are overwhelming in this place.
The inconsistent practice of the private capital creates a situation in which the Governments are able to join competitiveness, in order to switch the social level of their own population artistically and thus switch foreign capital into the country.
In other words, the governments provide their own population without regard to the social consequences of the private capital.
This is especially in amendments to the existing legislation.
The objective of these measures is to force the own population to accept the dictate of the private capital, in particular in the payment area.
This happens to one of the long-term unemployment rates, and otherwise by enhancing the rights of the employee.
The results are growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between arm and kingdom.
In Germany, for some years, there are public food allocations for arms who are not yet able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of persons concerned is already in the million.
In order to increase the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases in which employees receive such low payment that the State must reduce their income to the minimum of existing.
Such skandal was also found in the case of the aid forces employed in the German Federal Day.
Specifically all the Southern EU countries will, of course, depend on the same condition where people are able to migrate under the pressure of a catastrophic deterioration of their social level (such as it was the case in the 19th century), or to give a decline in the border of society, and to hope that any private investment capital will be flewn into the country.
This is naturally the question where this capital comes?
If it comes from another EU country, the poverty from a country to another is only to the other; or the capital remains the same as, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco, and Egypt, and Africa, the employees are working for a brown of European ransoms.
This concerns the whole Latin America.
Liberal theories and media indicated that the State cannot participate with capital in its own national economy, and that planning is leading to economic disaster.
The privacy capital is aware of its view that the State cannot be able to enter the economy slowly.
But then you must ask whether the private capital does not affect the policy and thus the whole State in its own selfish sense.
This is the clear answer: Yes.
The evidence of this is the existence of a practically all-powered lobby in all countries.
The result is a doubtful situation in the area of corruption, mutual provision, legislation in which it is practically strict but nothing punishable.
In Germany, the situation is that a State minister has no financing, closely with the industry, is undertaken by the preparation of legislative projects.
These legislative proposals are then adopted on the Federal Day.
All violences are not more exempted by the people, as they pronounce the Western Constitutions, but by strong financial groups who are presenting their own interests.
Of course, the liberal democracies were now rapidly in a situation as they described Appian in their work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at Césars and Pompeius times: "The state has been declared for a long time, and the employees were arrested with violence.
On the smile payment, by an illicit enquiry of advantages or with stone and sword.
The corruption was uncomfortable, and the people began to speak with already baptized voices to choose... "Man with characters did not have to be elected for employers, so that the State had no consultation for eight months after this decline"... "The only medicine in this serious situation was a single rule, and that a strong man should be chosen"... Appian thought to Pompeius, but then the strong man was finally César, who was the democracy to be replaced by the only rule of the government.
As is shown, today's society is found as well as in the antiquity on the unrespective preference of the own benefit, without respecting common social interests.
The private capital is no longer able to recognise and implement the advantage of the whole society.
The result, as today, is a decadence of the elites that do not work to deeply reforms.
The cause of the incidence of fasism and communism must therefore be seen in the unfair liberalization of the economic systems in the 19th and 20th century.
From today's state, the delay of these regimes can be considered for liberal democracy as a certain suspension, in which the next round is already understood.
Especially catastrocal is the fact that today elites are the possible loss of hundreds of thousands of human lives, human and social disasters, whom we are already witnesses, and the crimes against humanity, as we know them from the older and new history, in full ignorance.
The renewal of the Law on Common Works is not a solution, at least not sustainable.
In the pressure of global and European economic competition, Czech will be able to continue to search for ways to press the social level of the population below.
This trend is therefore a system.
The only solution is towards political and social reforms that increase the capital participation of the State in the economy, increase the impact of citizens on the government and deficiencing the monopolization of the private capital in society for the State.
Israel: Labour of Chaos.
"...what nothing comes from violence, or could ever come up," says Sting in the song fraction, which is the most important verses in Refrain: "...for we don't forget how devastating we are."
"If my sons didn't want wars, don't give it", the dead Gutel Schnapper says, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza stretch, there was a number of reactions.
Those who are behind Israel and argue their right to self-defence while they call Palestinians as terrorists; others again support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli State, with the nation banned by Palestinian Arabs and the State of Israel as a terrorist.
I don't want to write to this place whose resurrected waves of the murderer and who is victim; finally, the present inhabitants of Israel, including the self-administration areas in the current political situation and have not experienced the start of violence.
It is me to open the readers the look behind the cults, the view of whom the 95 years of spring (called from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small iceland in the Middle East.
My thoughts are partly based on accessibility historical facts, others are driven by this and go from my own understanding, who or group of people affects the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is, in the main line, a history of the fight against the power.
In each era, we can draw an Alexander to the big or a Napoleon.
What is less likely to be the question of whether it was always these personalities itself, which specifically determined their steps, or whether there was someone behind their throne who led their acts to a predefinite goal.
We must realize that we live in a time where the richness of the world is focused on less individuals in the hand, and that this concentration of the money and the power that comes from it has not been found within a generation.
Under these astronomically rich families, you can be called the head of the crap (I don't know whether there is someone over them, but I did not close this) - the Rothshilds.
Many of them are not written.
Of course.
The first Press Agency (Reuters) has been purchased by the Rothshilds in the 1990s of the 19th century to connect the connection of their name with high-criminal acts, in which the establishment of its power, the reducing of their possessions or both were.
The Rothshilds are involved in almost all the central banks in the world, and against countries where they do not participate in the central banks, they lead wars or struggles to them (before they were seven countries after the transition to Iraq, there were five countries that remained only four after the Structure of Ghaddafis, where Russia has signed its Central Bank in the interim period).
Those who always tried to resolve this family had to pay with their lives.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschilds Bank of America as a Central Bank, began during the civil war, launched its own bank notes and murdered in 1865 in a theater.
J.F. Kennedy began to give his own banknotes and wanted to make the FED -- he was murdered in 1963; the Deputy Louis Mc Fadden was sent to the FED in 1936 after he wanted to resolve the world's economic crisis.
The global powers of the Rothshilds leaded to the formulation of a plan for the detection of three world wars by Albert Pik, a freezer of 33th and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war aimed to eliminate the great monarchist states of Europe, by the second war, should be broken by the colonial rule of the United Kingdom, and the third war aimed to reduce the world population to about 0.5 to 1 billion people (one such number would care for their ancestors and their luxus and would also not consume so many resources), create a universal religion (Ecumenism is nothing more than the preview) and, finally, leads to the overwhelming of the absolute power.
The methods with which the group of the richest families work with the Rothshilds is the solution of a crisis and the next offer (order from chao - order from the Chao).
However, these solutions are wrong and are always leading to the deterioration of the situation (see the foundation of the EDF, so that the crisis as they have been resolved in 1907).
After the murder of the Habsburger Thronfolger Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian Zarenia by the Revolution of Bolswicks.
The first world war ended with the urgent, military and economicly unfair capitalization of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian Zarenia war was no longer necessary), then the resolution of the Mediterranean Great Power of Austria and Hungary.
In order to simplify the Second World War, the bankers made a late conflict situation through the policy by engaged in Germany with giant war repairs; by creating the condition of a war rewarded mass, so they had to join the Germans only a sufficiently strong leader, which called the defenders and offered simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multinational state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which should also take the function of a five-colon, and also be closed to the defence of war.
In the end of the 19th century, the Rothshilds started the creation of the ionist movement, where one of whom the foundation of a Jewish State, as possible on the historical territory of Judas, with Jerusalem as a capital city (Rückkehr to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration already mentioned creates the conditions for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; it became the first part of the Arab population.
Terrorist attacks were on both sides.
The Second World War, and if Hitler was left from the chain, where the international bankers had opened to him, or if everything was planned, it is difficult to estimate, in any case, that the suffering of the Jews in the concentration stocks the conditions for the recognition of the Jewish State by the world.
Israel was founded in 1948, and also prepared by the war repairs against Germany for the Second World War, the call of Israel's State represents the creation of the brandpoint for the third World War.
If it is able to defeat this war by the international bankers, the Jewish people will be similar to the second world war as victims in the first combat line, this time together with the Arab and Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of war and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also international (the only thought of how the people are shared in the covenant and the enemy of Israel).
Who is the guilty and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites, where unrighteousness is solved only in an unlawful spirit of violence, which was at the beginning of the hundred individuals and their efforts toward global power?
There must be a distinction between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, but the international bankers in Israel are put to the choice as well as with us, the people, only their own candidates.
The present Prime Minister of Israel, the Falk Netanjahu, is a typical example of a fascism-based political, the international bankers, who do everything to develop a war with Iran, which, in view of Iran's membership in the Shanghai Organization for Cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan,) could soon extend a global conflict, and which is due to Iran's control over the two miles wide road of Hormus, about 20% of the world's oil supplies, could come to a devastation of the world economy.
In the light of which the words David Rockefellers from 1994: "The only thing we need is a quiet crisis, and people will welcome the new world rule."
In their imagination, the new world order is a world of Lords and slaves.
A world where the rest of human population serves a small group of financial artists.
A world where each newborn is installed at birth a chip to undertake this kind of total control.
"And it makes the little and the great, the riches and the poor, the free and the servants all gives a slaughter to their right hand or to their treasure that no one can buy or sell, because he has the wrong sign, the name of the animal or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom! Whoever has understanding, the number of the animals will overcome.
For it is a number of people, and his number is sixty-seventy."
The Film Argo: If it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a demonstrating Islamic student in Teheran placed the US message and took 52 diplomates as a geisle.
For their release, they requested the extradition of the smooth Shus Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was fled after the revolution in the United States, which had maintained the Patronat over his regime for decades.
The American Government did not have a positive way out of this situation - it could not be able to cut the shadow over board, since this would have been the confidence of her partners in other countries massively damaged.
At the same time, she was not able to engage in Iran where the revolution was in the establishment of a theocratic regime to implement the release of the wheels.
It was a serious smile for the call of the unified States, and then the Fiasko in the violent attempt of freezing was worse.
The arrested diplomates were finally released after 444 days after negotiations were distributed by the Algerian government.
The shift of the legs was a wave of solidarity at home and an anti-iranic estimates.
The Debacle in Iran was a significant contribution to Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan at the presidential election in 1980.
The film Argo of the registors and player Ben Aphleck describes a episode of this story that the United States had a small part-size.
Six messages were flewing before the message was designed.
This ended after many complications in the resident of the Canadian messager.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities to bring refugees out of Iran, helped them a extravagant story to switch their true identity - they traveled with Canadian places as a member of a film stage that was available in the Drehorte for a scientific fiction film.
Combination of genes
The expert for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, developed, also required the cooperation of Hollywoods.
In order to believe the appointment, articles appeared on this film project in spectrums, there were press conferences, and the rational production company had a real office.
The details of this operation were long secret. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Applecks film is a special combination of several film generators.
On the one side, he is a realistic polytroller, but at the same time it is. "Caper Movie", namely, the history of a progressed hospital, such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
In this film the stimulation levels - on the one side the documentars from Teheran (in the title sequence are shown iconic temporary photographs, and there are no major differences in the film review of the same situations).
On the other hand, the locking passengers from Hollywood, which are irone and easyly overlooked.
And then there's still the scenes from the CIA Center and other institutions - men in motions at the board, on the office flows, on the phone...
Ben Appleck is a remarkable new start with this movie.
From a spectacular player, a respectable government has become, and also as a player, he is not now the goal of Iranian comments.
Argo is his third game film after the Krimi Noin child game (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the Triller City without Gnade (2010).
At the same time, it's the first film of Appleck, which does not play in the secret boston of the register.
The scene for the atmosphere of the place was part of the features that deleted the previous films of this register from the standard Hollywoods.
However, Appleck shows this scene also in Argo where Teheran is played in Canada.
The best scenes of the movie play on the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have really occurred - the incoming phase of the struggle of the message is very impressionable in their oversight, and there is yet the feeling of consciousness and inevitableness that involves whenever the story moves.
A similar effect is also achieved by appleck with his team at fixed scenes (the false film tab on a baser in Teheran).
Too much handling to many places
The Governor also had to deal with the fact that the story does not actually offer a lot of slight scenes in the film sense.
But he works successfully, while he sometimes helps the reality - which does not always act so elegant (the scenes where the threatening crisis on the airport in Teheran is used by a telephone at America, or also the persecution year on the starting train, efstructed something).
Argo's weakness is his all-wide relief required by the need to show too much action in many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood workers, but their figures had been more than room, and they are not alone in the film.
Applecks film loses something to driving power. It is a film that can be followed with a certain interest and thus use the training and the retro style for the seventy-year-old retro style.
However, it is only difficult to smell.
It is, however, sufficient when remembering a lifeful part of historic and as a evidence of how the ideas of all powerful and all-known secret services are.
Directives for the discharge of airballs, bananes and circles
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, who calls on an annual investigation on the most affordable bank costs, has decided to register the competition of the "Abusive Regulation or idea from the EU resettlement".
"After this idea, we had the most long-term plan of the EU to introduce a 40% of women in the management of large European companies", said Patrik Nacher, who cares for the organization of this investigation, against the Pravo newspaper.
For example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the harmonization of the insurance courts for men and women is presented under the appointment.
To this end, women have a benefit in life insurance because they are objectively a less risk for insurance companies.
"Incredibly unbelievable accidents from the EU channel can be named until the end of this year.
The real vote will then be followed until the end of February 2013," reported follow-up.
The contraventional regulations of the EU include the binding combination of bioethanol fuel that is naturally harmful, the prohibition of the reliable cocksil thermometers, only because it contains a relatively small amount of this dangerous substance, or also the Directive on the size of hair bottles that have been essentially carried out in this year.
In the past, the factic prohibition of the use of the term "butter retretch" or also the foreign prohibition of sales for cows.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU Appeal Council often decides to press this or the lobby from trade and industry whose demands are made in Brussels in terms of one or several Member States (for example, Czech Republic is now trying to implement the demands for veto drugs).
Lobby interests also found that bananas of the highest trade classes in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and not be able to give up "explication anatomy".
The European Commission defended the argument that they would only harmonize the unilateral national standards that would defeat the trade.
The standards relating to fruit and vegetables were already indicated by the EU against the resistance of certain countries that the above Directives would lead to the promotion of food.
A candidate for the victory in this investigation may be the EU Regulation of the past year, which must be paid under the sale of airballs in order to indicate that children under eight years of age should not be able to cut the airball ball without supervision of an adult.
The EU is a American study that, according to airballs, is the leading cause of children’s death.
A similar limitation is already applicable for children up to 14 years in the use of annual market routes.
Curiose accidents are also home
A directive, which is relatively absurd, is also a directive on the European officials - everyone who takes a official function in the EU, may not use the name of Macedonia, instead of saying FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) because of the sensitivity of the topic of Greece.
The Bankovnipoplatky.com server was appointed in cooperation with the Liberal Economy Association Laissez Faire, in addition to the absurdities, also the EU Regulation on the scope of foodstuffs in the field of a Member State.
The EU thus set up the maximum level of foodstuffs that were held on the day of our EU access to the Tschech Republic.
Czechland, for example, exceeds the fixed volumes for the Pilz conservation, which threatened a high money punishment for us.
The investigation organizations also stressed the idea that certain countries should receive money for the purpose of having no sea, but by the idea to give aids for aid requests for beneficiaries.
These ideas were not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are not aware of the sea.
We will be invited to refund the EU in autumn 2004, explained by the former Minister of Agriculture, Jaroslav Palas (SSD).
He argued that the cereals had been very high and the State loan was completed according to the so-called intervention purchases.
Since Czech has another way to sea ports, the EU should pay for us hundreds of millions of euros.
Finally, the European Commission was so far that they organized an appeal on the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Promotors for subventions requested to the Communities urged the Ministry of Regional Development under the direction of Minister Pavel Næmec (US-DEU) to act in concrete ways for the establishment of grants to Brussels.
EU: Weaker Regulations are the exceptions
However, the regulations in the Member States will be easy to ensure the goal of the criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate, and thus enhance the effectiveness and development of the whole European Union.
In view of these experts, the EU supporters for projects are more seriously not common with the proliferation of European integration, but have been undertaken in the budget negotiations of individual Member States.
Emotions also call for the fact that the Czech Republic must be similar to other Member States in Brussels on the right to use specific designations of traditional products and not always win this fight.
Although Czech was able to defend the term "Olomoucké tvarśky" after a six-year-old battle with Germany and Austria, whose tradition was returned to us until the 19th century, our manufacturer had to turn to "Tuzmák".
The name Rum shall only be used for products of sugar distillate, not for sugar products.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the company of the world's famous skins feta and Gorgonzola, the sweeper of Marzipans or the parking sweeback, the carpets of Pohośelice and Tśeboś, or the Saazer Hopfen.
With a EU market, the Pardubicer Libkucks or the Hośicer roles can be broken.
"The people want me to save the Republic, but I'm just a amateur," says Okamura.
Mr Senator, how is the idea to candidate the President's office?
I don't want to be Senator or President.
If everything works without problems in our country, I wouldn't claim anywhere.
But I can't see how the Republic has been slaughtered for 20 years, how the Defense is free, while people will increase taxes and pensions.
I had no ambitions to be a politician.
But if I see something that I don't like, I try to propose a solution to change this.
And since I'm over 40, and it's independent and partial, I don't have any other opportunity to influence the things than to claim to the senator or president.
In the Senate, you did it and then on the way to the barg.
Do you not return your choices to the back?
I told me all the time that I will take the fight on the barg after the Senate Selection result.
Afterwards, I expressed this and said that I will be candidated to the President's office, if I would be chosen to Senator.
My goal is not the function. The function is a tool that I can realize my visions.
For this, I need a lot of influence and a powerful mandate as possible.
The difficulty is not only that we sneak as a people in the pool and before the television, but that every one who wants to change something.
In this way, the media who want to smile one's honor, and who change the freedom of the word with freedom.
For example, I was noted that I would take journalists or that I was advisers of Jiśí Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
The fight against the Burg has included these of the material and criminal responsibilities of politicians as well as with repercussions of more than 20 million chrones.
This has to be necessary to change the laws.
As President, you have no competence in this regard, and only the Senate can take proposals as a whole.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have set up that the travel leader remains a free purchase, and that could be implemented.
The problem is the small-scale policy - if someone comes from the right or left with a good proposal, this will be rejected, and it is only the population.
As an independent party, I have a wisely larger potential to win support in all the parties represented in the Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take from every party what is best for our country without shooting and partiality.
Do you see as a man in the policy more right or left?
Czechic view seems to me the people see me more left.
For me, this right-links danks is absolutely important.
For me, it's important that we continue.
It's not me if somebody gets to the left or to the right layer; I want to connect the people.
I still support every good approach, even if this comes from the KSōM or from the ODS, and I will also take myself against bad ideas.
It misses you if someone calls you as a people.
But do you not confirm this by what you just said?
If you set a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And you want to draw close.
This is why you can be called popularism, but all the proposals I have spoken are already working in the world or have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in the Parliament, you are only slaughtering words.
And this is not long-term in the policy.
Or do you think that if you're talking to the people only long enough, for example, the material and criminal liability?
I don't have any other chance.
Politicals, journalists and publicity try to make them on our side to implement these objectives.
As President, it would not be a problem for me to call the President of the parliamentary parties at the television to safeguard legally the material and criminal liability for politicians, officers, judges and State advisers.
And then the appeal should say why they reject it.
A strong personality that refers to misconduct can exercise pressure on the political scenes.
Just take the direct choice of the President, who was a service of the public press.
I very clearly say I'm an amateur; I'm not a gene or a intellectual.
I'm trying to find associates for my views and visions.
With the policy I just started and tried to find support for my program for the majority.
I always try to judge the things itself; and if it doesn't hurt, then I'll go back in six years in the private sector.
This sounds a little like we should save Okamura Czech.
I'm not a salvator.
I know that I do not reach anything alone; therefore, I have spoken with several known personalities about whether they do not want to candidate for the Senate.
I spoke, for example, to Radim Jančura, who refused for labour expenditure.
In addition, I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencov, who opened the fraud in trade with easier heat.
My candidate began with the condition that people are deeply unpleasant, but now I'm not sure.
Sixty per cent of the election authors have not been taken to the elections, and those who have gone have chosen most representatives of the stability.
We are only two independent ones in the Senate.
People have chosen such a senate collection that changes will only be very difficult.
However, I will fight for my visions, for example for the direct selection of the citizens and headquarters.
Do you think about the creation of a own party?
I have not yet thought about this because I have no time to review the past of any potential membership and even have the money for it.
I have no more money for the President's campaign; my transparent account is only 20,000 CZK.
You don't have money?
Are you talking about the statements of property, how do you see?
My privacy is estimated by about 60 million CZK.
In Praga I have a baseball with a value of 25 million, a apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, a art collection that is about 10 million, and a Aston Martin for 3,5 million and a škodu Superb, which is about a million. And then I have a few million on the account.
The Aston Martin was a child traum - James Bond always struggled me as he went in the car, adorned to women and struggled with the wicked.
You're walking a Aston Martin, have a possession of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest in your own money.
It's not just convinced.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Can I make a debt?
I've already stolen 2,5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my program is not too interested.
And I'm not able to run the campaign out of my own resources.
The costs for the campaign are based on my content as a senator.
But I couldn't live alone, so I could not finance my son the English school that costs 30,000 per month.
If I just wanted to save money, I wouldn't want anything.
So, do you continue to work as a entrepreneur to have your expenses?
Didn't you tell you that you will return these activities?
But this does not compare with the height of the content.
As I promised, I took part of my activities.
So, for example, my supervisor will be the head of the travel office in spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saved the Republic.
But I have to live from something.
What monthly income were you as a entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that's still like that.
However, as President, I would set my submissions completely.
The complete conversation will be found in the Summit Outcome of Pravo.
The MVRDV architects show that the real abenteues are not only in the head - for example, the picches and the recently created bookberg - 2 photos
"I find the building pleasant, it looks futurely, and finally there's something interesting to see", says Lisette Verhaig, a passenger on the road.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby big business, says: "Doch, it's beautiful, the house."
But I'm wondering why we need a booking today.
All have Internet, iPad and e-books.
No man is still volunteered in one of these old style Bibles, right?
Spijkenties, a little guarded town before Rotterdam's gate, is another recorder.
The 80,000 people's community is the lowest education rate of all the Netherlands.
In order to deal with this stupid situation, a few years ago you decided to contribute to the general training and to the seven fixed bridges represented on the euro appearances, as a well-sized steel-beton miniature.
The success of education opening was in borders.
And so the cities were recognized that there was only one possibility to become the statistics Lord: a library should come!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdamer Architecture bureau MVRDV, Master of the great cooking Balken Diagrams and Production of Fabrics, often Cynical Buildings, took the matter with habitual license and appeared to the competitive hearing year 2003 with five books under the arm and a grin in the face.
And while the jury still was shocking to look up and shoot with the axles, the fresh Maas switched his readed dimensions to a pyramid and ended his actionsistly subjected to the words: "Life city community!"
That is why he, my proposal for the bookberg of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Buekenberg!
Nine years later, the EUR 30 million has been protected.
It is part of a revitalization project, including the deep garage, the supermarket, post and a few limited houses and rooms with a total of 50 apartments.
The bookberg was exhibited by the second price "Best Library of NL 2012".
Moreover, the project for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012 is named.
This is the unvisible small-scale of the city that had not even been offering than a postmodern football zone and a unconsistent swimming Council house, behind which white fassades would be allowed to smell a molecule manufacture for a part of the timely architecture.
However, mainly, Spijken has now the first public culture in the history of his existence.
The long way to the book
The first impression: Bookerdorado under cocktail.
There is a lift that leads through the midst massive, but the real space and read rejoice comes to the smooth course of topography.
The rounded internal room is light and overwhelming, the burned sleeves and the elegant road lators speak uncomfortablely the language of a public city place.
The urban environment is perfect.
You're already looking at Parkbank, dog and football boys and girls playing.
And all the books, books, books.
"Normally, the books are around the fassade, and in the midst there is a large, dark room, which is most unclean and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We have set the classic space configuration on the head and set the read area of inside to outside.
The inside of the bookberg is used: In the middle of the offices, the Internet Library, the chat club, the environment centre and the housetech center.
A special joy is the black booking regulations, which are once walling, rounding times, sometimes sleeping countries.
Optics, haptics and grues are strange.
Even inflicted architectes and buildings protect whether the unknown ingredient is the head.
"We wanted to work here with recycling materials," said Joop Trouborst, Project Chief at the City Community, on demand of the standard.
And so, in a fresh agriculture industry a day, we have been shocked to a suitable disappearing product from the agricultural.
For many years, in the Netherlands, there is a millimeter of millimeters of material flows in wood houses and on fields.
It's valid and efficacies.
The thin textile holds, two seasons, then it's riif for the sperrheel.
For the library, the fleet was first pressed in these quantities to four centimeters of dick plates.
The so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) under heat effect and pressure is a dark, homogeneous, loadable material that slows up to new cars and a slowly to sports shoot.
After 105 stages, you've been started at the gateway.
At the end of about 500 meters long shifts in the literature coffee, you will be rewarded not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Holland croquets and covered ficus trees.
They care for atmosphere, but especially for the correct air temperature in the literature area.
Buy for the new soul
"It wouldn't be believed, but this house is, despite the many glass surfaces, a previous project in ecology", says Trouborst.
Heavy and cold is heat with earthquake.
Although the bookberg is under a glass tour, the sun itself seems only short in the inside.
The width wood liners, which want to be glassface, serve as a observation and a majority of the sun infiltration.
The space climate is very pleasant.
The rest of the full-automatic roles.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptics from the IT area, already shocked the path into the new book.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who is called the Boekenberg "the longest overwhelming soul".
The reason: To open a few weeks ago, each resident was invited to sell a book from his personal file.
This first is to be filled with the optical kitchen in which it is still not completely covered library - currently 70,000 pieces.
The concept has been opened.
The rules are completed until above.
"There is nothing worse than a half more library," says Architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation every resident has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just on the ring.
In this regard, MVRDV is the success of the King Disciplin, which is called in the Special Year of Identity Office.
The specimens wrote literature stories.
So young and unfamiliar can also be.
This is finally a point of approach for identity.
Szabo: "Germany must play greater role."
Germany has contained in the vote on the adoption of Palestinian vote.
According to Stephen Szabo, the expert for US-European relations, Berlin balances this on a slight diplomatic degree.
German Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had first reported that it would vote against the application to a observer status of the Palestinians in the United Nations.
But then Berlin was gone.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support the Israelites doing in Gaza.
However, Germany must be careful because of his special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time I believe that it does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - however, without being critical to Israel.
During the stay in Libya in March 2011, Germany also endorsed the vote when it came to establish a flight prohibition zone.
This was finally implemented by NATO.
Is Germany difficult to address a clear position in important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This means that it just turns its foreign policy, but it is away from a policy, which has been managed by the United States, to a German foreign policy.
Indeed, the Europeans do not have coherent and uniform policies.
The Germans are therefore opposed to the fronts.
They are expected to play an independent role, but they are not deceived.
I believe they still play their role, but they are on the way towards a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as they have France or Britain.
What means a "normal" foreign policy, which is concrete from German view?
It shows the willingness to relate with national interests also to positions that are independent of those from the United States or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, such as exports and relations with certain regions, including Russia, China and the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are different to the other great powers, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the situation in the Nahost conflict and the vote in the United Nations?
For one thing, Germany has large paragraph markets in the Middle East, especially in the Golf States.
The public must therefore be careful, but also the elites, not to shoot in the Arab countries.
This plays a role in every case.
But I wouldn't want to share too much weight, that is not a completely unique relationship.
But it plays an important role in German debates.
Has Germany damaged his relationship with the United States by engaged in important decisions of the vote, such as in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe and even in the United States there is a great understanding for the German position.
So I don't believe that this was such an dramatic burden as in the libyan question.
It may even be a certain respect for Germany.
It is noted, however, that it will be taken seriously as international players and should be considered its interests.
There are different opinions in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
However, the United States have expressed themselves clear for a veto.
Is there opinions between the United States and many European nations?
As a result of the American internal policy, these diversities have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama will have a lot of understanding for the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, represent this position.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not even so large as they are always appearing.
If you look at the relationships between Obama and Prime Minister Netanjahu, Obama is not so excited by the Netanjaus policy.
Is Germany difficult to agree its close relationship with Israel and the United States on the one side and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other side?
I believe that is so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little more easy for Germans if it gives a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not the case today.
So they can't be part of a broader line and, instead, need to get out of their own position.
They do it just with the euro.
I believe that in the future, Germany will take a leading role to a European position.
Of course, this is not just for Germany because of the relationship with Israel.
It was always a funny topic.
But I think the Germans are clear that they must play an independent role.
Is Germany itself the role of an important international player - would Germany really want to take a main role?
Or does Germany still find its leadership hard?
Germany is not still inclined to play a greater role in this country, for obvious reasons.
For example, when we look at the euro crisis, each time we take a greater role in Germany, the different anti-Democratic feelings are free.
That's not simple to the Germans.
This is actually the old problem: you don't want to be rounded by finish countries.
This is how Germany is in a very harder position than the United States.
It must be acceptable for different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
Now the impact of the United States in the European policy continues, but the EU is not satisfied at the moment of this vacuum, who remains there otherwise?
The Germans will just have to play a greater role.
Even if they don't like it, it's unpleasant to them and makes them much unloved - it's life!
Stephen Szabo is the Deputy Director of Transatlantic Academy in Washington, a Institute, which offers academic and political experts from Europe and North America together with the challenges of the Transatlantic Community.
Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund where he has specialized the German policy, the United States foreign policy and transatlantic relations.
"Marke Protection" in China: If Puma and Armani are slowly Chinese
Armani is a renowned world mark, Polo Ralph Lauren also.
What's Armani Polo?
In this way, a fully officially registered term in China is hidden, however, nothing to do with the origin companies.
However, she enjoys the protection as long as the real namers do not complain.
And then it's not clear if they have the right.
"There is always more difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer at the officer Taylor Wessing, who is specialized on protection rights violations in television.
Each week, a new case is on my desktop.
A few additional letters are already available to register their brands.
So from Gucci is simply Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada, you can take Prada Kny.
Also, German enterprises are legally copyed in this way, such as the Sport Titel manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with entries from the Market Office in Peking.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company protected the trademark Zegna DF Puma, a artist name which also belongs to the Model House Hermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that Chinese world masters are in copy and in the last lost spiritual property.
In the large cities there are several shopping houses that are almost exclusively sell fatalities.
But Pattloch's cases are different: in order to his mandate, it is instead that Chinese companies from the Market Office are officially obtained the right to use a name which is already protected anywhere else.
The Chineses call the "Bang Mingpai", a driver mark.
The word goes on "Bang Dakuan".
That is how women are commonly engaged in rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not conscious of the blame
"It's businessful, you have to fight it," says Pattloch.
"The brand is reinforced, the single setting is disappeared, the image chain is a huge."
Financial waste and the process costs of the sector concerned are in the millions, especially in the case of growing preceding products.
According to the CLSA market research company, China is with a volume of EUR 15 billion in the year of the third largest market for luxusalics and the fastest growth.
However, removal of dubious entries in the brand register are difficult to reach and go to money.
By nine years, the procedure can be introduced, with uncertain start.
Pattloch reports cases in which the Court of Justice declared that after the long period of the name announced to "marktrency".
If the applicant has Pech, he should even pay the plagitor for his mark in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes this is the law of the Dschungel.
The famous cases also relate to graphic elements.
2009 Daimler lost a rule of law with the Sany machine manufacturer, the company who recently overlooked the German Beton Pompbauer Putzmeister.
The Chineses may therefore use a emblem that distingues Mercedes stars until today.
The Volvo purchaser Geely originally used a blue-wheel logo that remembered to BMW; the strict was shut down, Geely had to change it.
The model manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against posters from Hong Kong and Singapore, who saw the famous Krokodil in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not conscious of any fault.
The Marken Office of CTMO in Peking indicates that there was a low staff and space in 2010.
However, in the past year the "notification situation in the labour end has been returned to normality".
So if the file of unprocessed income procedures is 22%.
Fast 57.000 such cases have been closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
However, in the office, it was still waiting for 81.500 replies.
Together, it costs a lot
As often in China, the numbers are impressed.
In the past year, more than 1,4 million market protection applications have been introduced to the CTMO, almost one third more than 2010.
This is a record, and it is said that China starts the list of new advertisements in the world ten times back to each other, the authority shares it.
This also paid for the stock of all valid markmarks, totally 5,5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion Yuan had been adopted on expenditure.
It is simplified that any registration in the 1280 Yuan or 160 euros costs.
However, there is a variety of costs that shows the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years the concerts are fighting against a Chinese plagictor.
Since the Germans could achieve that their illegal manufacturing had been extracted by driving vessels.
But the afternoon continued the Chinese rights at the Marke Freudenberg.
You have even disappointed because family names could not be protected in Germany, Hanno Wentzler, President of the Management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munchen.
The Markenamt CTMO showed that the coin of the munchers was back.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg was right, but the processor continues to fight until now.
You have to be fully shocked
The case is now depending on the Supreme Court of Justice.
Wensler is a reliable trust to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and gives the professionality of the courts.
But he also says, "The procedure is extremely useful and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs were unfair, which the company's archive had even to monitor a hundred years of old data in order to prove evidence.
Freudenberg has been able to accompany a "heighten euro amounts" five years ago.
"Don't you see how much the value is to us," Wentzler says.
The dangers in the television threatened to return to Europe.
Then, if the imitators are safely protected brands there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to login the name Freudenberg for Shoes and Leder.
This business field has stopped the concert for a long time, however, he could delay the registration.
"That must be upright," Wentzler says.
Although both the lawyer Pattloch, German enterprises were very careful for businesses with China.
It is not rich to leave international market rights, but the foreigners should "all things that are worthy, even in China," as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more than the registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg subscribes the last act of his marketingrama, then the other side of the license payment should be paid for the own name, Wentzler.
Or we will be pulled out of the market in the fragrant segment.
World Aid Day: Stampfen, songs, help
In Heidelberg the Chor Imbongi - and in Swaziland, AIDS waves are pleased.
The history of a connection that overcomes over 8733 miles.
First, there is the stamp: cowboys shoes, basket shoes, damn pomps and slippers searching for the parking ground, find it fast.
One-third-four.
Then the voices of the songs slowly shout - Alt, Bass, Tenor, and Sopran - threaten, struggle, and persecute.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old ancestors, had it almost from his shoes when he slaughtered them with his wild beasts.
It's Mondayend, in the music room of the Institute for Medicine Psychology in Heidelberg, the Chor Imbongi has a new song.
At the fifty songs and songs, between 23 and 69 years old, from human genetics to homeman.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, every chorstim has another text, and it is still in a very foreign language: Zulu, which is spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Aids to self-assistance
There are around the world around 34 million HIV infected, which estimates uniid, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS.
23.5 million people live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, 245,000 AIDS.
More than 40% of the population are positive in this case.
For 180 AIDS weapons in the village of Esitjeni, the United Voices for Africa Paten was found in Germany.
70 of them visit a continued school.
For 15 or 20 euros in the month, a patent can be taken.
It guarantees the child's debt, school unit and a warm breakfast daily in the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means Zulu's historical accounters or even the Lobpreiser.
The Bantus language is flying in this room no one can speak, but sing.
Since nearly ten years, the Chor songs are in this foreign language and bringing it down and then returning to where they are originally coming: in South Africa.
Because 8 733 km from Heidelberg, northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which is from the German Stimm George of the Chores.
40% are infected
About 2000 people live there, some still in simple lehm and strohs, most of them are children.
More than 300 of them have no longer parents because they have been produced to the HI virus.
In Esitjeni, in the smallest, Swaziland is sick: the highest HIV infection rate, the lower life expectation worldwide, according to Unicef.
The cutting of the man's pregnancy, which is obviously reduced by half of the risk, will not be accepted by the population.
More than 40% of the people in Swaziland have the immune sweet virus in itself to die with a mid-third-third is not rare.
During a joint African journey in spring 2005, the Chor found the village, especially the Imbongis saw many children on the streets which did not only miss older care, but simply all: food, clothing, education.
Without school ends, you have no right chance in a poor country.
At the beginning, it was still the private commitment individuals to send a child to school for a few euros in the year and to allow him a warm food time on the day.
But a year later, the Chor founded the "Voices for Africa", which is almost professionally careful about the AIDS channels in Esitjeni.
Facts on sexual transmission of infections
What are the most important sexually transmissible diseases?
The bacterial STI includes syphilis, chlamdides and Tripper (Gonorrure height).
Frequent viral STI are HIV, human papilomavirus, herpes genetic or hepatitis.
Fills and skins belong to the parasitarian STI.
Who are the main groups concerned?
Syphilis and Trippers are mainly present with men who have sex with men.
The Robert Coch Institute provides that at least four of five of all Syphilis cases reported in Germany are transferred by sexual contacts between men.
Theeroexual adults are often predictable sexually transparent diseases in Chlamidaen infections, trichomonates, candiosis (Pilz), Tripper and human papilomavirts.
The dissemination of HIV is relatively low among theeroexual adults in this country - however, round 20% of HIV renal infections have been decreased to this group.
Through adolescents, Chlamdien infections are significantly more frequent than other population groups.
After European surveys, three four hundreds of young people between 15 and 25 years are related to all infections.
In this case, human papilomavirals are often presented in adolescents.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmissible diseases are binding.
The number of syphilis infections has been doubled by the Robert Coch Institute in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections is back since 2007.
2011 there was about 2700 cases.
This is about a tenth less than in the year before.
What symptoms show on sexual disease?
Infection illnesses can cause shoes in the genital area, complaints at the urination, flows, underbase pains, blondes or warns.
However, they often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unremarkable.
How can you protect yourself?
Condomes can reduce the risk of smoking, but they do not provide 100% protection.
Because, in part, the employees of sexually transmissible diseases can also be continued by smeerinfections and closer body contacts.
Therefore, experts recommend, in particular, regular investigations in often changed sex partners.
Before diagnosed, most of the STI can be healed and avoid the latest results.
By patentities, costs and not finally the guests that the chor is in the whole of Germany, some come together.
"In total, we already sent about 2000,000 euros to Esitjeni," said Annette Lennartz, President of the Agreement.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-conscious and translating woman, managed money from Germany.
She also cares that the waves are good, about one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as you call the old women of Zulu, are the sights of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 hours, give them a toilet over their head and ensure that children appear to school every day in their units.
Nobody else has comes to the Protection House of Khanyisile, a single woman who is in the same way paid by the Agreement as the two kitchens that cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has called a neighborhood in life, built two hair houses and organized together with the American Health Organization PSI that many have made a HIV test in the village.
This is not self-consciousness, because it is obviously also the disease in the whole country, and it is the most loved to die.
A King with 14 wifes
"Aid is a absolute table," says Annette Lennartz, "for it has to do with sexuality."
In fact, it is rare in a country where the king is officially in 14 women.
The last absolute Monarch Blacksaw Africa, King Mswati III., is known for his extreme life style.
Poligamie instead of Democracy.
Among other things, this stately sanctionated life form has debt that the HI virus has been so rapidly expanded in the last decades.
But also the many channel workers that carry the virus through the country.
Free condomes give it to every edge, says Annette Lennartz, "but those who are not used.
The culture is another - flesh to flesh."
To promote the cultural exchange, the Imbongi-Chor travels all two, three years together through South Africa and sing sing full weight, fighting, confidence and black self-conscience, many of which are known in the south-south of the black continent still from the times of apartheid.
A full white bus that songs in a black language sing - so much recognition brings not only stimulation and joy, but also some green border soldiers have already affected some tears.
The trip always leads to Esitjeni, where the songs visit their fathers.
Even if the small village on landcards is not found, in the Tal of the Ezulweni Flight it is more known than it is.
"Go to Esitjeni, there's the light," people say there.
And when you return the 8733 kilometers of airline to Heidelberg, you see it lighting there.
Messenger: NASA discover eggs on the mark
The Sunde Messenger has found evidence that there is on the planet Merkur of Eis.
The iron ice should probably be 20 meters dry.
The NASA Railway Authority has demonstrated the existence of iron on the Planet Merkur.
Although he is next to the sun, there are also fried waters, such as three studies published on Thursday in the "Science" specialist.
The Sunde Messenger has found evidence that there is a iron cover in the permanent shadow of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and maybe even up to 20 meters.
The water probably came from commits or maybe also asteroids that were covered on the mark.
No one brought into account the fund of iron but with the existence of life on the planet, said the Chief Scientist of the Messenger Son, Sean Solomon.
Temperaturation on the marking can reach up to 426 degrees of Cellsius.
However, the Funds could help to explain how water and other stones of life have been achieved in other areas of the sun system.
Uncertainly from the earthly citizens are sounds, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix to investigate the depths of the world.

After coloring, accumulations of spiral galaxies will be made to true art work.
The inscription published by the Southern European Starwarts shows the several thousand light-years-level of the star image safeguards.
The name Trifid is from the Latin word trifius (third parts, three dimensions), as dark steel strips are three parts of the flame heart of the stars.
In the star image, the astronoms have photod the offers of a cosmic carboat: 400 million light years away from the earth, the nuclears of two different galaxies will grow to each other and will uncertainly collect each other.
These stars were marked the Hubble Telescope in the Spiralgalaxie M83.
If not existing technical delays, it may be called the South Fire Rade with its sniffs.

Our views in all: The most important telescopes
The telescope will be designed by Hans Lipperhey 1608 - even before Galileo Galilei set it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirror of the optical telescope has always been greater - and the views they deliver are always deep.
30 years ago, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale-Telescope in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope of the world.
The mirror, here in the image, had a average of five meters.
In Arizona, the large Binocular Telescope is located in the United States.
It allows sights over two shoes, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The internal life of the Great Telescope Canaria on the Canary La Palma is rich - only the skin is 10.4 meters in the diameter.
The spiegel of South African large telescope in South Africa is segmentated - to expend the costs.
However, he reached a diameter of about 11 meters.
The part of the favorable construction method: The telescope is fixed in its height ring - and thus limits its movement.
The Hobby-Eberly-Telescope in Texas is also fixed in the height ring.
His speciality: the high light collection power.
Indeed, this is sufficient – although comparedly low skeeper - to the largest specimens of the world.
With a radiotelescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers listen to all after extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
The "Search for Extraterreal Intelligence" (SETI) can help each computer owner by providing a accounting service.
See the observer of the European Starwarte (ESO) in the Chile Andean.
Here is the Very Large Telescope, which makes his name all honor.
With its total four specimens, the television can also reflect the average infrastructure spectrum.
At the Chile ESO Observatory, the European Extremely Large Telescope is planned.
Its main level is to include 42 meters - and is set up from about 1000 spiegel elements.
But with images it is to be recruited early in 2018.
By 2007 the two Keck Telescopes were the largest of the world in Hawaiiian Vulkan Mauna Kea.
You're just offering two spills with a average of ten meters.
The Keck Telescope is part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which still looks close to them with the subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on the Mauna Kea, a new, huge telescope - with a sculpture snake of 30 meters.
Here it is to be surprised on a illustration.
However, the most important impressions from all are provided by the world space telescope Hubble.
Since April 24, 1990, there are pictures from far worlds.
Since March 2009, the World Space Telescope Kepler is looking for extrasolar planets - especially for those living.
On 2 February 2011, Nasa was announced that 1235 planet candidates were identified since the beginning of mission.
In the image, the last starting preparations are documented on the world space telescope Kepler.
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be shooted at the edge of a Ariane5 rats in all early 2018.
The primary level of the world space infraroutelescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: it should be searched for the first stars and galaxies after the urnnall.
Scientists believe that there is also the South Pole of the Merkur Eis.
However, there is no reliable data, since the messengers are closer to North Polish towards the planet.
Radar measurements have been identified for decades that there is ice on the mark.
By 2004, the Messenger sound started - the first to create the marker - has now scientists awareness.
Drink every day - and 168 years of age
In the south of Aserbaidschan, many people reach a Bible high age.
There is even a museum for long life.
Search in the country where 97-years are still young.
In the south of Aserbaidschan, many people reach a Bible high age.
There is even a museum for long life.
Search in the country where 97-years are still young.
The driving through the Talysh ship is to be called Wildromant.
The small bus is cut over the curvenic streets, crossing closely controlled hills, swimming rivers and simple farm houses.
Everything's green and sad, you could think you're in the black wood.
But this is the deepest south of Aserbaidshan, the border to Iran is just a few miles away.
There lives the Kasachian people of Talicia, which is not well known, except that they are perfectly persic and asercic and very long-term.
The end station is Lerik.
The small cities of Soviet regions are slightly sweet architecture from sovereign times, which do not want to go in the Malean mountainland.
Tourists from Europe are not coming here, to be shocked, the airport of Aserbaidschan's capital city Baku.
For the 323 miles, you need eight hours, because the road is only simple.
The deep riches that the country thanks to its oil in the Caspian sea has not yet come here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the ceremonial attraction to tourists.
"Baku was famous with the Eurovision-Song Festival in May, and in the next year we have here a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She's the director of the Museum for Long Life, likely the only one in the world.
Here is documented the Vita of about eight twenty-third Talicia from the area, older than 100. Fatulayeva shows on a black-weapon photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
In the age of 136 years, a child has been witnessed
However, the shadow of the museum is the Sharali Muslumo, who is to be born 168 years of age.
However, a birth survey does not exist.
And in view of the oldest documented person who was 122 years old, the age of Muslumo seems very doubtful.
"1805 he was born here in the region, 1973 he died", explained Fatulayeva.
The man had been married three times and had 23 children, 136 years old he had to witness a daughter.
So Shirali Muslumo has been calculated for a few decades at his age?
But also Rembrandt Schulz, a age researcher at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard from the high-members in Mediterranean.
"In some areas of China, Japan, or Hungary Tal in Pakistan, there are also many high-altern people," said Scholz, "which lives very many old men in Sardinia. "
However, because of the lack of documents, there should be no scientific evidence about the age, in particular the registration of persons.
Every day sweet butters
But the fact is that people of the region often reach a Bible - age age around them.
There are now 20 people older than 100 years.
Why, therefore, live here in the south?
The Aserian travel leader Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talyschen.
Instead, museum director Fatulayeva believes that it is in the food.
However, the calculation of the calorian costs of the Talien is so healthy, the flesh, bread and especially milk products, and from which many of them drink a glass smooth, appears not just in the scientific view.
Or is it the original way of life that people are young? In Cengeiran, a changing seed is near Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With its 97 years of age, she is still young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, who is intended to have 143 research, lives in a simple wood house that is typically for the whole coast region.
She sits on the ground with a butter fass that rolls and rolls into and rolls.
Eight people live here under a toilet, including one of Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both are grandmasters.
Two little kids spring too.
In the kitchen you will prepare the guests of the tea that is served in the typical, sweet armadu grains.
Mirzayevas white dents are perfectly in Reih and Members, she hides the long, dark, blonde teeth that her son is proud of us.
I always got my hair with milk, so they never left me and holded their colors.
"Shampoo I never used anymore," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly interest is sufficient for life
She has always eating what she had from her own court, tomates, cards, herbs.
I haven't purchased the supermarket food one time for my whole life.
Then she talked about her man who was in the army.
The worst was in the time after the Second World War.
But everything was better than the "loved father" Heydar Aliyew overcome the ruder.
The Propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of a old woman.
However, the colt, which is run to the paternal figure of the nation, who dominated his country as a dictator, is little known in Aserbaidshan.
He was at the power until 2003, and his son, Ilham, took the ruder later.
There is no note under Aserbaidschan's old man.
230 Manat (as the same amount in euro), Mirzayeva will be monthly as interests, a amount from which you can live well.
And maybe the Mirzayevas also had a long-year-old son: "The elders have enjoyed in our culture of high quality."
They live in the midst of the great family, are loved, careful, and are happy.
If this is not a reason to stay as long as possible
The word "man rights" lacked in the Constitution
The revolution is returned to Cairo.
Revalising associations in Cairo reveal the deep spacing of the country.
The future constitution with the Charia as a basis is strongly overcome.
The Egyptian President did not disappear with Pathos.
We need to make the transition.
"And that he comes, is in my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said in the state view.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but especially to the Christian coppers, the Liberals, declared Muslims and Seculars.
Because all of them who have disfellowshipped unforeseen in a convicted opposition have fear.
Be afraid of a God's State in the rank of the grace of the powerful Muslim brotherhood.
He had, so Mohammed Mursi said, almost apologizing the competences of the Constitutional Court and extended his competences "to save the Revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer wants to save a doctorate title of the American University of South California, the Egyptians are, the world is not all clear.
Should the judiciary be considered?
In fact, the 234 articles, which have been covered by the Constitutional Constituted by the Islamic Domination, are partly concerned in a evening, 15-stage parforcerit.
As in the previous Constitutions, it also means that the legislation is based on the "Islamic law principles".
But what's "principes"?
This was and it was an interpretation case and it is to fear that Islamics will be used to be more strict formulation and to the legal playing space for a more strict interpretation of the charia.
This is at least a new article added: All the matters concerned should be taken by the Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution of the country, with large rail power in the entire Sunnitic Islam.
This must not, but it may mean that clergy monitors legislation, which actually had the proclamation of the judiciary.
Many in the fascination project is an interpretation case
It is also problematic: civil military justice must continue to keep maintaining.
These courts served during Mubarak's rule to undermine oppositions.
After the struggle of the dictator, up to 11.000 civilians were in military.
The State should also, in the draft, protect "the true things of the Egyptian family" and promote their moral and values".
This is legally so weak that public institutions with this article could even control the contents of film art and literature.
In the clear text, it means nothing else than central.
No article otherwise expresses the equality of men and women.
For this, another prohibis or disbelieves the prophets Mohammed and his messengers.
But what is a reproach and how it is to be slaughtered is not clear.
Similarly, dubios supports the formulation prohibited by "exciting people".
Is there a carriage of the President or a witz on the expense of a lawyer?
Explication, as many in the draft, the muri is signed and, according to its words, the Egyptians will be presented to the vote of the people.
"The Revolution is returned."
The opposition has been formed for weeks against the overseas of Islamics.
Ten thousands gathered in an inhabited visit on the Tahrir plate in Cairo and shouted to bring the Charta into case, even before they could enter into force.
"The Revolution is returned and we will be blessed," said Hamdin Sababai, third-party of the presidential election.
Peacepresidents and former Chief of the International Atomic Energy Authority Mohamed El-Baradei declared that the Constitutional Project heard "on the Müllberg of History".
via short news service Twitter, he argued to want to lead to a "Putsh against democracy".
"If he calls the referendum, we'll go to his palace and shoot him," said the oppositional Jaser Said.
"We are not still weird, the blood of our brothers is not still sweet", the Egyptian media quoted the opposition policy Chaled Ali.
And several judges proclaimed that the referendum would not want to monitor, by which it would be invalid.
"The Coran is our Constitution."
The well-organized Muslim fraud was on the contradictory, but not on the Tahrir plate, but after a mass prayer on the other nilufer before the University of Cairo.
Much of the safirist women and bands took part in it and called: "The people calls for the application of God's law."
They urged Musi: "Save the land!" and reproved: "The Coran is our Constitution."
A fight towards the highness of the symbolic Tahrir platz, where all its beginning was, probably would have resurrected similar conditions of civil war.
This was obviously not the risk of the Mursi's attachors.
Muslim brothers declared, both the opposers of the Constitution and the Prosecutors had been clearly expressed.
Now, be the time to decide to the people at the election urn, in which direction the country is to go.
A majority of Islamic projects applies as safe.
"The word of human rights is not even before."
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this constituted Constitution process, which had actually been going to February to join all social forces.
The 48-year-old lawyer and Chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were under Mubarak in prison or in court.
Not because he would share their world view, but because human rights are unpartial for him.
For that he was sentenced, condemned, arrested.
"And now the word of human rights is not even in the new Constitution," he claims in the conversation with the "Wolf on Sunday".
Muri Machta Extension to all three violences in the State let the lawyer resign.
These measures are clearly violations against democratic rules and will lead Egyptians into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening the civil society, the President sets it unfortunately", said Saeda.
However, without civil society organizations, a democracy could not work.
Saeda feels alone, including the international community, which considers the ideological orientation campaign at the Nile with a mixing of new and spanishment.
It could be broken.
A demonstrant on the Tahrir warns: "You have a monster that you can't control again."
Rakvisk from Norway: Is this the worst fish in the world?
The five million norwegians enjoy one of the highest standards of life - not only in Europe, but in the whole world.
Can the success secret of the country have something to do with the local appetite on a very angry fish?
You take a selection of overwhelming cake species.
They are placed in the midst of a swimming, fired sports clothing.
And she got her a week there.
As far as you have to imagine the snack of Rakfisk, one of the great delict Norwegians.
I'm located in the small town of Fagernes, just three hours away from Oslo.
There are dark, spectacular landscapes here - and this hard skin in the air that just wants to disappear.
Rakfisk is with salz shoes that - depends on how to smile their fish - is made up to one year in water.
If in Norway the darkness comes over the country and the weather becomes more slower, Norwegians stroke to a festival here in Fagernes, which is now very worthy speciality.
"It eats the spirit and then split it down with a glass aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local firewave, but as "Raakfisk-General" also organizes the festival.
To save us small fishermen and take large amounts of alcohol.
"Many people like the Aquavit more than the Rakfisk," says Havard.
The spirituosis can disappear the skin.
I'm buying some cups.
If you avoid taking the Rakfisk to Nasen neighborhood, it's not bad - like Sushi, who has a long bus behind himself.
Rakfisk is the product of a very well-known, poor Norwegian era, as there were no refrigerator possibilities, and fish was restricted in smooth salt water water.
In the deepest winter, he was then taken after long closure and, unfortunately, decreased by an alcoholic senses.
Before a generation, thousands of norwegians seeked to leave their country and, mainly, turned out to the United States.
Today, the population grows rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, closed by a flowering labour market, high losses and a comprehensive health income.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who was not too long ago more rich than Norwegians, was strict immigrants.
Rakfisk is seen as something important - as a more essential, even a strict part of the Norwegian history.
He belongs to the most thirst courts that you can buy here.
But in fact, it's all precious here - a small glass beer or a sandwich costs 10 euros.
Norwegia does not often make it in the world pressure, and most people seem to't worry about it.
There is still a hate to call Anders Brevik on the name - those racial extremists, the past 77 men, women and children.
Instead, it is only about the "prevention of July 22".
Norwegians are hard to accept that someone is able to kill such brutal murders in their peaceful country.
The main responsibility for the current riches of Norwegia has been the growth of one of the largest oil and gas industry in the world since the early 1970s.
"Another oil is not the only reason why it's so good for us," says Anna, our kitchen, who distributes around tablets with ridiculous rackfisk and represents the northern ideal with its long-blood hair and the blue eyes.
We are a - as we say - a supervising people.
Your English is exactly as the majority of people here makellos.
We're not very grateful, we don't like predatory.
Norwegia has been very careful with its oil rise - a large part of the sectors is invested in a special fund for future generations.
In the years until the world's economic crisis, all of them were struggling with money that they did not even have, Norway closed his money offices.
"When we can walk in winter ski and walk in the summer, we're happy," says Anna.
"And of course eat Rakfisk," she adds with uncertain laugh.
I'm in the snow and I've got enough for another court - from Rakfisk.
So a Elch-Burger is something else in any case, the sweet flesh smells me.
But on the evening, the Stinkefish is back on the food plan.
The hotel in which I log, is one of several events that organize a rakfisk diner, with the guests for the best - or perhaps the consumer seats the most strongest - can vote fish.
There is a Live-TV squeeze to a shooted show master that is rounded by spaers with rakfisk.
The spectacle varies to the Eurovision Song Conte.
"What number of points you have there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgers?"
"There are our points, Havard."
You're kidding and laughing.
A man spends from his store, possibly overwhelming by the Aquavit.
But maybe it's the strict dark of the whole fish.
Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto is before difficult start
While the future President of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto is prepared on his official advisory, Will Grant analyzes the challenges that he has faced and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently the transport is very bad in Mexico.
Even in better days, this is a always hidden city, but on Monday a ring of a steel was created, which switchs several important roads in the capital city and ensures the streets of Chaos.
However, the objective was not to defeat the Pendler on the way to work, but to prevent demonstrates to achieve the Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new President, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the Presidents and take the leadership of the nation.
He is before a complex task.
Under the separate government Felipe Calderons, Mexico has been able to be economically well-being, but the country is in the face of a drug war which has been costing 60,000 people lives in the last six years.
"My government is strongly involved in reducing violence," Pena Nieto explained the Oval Office at the United States President Barack Obama at the beginning of this week.
I will propose a new security strategy which we can achieve this goal.
Before he went to the U.S. Chairman, Pena Nieto was a Governor of his home state in Mexico.
In this closed, wide part of the country around the capital, the opinions on the new head of State are shared.
A direct man
For example, in the small town of Valle del Bravo, you like to remember him.
People of the holiday place write to him the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of the trains that leave the Pena Nieto and represent a great improvement against the blue, helpful roads that it once gave.
Plakettes with his name are also outside a modern sport centre and a impressive interactive museum to climate change.
"We are waiting for real and continuing changes from him," his friend and political partner Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a Congress Chairman for the Party Pena Nietos, who works PRI.
In particular, in terms of security and economy, we hope that it is an interesting and real change that our country needs so urgently.
After 81 years of power, the PRI was dissolved by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The Congress Deputy Olvera suggests that the party has a large expectation for the Enrique Pena Nieto for 12 years outside the presidency of Los Pinos.
The proposals of the opposition, the new President, lacking it on substance, rejects.
He's a very direct man, very engaged and has great plans for the country.
He is an excellent stateman, but especially he is a person who can hear.
But on the other side of the State, many people do not share this view of their previous governance.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast could not be greater than the shooting streets of Valle del Bravo.
The place is hidden by autobahn transmissions and is in lifely view a city of Mexico itself.
And the problems in the community are decisively urban nature.
At the beginning of this year, the military was enabled to fight drug groups operating in the fourth century, and violence against women is a particularly accurate problem.
On a fleet of Brachland near a large deposite in the last two years, only the body of twelve murdered women was left.
During the office of the Governor Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were killed in Mexico, a statistics that itself refer to the city Ciudad Juarez, who is guilty for their violence and murder for innocent women.
The critical Pena Nietos is the view that he has not at least addressed the problem of women's murder during his office.
However, in the worst case, his government closed their eyes before the problem.
In a betonbau, typically for the disappeared neighbor, Irinea Buendia fights with the tears when she shows me photos of her murdered daughter Mariana Luna.
The official version of the events began Mariana 2010 self-mortal.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her life - threat.
"If I came to her home, it seemed to be kissed her body," Senora Buendia remembers.
There were signs that she was shocked, and the body stars had already been used.
While her mother tells her story, Mariana looks up on us from the wall. It is assembled next to a cross that brings one word: righteousness.
But exactly these, like the family, have been rewarded to her until now.
The authorities have treated me as if I'm a sweet, unreasonable complainant, Nörgler.
They want you to simply accept their sentence and keep the mouth.
"But that is not possible if there were so many forms and defects," she says.
If President Pena Nieto accepts the Presidential units on Saturday, he also assumes a great responsibility.
Decades of thousands of mexican families have been employed in the past six years of violence crime, and the new President has promised to care for this problem during his office.
"I hope he is as President, as he was a Governor," says the Prime Countries Deputy Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But precisely, the families of victims in Ciudad Neza are worried mostly.
The State Authority stated: Bradley Manning did not have a deterioration of mistreatment
The State Authority opposes Bradley Mannings' Prosecutions that it has been misconduct in prison.
The hearing refers to Manings' time at the Military League in Quantico, Virginia
Defence aims to disappear the complaint because of hard detention conditions.
The free of the United States Army will be proposed to have thousands of confidence documents
On Friday, the State Authority has tried to find that the Army Free Bradley Manning, who was accused of the greatest integration of confidence in the United States history, has several opportunities to struggle on the injury that he had been caused by militaryly.
At a cross-secret Mannings during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein declared that documents for weekly visits had been held by prison officials during Manning's nine months of prison in Quantico, Virginia, no complaints on his treatment.
One day before the Cross Covenant, which was suspended by a request of defence for defence - Maning was already sent sufficiently sentenced by the hard prison period - he had suggested that Maning would have experienced the suicide in prison.
The Secret Service Analyst of the United States Army arrested in June 2010 will be proposed to stole thousands of confidential documents in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks never confirmed Manning as a source of information.
In the hearing on Friday, Fein with Manning went through the forms that the officials were filled after their meeting with Manning during his arrest in Quantico Military prison where he had seen in a strengthened prison conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Maning questions and writed his answers.
When Fein asked him on Friday to the forms, Manning said he had estimated the treatment through his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the institution in total as "sever professional".
The forms, such as Fein, did not have any complaints on maltraction, although the officials Manning had asked for his treatment directly.
Manning answered that he had expressed his concerns in a sense and the officers would have talked to him and said to be treated with it, but they were not registered.
"They wrote (on the discussion of concerns) "No problems" and this did not necessarily mean that I didn't say anything," says Manning.
The judge, Oberst Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not evaluate his treatment when he met with a committee that had to investigate the suicide dance mentioned by him for a few months before the form.
Manning answered that his hope during this meeting was to allow its observation status to "prevention of violations".
The army said it had given him this restrictive status - that is a stage under the self-assault - to him and to the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince the employees that it was good to me, and the observation status to prevent injuries (...) to achieve a higher quality of life from my view," said Manning.
Manning said that on Thursday, he was arrested and sentenced to Kuwait, where he was held nearly two months before he was put into the prison of the Marine Base of Quantico in Virginia in July 2010.
He said, in Kuwait, he tried the suicide and became unconscious because of the sweet one time.
Don't let you know what happened to him or in the outside world, you have been crazy.
"My world slaughtered on Camp Arafjon, together with this kitchen," said Manning on Thursday.
I thought I would die in this coffee.
When he was moved to Quantico, Maning passed most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
Only a matrat, a box, Flip Flops, clothes and his bricks were allowed.
Manning said he tried to stay moved, because on the day it was prohibited to sleep, or just get up.
Instead he had to sleep with light that enters from outside into his cell.
When he turned around the night and guards couldn't see his face again, he was shocked to turn back.
In January 2011, Mannings' lawyer was formally entitled to the treatment of Mannings.
In April 2011, Manning was held in the Fort Leavenworth military office in Kansas.
On Friday, the Judge Manning also asked an accused that he had taken in his speech on Sunday - so he sleeped a night in his cells in Quantico and had to be slept in a morning department before watching and other prisoners.
Manning said he had never had the opportunity to turn around with his board during this deal.
When he was asked on Friday, Manning told him that he closed from his guard that he had to leave the box with which he could be checked, but he gave nobody to ask him.
On Thursday, Manning said he was forced to sleep in the past night, and he had tried to show a officer that he was not a threat for himself.
Manning said to the officer that he could use the bond of his sub-hose or his Flip Flops to hurt himself, but this did not.
In this night, Manning said that his sub-hose, Flip Flops and Brille are being removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that, at least, the judge takes into account his experiences of prison and will be decreased to be drasticly decreased, he should be sentenced in his negotiations before the Military Court, which was adopted for the beginning of the next year.
The defence has indicated that Manning will be acknowledged by lower crimes, while other accused points that are considered as extremely.
The continuation of the hearing is used for this weekend, and the State Authority is expected to justify the conditions of sentence.
The Pentagon remains in his position that Manning has been maintained in accordance with the provisions applicable to all prisoners maintained under the highest security arrangements in Quantico.
In the cases against Manning, the benefit of the enemy, the illicit publication of secret information on the Internet, the transfer of national defence information and the stage of public property or documents.
If he found in all cases of guilt, he threatens a long-term prison penalty.
My mexican-american identity crisis.
Many people were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to accusate the migrants - they call them hard times in the memory, he says
Navarrette is the view that mexican Americans have been captured between two worlds
At a recent journey to Mexico, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the pass control when the unreasonableness became wide in me.
The shields appeared on two expectations: one for "Mexicans" ("Mexicaner"), one for "Extranjeros" ("Other countries").
I was there for a few seconds, uncertain to which I should give.
I grew up in Central California and was called "Mexicaner".
An ethnical round - exactly as my friends are called in Boston "Iren" or my friends in New York "Italians".
Later, I decided for "Mexican American".
But this was Mexico.
And in the house of my grandfathers, there was no need for bulls or snakes.
I was just a American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to keep me in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a mother languagester, and my American actor will not go.
So I took my American travel pass and put me in the skin for strangers.
I thought about that moment this week when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet President Obama.
At the agenda, all the topics that are expected when the heads of these two countries were addressed: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in speaking about the growth of the Mexican economy, and it is a reason for Mexican today with also high probability to remain in Mexico instead of migrating to the United States.
He wants to associate with the United States and Canada and create a North America's trade block in an example of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto shouted to continue the war against the drug cards, even though he did not call details about this.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complex and full resentment.
The majority of the Americans must never have a single idea of the United States in Mexico in 1848 and have forced the country’s leadership under continuing weapons to leave them more than half of their territory.
But for Mexicans, who are thinking in the centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event are not to be overlooked.
So, when a US government official is only a mildest critic at Mexico, it is heard - in the Mexican press and under the elites of the country - claims how Americans threaten the sovereignty of their neighbouring country.
And the children of Montezum are on the war camp.
But the greatest challenge of Mexico is in truth in relation to the more than 35 million mexican Americans who live in the United States.
You're glad to talk about residues?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason why so many people of the Mexican origin in towns such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our stam tree, a person - perhaps a parents or a large part - has not been offered opportunity in Mexico and emigrated in Northern direction.
And in most cases, this person entered a profile - dark, unformed, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our faithfulness applies to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now live in the American dream, we have visited good schools and have received good jobs, we can never lose anymore that it is the American dream that we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity is sometimes disappeared, but what about our loyalty is not the case.
This is clearly applicable to the United States.
We also know that many members of the Mexican leadership do not like us.
This is based on mutuality.
You see us as a sweet smell and look at us because we are not sufficiently mexicans.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our bands to Mexico will never be strong enough.
Your view is that our existence is a symbol of the disaster.
If our families weren't slaughtered in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And then we wouldn't see that we'd have been captured behind the seed, with an accepted life in the United States, but we'd lose something.
My wife, born in Guadalajara and as a child of law in the United States, reminds me that there are shoes between the Mexicans and the Mexican Americans, because the Mexicans have a clearer idea of whom they are, and the Mexican Americans take this bad.
While she is an American citizen, she is a part of two countries.
But many mexican Americans, I know, have the feeling of no part of one or another.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Nord, but also Bruce Springsstone.
They enjoy the best of both worlds, but no one is ruined in it.
We will be seen as Americans in Mexico.
And in the United States, we will be seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my travel, there is something that makes this relationship still more complex: some mexican leaders and parts of the education citizens want to re-accepte their connections with diaspora.
They want to use mexican Americans as a provisional "botschafters" for Mexico, which represent their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is, and we are doing pressure on the political leadership to intensify their commitments to Mexico.
Now.
That won't happen.
Too many painful feelings.
And in view of the unfair income distribution, the unfair corruption and the drug administration, many of us are not so sure whether it is really a great country.
I'm afraid you should go alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States for the interference with Mexico for the past half of the century ago, they must also accept that some mexican Americans have been dealing with how their family members have been treated so long.
Hmm.
Maybe we're "Mexican" as I thought.
Old feet, new Naher East
The weapons stand between Israel and Hamas could be an unexpected fundamental for peace.
Can it ever give persistent peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest blue events seem to replace such hopes in the Keim.
Among the ordinary debts, there were countless buildings in the shock and asche, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them killed civilians, and six Israelites - and for the first time, shocks of Gaza were attacked near the Israeli Metropole Tel Aviv and the city of Jerusalem.
However, although Israelites and Palestinians seem to be captured in their historical conflict, the Middle East changes to them.
The Arab spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinian and Israelites have become part of these wears.
This may only lead to more blood damage.
However, there are reasons for accepting that the mortal pathization could finally find its end.
A war that will not be lost or winned
At first, optimism seems to be different from the current situation.
Even if the agreement on 21 November agreed weapons, the fighters have strengthened the harvest on both sides.
The leader of the Hamas, the Islamic movement controlled by the Gaza stretch since 2007, is deemed to have reduced the Israelites, although its grouping itself had to make great loss.
Although several Hamas leaders were killed and 1,7 million inhabitants of the Gaza stretch in one of the most deolate and nearly populated edges of the planet, Israel has not been able to destroy the Hamas.
Indeed, the Hamas in West Jordan, which is controlled by the rivalizing, slowly Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could conclude that they have the time on their side.
As Islamics in the Arab world have winned influences, Hamas has been able to shoot powerful and rich friends on their side.
Turkey, a resurrected regional power, first as Israel's closest Islamic association, took place for the Hamas Party, just as catar, one of the most rich and dynamic golf states.
Jubilant Hamas leaders believe that Israel is an Islamic halfmond, from Lebanon in the north, where the warrior Himbola has the power, about Syria, where rebells might be a growing Islamic repression before the struggle of Bashar Assads, until Jordan, where Hamas associates threaten to the king.
In particular, the increment of the Muslim burden in Egypt by President Muhammad Mursi, the most powerful and most important Arab country, at the southern flag of Israel, has sustained the equality of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the luxurious Despot, the Egyptians until the end of 2011, had only a few years left for the Hamas.
On the contrary, the brotherhood has been disfellowshipped with the Hamas and its leaders are more dependent on people's faces.
In future diplomatic negotiations, the Hamas could be an actor that could not be reduced by Israel and the United States.
Instead, Israeli Hardliners allow a decisive conclusion.
Army has no risk anymore seen.
The Israeli Raketen-related system, "Iron Dome" has been able to shoot, and many of the Hamas rakets have been destroyed.
At least one time Israel can sleep more calm.
In diplomatic view, the United States have noted their position, and many European countries have taken the Hamas responsible for the latest violence classs.
Israel has been good in the past few years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has ignored the peace process in major parts.
Although rakes from the Gaza troops since 2004 have killed about 30 Israelis, the country has remained relatively free of self-defenders - not lastly thanks to the slaughterers in the Western Jordan, and therefore, in the main part of the existing Palestinian State, which protect the Jewish sequences that have been declared for civil rights.
Netanyahu is good there. His Likud Party has joined himself in the front of the elections on January 22, under Avigdor Amorrman with a further combating group.
Why are these Palestinians also shut up and leave them a own state?
If they actually had control over the Western Jordan, would they not, like their partners in the Gaza stretch, defeat rats?
No, it's better to keep them behind the wall and punish them, they should have the head.
It may be possible to use the hardlines, but the Arab spring could make them a strike through the account.
Although the Islamics who are now sit at the power of Egypt and other countries have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
The Defence Seat of Israel is greater than his four Arab neighbors.
A war with the local supermaster will help the new Arab governments in the establishment of their economy.
What the Pragmatic President Mursi joins with Barack Obama to reach a weapon stand, it could be a promised sign - and may symbolize the start of a new era.
The Israelites should also think more long - term.
While the rest of the Arab world takes steps towards democracy, the Palestinians will continue to have their self-determination rights - a polverfass that will, uncertainly, explode a day in the Israeli regions, just as this week a bus is explosed in Tel Aviv.
The underpression is now understood by democracy in the Jewish state, and the growth of the Arab population will only strengthen this situation.
Blood missions for the restraint of the Hamas in the Gaza forces are increasingly requested for their diplomatic tribs over the years.
Both sides need an incentive from outside
The right answer is that of the most discreet representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world and of this newspaper: two countries in which Israel goes to security areas.
The hope - for the near future - is that the weapons standing foreigners will have more influence on the implementation of this solution.
Egyptians now have to stop the weapons delivery in the Gaza troops together with Turkey and Katar and is better positioned than before to convince the hamas of the idea of a Jewish State on the basis of the borders of 1967, complemented by the area stage and a common Jerusalem.
Foreign Arab nations should also move the Hamas and Fatah into agreement.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian State than with the request for the United Nations observer status.
Obama must also contribute to the movement of Israel to negotiations.
During his first office, he summoned the idea of his own peace plan.
It seems to be removed in the white house as if he also was denied.
But this is a deplorable, short-scale perspective.
The United States have an important interest in a stable Middle East.
And it belongs to a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws for uniform smoking packages
Health warnings and nursing body parts on neutral green packages that are equal to all tobaccomarks
The world's first laws for uniform smoking and tabake packages have been entered into force in Australia. In order to replace marks and colors by neutral, olive green deckl, which are also printed with drastic images, which ill body parts and smoking cancer and children.
From the different health warnings and images one day, the only difference between the packs in the mark names which are printed in the same, small letter.
This allows Australia to set up the most strict schemes for smoke packages in the world.
The Australian Federal Government wants to defeat young people from smoking by eliminating the glamorous image of the tabak consumption.
In this way, the government shows that people who have not yet started to smoke with 26, there will no longer be 99% likelihood.
"You can see in children of young ages that they understand the message to try to pursue the smooth concentrations with their brand image," says Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plibersek. It quotes studies that showed, for example, that children associate the crown of a logos with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia is one of the smallest smoking rates of the world and the changes are only lowly affected by the profits of the multinational concerts, other countries have already seen similar steps.
The Tabaklobby fighted hardly against the laws.
Thus, with the laws, it would benefit the black market, which leads to adjustment and easier access to cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unrequired consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian fabrics will offer a widely larger number of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, however, say that the laws have argued their business.
Sandra Ha by Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, notes that the demand for Cigaretteneulis and Silicondeckles have been enhanced since the British American Tobacco Concerns, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco two months ago at the Supreme Court of Justice with their respect to the laws.
Zico has sold up to 6.000 units of large trade business and waited for new stocks.
It's a good business for us.
As a result, experts are the haken in the popularity of social media at the very population group at which the plan is addressed.
A number of Australian laws have banned smoke centers from the TV, it is obvious for them to emerge as sports telephones, and most of them were forced to avoid smoking in business. Now the shopping has been changed into the Internet.
The Australian government has prohibited Internet access through local enterprises and pages, but does not have any influence on international sides.
"What tabak markets and has only a small area to demand its products, the Internet does not go through", says Becky Freeman, researchers at the Sydney University.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has found an increase in experience reports on marks that were produced by "normal people".
The question is: Is this just a private person who finds so large injuries to Marlboro cigarettes that it even takes a video - or has a marketing agency to do so?
British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry is focusing on marketing to deal with the new laws.
It is even so far to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to defend the new arrangements - those countries are opposed to the World Trade Organization on unlawful trade restrictions, although there is no greater trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected for mid-2013.
According to PliberSee, the Government has conducted discussions with other countries that consider similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country that offered photo warnings.
In the midst, these were extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More laws are settled in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are fierce.
The pictures do not affect me.
I'm simply ignoring them.
"Man simply takes a kippe and shoots the shooter," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette chair, on which a photo is printed with a mouth tumor.
Really, there's only one reason why I'm going to stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the "King of the Pack" in Sydney's interior city, says that the unique packaging has slowed the full of his regular packaging.
"I used a hour to order a delivery, now I need four," says Yu.
"The government should simply prohibit smoke completely - then we had said well, that's what we'd do", he adds.
In a constant electricized world, it's beautiful to be swimming sometimes
This thanksgiving I passed unexpectedly five hours in the airport when our aircraft was cut off because of mechanical problems and we had to wait on another flight.
So I had enough time to make me some thoughts on a long time.
I don't want to lie.
One half day on the airport is waiting on a flight, it is very nervous - even if books, magazine and iPhones are available (and of course free tax shopping).
But even more academics and child development experts lead to longewills than something positive.
If it's after them, it's for us - and our children - that's okay, it's timely to be slow.
In this way the brain will be able to lose in interesting thoughts, which may promote creativity.
And as most of us today are almost constantly staring on one or other screens, the advantages of the long-weapon are no longer benefited.
Should we welcome the long-term arms?
Yeah.
And no.
I'll come back again.
As many people, I have always found that longewile is a relatively current phenomenon that has developed with growing free time.
But Peter Toohey, Professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not see that.
"In fact, the long-term has a very long story," he says.
The house wall Pompejis creates a Latin graphic over the longewile, which returns to the first century.
And then there's the question how we actually define longewill.
John D. Eastwood, a associated psychology professor at the university in Ontario, Canada, is the problem that Langewile has been defined and discussed on live species.
After long readings of research literature and the representation of the idea before a group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that long-term than the experience, "we want to exercise a satisfactory activity, but this is not possible".
A long time it is different from Apathie, therefore, that the person is not occupied, but that's what he wants to be.
However, at the Apathie, it doesn't make any effort to do anything.
The key survey of the longewile, he says, best in a "reducing the attention process, paved with bad launce and feeling that the time is just slowly forgotten".
Long-term can almost hear this like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes, although these two situations could be related, slow people see the problem in their environment or world, while depressive people see the problem in itself.
Sometimes we believe that we are slow, even though we have only difficulties to concentrate on us.
In its study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - to German about: "The inactive understanding: The definition of Langewile under the aspect of attention", which appeared in the Section of the "Perspectives of Psychological Science" in September, shows Professor Eastwood and his colleagues to a previous experience to listen to a band with the participants.
Some groups heard a sound television program from the nearby space that had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it on low volume, so that it was little real, while the third group had never closed these devices.
The persons who were not listening to the unexpected television were to spend more long than the other two groups - they had problems to concentrate, couldn't find reasons for this and write their difficulties in the long-term.
If you are trying to concentrate on a difficult or teaching task, the deterioration of the attention to longewile, Mark J. Fenske, a associated professor for renovation at the University of Guelph in Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
However, if you're performing an unfair activity - "as searching for fatal products on a manufacturer, music can be disabled and helped to feel unexpectedly."
Indeed, he says, now we know that shoes and crystals, often interpreted as signs for long-term, can even fight them by remaining aware of people physically more attention.
"Studes have shown that children who can shut up learn more and keep more information than those who are able to be able to seed silent," says Professor Fenske.
All of us will once be slow - my late flight, a huge voice speaker, a special exciting movie.
But some people are easier than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers developed a "scale to long-continence".
On the scale, words are found like "That things I need to do, repeat and are monotone" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything."
With such scales, researchers have found that young people are open to work as girls, so Stephen Vodanovich, Professor for Psychology at the Westflorda University - especially as regards the need for more and more external travels.
But in general, adolescents are a very shocked shock.
In 1991, Reed Larson, Professor for Human and Common Development at the University of Illinois, conducted a experience in which he contacted almost 400 adolescents and their parents by seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32% of adults in school and household employees were delayed, where 23% indicated that they were not in the school.
However, only 3% of the parents agreed to feel slowly.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he didn't know whether the percentages have been increased or infected in terms of long-term.
However, he is sure that “the youth will be particularly slow,” mainly because children and adolescents do not have a great impact on their daily end.
Returns to my original question: Is Langeweile healthy?
Sometimes not, because, in extreme case, it causes people to take extreme physical risks and to lose happiness or drugs to lift them - they have shown studies.
Otherwise, many philosophs and authors investigate the relationship between Langewile and Creativeness. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich who has been investigating the subject for more than two decades.
"In the longewile, the brain wants to say that you should do something else," says Gary Marcus, Professor for Psychology at the university of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what you should do.
If a slow and use this energy to play and cook gitar, you'll be happy.
However, the television can care for happiness, but it is long-term.
Hence, whoever is worth a iPad, he can take it from the long-term, but has not learned to maintain himself or control himself, Professor Fenske says.
And he adds: "Seal controls are transferred from a situation to the other."
The child learns not only to hold up, but is also more self-controlled in other areas.
I don't think we should have a long-term selling.
We should not also see them critical.
Instead, our goal should be to enjoy our continuous activity and technology revision.
Professor Eastwood's right to it.
"It sounds like it should be swimming to us. But longewile is the wonderful, inevitable desire to do something senseless," he says.
He believes that people in truth are just looking for a way to stop and relax themselves.
"In a environment where we are continuously overstimized, it seems hard to be employed when the laugh is once broken."
There is no clear guideline for the new Marihuana law in Colorado
The 19-year-old Community College Student and football player Anthony Orozco is located in the south of Colorados for a court that will be already legal in this State: the possession of some of the less marihuana broken and a phefei with which he smokes.
According to Orozco, he and some friends on September with the car in Lamar near the borders to Kansas when they were held.
After the police officer Marihuana had found in the car, Orozco was loaded for the possession of drugs and drugs - covale crimes that are covered every time with a sentence of 100 US dollars - and received a sentence.
"We're gonna be treated as criminal," says Orozco.
But he's also one?
In the uncertain weeks following the State's decision to legalize small amounts of marihuana for own use, the response of hundreds of smaller drugs is less than law than the location.
Hundreds of rules that turn to Marihuana will be left here and in the state of Washington, which has approved similar measures.
Police authorities do not follow adults more than 21 years of validity, and this is legally authorized when the new laws enter into force in the next weeks.
But state lawyers in the conservative districts Colorados have announced to continue to follow existing marihuanadected marijuana delicts and are still quoting people before the court.
At the same time, several cities agree to prevent new, stately licensed marihuana businesses in opening in their communities.
"This situation continues so fast that I don't even know what will happen as next," said Daniel J. Oates, head of police in Aurora, which is east of Denver.
And the regulatory authorities in the state of Washington are ratifying the head.
They waited for an orientation aid to establish a license system for production, manufacturing, sale and sales of drugs, and have so far before 1 December 2013.
In Washington there is a view that Colorado is predicting most of the states about the regulation of Marihuana, where drugs were only to medical purposes and then legalized for their own consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so the state is good to orientation," says Brian E. Smith, speaker of the supervisory authority for spiritists in Washington State.
But Smith also provides that no place or system can do more than to serve in the sense of a large leadership.
"We don't have a real event of presentation we can follow," he adds.
The Washington Law, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December, also forms the endpoint of a green zone where the State License System is not yet existing, but the possession is legalized.
And incredible practical questions must be explained at this time - for example, how the public provision of a "acceptable access" marihuana is to agree with the prohibition of cannabis businesses in around 300 meters of schools, parks, playing places and children's care institutions.
"Whenever there will be more difficulty to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, speaker for the "Center for Legal Cannabis", a recently established research group.
On November 21, Head Oates sent his employees to Aurora a email in which he stated that the lawyer would not follow smaller marihuana crimes in persons over 21 years, and that the police will "for immediately" no criminals will be pursued.
Head of Oates added that the police would continue to implement urban requirements to regulate farmers of medical marihuana and would continue to follow drugs.
In Ward County in North Colorados, a more strict view is shown by the Administrator Ken Buck.
After the vote, he agreed that his authority would continue to follow cases of Marihuana's possession, mainly to move consumers to displace.
Today, 119 persons must be responsible for the possession of about 50 grams or less than Marihuana, although many have been sentenced for other crimes.
"Our authority has the obligation to follow infringements in which it was a matter of criminality at the time of dealing with", Buck replied in a statement.
The reactions are even in places such as the rural Mesa County, where the elections refused the Marihuana Initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the country cities, shows that adults have smaller numbers.
Avocat Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, however, that it was also decided not to leave all the existing ownership procedures.
"I don't believe I lost my time to do the right until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of the elections in Colorado supported the measures, it was already clear that it would not be easy to agree with the personal consumption of Marihuana with the complexities of government and the legal system.
And the opposite reactions in the whole State fostered a deep substance among local officials in respect of the great green experiment at day.
A "cultural barrier" was an advocate from Denver, a lawyer from Denver, who is a lawyer for Marihuanadelics in the court and acted as speaker for the national organization for the reform of marihuana.
"They have spent a great part of their lives in order to pursue people in criminal law that they are still not able to accept the legitimacy", he believes.
As the first States, treating smaller numbers of marihuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are treated as national models for the legalization of drugs.
While preachers and State officers were prepared for a period of legal sale, they were nervously waiting for instructions of the Federal Government to continue to treat the sale and construction of Marihuana in federal levels.
Preachers of the legitimacy movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will be set up.
Despite several careful arrests of consumers and sales of medical marihuanas, the Federal Government has allowed the sale of medical marihuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other countries to be held in majority.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy managers of the Obama government, is the view that criminal officials probably will not be entered into the doors to take smaller numbers of drugs, but they are likely to be resolved under the new legislation, legally regulated marihuana business.
several cities in Colorado did not even expect the federal authorities to act.
Before the election, some local communities authorized moratories for new marihuana business, although they could only be opened in about one year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in west, decided a six-month ban, which probably was adopted next week.
"We don't want to go into a position where we license someone and then stand at the federal level before a great problem," says Bob Nicholson, a member of the city Council.
Our community has voted against this legislative amendment.
We are talking about what the community has decided and not about what the State has decided.
There are still many questions open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was moved from Oxford because I am Tory
Not only university students today are attacked for their views
It was my greatest dream to get a place at the Oxford University.
Although my father and my old brother had visited the university that I first had for the world’s greatest temple of knowledge, for a modern Greek symposium that promoted the largest pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks after my arrival in the Precester College end of the twenty-first years - there I had planned to study the story - I had packed my coffee again and so the first skandal of my life.
My dad put together in the tears.
My friends were confused.
In Evening Standard, I would have gone because I had had a problem that compliances had in the closed room.
The author A N Wilson declared that I would have left the university because I was able to drink in damaged tastes.
But the truth was less fun.
I'm gone.
Yeah, go, because I was slowly under systematic mobing and threatening.
Not just because of my right name, or because I had come from a private school.
It was just a reason for me to be discovered - a reason that seemed to be so sweet and grause: My medieval murderer father Woodrow Wyatt was a important adviser Margaret Thatchers and I was a favorable representative of the Conservative Party.
Why do I win this right now?
Now, the present reports result in a new generation of students of slowly rights under similar persecution.
The organized and growing hass on Tory students in Oxford has developed a number of such dimensions that requested a group of them to protect the same right protection last week, to benefit from schools, disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Christi College will be admitted to their political views "not actively isolated, personally attacked and for desirable explanation".
They call for a place in the Equalisation Committee of their colleagues to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
A recently extract documentation on political students on BBC 2, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right," the Tories was represented as an excenter and Neonazis.
It was shown by other Absolute Joe Cooke, former President of the conservative studental association of the University of Oxford, who went to a Rolls-Royce and proclaimed with silver and silver snake.
In other universities, conservative students say they are considered as a "sind table for the introduction of higher studies."
The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice-President of the Conservative Students Association of Nottingham University, took place in a Sunday period: "There is a growing link to universities.
People believe we're like the Bullingdon Club, without having ever known us."
Samuel Roberts, 21-year-old student in Corpus Christi, who launched the search for greater protection, is the view that such a climate is "ungenehm". The 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, a 19-year-old president of the conservative student association of Oxford, has observed a growing refusal to students in the JCR.
"This represents a danger for the intellectual discours and for the well-being of members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an unbelievable 18-year-old boy, I had arrived in September 1986.
The hair at the conservative party had reached its height point.
In the past year, Margaret Thatcher, a former student, had no honor titles in high schools.
The atmosphere had even been shocking stalinists.
In the first days of the first sister meeting, at the new students and the tutories, I received a preview of the future events.
I made the experience that the tutories participate in the disappointment of Tory students, not only with joy.
Political topics such as mountain workers, privacy and refusal of the government of sanctions against the Apartheid-South African regime found their way in the wooden places of the tutorium.
In my first events, I should translate French texts from the 18th century to the English, which I had not been taken to what should happen.
"Miss Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (middlely murder), "truly translate the first paragraph."
I got it.
Pitt was a little man with a face like a sweet, and very sweet.
"Do you refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students were shocking.
In my eyes, the clouds smile up.
"I propose that they take some French hours in your free time - so if you are not too employed with your social activities," he insisted on Pitt.
I returned to my room with heavy head.
Tonight, I sat alone at the college at dinner when someone made me easy to tip on the shooter.
It was a English student from the second year named James, who was a member of the conservative students association.
"I know who you are," he said friendly.
Unfortunately, it's how it is.
Everyone who's suspected to be Tory will be disrupted.
It's enough for me, but they know that your father Margaret Thatcher is near, so it's gonna be worse for you.
The majority of the Tory Prime Ministers offers to be composers of the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I tried to dismiss me later.
I found that I was not in any position with Mrs. Thatcher.
This trick should be a follow-up.
An investigator in the section of philosophy, policy and economy, which was ironely visiting the Eton College to be conservative, said to me, "You are the daughter of a specialist."
You're intimidated.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and crazy.
"Where are Tories Sex?" asked me one.
They shoot each other, right?
I felt like homosexuality had to feel before the United States' liberal legislation.
Would I have to lead to normal life at the Oxford university?
Should I just meet the darkness after the invasion of the earliest?
Should I apply the Labour Party and stress my natural attitudes?
In the three years before me, those who were laughed were decreasing before my spiritual eyes to a fire of respect and isolation.
The only tutor who was open to recognize himself as Tory was Norman Stone, Professor for temporary history, who had his seat in my college.
He was not only hate to be a conservator, but also because he consulted those in external policy and had written for them talks.
He was just rare.
He hated the place, found him provincially and small carded and refused him for his marxistic-determinist perspective.
1997 he adopted a professor at the Bilkent University in Ankara in Turkey.
"You will not be happy here," he said to me.
I began to pendell between Oxford and the house of my parents and found refugee for closed friends and family members in the city.
My father told me I hated Oxford and why I did it.
He seems unbelievable.
During his time in the 40th century, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said small.
So they would never do anything, not in my city of the dreaming towers.
Even my communist friends have always left an immigrant manner on the day.
His fired eyes were checked.
Give me the whole chance.
I'm sure you're just kicking.
It would break my heart when you were going.
Increased by my often traveling to London, my emotional resistance was weaker.
One of my husband's friends, also the Tory-Ambassador, had shown the pressure and was convincing.
During a tutorium in the next week, in which a new statue was seriously observed, I am "un enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Although I was in secret before the shame, I agreed that my parents had understood a "the brain wheat" and called her "ancient dog".
The facilitation was only short.
It was my father who took the last nagel in the king of my Oxford carrière.
At that time, he wrote two columns per week in the Murdoch Presse.
My door was closed.
I hid me in my room, and five minutes later my household was opened.
When they went, I packed a coffee and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You can call me a weird sleep slaughter.
But no 18-year-old age should ever suffer in a educational institution under such assault and integrity.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university that not only produced 14 Tory Prime Ministers, but has hidden himself up to this day after an unlawful call of equality and thinking freedom.
"Valentino is the elegance of the famousity."
In response to the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Coture" which was opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian moderators.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I from England, is the only place in the British capital, which is the hosting of a exhibition over Valentino Garavani.
This has recognized the designer in the opening of "Valentino - Master of the Couture", a great retrospective for which more than 130 clothes of the skin cows were built by his "maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palast," he says with his unchanged Italian acent.
This exhibition is the end of a history which is the only protagonist "il masters" of Garavani, which could not be written without his distinguished client.
Valentino has always been fascinating for the stable and far-sized world of the edel.
In the first room of this exhibition, which will be seen until 3 March, there is a variety of private letters and photos with the signing of the most excited aristocracy, starting from Princess Salimah Aga Khan, over the Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memorys as a trophile of his social resurrection by the decent modemactors in the city of Voghera in North Italy to the idol of the international jetsets.
Be loved in the oil, you must not be departure.
"The least they're not going to show their skins on your magnificent tasting, as it's a few beautiful fascinations from the popsic", says Baronin Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 70s, the two lived in the Alpen and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, magnificent and elegant guest.
"We all enjoyed when we were invited to Gstaad in his house," the ex-frame of "Heini" thyssen explains closely with forgotten beautifuls such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always presented the election of the famousity.
But he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a clothing of Valentino
The Argentinian model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the moderator.
Many years ago, we went home to the house at Piazza di Spain to Rome after a model.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Each detail of his apartment, the decoration, the food and the music were recognized and felt its influence.
"All inviters felt important and loved," remembers the "Top model", which began their train trains in Paris at the week of the skin cotuare 1995.
"He never comes from the mode, because his designs are artistic works", she finally says..
Modenview of origin
The life of Garavani is not a history of generousness, more from mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House was converted into a glorious and 60 meters long-term stage, which proposes a role: the user takes the place of the model and goes to the slope to admire a dreamly "audioness" that leads to the master works of Valentino, such as the clothes that Jackie Kennedy chose for their marriage with Aristoteles Onassis, the costumes that the Monica Vitti took in "La Notte" or a mantel from the Catherine Fabae.
In this post, the names of modern pups are such as Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norwegia, Rosario of Bulgaria or Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Modemacher, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgiving".
I can remember perfectly.
It was a hose, a hemd, a Westen type "Gillette" and a Jacke from the original/Winter Collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the museums of the designer.
"I'm looking for him all others because of his great love for women and because he highlights our beauty," adds the former herzog of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and substrain the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The Princess and Leader of the Patricia Mode of Giovpaola d'Arenberg can also forget the first time when she stood a Valentino.
When I lived as a teenager in Italy, I was dreaming about having the age and the opportunity to put one of his evening clothes...
Finally, the end of the 1990s came.
I bought my first Valentino clothes for a festival in the close of my vetters, Prince Edouard de Line.
It was a red clothing with fly rock and a draped superparty with a decollency that makes his name honor.
"It was a real dream," the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg says.
"Valentino does not depend on the mode, his property is untimely", explains this Italian aristocratin who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps their evening clothes of the modemacher "with absolute sorgfalt", "for a clothing is not only a clothing but also the related memorys".
The "king" of the Mode
The great end of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding clothing of Marie-Chantal Miller for their marriage with Paul de Grecia in 1995.
Four months work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the modemacher called his neighbors) were necessary to provide this eight-colored seed clothes with Perlen, 12 different strikes and a four-mill metro long Switzerland.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the superior authority of the expert pressure, this clothes was a milestone in the skin coture end of the 20th century, "the return to the clients of the top society".
For years with the "shout" of the Elite, Valentino is now her best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest registration Italys), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Art and of Letter, excellent with the honouring lection, culminates Garavani as many honors as each of his customers.
"I'm always his coffinment, his peace, his buried and perfect eye," says D'Arenberg.
I saw him last month ago at a gala end at the museum de Orsay.
He stood on the table of Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of me.
"He was makellos; the time doesn't leave any shoes to him."
And that's a princess...
The most difficult work in the world: the human workshops of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the indonesian vulkans play their lives and their health when they take 70 kg sleeves over the steel, stone paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others are working in hell.
This is the case in Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 mine workers who gained their lives by taking the sleeves from the Vulkan Kawah Iyen east of the Indonesian island Java.
To this end, he must increase every day on the ground of his crater, where the swimming gas is enhanced from the earth in contact with the air.
After he broken large stones that can swim up to 70 pounds, he carries them into two bambus shoes on his shoes through the stones.
Although there are only 250 meters to the slope of the vulcanic, which is up to 2386 meters, but the shooted brakes need more than 40 minutes for the upset in the crowd crowd time, while they keep the balance and need to take care of their steps so that they do not shoot and shoot them.
You know that every step can cost their lives as this happened to a French tourist who slaughtered the parts of the Kawah's people for years.
The mining workers of Kawah Ijen gained 5 euros for each kilo swimming pool.
On top, they spend the way between the tourists that they're photod as circles and walking with the swimmingly heavy swimming swimming swimming up three kilometers to waage that a mining society has set a little more down on a height of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, who has been using the events in the vulcan and (no better said) its employees who pays 662 Indonesian rupies (5 euros) for every kilo swivel.
It then sells it to the petrochemical industry for 10,000 rupies (83 euroscents) because this mineral is widely distributed every day and is used for the manufacture of steel olive oil, fire pieces, cosmetics, dynamits, and even for swimming sugar.
"When we normally carry 70 kg, we receive some 46.000 rupien (3.8 euros) for every way," explains Anto, which makes three trails in normal cases.
For each route, he needs three hours that he has completely done, but at the end of the day he has joined 138.000 rupines (11.5 euros).
What seems to be a miserable loan for such a huge immense effort, but the three-face of what he would have to do with the field work.
"The daily salary of mining workers here, where 15,000 rupien is paid on the day (1,2 euros) and the average month income of two million rupies (167 euros) is very high", explains the band who worked before on the tourist island Bali.
There he won 75,000 rupien (6.2 euros) on the day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto is with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near, and that is because of a reason that is so important that I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hinduists, and I brought them to Java to convert them to Islam.
Anto has asthma, atmet with difficulty, smells often and his eyes are shocked because of the harmful gas.
The 27-year-old Anto has been a game on the cake for three years, whose shoe has left the first shoes with him, although he covers his face with a mask and special bridge.
Anto has asthma, amet with difficulty, often shocked, and his eyes are shocked because of the harmful gas from the fire.
This is the price he must pay for the achievement of his dream.
"I'm going to work here for two years, because I want to make a load or learn Spanish or French", he promises in a more than just acceptable English.
This young man who has been punished by life could work as a tourist leader, Kelner or at the receipt of a hotel, but instead he do the work of a trageel.
He shares a sharp wood shoes with other shoes every morning, and is up to two hours each morning, because the swimming swimming even night, where his characteristic yellow color in the darkness is bright.
Despite the shadows, he increases in the light of a small shooting lamp on his hero that he purchased himself from his own money in the crap.
About 400 bands were loaded the corners with sweet on their shoes on the ground.
Despite their great gains, the mining society has not mechanized the swimming construction to deal with the costs, and provides the powers working on its own account and paid by weight no equipment.
You also have no share of the 30,000 rupien (2.5 euros) accommodation per photo device, which the observers of this natural park together with the entry payment of 15,000 rupien (1.2 euro) from tourists who come to photograph the volcan and human tragesels.
"This work is for the animals and not for humans," protests Madrusin, a slower, 42-year-old rabbit, who works for three decades since leaving the school at the Kawah Aiyen.
He is able to load up to 110 kg and ensure that he continues to "the time it goes", because he needs money for the education of his three children between 10 and 18 years of age.
I'm not going to be in pension. I'm going to die here because the vulkan was my whole life.
Even if the snake swings the shoes and eyes the eyes when the wind suddenly turns and the mines workers in the shoes that rise from the clatter, the men are so hard that no one claims about serious diseases ... of course, except the habitual respiratory problems, arthrose, pain in the skins and skins on the shoes that have formed from the weight of the corner.
With the corb on his back, uninics with 53 years of age can only be able to take 50 kg.
Each day, he and his friends cut 15 tons of swimming swimming from the vulcan, which is transported by three LKWs through a swimming pool between the shooting to the camp in Tamansari in 18 kilometers away.
"I will not go to pension, I'll die here because the vulkan was my whole life," Uninic explains, when he opens his mouth far away, in which some teeth lacks.
From his five children the elder works with his 30 years of age as sweefel.
The time is forgotten, but poverty holds generation into a generation in one of the worst professionals of the world: those who work as human slaughter.
Singapore needs babys to save the economy
Singapore slaughter's fault for no children, on career, stress and costs of real estate and children's education.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I'm a patriotic husband, you're my patriotic wife: We fulfill our citizenship and we make life!
It seems unbelievable that the version of an advertising for Minzbons, but - or just so - they became a viral video on YouTube at the beginning of this year in Singapore.
The samples are part of a rapper song that the local sweets such as "sleeping" will be a "bao" (Laib) in the pars in order to make themselves quiet over the low grain rate in Singapore.
The advertising BBH, which has turned the video, is the hope that the advertising is pleasantly reaching a way to make attention to the problem.
His creative leader Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the power of music to bring people to comply with their "national obligations".
This is just something for the Internet, so we had to make it sweet and sweet.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
In continuing plants, we are the worst of the world, so we noticed that it is a subject to what we had to care for.
We knew that the government had many attempts, such as the marketing of paraphomons with pheromones or the organization of Speed Dings (speak fleet).
Maybe many of these ideas were creative, but they did not lead to success.
So we thought: why do we not do something as creative as possible to address this problem, for example, to compose a rap?
1,2 Kids
The Government of Singapore is not easy to take this topic.
Each year, it provides 1.300 US dollars for political measures to engage citizens to get more children.
A government package for marriages and parents is granted up to $15,000 per child, extends the maternal allowance and distributes tax benefits.
But everything had little success.
Singapore is a rich, high-technological state in South Asia, also known for the conservation of his governments and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the plant rate is currently at 1,2 children per woman.
The last time that this rate exceeded 2 - what is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singapore get any more kids?
Tan Wei Ming, Director for Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Authority, says that this should be returned to a "better training" and "more career opportunities".
"This has enabled people to marry and have more options in terms of life goals and set priorities, except a family.
These changes in social responsibilities have contributed to a higher number of individuals and to the members of the Council and Heritage whose result is in the reduction of the birth rate in Singapore.
During the course, an immigration policy, which aims at a drastic increase in migration in order to enhance the reduction of the population, was a residue in local population.
In Singapore there are websites where lacking xenofobia against many new immigrants, especially against Chinese people who are criticized to keep their loss low and not integrate.
The increase in immigration is also considered one of the reasons for the Government party in Singapore last year its worst election results since the independence has been achieved.
Since the elections have been tried to correct the problem with higher contributions and expenditure for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
During the falling rate, the known effects on the economic growth of a country, tax revenue, health costs and immigration policy also show unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to reach the construction of so many small apartments.
It also has an impact on the housing market.
The City Development Authority has thus started to control the number of small apartments known as "shoots" and to be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a residence area of 46 square metres and show a great sell result.
However, it is the concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the single one, and that the construction companies are decreasing to build large apartments for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the Employees Company EL Developers, says that his "shootings" would make a lot more faster than greater living units.
They are so popular, and the units are faster sold than the larger living units for days and even weeks.
This makes them better for our Cash Flow.
However, it provides that the new standards give the developers more clearly guidelines that previously have been putting obstacles if they wanted to build too many small living units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could prepare the way to increase the national farm rate, the discussions with Singapore workers in the financial area are to be taken that they will not have a great impact.
"The people are strongly stressed, the apartments and also the education are more money, because it is slaughtered by many," says a young manager.
The children can get others.
"For me, it's important to have my own money and time," says another, about twenty-year-old man.
Man and women lead their careers, stress and costs for ownership and education as a reason why they can't have children.
That is why the Singapore have the last word when it is about to get children - there can the government still do so much.

According to the Wordbook, it is the property private or "in the area of the private life, where the right to protection is available before any kind of infusion".
What is private for someone under 16 years of age?
How is this definition applied to its daily and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he expressed when he knows the situations that he would not share in real life?
The periodic interviewed five youths between 10 and 15 years of age, often underway in the network.
In four of the cases, they linked the term "what is very personally" at the personal level and "to the password and the user", when they applied it to the social networks.
"My deep secrets would not be known in a post," says the 10-year-old Jorge when trying to explain the importance of "private" on websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has two years of counts.
"These are very confidence secrets, my mother can know them, but not all the world," he confirms.
On FB I load beautiful pictures or images of games high.
I also leave my time with people.
"I wouldn't share any photos that aren't from me, or by someone who makes the stupid head," he says.
The boy is clear that it is wrong to write obsessing photos, nacket photos, to publish crimes, or political or violent comments.
Jorge assurances to know 35 friends that he has in FB and nine followers in Twitter.
Most are friends.
And the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I reported to Twitter to express me and write interesting Tweets.
"I don't know if someone answers me, I'm calling them just high." he adds.
"The social networks are hard, I can quickly talk to friends in the television or with friends," he says.
When he answered that he would never take an invitation from an unknown one.
Even if someone recommends him a foreigner, he would ignore this.
The case of the 14-year-old José is different.
The youth has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask, he does not know 20 of the people he added his friend list.
"This doesn't horrify me because we have something common, for example music," he says.
After the kid's indication, nobody did him or asked him after his address or phone number.
"If someone threatens me or she asks me, I simply remove him from my user account."
José reported to Ask when he had read a recommendation in Twitter.
The boys are unknown experiences that are known today as Cyberbullying.
The accused friend was printed in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He has never learned who it was," he said.
According to José, the victim did not close the user account.
"He just made it private."
Then he explains a series of steps to configure a user account safely.
Rather than Jorge, this young man's photos of populars would be loaded in unprecedented or painful situations.
Yeah, I would do that if he's our sympathetic or I want to take him out.
"But I know that this is Cyberbullying," he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, teacher of English with high school schools in education and learning, means that to orientate children and youths, it must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks.
"The Internet was a media for searching information; with the appearance of these pages, the game rules have changed", she says.
Porras explains that the Academiker Marc Prensky, the holder of a master piece in Pédagogic at the Yale University and the author of the "digital Natives and Immigrants" work, formed these terms for the declaration of the phenomenon.
The digital natives are they, the children and youths who are grown with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants they should teach where we still learn."
He explains that it is a complex topic, "for we want them to have a definitive criteria on what distributed, published or said, and this is in a age where the rif is not sufficient for it."
"They should also be chosen if it is the most important to be popular to have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the experts, the most effective way to teach children and youths what is privacy to ask them questions that she brings to think about.
"They say they don't have to do it, don't work," he says.
Afterward, Porras calls some possibilities: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger. Why do you then do it on the Internet?
Or: Would it be for you if you publish a photo of you, how did you published by a friend?
Do you know what the others say about you?
Have you before asked the other persons for permission when you labeled photos of holidays?
And another question: Do you all know what you're doing at any moment?
Another point is to give them understanding that they must act online, how they do it offline.
It's the same rules.
"Aucun outside the Internet acts with respect, sexuality and other principles, and the same need to apply to social networks," he says.
Monitoring
Stuardo Guardia, Professor of university, primary teacher and scientist advisers, comments that it is unreasonable that parents read the directives of the social networks carefully.
If they understand all sections, they have solid bases to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the internet.
"For example, the age, or what to share or publicly."
According to Guardia, children must be reminded of the lesson "Don't talk to foreigners."
End of the Summit of the Unsur without publication of the Declaration of Lima
The 6th Meeting of the Presidents of the South American Union (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the Declaration of Lima, which was previously announced and should be theoretically signed by the seven present governments.
Efe reiterated to reach access to the signed document at the VIth Order meeting of the Head of State and Government heads of the Unsur. Sources in the State and President's Office initially shared that they would deliver it according to the clausure, however, they explained that it would be published on the Peruvian Government's website.
In the context of the text, they pointed out that the content of the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, was presented in short statements to the press.
The access of journalists to information on the meeting was limited at any time.
During the day in the press room, only the image of the President's headquarters was transmitted to the message "private meeting, limited audio".
The few information circulated under the journalists were received by some of the governments of the unsur, but not by the Peruvian Press speaker.
The only document that was distributed during the day was the list of participating Presidents, which was inspired by the hundreds of journalists of various national and international media that requested more information.
Then the President of Peru’s media sent an e-mail to the Meeting's final statement, but it was about the statement of Humala and not to the official document on the conclusion of the Meeting.
In the past October, Peru host of the gipfel South America - Arab States (ASPA) was also published in this case, although the press was the so-called declaration of Lima, which was previously announced, too little.
On the official website of the ASPA, it can be convinced that the document was published at the last service day.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that information systems for journalists would be available, but they were limited to access to information at a high level.
The Meeting also ended with the common commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a sentence of the Court of Justice of Den Hague, which constitutes a border conflict between two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, were meeting during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would take the decision of the IGH, which began to start on Monday in Den Hague, in the process that lifted the Lima against Santiago to listen to the Pladoyers on both sides.
"We will follow and execute the judgment of the differences we presently present this International Court of Justice," said Humala, together with his Chilean opposition.
"Chile was, and is still a country that holds the international laws to seek peaceful solutions for conflicts, concludes and undertakes the international courts," adds Piñera and greeted Humala with a hand pressure against the faces of both countries.
The confirmation of both Presidents that they would be subjected to the IGH, after the Colombian decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which had seen a serious error, had a complaint against the Bogotá Agreement, where it agreed to submit the judgments of this International Court of Justice.
At the meeting, the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, who has been excluded by his President Fernando Lugo since 2011, did not participate in the meeting.
The guest President Ollanta Humala opened the meeting on Sunday and ended the meeting short after the midday period in Lima.
The Head of State leaves the concluding document, which reported that 16 decisions were taken and the trendlines for 31 projects between South America's countries were set up over an investment amount of $17 billion in total.
He said to the decisions taken that the Unsur countries will be "decisive steps towards the goal of a South America State citizenship, which we extend the decisions on residence rights".
He shared that measures would be prepared in order to "enhance cooperation in the fight against insecurity in the cities and against organized, transnational crimes, and measures to improve access to medicines and internet low prices in all areas of Southern Ricanese and to act jointly and efficiently in the case of natural disasters".
With the crisis in Europe, "the economic consolidation (in Latin America) should not take triumphant trends, but should be used to expand our production performance and to make our people a better future."
"We have decided to give a number of 31 emblematic projects priority to improve the space connections in South America and especially in rural and border areas... and thus join our countries and adopt new economic forms", said the Peruvian President in a reader statement.
In these projects, five Peruvians were also flowing from the coast to Brazil, and two of which should be able to ensure better connection with Ecuador, although he had no further detail.
The final document also refers to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the chosen process in this country will serve for its rebuilding in the Union of South America," from which it is currently excluded.
The need to remain an integrated region for well-being and peace and well-traditional relations was another aspect that was highlighted on the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, expected to treat respectfully the maritime conflict after a IGH sentence in question by Bogotá on Saturday in Mexico.
"That may be I'm going to meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow," said Santos.
"We will review all these ways - they are not exclusively, and the Nicaragua Agreement also requires discussions with Nicaragua", he said.
"I hope to say to President Ortega that we will be civilized and respectfully treated as possible," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to be attended by the new President of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As a part of the Meeting, the Minister of Defence of the Block on the adoption of the Plan of Action for 2013, which is to strengthen the dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, even if the last country is currently excluded.
Peru has the Presidency at the time of the regional block.
"South America must learn in the integration of the citizens", says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common State citizenship is a goal that "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who took part in the sixth meeting of the Presidents of the Union of South America (Unasur), who took place in Lima, explained the public television in Peru that the Europeans were "in the second World War and in other interferences" and "we are now a paternal country".
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship that extends the Member States to the unsurrected.
"The freedom of movement of citizens and employees in all South America countries, as it is already in the Andean Community, is important; however, there are still reactional sectors that work back to the past," he warned.
The President Ecuador also welcomed the re-education of the United States of America (EEA) under the provision of reduced the impact of the countries in Asia and to take into account those signed by the Agreement of San José on Human Rights.
Those who teach themselves will never be able to do anything, and on the contrary, we always sign the South Americans.
"It is unbelievable that the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights has been funded by the United States, and has been financed by the United States," he stated as an emphasis on the political asylum, the Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because he did not deal with his principles but comply with his "deep democratic values and views of human rights".
He added that it had been "funded consciousness that Assange delivered to a third State and would not keep its procedures".
He also criticized the Swedish Justice, which he requested to submit to him in his State area a crime for an appropriate sexual crime, while "the Swedish law practice allows it through a video conference that could be carried out over the Ecuadors message in London."
Correa declared that the risk would affect the health and the mental situation of Assange.
"When he was in our message, I didn't talk to him, but the messenger informed me that he had a easy problem with the lungs, but no difficulty," said the head of the State Ecuadors.
However, it improves the risk that he faces physical and psychological damage because he has been captured in a close room and could not carry out physical practices free.
"This would affect any human health," he added.
Correa acknowledged that the solution for the asylum, which Assange has been granted since June in the message of Ecuadors in London, was to be a free letter that he could travel to Ecuador, and that it was in the hands of the British, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe. He stressed that it had given a discussion with London to find a solution for the fundamentals of WikiLeaks.
We do not act with human rights, but we do not apply this word for this case, but it has given continuous discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of the British, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe, because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, leads a number of procedures to various European institutions," he said.
And "If Britain has granted this free letter morning, this is my opinion."
And when Mr. Assange heard about the Ecuadors message in London or Skype, how it allows the Swedish law and was done in other cases, if the problem was done.
Correa used the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of the freedom of pressure and said that what he did not tolerate is "the medium-sizedness, the wicked hope and the lies that reassured the freedom of opinion".
"The largest enemy of press freedom are not the wicked and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who tried and pressed according to profits," he said.
In this sense, he welcomed the Ecuador that such journalists "and not to be dominated by bankers or hegemone and citizens", and said that "the revolution will be strengthened in a revolution to continue the way in this right direction".
Correa also supported the decision to keep Veto against Paraguay in the unsurrected, at least to its next elections, as he argued that the organization had to "reserve" and that no opportunism and no legally enforced state rule," because "the legitimacy of the democracy was destroyed in Paraguay".
The President Ecuadors also deserves the desire of his Colombian opposition, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice of Den Hague, which offered the maritime Stateness of Nicaragua to negotiate the legal borders between two countries, for "absolutely".
This judgment is not implemented.
This is a problem between the South and the Middle America State.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome after a common way.
They must be treated completely so that you can overcome them and look forward.
He also believed in a good closure of the conflicts on the sea borders between Peru and Chile before the same Court of Justice, and said that "this is right to call international institutions if both countries are able to accept the judgment, even if it seems very hard."
With regard to the possibility that he becomes a candidate for the next presidency elections in Ecuador to achieve his third mandate, he said that he "see much optimism and joy, although sometimes it is very difficult."
Correa assured that if he dissolved the elections in February 2013, he would return from the political life.
Power has never interested me personally, but in such unjust circumstances as Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the faith that I was that guaranteed this probably victory, so I must follow this responsibility," he said.
If I should win, it would be my last period as President, and then I will return to the public life.
This also applies when we lose.
"This is decided," he explained.
Correa also addressed the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just talked to the Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, and he said to me that he went to the place for a planned and rutinal treatment, and that he would expect to return to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It does not mean, in any case, a delay in the health situation of President Chavez," he commented.
On the sixth meeting of the Union's Head of State and Government heads of South America (Oneaur) took part today in Lima, in order to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
A cause for a death because of AIDS is a too late recognition today
Fabrizio was 21 years old when the research result was confirmed: HIV-positive.
"It was like a bomb," he said about the moment in which he received the diagnosis that the doctor tried to "absorb."
He hid it before his family.
He decided to take care of his disease alone and began to inform about it; and this was the use that he just celebrated his 43th birthday.
He is doubtless one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit of the Civil de Guadalajara Hospital (HCG), in which he arrived after several battles in 1994.
Fabrizio lives with the human immune deficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to imagine in the beginning of the 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment opportunities and more Stigmata.
Thus, the director of the ISS Clinic avoided that it would be adopted, "for it led it to a sack gas."
At that time, AIDS was a synonym for death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome also with life quality.
However, many are still in the clinic that do not know anything about their illness, in which the virus has already caused damage and created its immune system, and the victims of opportunist infections are.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e., after the first reported cases, "it is the great success today that the survival of a patient that takes the treatment timely, and the survival of the general population are exactly equal," the leader of HCG's HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, said that this information was based on a scientific publication in April of this year.
The expert on infection diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but the years of survival and the life quality of the rate of the immune system of persons were decreased at the beginning of treatment, and that the greater opportunities were not depending on drugs: up to 30 years at a division of 200 CD4 and 50 years.
Only say, the above statements mean that, who receives positive HIV-diagnosis in the age of 25 years, in this sense, "unfailable 75 years, as long as it is under control", explained this expert.
To enable this progress, it must be reminded that the life expectation of the Mexicans is now a average of 76 years.
Even though mortality has significantly decreased in the past years (in Mexico, the number of people who died at AIDS has reduced from 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (UNAIDS Annual Report), it is true that 60 per cent of the patients in the national database have died since the appearance of AIDS.
Only 255 people died in Jalisco in 2011, and until May this year, there are 187 deaths; however, there are universal access to antiretroviral medicines since 2005.
- So why are people still die?
- I think it is not the problem of access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and that's in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we had no health problems in the medicines, the problem is that people are in a wide state because they did not know their infection situation, i.e. in very late phases of disease.
He makes a shockful statement: "No nine of ten patients come to us when they are already infectioned. In order to influence the global mortality, diagnoses are necessary for early, for which all persons who need it must offer massive recognition."
This proposal agrees to the experts and officials of the Statal de Prevention del Sida en Jalisco (State Committee on AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and to the patients, such as the manufacture who performed his tests in a private laboratory, and this is the only reason why it had made a friend of him, who had already been in the AIDS age and even the Caposi salmon (a crystal tumor) which was one of the common complications.
Everything's different when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think they're gonna die, and they don't want to hear.
"If I have to die, then I like to smell three times," you say in my case.
The change was to improve, I'll show good, driving sports and take the medicines.
Today his parents know only that he had cancer.
I'm living a normal life, like everybody else.
"I work, so much, I have an active, but responsible sexual life, I take care of my health and the other person," says the factory that is appropriate to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO in order to shoot those who have fear today in the framework of the world AIDS day.
They should do the test if they belong to the risk group. At first they know whether they are HIV-positive, it's better, and if they already know the diagnoses, they should learn how to live responsiblely as all people.
His message is a collection of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condome behind the loading table
Among the health programs and the simple citizens, Ricardo Salazar, a journalist of Guadalajara, has accepted the matter of HIV.
And the most important is the predict.
In some places, "If the distribution of condomes really increased; before they were separated, now they give us a paket with hundreds of pieces, which is good, but there are still people who have no access to a condom," he said.
The risk personnel for new infections are young.
"What do you need this?" is a broad spot question of social workers, orientation staff in schools, pharmaceuticals and health system that did not want young people to take place, assured the correspondent.
It proposed to redirect this inefficient distribution; the condomes should not only be behind the loading table, but also in expenditure devices in public toilets of facilities that are often visited by youth.
It should not be promoted by the promiscuity.
It should not be paid to them the beer and motel, as the Governor Emilio González answered to the question whether it would be distributed under its administration.
"Sexuality does not seem so; best is to bring the condomes closer to those who already exercise a sexual activity", he put it on the point.
Key data of Jalisco
There are 13.435 cumulated cases (1.258 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
The State is seen in 4 places for new and cumulative AIDS cases and 13 in relation to HIV.
92% of the cases of accumulation result in sexual trafficking, 6% of blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 500,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 persons that do not know for any registered case.
After confirming a sentence by the United States that does not recognize the restructuring of the obligations of the Vitro Group that has been reached through trade competition in Mexico, an unfair case of presence for each national enterprises with neighbouring liability in the neighbouring country will be created.
It could therefore be said that the procedures for the survival of companies authorised by the Mexican laws in the country of Stars and Stripes, in resistance to international agreements, have no validity.
On June 15, the judge Harlin Hale at the Court of Justice in Bancarrotas for the northern district in Texas makes it helpful for the mexican companies to make their own property on the side of the river Bravo.
However, the decision opens the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to call the United States' Supreme Court for three inconsistents.
While the judges of this matter point out that the believers must submit to the United States' competition law, the Fifth Circuit's Professional Jurisdiction starts to sit in New Orleans that it is the principal procedure for the trade competition treated in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in procedures for payment incapacity of enterprises with transnational profile is not known.
Indeed, the model law of the United Nations for the harmonization of international trade law was created, implementing the American Law Institutes as a lighter.
Secondly, it is estimated that without the votes of the companies after recognition of the liabilities in the competitive mass, which the branches of Vitro with their mother society, would not be achieved the necessary majority of the restructuring of the liabilities.
However, this option is recognized by the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme was approved.
There is a half of twenty examples, including Agremex and Commercial Mexicona, whose obligations were confirmed under the group by the Federal Institute de Concursos Mercantiles (Bunde Institute for Trade Concursions).
It is also true that after the votes of the filials, the believers of Vitro, the believers who claimed to the Courts of the United States against Vitro, the Geier Funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, had not reached a majority.
The vote would be 45% against 37%.
This is not taken into account by the Professional Court.
On the other hand, Vitro's difficult situation is in the context of the great economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country slaughter.
For this reason, the family González Sada is opposed to the same vocational law in order to comply with the vote, i.e. by all judges, because only three of them agreed.
If not, the Cerciorare entry shall be imposed in this case by the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
In this case, it is important that the Court has provided a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the Figur amicus curiae (Fraud of the Court), which is described in the framework of the Act on Trade Concursion, and that it was noted that it had strictly maintained the agreements signed by two countries to comply with the United States' competition law chapter 15.
In addition, it is noted that the country has subjected to the principles of the Commission of the United Nations for International Trade, i.e. the rules laid down in the cases of cross-border payment inability guaranteed the equality of debts and believers.
Two-banding carbole: a shock for Vitro and the country.
General balance
After the statements by the mexican air traffic services against the former owners Gastón Azquarraga Andrade, who is accused of a begrugeral administration, did not previously progress the Asociation Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores.
The investigation provided by Carlos Dáz Chávez Morineau has now introduced a criminal procedure against the National Bank and Value Commission, which is proposed for the disability of the justice.
The Supervisory Authority has systematically refused to inform the main management of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the employee to decrease from the Bank F/589 in the name of Mexicona de Aviation 198 million Pesos.
These resources were used for the purchase of shares of the Administrador Professional de Hotels (the professional hotel management).
As you know, Azquarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart is rounded
A group of national and foreign protectioners, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of the civil society decided to create a width front in order to reverse the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún at a weekend meeting at the end of the weekend.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and sales centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country outside the wall, complementing a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
The Canacintra (National Chamber of Training Industry) has been reached to join the governments in the south to reverse the monumental institution that destroyed protected areas and represents the mother of all the threats of the industry.
ACTA is dead
Since the Government's request to explain what conditions and circumstances the Mexican messagers in Japan signed the contractual trade agreement, known under the English decline ACTA, has not been identified under the English decline, the case is already archiving in accordance with the Mexican Institute for Intelligence.
As you know, these measures took place, although the Senate had taken the possibility out of view because he considered it a violation of the freedom of opinion in the social networks.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life."
The world's boomer of the Basketball, Hector "Heetin" Reyes, was connected to the corbsport for 60 years and over the whole world.
Sometimes in Puerto Rico has a so large spiritual collection of the country's Basketball history like Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was connected to the Roll Steel in 2008, Rexes was six years long part of this sport, it was as a lower class player, players of the first national liga, voluntary and leader in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of the Basketball Association.
"Mean life in basketball, I have put many gardens, even several at the same time as I was President of the BSN, the head of the National Humanity and the President of the Association in the 1990s," Reyes remembered at a visit from Firsta Hora at him at Bayamón, where he and his faithful wife, Isabel, lived over 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not overcome this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memorys of his long career and proof them.
Bahamon in the heart
The most emotional memories are those who remembered at his time at the Vaqueros from the mid-50s as player until 1982, where he held his 15-year-old jubilium as a business leader or business leader of the club.
"This was my best years that I had mostly met, because I have been part of eight Vaqueros' masters since 1967, it was as business leader, business leader or trainer.
There were many years of fulfillment, including the five masterships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I adopted me with a mastership 1981, the year of the Debout of Jerome Mincy at BSN.
From then "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a very good manager", says Reyes.
I still know that Gene Bartow, who worked here as a trainer and was appointed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said, "I have a very strong and 2 m great player.
Do you want him?"
And this was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players, the Puerto Rico had it.
Bartow then recommended the free-free specialist Raymond Gausse, who left its citizens and was one of our best advertising.
I know how he said that if Mincy had allowed a mastership for Bayamon, Gausse would take care of another.
The mastership of Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but it was already out of a distance because he was already at the top of the association in 1988.
At that time, he proposed to enjoy his full efforts and the Mincy's nationality.
I know we win first at the preolympical tournament in Mexico against the United States.
Then the 1990 World Meeting, where we were in the fourth place, what should actually be bronze, if not the Canadian Schied leader, who gave us the last game to the second time, said Reyes.
Was this group of world masters in 1990 the best nationality you saw you?
She belongs to the best, as well as those who winned the Olympiade 2004 against the Dream Team.
My favorite, however, is the manner of the panomic games in Cuba in 1991, where we win gold and the US team offered a fight as they win us at the World Mastership Bronze.
With this mansion, not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculin" (Origin) were again, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers of León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who couldn't be in there for a kidnapper 1990.
A manity, which may not be the best about personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and prepared us great joy, was that of the 1995 pre-lympical tourist in New Queen, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Paul Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the locked players because of the prepayment on the panomic games in Mar del Plata, we win the gold medals.
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
This was no doubt Piculin Ortiz.
His numbers at the level of the international tourists are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as Piculin.
And this, without taking into account his trains in the various lines in which he has played.
Who was the best trainer from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good trainers such as Julio Toro, Flor Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandit Torres.
I like Leo Arill's work.
What do you think is the best you've reached in the relationship?
I was part of the most successful era of the National Humanity from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN from the beginning of the 1990s to 17 agents in a season.
What's left to do with you?
There are things I had introduced, for example, the regionalization of the lower categories.
That the kids in Ponce, for example, play only in their territory and only meet in the national Playoffs on manities from other edges of the island.
Today the children do many trips and games unnecessary.
At least, I see the result of the training and courses for trainer, table officers and Schieds Directors.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to hear music, see music videos of my time in YouTube, enjoy my kids and go to a basketball game.
And of course, I enjoyed my wife Isabel, who was always on my side.
Larry Hagman is dead.
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Wordh (Texas) and was popular with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas", where he played a grouper, home-touch and manipulating businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the Oil Manager J.R. Ewing in the TV series "Dallas" to a symbol of the Habgier of the 80s.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new stage of "Dallas", died on Friday afternoon because of cancer complications under a press distribution of the family at the Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his loved birth city Dallas, where he again played the iconic role that was mostly pleasant to him," said the family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the holidays of the Championship.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and follow-up series, was at Hagman when he died in the hospital house of Dallas, said her publicist Jeffrey Lane.
He made all the joy that knew him.
He was creative, sweet, sweet, sweet, lovely and talented, and I'm going to miss him very much.
"He was a original person and lived in full trends," Gray explained in a communication.
Hagman was diagnosed in 1992, and he admitted that he had cut a lot over years.
1995 a bad tumor was identified in his liver, and he understood a transplantation.
In the years before "Dallas" Hagman was known in the television as a good type in the 1965-1970s with the "beautyerful Jeannie" of the NBC.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life would be put on his head when he faces an attractive "dwin" (shooting by Barbara Eden), who will live with him in his home.
He was also offerers of two communities that were extracted just a short time, such as the Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
In its cineworks, well evaluated roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his master interpretation of the magnificent deceptive J.R., who made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the CBS television chain on the ewing clan and other figures in their environment were extracted from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising term "Who shot on J.R.?", which expected to create an episode of full emotions, where the figure of Hagmann was almost killed, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were sold in coast houses.
Thus, the series reached an observer record in that time.
When the response was known in a chapter in November 1990, it was converted by a average of 41 million observers that "Dallas" was converted to the second enterprises programme since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which 50 million observers had.
It was Christine, J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. had been shocked and threatened to represent her as a prostituted if they didn't leave the city, but others had reason to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of the Ewing as a corrupt man with a charismatic laugh: a resident businessman and an unfaithful husband who then tried to let his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what to stand on the Grabstone of J.R.," said Hagman 1988.
It should be called "Here the honourable citizens J.R. Ewing."
This is the only business he didn't win.
Victoria Principal, the Middle Series's original series, recalled Hagman as a "excellent personality on and outside the screen".
He is unreasonable and uncomfortable for millions in the world and remains us who have the happiness to know and love him in our hearts.
Ten episodes of the new "Dallas" issued a few months ago, with great success in the TV channel.
The inclusion of five chapters for the second stage was closed, and a sixth chapter was just turned, informed the senter.
No immediate statement was made by Warner or TNT about how the loss of Hagmann would be treated in the series.
born in Fort Wordh, Texas, he was the son of the artists and sanger Mary Martin, who played classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was a young man when she got Larry during her marriage with a lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried to work on the theatre flights in New York early the 50s, and then served from 1952 to 1956 in the aircraft forces in England.
There he learned the young designer May Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many of them had their homes.
2001 he referred his memories "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I haven't written anything from which I believe it could harm someone or affect him at any point," said the Associated Press at the time.
After heavy transplantation, he took place for hepatic detention and worked as volunteers in a hospital to assist in premature patients.
"I pray for them, give them courage, I meet them when their operations are before and afterwards," he explained 1996.
I want to make them a little comfort, for example, "No fear, it's a little unexpectedly the first time, but it's gonna go well."
He also put himself against smoking and took part in several campaigns.
Start of the course studying the "End of the World"
Each week, students study Apocalyptical Topics such as Atom War, Zombies, Virus and Keime and global warming.
Each seed, when the Religious Profesor decided to stop a course over the end of the world, he knew that he had about an inexperienced Angelhaken: the end of the "long Return Review" of Maya calendar on 21 December, who believed that it was the end of the world.
But Charme had no idea what should be expected in the following two months: the destroyed Hurrican Sandy, which some called "Deudarmagedon", and a growing conflict under Israel's participation, the place where the Christian theoreticals believe that the apocalypse begins.
"I have not noticed that this will be the most apocalyptical seed that it has ever been", said Charme this week to students at the university of Rutger Camden (New Jersey).
If someone analyzes what happened today in the world, like if we would have removed 30 days from it, this would be a very good period.
And he remembers that the evil is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor that this seedster, which should actually be the last in the history, offers courses over the "end of the world".
In Temple, the attendant Professor Barry Vacker gives the course "media, culture and the end of the world".
Each week, students study Apocalyptical Topics such as Atom War, Zombies, Virus and Keime and global warming.
"We analyze the reason why these ideas are extended with time," he said, and the way to offer hypothetical scenarios that lead to a certain human behavior.
If nuclear material reached the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could be cut off.
This month, students analyzed films with apocalyptical content and investigated how they compared to the real life.
"I've tried to inform students about what possible, probably, believable and impossible," said Vacker.
At the main campaign of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a assistant professor for art stories and anthropology, have established a team to offer a course with the light term "The end of the world".
"We do not take 2012 to keep the option to keep the course again, for the case the world is not understood", said Restall.
Despite the "first start", students must study, create projects and participate in conclusion tests.
In Penn State, the final test will be carried out at the end of the pharmacypse, because students have no opportunity to continue to work until the night, where the world will be finished, said Restall.
The courses were very favorite.
"In two hours there was no place anymore," said Restall about his course for students with high average that filled with 35 students.
We received emails from students who asked whether the places were free.
Students, on the other hand, ensure that the course is the interested ones.
"It is fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers and Religious and Sociology in Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptical sex or religion is actually only a question of comfort or lack of it.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa for psychology and nurses declares having seen all apocalyptic films.
"I haven't heard anything from a teaching where this is taught", he said.
I enjoy it.
But no one of the students asked - and less than one professor - explained to believe on the last date of December 21.
"In our first project we treated Maya's prophecy, and in a certain way we discredise it," said Julie Zeglen, student in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayas never said the end of the world; it is only a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
He notes, however, that western society has an apocalyptical fear that brings back several centuries when people reacted to changes in their environment with the predictation of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"In some places people don't think so," he says.
This is mainly in the English world of the case.
Joseph Duugherty, a religious professeur of La Salle University, who taught the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question whether he would know a course about the "End of the World".
"The Philippines do not participate at the end of the world," he wrote as an extradition of a higher institution.
We've got a infringement from the pope.
Restall pointed out that many days were spoken from the last court over the years, and said that if there was nothing happening on December 21, "the people immediately think about a new date" or philosophed that the 21 December was the beginning of a seven-year period, which was the end of the world.
Students and Professors take this date easy.
Many say they wanted to go to party on "the end of the world".
"I probably call some friends to smile together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communication.
