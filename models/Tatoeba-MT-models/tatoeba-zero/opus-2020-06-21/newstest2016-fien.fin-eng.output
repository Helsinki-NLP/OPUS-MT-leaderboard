The teacher admits his shooting girlfriend during the emergency phone
My voice is only a little bit of a color university student Shannon Lamb tells the police that he shot her girlfriend and that the police must come to their home.
The Lamb stressed that his "good dog" is alive and probably confused, and said that the closest contacts of the woman were found on this phone.
The police in the field found a message written to Amy Prentiss body and the hair page: "I am so sorry that I could abolish this love Amya and she is the only woman who has ever loved me," stated in the letter that the experts were signed by Lambi.
There was no reference to the fact that the Lamb who taught two network courses at the University of Minnesota Cleveland had already traveled about 500 miles [500 km] to the school camp where the police believes his shot and murdered historian, Ethan Schmidt, the door of this work room.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford reported to the U.S.A. at 10:18.
He told Lambi to call an emergency call a few days later.
By the end of the day, the number of dead arrived: The Lamb made self - murder when the police turned up.
The authorities still tried to find Lambi’s motives on the day after students and staff were taken behind the doors hidden in the hidden.
Scientists both of the States have published information that the students and staff were described as a donor teacher who, however, had a problem.
Students told them when he was waiting for his feeling.
The police says that Lambin had no violence or crime records.
Schmidt himself had incorporated Lambi to write to his book where he thanked "making people" with whom he shared his life of academy.
Both the students taught society sciences and history, with a total of 17 members of the staff, and many students participated in the courses of each man.
On the other hand, there were marks of the problem.
The student named Brandon Beavers was in the Lambie, but he said that he also seemed to be nervous and unpleasant, "no matters like anything had been sweet."
Another student Mikel Sykes told Lambi that he had a lot of stress at the end of 2014-15.
The Lamb had previously asked the hospital from Delta State University to say that he had some health problem.
He's just taught two network courses this year.
The recent changes in the university's reward principles mean that, although Lamb had worked a lot of doctoral values, it did not give him an automatical development and an opening profile.
Professor William LaForge said that it wasn't between Lambi and Schmidt to know that there was any conflict, but that "speakly the Lambi's thought was something."
The Lamb can't answer these questions.
After the Lamb fled from the camp, the police went to his followers when he moved back to Mississippi's state.
Before he was arrested, the Lamb shooting himself in a .38-caliper shooting house at about eight and a half miles south of the house of his parents from Mississippi Greenville in the former town of Mississippi, reported the student Methel Johnson of the district of Washington.
Lambin's car was still in the skill.
It was not soon clear why the Lamb was just going to this house, although Johnson said to believe that the Lamb knew the people there.
The Lamb was in the area.
Lamb began working at the university in 2009 and taught geographic knowledge and education. In the University, there are 3500 students and it is in the city where about 120,000 people live.
The Lamb conducted the doctor's study in the education science with heat.
One of the old Lambi’s friends described her as a intelligent, charistical and awesome.
Carla Hairston told her 15-year-old and Lamb's 20-year-old age when they met through friends.
Hairston’s friends were in the class, and Lamb was pleasant, older boy who tried to teach Hairston to call a cup for many years.
He was so sweet in those days.
All the girls were shut up when she was there, and now he told 40-year-old Hairston, who lives in Jackson's headquarter in Brandon.
The Lamb and the Princess apparently were watching some time.
The Lamb told her murdered wife, but their marriage association has no evidence.
They had a name of Lightning dog, who lived with them in the Gautier Account.
The police told the dog's okay.
Princess' ex-marry Shawn O'Sten told them a divorce 15 years ago, but I remained friend, and now they have a 19-year-old daughter.
"He's really confused," O'Sz described her daughter.
He was his best friend.
O'Sten told you hadn't met Lambi, but she had heard her daughter Abigail that the Lamb had interested in music and called blue.
The Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both in the summer market three years ago.
Afterward, they were playing together a few weeks.
O'Sten told her daughter to do and sing his own music.
Princess was a hospital who worked for a number of different network companies.
The Julep Rome's bar near Gautier, a marvelous bar, and a swimming chairman Mike Shaffer tells that he saw the Lambin and Princess last night when the Lamb had stopped a bicycle and swimming swimming public.
There's nothing that seemed to be sweet.
"I've got a joyful couple," he said.
We were playing and shooting to each other.
So they're both very nice.
The dead teacher Schmidt led the seminar program of students in the first year and was specialized in Indians and the history of transferring, reported an English student Don Allan Mitchell.
Schmidt was married and he had three children.
He studied at the Emporia State University of the United Nations, as well as the director of his brotherhood and the Administration of Students.
Last night, in Cleveland, Delta States camp, there was a skilled farm in which about 900 people participated, including educational and other staff, students and Community members.
Schmidt’s wife Liz and Brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the messenger, which during the university's colleagues Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Learning continues in the middle week.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
Your crisis is over.
Now it's time to get up.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported about Mississippi Cleveland.
Associated Press writer Emily Wagster Petus from Mississipin Greenville and Rebecca Santana New Orleans participated in the report.
It has been corrected that the police now say the Lambi's emergency call after the shot of Schmidt, and that although the Lamb was referring to his wife of Princess, there are no evidence that they were married.

The Chairman of the United Nations says that the situation of Syria is not armedly resolved
The answer by Mr Ban Ki-moon is that Russia's military support to Syria is that this nearly five-year conflict "non-weaponly resolve", and more weapons only increase violence and millions of people's suffering.
The Director of the United Nations reiterated all parties, including the shared United Nations Security Council, to combine and support any undiscriminate negotiations to find political solution.
In the middle-week newspaper, Ban reported that he would like to meet the five permanent Member States, the United States, Russia, China, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States and the French Ministers of the General Assembly, and later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the Council, the Syrian people and the dividend of regional powers "on made the situation unable to resolve".
The Bank called on five permanent Member States to demonstrate the Syrian crisis of solidarity and unilaterality, as they refer to Iran's nuclear programme when agreed.
8 Recommendations that show that Donald Trump is serious
Some have tried to smell him as a winter.
Others like him only as a joke.
Some of you are waiting for the robbery.
Although some Republicans have tried to shut Donald Trumpia away from the counterparty of the counterparty, it has not been successful.
In the last 11th national question, Donald Trump has been due to the two-number chapter, and some have been seriously understood what this means for the appointment of the Communities.
You're just in the first stage.
These results still do not mean that Trump probably would be the candidate of the Republic.
The comments noted that in this stage, Rick Perry had lost her leadership in 2011 to Herman Cain, which no one could have been able to ensure that any State is in the appointment process.
There are also many reasons why he had problems in general.
Foreign groups such as Jeb Bushin Super PAC and conservative economic organization Club for Growth, however, have marked the synthesis of Trump and have started to use care for his savings.
The following recent stimulation results refer to the fact that the Commonwealth is not only a unique stage:
Trump's recommendation figures have been completed.
Just before Donald Trump announced its emotion in June, Monmouth University’s advisory statements showed that only two decades of the Republic were positively related to the counterparty gas.
By July, the number was 40%.
At the beginning of May, there was 52 per cent.
At this time, six of the ten Republicans are welcomed to Donald Trump.
About three decades say they're denied.
These chapters also consider their place in the first states of the pre-agency.
In the university of Quinnipiac, in Iowa last week 60% of the Republicans reported that they are welcome to Trump.
Two third parts of the Republic of Republic would be satisfied if Trump is a candidate.
In the last week of the CNN/ORC, 67% of the Republicans said that they would be "fellowships" or "pleasant" if Trump was a candidate.
Only two decades said they'd be "insured" if he'd be a candidate.
Only Ben Carson receives the largest extent of the same incentive as Trump (43 per cent of the "successful" vs. Trump 40 per cent).
The next cause of the most exciting exciting?
Marco Rubio's only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of the representatives of the Republic of the Republic would be "unpleasant" or "unpleased", if the representatives recommended Jeb Bush should be a candidate.
Trump's fire is not a problem for the majority of the Republicans.
Although Donald Trumpia has been critical of its optimum speech and injuries, ABC News/Washington Post surveyed 52% of voters on the national level of the Republics believes that the company has a proper quality of nature to the President.
According to the last week in Quinnipiac's survey, the number of Iowa State organized by the First Party Committee is the same: 52 per cent of the Republicans believes that Trump has a suitable quality for the leader.
However, 44% of the question states that his nature is not applicable to the President, and nearly six ten of them agree that it does not belong to the White House.
The representatives of the Republic are taking into consideration.
When the Republicans consider as commentators, they agree that Trump is a real option.
According to the CNN/ORC survey, the four decades were likely to be a alternative for Trumpia when anyone who would be appointed as a candidate to the Republic.
On the end of July, four decades supported Jeb Bushi.
Publication of data: The voters of the Republican Party have not always been able to use a crystal ball.
In the past period of this period, four ten Republicns agreed that Rick Perry was appointed as a candidate, and only 28 percent supported the final condition, Mitt Romney.
In each case, the majority of the voters of the Republican Party is to be believed by the Trump campaign.
Although the Republicans would stand to support other candidates, Trump would still win almost everybody.
Some commentators have noted that the circle field probably has promoted the leadership of Trump, since the adverse encouragement of Trump has been shared between several other candidates.
However, the question undertaken at the beginning of September of the University of Monmouth showed that the hypothesis of the two-traditional kitch between the Trump and almost all other republicans, Trump is in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina at 13 points, Marco Rubiota 14 points, Walkeria 15 points, Jeb Bushia 19 points, and Rand Paul, John Kasichi and Chris Christie on each 33 points.
He's at the point with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to win Trump?
If they were set up against them, Ben Carson would win the businessman on the largest 18 points away from Trump.
Right and just a majority of Donald Trump's supporters have told the decision.
The new CBS/NYT question shows that only a few more than half of the voters that have supported Trumpia have decided whose voice goes.
Your situation can naturally change, and no one can absolutely say that he would never change.
46% reported that they may be able to change candidates.
In each case, the biggest competitor of Trump now has a second inevitable winner, neurochirurg Ben Carson, but those voters who said to have taken a decision are probably two times on the side of the Trump.
Of the six ten Republicans, they say that they are with Trump on the same agreement on immigration.
Since Donald Trump two months ago called the Mexican immigrants as a "fatal" phone of their campaigns, the migration was in the middle of 2016.
Some are concerned that the possibility of Trump's Latin voters are going on the farest Republicans and that it hurts rebuilding enterprises.
According to the new ABC/Post-Chine survey published on Sunday, six of the six Deputy Republicans said that they are with Trump the same agreement on immigration.
So it affects that as long as immigration is in the middle of the matter, it is also Donald Trump.
The destruction to the government has increased in a new way.
The encouragement of Donald Trump and Ben Carson now covers about half of the representatives of the Republic, which is a large part of their position outside their policy.
Of the six ten Republicns, the ABC/Post question stated that they prefer to select an external policy person than a person with a government trial.
They are also enemy to the government of the Union.
Two weeks after the investigation of De Moines Register/Bloomberg on Iowa showed that three four yowa Republicans have been disfellowshipped in the Republicans: 54 per cent is "not satisfied" and 21 per cent of "the real enemy".
Introduction of Jeremy Corbyn by the Chief Minister
The first question of Corbyn has been expected to be joyful since his choice.
The new leader Jeremy Corby at the Labour Working Party will meet David Cameron at the first time.
Corby is up to ask for the first three questions after a little half day, and probably both the media and the unemployed people were closely able to strengthen its implementation.
Corby has required this weekly show for "mother theatre and more facts".
He has also said that he could leave a part of the opportunity to handle his colleagues.
This approach is the first parliamentary test to the leadership of Corbyn when he was appointed to the preserving government and he spoke at the annual meeting of the Centre for Training.
At the same time, the decision by the Director of the Working Party, during the national song, which was held in the Memorial Service held in the 75th anniversary of the United Kingdom, has risen with the views of the conservative civilians and appeared in several prior meetings.
Corbyn's decision not to sing a national sweet has been aware of the attention.
The representative of Corbyn said to his "speakly silence of the session" and that he recognizes "the sport of the Minnesota aircraft in the Ison-Britannia climate war".
The President of the Corbyn Office, Owen Smith, said to BBC two Newsnight programs that he would have invited the Director of the Working Party to sing a national song, despite his views that the Kingdom Room should be delayed.
Nevertheless, the ministers of Warden have refused to join in Corbyn's internal barriers with the differences in the economic, defence and external affairs, and the sixth part of the parliamentary Party has supported him as a leader.
The BBC Policy Robin Brant says that the position of the cocktail users in the European Union and the government's support chairs have been "faced" in the working partner in Corbyn's appointment.
Corbyn said at the Meeting of the Central Organization of Professional Affairs that the Working Party would propose a change that would remove the whole disappearance.
In time, he said that the Deputy was clear in respect of the fact that they only opposed the plans of the government to count up to 26.000 trees from 23.0.000 pounds.
Corbyn comes from the Fifth Employee Chamber, whose David Cameron has taken place during the last decade, in which he has been the leader of the Conservation Party.
The Director of the Working Party has promised a new approach to the policy and now tells us that he has "committed" the ideas for the Prime Ministers and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
Corby, the Popularist of the Northern region, has said that it is too contrary to the question of the Prime Minister, and that he will be arrested as well as the smooth word and the strike promising instead of focusing on serious matters such as poverty, diversity, and challenges of young people.
Corbyn has said that the Ombudsman's Ombudsman Angela Eagle works on his position when Corbyn does not participate, for example when Cameron is outside.
Corby has also proposed that other colleagues may sometimes allow to use talks, and he has said his approach to the President of the Headquarter, John Bercowi, the teams.
When Cameron arrived in 2005, he said to want to move away from a political theater, often combined to the questionnaires of the Prime Minister, but later he had to admit its failure.
Since they were launched to television in 1990, the Chief Minister has been an important measure to assess the ability of the leadership, the management of its sector rooms and its position in the part of other civilians, although the valuers have criticized the fact that they have been only a slow picture that requires great reforms.
Photographed in Joburg: Non-home young ones are trained as photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is difficult to be homeless.

The value of the powder is increased in the decline of the UK
The value of the powder slowed down after the numbers appeared to be increased in the britannic growth, and at the same time, the FTSE 100-index increased the offering of SABMller.
During the period between May and July, the payment of the United Kingdom, including the bonus, increased 2.9 per cent compared to the same time in the last year.
The growth was the fastest after 2009, and it was considered to assess the increase in the rates.
The point increased over the percentage of $1,555, and 0.84 per cent against EUR 1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed 1,49 per cent to read 6229,21.
SABMller was a separate part of the market and increased 20% after the competitor AB Inbev approached it.
The agreement would combine two major panics in the world and together with bands such as Budischr, Stella Artois, Butni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share increased 0.9 per cent after the competitive clause group of Richmont was encouraged.
Richemont's newest sales numbers were expected to be better, and moreover, they pointed out that the sale in China, which is the key market of Burberry, was starting to grow again.
The Glencore shares increased 5% after the counterparty reported that it had collected 2.5 billion dollars by calculating parts of its banking strategy.
Package and paper Group Mond shares were the largest index of 4.3% after the Goldman Sachs changed its recommendation from its company to "Sell".
JD Sports increased 3,1 per cent after the sporting company publicly informed its production by half a year prior to taxes: 83 per cent of the 46.6 million.
According to the director of the JD Sports Company, the highest payments may damage the expansion
Mr Peter Cowgill, director of the JD Sports Company, says that if the minimum payment of employees is higher in the United Kingdom, it may mean that "potental consumers will grow to purchase power".
However, this purchase power is probably not exceeding the higher costs of work for the company, and Cowgill states.
The costs could be addressed to the expansion plans of the company, which would mean less additional jobs.
Metcash starts a food-free campaign against the Ald sector
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA trade in Aldin's attack in South and Western Australia.
Metcash’s smoking sales of food has been initiated in order to defend the IGA market share in South and Western Australia before 700 million of Aldin's attack.
At the same time, Aldi is preparing two departments and the first market opening for the first year in South and Western Australia, which has even been reached by 120 trade. At the same time, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local coal intermediaries and build the IGA bridges through the market of power and social media, as well as events such as the Adelaide show display.
The commercials and purchasers of IGA have been delayed, and the bridges such as the refrigerators from Dunsborrow offer the mass of the IGA trades, and the owners of the trade sell a decrease prices for the fighting of the shooter of Australian football customers.
The Metkashi is expected to develop more details on its defence strategy on September 29 when this food, alcohol and rail tabagment sales will organize the yearly strategy of investors.
There are a lot of games, since nearly 30% of the range of Metcash IGA trade in South and Western Australia are higher than the IGA network of East Metcash States.
The purchasing events in South and Western Australia are well-known, and IGA revengeers have much greater market share than New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: over 30 per cent in the south and 24 per cent in Western countries compared to 14 per cent.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi is taking about 5 per cent of these two States’ foodstuff markets in 12 months after the opening of the first movement.
In its report, Morgan Stanley's analysis, Tom Kierath estimates that the IGA revengeers can lose $360 million per year in sale and Metcash can lose $2,2 million until the end of 2016.
This prophecy is based on the default that Aldi will open up the next year in the south of the 25th and west 30, which produces 500 and 600 million dollars in these regions.
The loss of the sale of food and food products and measurements of the higher costs of Metcash may be paid to Metcash about 13 million dollars of trafficking infringements before the rate and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash lost the market share in the older states mainly Ald and Coles, although in the survey of Roy Morgan, it was said that IGA customers were all the most faithful ones.
Morgan Stanley believes that the Metkashi food and food sale is 3.8% in 2016; 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, so that its market share is 14% from 10.3% in 2020.
Last week, the manager of the Investment Fund and the founder of the Magellan Financial Group Hamish Douglass said in the business in Melbourne that Metcash can "also likely be deleted in decades".
Metcash has refused to respond publicly to Douglass' comments.
However, it was understood that the member of the Metkashi government would have taken contact to Douglassis last week.
The market share of IGA has been calculated from 18 per cent to 14 per cent after 2010, and the production of Metcash food and food rights, which covers products for about 1200 IGA sales, has been estimated at 43 per cent after 2012.
However, it has been invested in more than 150 million dollars annually during the latest of hundreds of products at the same level with Coles and Woolworths, helping vendors to enhance their sales by increasing rapidly increased food, and in the market, the best private signs of the market.
Mr Ian Morrice, Director-General of Metkashi, said that the rate of prices and the increase of sales have increased the strength of the prices and he hopes that smoking sales will return to the growth of products until 2017, first into the fourth year.
President Steve Healy, Australian Tennis Association, supports Thanasi Kokkinak
Thanasi Kokkinakis offers more honor than its critical use
Thanasi Kokkinakis has been able to suffer in the last shock that has ruined his friend Nick Kyrgios around. He is worth more honor than his own critical conduct, says President Steve Healy, Australian Tennis Unit.
The "Special Ks" named two younger member Kokkinakis, unless he wants to come to the public case in which Kyrgios doctor Stan Wawrinkah Montreal Masters.
Shortly after that, in the warning negotiation in Cincinnat, the Headquarter had two times to remove Kokkinaks and his opposer Ryan Harrison, when he declared: "Wawrinkan had to shoot Kyrgios, and I should shoot that shooting."
Although the last time, Kokinnakis was seen to shoot his mail after the slaughter shocked his potential victory from Richard Gasquet in the United States open, Healy was an unhappy defender of Kokkinaks.
Just now, a young man is in Glasgow in a competition with Sam Groth on another place in Bernard Tomici with Davids Cupin in the semi-final of Britain.
"I'm so strongly agreed that Thanasi has only been shocked with its skin," Healy said.
He destroyed his mail because of the crampe in the United States Open, but he is not the first player who ruins his emails when he disappointed, and I feel sufficiently well to know that she's not proud of it.
But he has been very well-being, also in extreme provocative situations in the United States in Open Harrison and so still, and I think he's worth a body.
He has a great team around, he's got a great family around, and I think he's a little deceased.
She's very sweet 19 years old, she works hardly, including its team, and so still, and he has never had problems with other players. He's not worthy in the sweet room, he works lowly, is good, and especially is a peaceful and skilled young man, and I think he should be evaluated according to his ancestors.
Healy has also encouraged the decision to be not taken from Kyrgy, according to that of Thursday, to the main games in this "community decision" for all good solutions, but I still support Canberra's return to a stability team.
"We want to be fully concentrated on games and not all the polymics [Kirgios] around the team," he said.
And Nick has really been slowly collected, such as Federer and Murray have been observed, and he has been engaged in public, and has made some challenging errors and gains all its criticism, but we try to support him, we try to help him understand the consequences of his works, and I believe it is best for the team and for him if he takes some time away from the public to consider these consequences.
European Migration Crisis: Hungary announces the emergency account, closes the borders, arrests immigrants
Hungary proclaimed an exceptional account and closed its southern border by arresting those who tried to go unlawfully to the country; the goal is to cast the future movement into the country.
The king followed the caos when hundreds of migrants were gathered into the unrelated region, and the Serbian authorities reacted with a smooth.
Those who flew from their home violence have now been able to make their tents and have placed an undefinite time between the two inspections of the country.
However, the deterioration increased.
The police's helicopter remaining above them, immigrants cut "Open the border!" and shouted the damages to the Hungarian mechanical police.
Some rejected food and water as protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declared that it is "unacceptable to accept" the return of the migrants from Hungary when they reached more than the Macedonia and Greek.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of a solution, does not cause any damage to civilians.
The debate must be closed with other countries and Brussels," Ivica Dacic said in Praha.
The Ungarn and Serbian government was born after the 28th group of nationalities failed to create a common immigration policy in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed that 400,000 safe places were in the face of people who are now reserved by Italy and Greece, and that the Ministers were able to speak on the final agreement - in the next month or the end of the first year - of which the EU has taken 1200,000 additional places, including part of the Hungary.
The German Alliance Office Angela Merkel and Austria require the summary of the EU Summit, which is discussed in the country's immigration crisis for the next week.
However, Hungary is not hoped that its neighbors or Brussels acted in the next days.
On the other hand, two Southern regions gave the authorities greater authority to act in the crisis and the possibility that you can be closed and safeguarded.
At the same time, Peter Ssijarto, Minister for Foreign Affairs, said that now, when the Serbian border is ready, the country will also be able to make a part of the swimming swimming swimming pool of the Roman borders to stop immigrants coming through the land.
CBS Newsinağ Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners had been disfellowshipped in order to swallow the swimming pool between Hungary and Serbian.
In recent months, Hungary has become the largest stage and arrival place for refugees in the European Union, which many are going to war against Syria and other parts of the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Victor Orban has claimed that the majority of arrivals is the better life of refugees to seek them, and not the poor of armed refugees that are right to protect - this view is strongly conflicting other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that arrived in the middle of the night in Hungary are now defined as a crime to exceed or damage the company from 4 meters (13 feet) swimming pool, which has built the Government towards the southern border of Serbian, and contain the higher prisons for human traffickers condemned.
"The situation caused by the immigration has been proclaimed by the Hungarian government's emergency account," the government informed Zoltan Kovacs to the journalists in the South Szeged city.
We are very clear in this: the overwhelming the border of the Office is a crime.
The Parliament must still be formally accepted for the war planned for the next week, but the Associated Press suppliers have already seen a weak military agent for vehicles and dogs for days.
Gyorgy Bacondi, home security advisor, said that the authorities had taken 45 persons by trying to overcome the border, as well as the 15-year-old country.
They are now a police prisoner, and they are accused of crimes defined in new laws.
The authorities quickly correct the aid.
The Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven supervision sites from Serbian’s reciprocal border after they sent one of these places.
The main border site near Hungary Roszke was cut into the cake when the Hungarians opened a small office of metallics for human processing and the population's groups tried to enter.
Some 20 got inside, but thousands left out.
A group of immigrants supported the main engines between Serbian and Hungary, saying that they refuse to eat and drink until they are allowed to come to Hungary.
2016 Varies: National investigation reported by Hillary Clinton, director of Bernie Sanders, has been shocked on the side
The former Minister of Foreign Affairs Hillary Clinton continues in a two-number democratic appointment chair, but Senator Bernie Sanders circled him.
Clinton is now supported by 47 per cent of democratic voters (absorption of 58 per cent), and the second Sandersia supports 27 per cent (reduced from 17 per cent).
The President Joe Bden has not yet reported whether he will go with his presidency, but it supports 15% of the voters of the Democratics.
Over five months before the beginning of the prevailers, the majority of democratic voters pointed out that it is still too early to say that they would have decided to vote.
However, Clinton's supporters are closer to their own choices than other candidates.
Clinton's recommendation has been calculated in several groups last month after the CBS News Poll survey, and at the same time Sanders have increased some comparisons.
Clinton is strongly conducted in women and malicious couples, but his leadership has fallen.
His appeal has been significantly calculated in the couple of men, and Sanders have only 5 percent of the remaining units.
Clinton's prior to 50-year-old democrats have lost, and he is now at the level with Sanders.
However, Clinton is clearly leading in the couple of older voters.
In the last month, Clinton led Sanders in a double chapter in the couple of liberals, but now Sanders lead to this group with five percentage units.
About half of the democrats of the country say they support Clintonia with enthusiasm if he becomes a party.
The fourth says he supported him, of course, and 15 percent helped him only because he was a candidate.
Six percent did not help him anymore.
It is not very surprised that Clinton's current supporters are likely very encouraging in his support.
The men are more grateful with those who aren't on this moment to spend Clintonia... just the fourth helped him.
Where 48 percent of the democratic voters say they supported Clintonia with enthusiasm, the one of the Republicns of Donald Trump said the very fewer Republicans (35 per cent).
When Clinton's appeal were asked in the open question why they wanted him to be a candidate, the recommended answer was that he had a suitable experience (16%).
Clinton supporters also reported on his contact with Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
Similar opinions and possibility to be selected were also mentioned.
Since the President affects the possibility of presidency, 57 per cent of democratic voters would like to see him already in the kitchen - even though the third is different.
The question of the democratic voters who have chosen to be the second party, Bden is the most recommended choice.
Over half of Clinton's supporters say they chose Biden, which is much more favourable than Sanders.
If Bden decides to be without the condition of democratics, Hilary Clinton's head of the Sanders will grow. If Bes is coming, it is 20 percent units, but if it leaves, chapter 30 is.
55 per cent of the democratic voters believe that Clinton has the best chance to win the President, but this number has been calculated by 78 per cent last month.
By this measure, Bden remains far, but the percentage of those who hold him as voters has grown.
However, when democratic voters asked what is important for them, they highlighted the opinions for voteability.
Neither in the last month no democratic candidates or possible candidates were considered impossible for these voters.
The candidates of democratics or potential candidates are very well in certain keys of their voters.
The majority of Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as honest, reliable and strong leaders.
The skin is over the third one in the best honestity, when Clinton's strength is the lead.
30% of democrats say that they do not believe Clintone being honest and reliable, which is more than 15% of Sanders, but 27% say that they do not have the opinion of Sanders.
The Democrats generally consider that Clinton, Sanders and Bden are ideologically the same agreement.
When we look at all these points, about the fourth democratic voters say that they have no opinion of Sanders.
Although Hillary Clinton’s personal email address and service is still as a foreign minister, the majority of the democratic representatives are satisfied with his explanation and say that the matter has not affected their generality.
However, it is another thing when we see the Americ as a whole.
The pools of the Americans are now unpleasant to explain him, and only some three are satisfied.
The views of the people were divided in March quickly after the matter comes to a breakfast.
Most Americans say that the e-mail policy did not affect their totality of Clinton, although 36 per cent of them say that their opinion has been bad.
More than six of the ten Republicans say that their views from Clinton have become worse.
Although the voters of Clinton's own defence are to be honest and reliable to him, this is still a problem among all registered voters, but only 32 per cent of it remains honest and reliable, and this number has been calculated by 8 per cent units last month and 15 per cent after May.
62% of the registered voters say that they do not believe Clintone being honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of all registered voters in the whole country also do not consider Trumpia honest and reliable.
But Clinton and Trumpia are considered a good leader.
The new candidate of Biden, Carsone and Bushi are more honest.
Sanders are precisely considered honest, but many have no view of him, just as not Carson.
There are 6 percent units in the investigation, which participated in 351 democratic voter.
Ben Carson is close to Donald Trumpia in national question
Ben Carson will take Donald Trump near the newest CBS News/New York Times question
Two candidates were collected in the new question half of all the voices, leaving others to fight the passenger.
The representatives of the Republic are still strongly supported by the country of Trumpia, which has been encouraged to increase in the previous year before the question of the CBS published by Fox News as 23% in the issue published in the last month.
However, in the same time, Carson increased from two percent to 23 percent.
It was also observed that Carson was very good in the couple of different demographic groups, and that the high-educated Republicans of Trump have been excluded.
The final fields have remained, unlike Carly Fiorina and Ohion Secretary John Kasichi. The encouragement of the Visconsin Scott Walker has been the largest: from 10 per cent to the current 2 per cent of the last month.
Ex-Froidian Major Jeb Bush, the former Archansas, Mike Huckabee, and Senator Marco Rubio, are on the third position of 6 percent.
Error marginal in this new, 376 Republican voter in September has +/- 6 %.
Last week, published by the CNN/ORC question, Carson showed that he had 19% of the encouragement in the Republics, and Trump is at 32% before him.
According to the newest ABC News/Washington Post, Trump was significantly above Carsone.
Carson's recommendation last week, Trump criticizes the remaining neurochirurgy in an accident, although Carso asked for forgiveness to do so to Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Sunday with his campsite in Iowa.
Five members of the Brothers are accused of the death of the first year of the student Baruch College
About two years after a student died in the pinsylvanian Pocono Mountains area of the brotherhood, the murder has been raised against five people.
In September 2013, the members of the New York City Balch College Ambassaded Pi Delta Psi were condemned by Chun "Michael" Denig, whose membership was in New York City, and then moved to his hospital, so the later effect of his death, the police said.
The authorities say that Denig's eyes were shocked and then he was shocked over 13-kill rings, after which he was repeatedly shocked into the country when he tried to walk on the left game towards the land.
Finally, Deng decided that his head was lost, after she lost his mind.
The brother’s members did not call at the emergency number of Denig, but, according to the accused, they waited for an hour before they took him to the hospital, the police says.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothing, search for information on their symptoms, and to contact the President of the brothership with Andy Mitch asking that advice, the police chief Chris Wagner reported in a newspaper.
"There were the members who began to hide their ritual resources and therefore, in practice, put the brother's well-being to Michael Denig,," said the chief Wagner.
The Deng couldn't be able to get, and she died next morning.
According to the mortality protocol, Deng has repeated shocks in the head, guards and shocks.
"A lot of families have been able to suffer from the brotherhood, when at least one student has died since 1970," said Doug Fierberg, a representative lawyer of the Denig family, in his opinion.
The brothers and their members must be responsible, and this step of the authorities is important.
The large cluster of Monroe's area was on the side of the fact that the first five members were accused of murdering the third position.
32 Other members of the brothers, including Me, are also accusated of violent simplification and criminal drinking.
"We don't want to get responsibility only for individuals. If there is an organization that accepts the situation officially or non-officially, they should also be responsible," Wagner stated in that press.
Baruch College speaked to the Brotherhood and the National Brotherhood.
This happens when the United States Central Bank increases the rate
The rate of prices will be, and the markets of the increased rates are falling, the production of debt papers will be increased and the economy must be declined.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it's going or how long it's going.
The past is not just helping the schedule, which will be named in the economy.
Only 11 months after the first income, the income has been held, sometimes again, as long as 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the US Central Bank has been often, although not always, to determine how the economic and financial resources reacted.
Therefore, the officials of the United States Central Bank have so much pressured that investors should not concentrate on it because the higher levels are inclined to increase, but closely to normalising the situation in the development cattle.
Indeed, there are several changes.
However, the market shares may notify that all higher rates related to the coherence have been exceededed.
"The first global economic crisis of the Central Bank is unreasonablely undergoing for the end of the 'low money' period,” said the Chairman of Capitale Economy' report on the global issues in Julia Jessop in the communication to customers.
Instead, we are not expecting that the United States' estimate returns to normal, although still low, but there is a so-called concept that many feel that they are afraid.
However, this does not mean whether it does not affect it.
The following is how some economic parts of the regions will react on the basis of the previous development:
As the market has been seen in the last few months, the expectation of the highlights can make the situation unfortunately.
When the emphasis comes to the fact, it is not very dramatic.
"Declares that the capital product has an effort to stop on 12-24 months after the first reiteration, which may be reflected again in the monetary policy," the German bank analysts said in this investigation on what happens after the rating of the Central Bank.
In fact, in the last 35 years the markets are generally strong, at about 14 per cent when the approach is increased, 250 days later, the situation is very balanced (the average increase of 2.6 per cent) and the normal status has been reached by 500 days after the average product in two last cycles in 14.4 per cent of the new asset management company, is reported in the analysis of Bob Dolly, published in the newspaper of Barron.
According to Deutche Bank, the impact on the shares is generally clearer at the late stage when the products start.
Those are part of the economic life, but the rates often promote their arrival.
In the present situation, the central banks have some challenges that have not previously been, and that are possible to slow down.
This is in particular a brutal population product that will be closer to the level of all times before the focus of the Central Bank.
According to the German Bank, the 118-year-old NCB in 1950 has been only twice less than 4,5 %.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6%, it is rarely believed that when the third fourth has increased by 1.5%, the Atlantic Federation Bank reports.
The expenditure of the costs in the budgetary seat may be dangerous and urge the question "is this one different", German Bank stated.
The market shares have been funded to highlight the Central Bank throughout the year, and all of them will wait for the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which will be finished as a tour.
Although many strategies and economic rapporteurs believe that the Committee can accept the emphasis on this meeting, the smooth trade is only 25% of the probability.
"We have shown that since 1950, all the cycling cycles have reiterately shown an increased impact in supersykls where BKT has been slowly highlighted after the starting of breath", reports.
On the contrary now, there has been an exceptional long-term delay that has been the worst time of the observation.
In the present cycle, the Central Bank has been expected to end the last round over 35 months, and now it has already been 74 months.
The coal product was also insufficient when expected that the market was highlighted, and the model reminds some considerations made in comparison with the capital.
The main aspect is that when the Central Bank changes its lines, its effects are more rapid than the shares.
The direction of the products of the letters appears to be immediately changed on the first point of the cycle.
At the end of the recommendation cycle, the product of debt documents will immediately be calculated," Deutche Bank said.
Charles Schwab strategies believe that the rates of the rates are caused by the slower and shorter prices of debt papers, thus the product control.
High-free bond books often produce better in such situations, although "we are, however, careful for the search of the product," said a analysis of the frozen product in Kathy Jones in one analysis.
Incredibly, Jones believes that the markets have already been adapted to the line outputs of the Central Bank.
"In addition to the rate of the Dollar strength and inflation expectations, there are several indications that the markets have adjusted the more strictly financial policy", he wrote.
The short-term rates are higher, the product use is more balanced, the credit margins have grown and the insecurity has grown - all of these are qualified on the market when the Central Bank has stolen its line.
Generally, undertakings whose enterprises are invested in the capital to the United States will win when the rates are increased and the local products are more attractive.
Multinational enterprises who have a lot of debt are worse when the value of the dollars increases their products in the world markets and their costs are more than the financial.
"The history shows that the 'deadants' instruments are usually the most productive after three months of the first highlight", analysts of Goldman Sachs performed in their report.
Enterprises with a strong trade change had a weak business change in 1994, 1999 and 2004 after a average of five percentage units.
Enterprises with high capital production and low volatility shares were better performed than low-quality companies. Firstly, the average values were 4 (percentage units) and 3 (percentage units).
The brother's going to be a big problem.
Those who have a lot of switch costs are mostly losing, Goldman said.
There is also a potential for consumers to benefit from the increase of the value of the dollar.
The legislators can also gain the delay of larger products, although the experts are different from how fast the impact is felt.
BBC Radio is copy of Classic FM, mediator Andrew Bingham says
Conservation Citizen Andrew Bingham accused of the channel of civilization.
He claims that the separation of the commercial competitor will become more difficult.
In addition, he took the BBC Music Awards money in telling them that they only travel to British Awards payments
National College Damien Collins criticize The Voicea saying that it isn't own
BBC Radio 3 is "reverse" as classic FM, claims the pressure of the additional production company that it does something that commercial production companies do not do.
The conservative citizen Andrew Bingham also said to BBC's leaders that the radio channel of the public service affected the content of "building" and that it is still more difficult to differ from commercial competitors.
"It seems that Radio 3 - I wouldn't want to use the term "Classic FM" - is changed as classic FM," he said.
He also took his stars in the BBC Music Awards, which was launched last December.
"BBC Music Awards launched last year affects only different names under organized British Awards gallery.
So if you're trying to do something different, here's two directly to remember my example when you just copy something from the market already found," Bingham said.
The Director-General of the BBC stressed that BBC Radio 3 is a lot of commercial packaging to share life music and information to the citizens.
Radio 3 teaches such things from classic music that I can't learn from anything else.
Its commitment to living music and music is in itself from the first class.
"Anyway, I think it is really important that Radio 3 has committed to find a new music and to place new works", he said.
Previously this year, Alan Davey, head of the BBC Radio 3, stated that the channel must work more than before to go to the public, since the Britishs know the less classic music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the offering of BBC, which was criticized on the funds of commercial competitors during the consultation of the Committee of Cultural, Media and Sport.
The Voicea, a civilist of the Conservative Tory Party, criticizes The Voice, a musical competitor of the BBC from the Hollandic production company, estimated by 22 million in red.
Do you understand why this programme is often discussed because it is not original, and isn't it any more personal?
Lordi Hall said that this BBC1 canadian program, which operates as Paloma Faith and Boy George, has been produced in the "BBC style".
He adds that he wants the producer's company "to find success inside his own house" next time it starts a reward.
However, he did not agree to prevent the production of future The Voice times, or to decide that the money of the licensing providers would be used for other forms of relief.
On August, Black Friday may be reasonable
Network sale increased 7% in 2015 in the first three months
In the last month the increase was increased after the start of the statistics in 2000.
Three years ago the network sale confirmed the use of mobile devices for buying
Experts believe that Black Friday can smoke with consumption in November
Virtual services have been slowly grown over ten years and have changed many of the buying citys in Britain.
However, experts say that there are marks on the level of net sales now when the latest numbers showed only 7 per cent increases in the first 2015 year.
The total growth in May has grown at least before the start of statistics in 2000, only five percent of the last year.
Experts say that there are marks on the decline of net sales when the latest numbers indicated only 7 per cent increased in 2015 to the first year-end.
"If the growth rates of the previous years and return to 2000, it was clear that the situation would be rational for the latest." Andy Mulcahy, provider of JMRG marketing, reported to the Guardian.
He explained that three years ago the net sale was strengthened when the buyers began to use their mobile cells for the purchase.
It means that most people were buying online, and that they could be able to do in different environments, such as sweat.
But now it becomes level, and (created) can be counted.
The Black Friday show from the United States has been held behind the long-term trade.
Experts believe that consumers are shocking the purchase work before the last day of November.
Last year, normal average value five times more buyers parabled to their computers to catch trades in many trade websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, who received the buyers to strike the findings, can smoke the buyer's work.
The British Retail Consortium published that only one of the five items were used online.
A number of products such as television and pesticides, more than the third purchase are now being made on network trade.
At the same time, more than fourty people buy clothes and skins instead of using the purchased model chain.
Muslims enter the deaths of the Meca snake, the consequences of Bin Laden’s family
Muslims had 29 dead bodys during the first feasts in Mexico.
Saudi Arab has in part accused of the destruction of the building of Saudi Binlad Group
The Ministry of Health reported that the total of 394 people had been injured when the shock was shocked down.
29 When hundreds of Muslims gathered together with them, the victims died, when the shooting was slaughtered in the great Muslims of Meca.
In the main way, the slaughtered white slaughter filled the journey to respect the first dead who made their last journey in Al-Moisem.
The painful passage took the holy place, where only a few days ago the shock slowed through the mosquitoes and slaughtered the people.
The bodys were released to defeat when the Saudi Arab king strengthened the guilty of the Congregation of Bin Laden’s family, a disaster of 394 people.
In the major muscle of the mechanics, the 29 body of the slaughter of the slaughter of the slaughter of the slaughter of the slaughter.
The dead were four children, Qasim Akram from Manchester's region. He was in his first sacred journey when the snake was shocked.
Akram was in the biggest muscle with his parents prior to the beginning of the year's swimming skin.
Saudi authorities have already censed that the hair of Mecca continues when thousands continue to arrive in the city.
Today King Salman said that the Binlad Group had not had to leave the guard when it was not used.
The Saudi Press Agency, published in the Arab version of the Decision, stated that the Binlad Group was partly a cause for the destruction.
The English Service of the News Agency did not mention this detail, but it was said that the company leaders were prohibited to travel to foreign countries.
Preceding this week, Salman pleaded to find out what caused the decay of shoes to a large muscle, where hundreds of thousands of muslims were gathered before this month later.
The Binlad Group has not been published by informors on the destruction of the raws, and its representatives have not been obtained for comments.
The king's decision also condemned that it had not used filters at the same time and did not cooperate with the meteorological authorities.
The Meca is around the large mosquitoes, which are part of the powerful construction structure, which is leading to the Binlad Group.
Binladin's family has been close to the Saudi Arab government family for decades, and it leads to large construction projects.
The leader of Al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a rebellious son whose family was prohibited in the 1990s.
The Romanism was in an winter and swimming rule only days before millions of people arrive to the Kingdom for the sacredness of the Kingdom, which every Muslim is to do at least once in life.
The authorities tell that 158 people are still in the hospital.
The authorities estimated a million references (174,000 pounds) to the own of the dead and permanently injured.
The other wounds get half of this.
B&Q-popular says that the workers employed by Eastern European authorities are a favorite
The Britishs still use more support services, Veronique Laury says
The number of professionals from Eastern Europe is behind the growth
As a search for professionals, Screwfix trade is opened to 200 more
At the same time Kingfisher closes 60 B and Q-shirt around the country
writer Rupert Steiner, the principal letter changer for the Daily Mail newspaper
Britain is said to be able to make households with a view to the labour and the pensional law and the more exciting payment of Eastern European employees
It looks like if you're a key with the shooting, or you're looking for the walls, you're in the minority today.
The Britishs are seeing more appealers to handle the tee-sea work at their homes, tells B&Q's boss.
The new Director of Kingfisher, who owns the home-to-level trade chain, said that the recommendation is the number of employees in Eastern Europe and that they provide their services for their bigger prices.
This leads to the planning of Kingfisher to open 200 new employees' trade and closing 60 B & Q.
Laury said he wants more women to work at the B&Q salesmen, since eight of ten purchase decisions are named as the most beautiful sex work.
Today the biggest part of personal life is men.
He said that the changes in the population must be taken into account: there is now more women's households that make more households than before.
Laury said, "The biggest part of our selling person is still men.
We need to get better balance.
However, the pools of our customers are women, and 80% of the purchasing decisions of the products are women.
Women have a great role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of the only five women leading to the most important firms of the British FTSE100 index, which has reconstrued its leading group because it has so many men and women's groups.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which the group has about 50% of women, including the Chief and the Financial Director.
Laury said, "This was a knowledgeable decision... the difference is important here.
There was no difficulty to find good women in the leading group."
Kingfisher reported the calculation of both the products and sales after the group took the costs for the closure of soldiers to its necks.
Trend results as Screwfix and B&Q owners of Kingfisher is to open 200 new traffic
The third government decided to resolve the compulsory legislation to save the economy of the country.
Even soon the visible effects were obtained.
The sharp decision of the SAK and other NGOs began to impede the same way and, as a result, the country is standing on the basis of the wide notice of the employees on Wednesday.
Many time think that it will also be reasonable.
Let's ask if it's going to support the law when it's going badly.
It has even been founded on the contradiction.
More than 500,000 people have already been reporting that they are not going to participate in the vision but to work.
At the time of a good consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course there was no net where protesting, but openly proclaiming richly would have been a small political suicide.
Millions of professional organizations are not a lot of moments of protest of some ten thousands of people, but it gives it a reason for thinking.
The position of vocational access is no longer as clear as for a couple years ago.
All don't know the goals of the movement to their own, values have changed
In view of the interestfulness of the work of the ship, the boundary solutions of the government can also be seen as a direct gift to the heavens.
When things have shown their own pressure for years, we will finally be able to reach the rights of the employee to defend, visually and honestly.
The government may likely want to defeat the role of the cycling movement when the membership in the Professional Union is seeing the cases more necessary.
Whatever the organizations agree, it's not to say that the opinion on the birthday would stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has been stopped.
For example, industrial production has been calculated for 31 months.
Great national production continues to reduce, and unemployment increases.
You thought you had to force all of these things.
Slow rate of emissions to the university of labourbuilding: 8.5 million expenditure, staff decreased by 130
The technical university of the Lampebuilding will start an efficiency currency which is aimed at obtaining consumers from €8.5 million.
In particular, the University of the University will initiate all the nuclear negotiations on staff with the objective of restructuring of 6.5 million annually.
This means reducing about 130 employees.
Another action is intended to resolve more than two million.
The financial budget of 2016, which predicts 8,5 million of new operations, is undertaken by the undertaking of the negotiations.
It also affects the government's financing sectors.
In this account, the university makes about 2,6 million results.
Consumers will grow a little for the next year, but the financing of the ministerial area is less than 2 million and other financing by EUR 3,2 million.
The overall budget of the university is about 85 million euros, so the budget plan is 10 per cent of the total budget.
It is very important for our university to learn and investigate, and to reduce the coefficient effects of business financing, says Dr. Anneli Pauli University in information.
Prematurely, the effects of the surgery were more moderate, but now the reduction in supplementary funding appears in new measurements.
The negotiations with the trust men will be initiated in the next week and they will sustain the six weeks of law.
Over: Onnibus wants to want Finnish radars
Halpabus Company Onnibus's owner, British Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company will also be covered in Finland.
I'm very interested to go with the Finnish roots.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest radar transport companies in British, Souter says.
The root transport must be opened to competitively.

According to the Minister of Transport, the Onnibus plans are welcomed by the General Minister.
Another international interest in other international companies has notified Transdev (ancient Veolia), which has so much bus transport in Finland and rail transport in other countries in Europe.
The United States Central Bank must make decisions on higher rates
Another world will follow on the page when the United States Central Bank is assembled for two days a mid-week, and it will be struck to make a critical decision whether they will raise the first time for nearly ten years.
In Reuters' question, a few more than half of those who still believed that the Central Bank was in the last week, now believe that the situation is still not resolved and highlighted at the current level of 0-0.25%.
This has a historic event, since when your Central Bank operates up to zero, it is seven years.
The first time we are approaching the situation in which the central banks have the possibility to get out of null and start normalization of higher rates", said Angel Ubide, Peterson Institute for International Economics Institute, senior fellow.
The United States economy has been relatively well-being, and it has produced a few billion dollars of balances and a little inflation.
However, the bank cannot take attention to less rare global views.
It has warned the markets that they should be prepared to be income, but they also demonstrate that the likelihoods are highlighted.
The decision shall be published at 20.00 p.m. (CET).
Delta State University's shooter left an apologic message
When he shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Wednesday after the same day, Shannon Lamb wrote a message that said he was "devil" about the first murder and hoped that "It could be able to cut it", the authorities were told.
Mississippi's police reported that the teacher of Delta State University's geographic and social science and the Lamb called an emergency number from about ten morning.
On Monday, he told me he shot and killed someone.
The Lamb told the respondent that the police had to send officers to his home.
He said "her wife last night" and also said that there's a "small dog" in the house that "not hurt anybody," but it's probably confused.
The police asked the caller's name, but he didn't tell it.
The Lamb didn't explain to shoot.
When the police came to the place, there was 41-year-old Amy Prentiss' body, and a message written by Lambi, 45-year-old, which reads: "I'm so sorry I'm so sorry that I could pull it.
I loved Amya and she was the only person who ever loved me."
When the message was written, the Lamb traveled about 500 miles [500 km] to the Delta State where he killed a historic observer Ethan Schmidt before his death was finally killed in the afternoon of the police.
Professor William LaForge said that it wasn't between Lambi and Schmidt to know that there was any conflict, but that "speakly the Lambi's thought was something."
The authorities said that, despite the statements published on Monday, the Lamb had believed in the relationship with Schmidt was not "legal information or evidence" of any "third Drama".
Shawn O'Sten told her being married to Princess about seven years of marriage and described him "some man".
A couple left 15 years ago, but he remained a friend.
O'Sst told him and Princess had a 19-year-old girl who was "burned."
O'Sten told that Princess and his daughter were "the best friends every day."
According to Linsday Knowles, Princess worked at his home online. Sun Herald says that he was a close friend of Princess.
Knowles reported that Princess, who had a dog named Lightning, had been seen with Lambi for about three years.
"He always wanted to help others," knowles said.
The police told to the family of Lambi that he was calling for a couple to see the lunch to tell them that he wasn't going to prison.
When the police aimed at Lambi’s Kingship 1 near Greenville after the same night, Lamb stopped his car on his way, left it and went to the forest where he shot himself.
The Lamb claimed about the educational science of Delta States in June 2015, reports the list of the websites of the university.
The stars that lost their power of astraction
The viewer (left), pictures with his son Redmond (right), has been angry over the last few years.
In 2001 he was sick to Leukemia, and in 2009, his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
According to drugs, he also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested by drug management.
All such things really require their taxes.
Manchester United Luke Shaw is outside months because of double destruction
Luke Shaw took two murders to his right feet Manchester United to the PSV Findhoven in the battle of the Meester.
Although the defender left in a shock and is at least six months outside, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will be coming to play still in this period.
In 15 minutes after the 20-year-old Shaw was inflicted in the PSV region, the Vamman caused Hector Morenon holtiton.
He was treated 9 minutes in the field, and he was forced to give his hair before the hospital was carried out.
Van Gaal said, "He has two murders in his feet and he's in the hospital now."
She'll be moved tomorrow or maybe the day after it, and then we're going to operate in Manchester.
It's a horrible thing. The boy comes to Manchester as a 18-year-old age, suffering difficulties, and then plays slightly, and now it comes.
When I was in the bathroom, she was on the hair.
He's crying.
I'm not a doctor, but there's at least half a year of double murder, and he's not playing in the hamper stage.
I hope he's going to play this time.
Morano was a happy effect when he got or got a red card and a punishment shock.
Decorative Nicola Rizzoli did not punish mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian employee was wrong.
You can judge the situation when I say that it was a punishment and a red card.
It was a bad two-way out of the way.
Shaw tweeted: "Thank you to all your messages, you don't have enough words to tell me how crazy I am, my arrival begins now, I'll come back as stronger."
Regarding the question: Manchester United suffers of the case of Luke Shaw and losses PSV
The English Defender has an additional recovery of the European Magistrate Competition in France next June.
PSV's trainer Phillip Cocu said, "It's really bad."
If a player gets out because of the worst thing, it's all very painful.
The purpose of our player is never to struggle the opposite.
Moreno's foot slaughter was slaughtered when he played a Mexican team against Van Gaal's Holland in 2014 MM questions.
"Moreno takes this pregnantly, because it is not intended to hurt the opposite, and when he hears that wealth is really bad, it's bad, " said Cocu.
I didn't see that in the situation.
The only thing that I saw was the pillar that was going to different directions, so he [Moreno] would have touched it, but I didn’t see Luke’s back.
Moreno said to SBS6, "I know what it feels, I know how hard this thing can be.
"I'm so sorry for this, I'm so sorry."
Andrés Guardado was also transferred to the hospital with Chris Smalling.
Why David Cameron knows Lorax better about this?
Each parent will soon learn: If your child loves a book, don’t take a long time before he learns almost outside.
So just if you're David Cameron.
When the services offered for childhood were asked to the Prime Minister of his favorite book, he chosen the history of the protection of the environment published in 1971.
The choice was difficult, Cameron writes on the websites of SuperCamps and continues: "Available, adverse, creative and strong message. I like to include this book to my children, because it is always feeling a picture or message that we have never seen."
All this is true, but the next chapter, in which Cameron is unfortunately described by the book, is a efficacy of the 2012 film version, which has been filled with a very short text of the original text and details.
"In the city of Tarville, where everything has lost and even air is commercial goods, Ted's son hopes to gain his dreams in the heart of Audrey's hope to see the right tree," the text states and describes the loved man who died Dr. Seuss, the right name of Theodor Seuss Geisel, did not write.
If this is not sufficiently suspecting, Cameron's text hears to the place as it would be taken by the Internet Movie Database Internet on the drinking of the Lorax photo, which begins to: "In the city of the Tarville inside the murs, where all is methodic and even air is commercial, the Ted son hopes that his dreams will be able to get on the side of the heart of the Audrey girl."
In view of Cameron's publicly active parent, it is uncertain that he would be so unfair to drink a book. There youth, the son of the name hears how the local nature has destroyed, trees shocked and needed to smell the Kerskane, unlike the story of a short name, the age of Lorax, which was "sweet in favour of the trees".
This relatively visible PR work is likely to be foreigned to the assistant who apparently have not read a book 20 times for a child.
The Director of Directors said that the text was linked to Cameron's office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's personality, but not commented about it at that time.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger to stay on the page of the English team, but it was still a hard place
Playing against Pakistan has a very task in the Arabians, but when you see what team the English team has chosen to round, I don't believe that the last 3-0 series is likely to be repeated.
I didn't close the guest from the counts.
A half of the Cook may have experienced less than the team after three years, but there is a strong way of thinking with good routines and teams: they have no idea in 2012, just a youth positiveness.
Moeen Ali is developed in circulation and Adil Rashid is an attacking option, although it's an unknown factor at this level.
Regarding the question: Adam Lyth threw from the English critical team, his condition will come to Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth's team is very difficult to analyze me because I am his head officer in the Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good attackers in situations that can be deceived, and the simple but the truth is that the critical players are appreciated on the basis of their results.
For example, Joe Root had no incertitude before information, because, as I previously said, players are the best factors of the choice.
About a hundred more points, and Lyth had been able to continue in the team, but he was responsible for his own goal.
I hope that if he gets more walks to the Yorkshire, the second chance is to go forward.
The English Chief Trevor Bayliss was the place of Lyth even when he was not done as well as it could, and it is not surprised me. Lyth is mostly a team player.
It's difficult to answer questions how long the slaughter is to leave the rest.
Lyth was elected seven times in the country team, such as Sam Robson before him, once again Nick Compton was elected nine times.
Only Compton had the possibility to play as well as home and visits.
The only question of the complaint is that the English chose Jonathan Trotti first to the Caribbean when Lyth was in the top, but it is now the last time.
Alex Hales comes with you, and there's a shock that I'm worth it.
He has a cricket player of something we had seen in the West of New York in this time when he made 236 points against us in the Trent Bridge field.
He must, at least, give the same opportunity to others before him, but this really depends on the meeting of the team in the Arab Middle East in the United States.
There was a bunch of thoughts from Moeen in the shocking car, near the Cook, where the field could be extra consumed but four speeds could be held, and I was not against it.
I don't understand why the shooter could shoot there, and this left-handed has already proved to be a very critical player.
It doesn't necessarily make her task in its creature in the Worcestershirt, but he is a third of them and there's no difference.
My old teamfriend Justin Langer played the first 38 games in the first castle before moving to open in 2001.
He did three hundred points immediately, and you didn't remember the past.
Zafar Ansari will be a slaughter of the team, and, what I've been doing with him, he feels very effective of a young man.
People can look at his beautiful statistics - with the average value 31, with the 35th ball, and think that it is a threat, but there is no too much food and choices that have chosen young people.
He learned a lot in this round.
Outside a little, English seems to have a few hard additions to the trainer.
The appointment of the Sri Lanka slaughter Mahla Jayawarden for consult games can be shown as a neuro-slaughter.
He is one of the most pleasant friends of the game, and there is a great number of experiences, because it has done everything in all situations and all attacks.
Paul Collingwood will join the white ball games, and it brings together both energy and unregular displacement.
I always thought that he was born to be together in international critics, then it was playing or training, and he has the same useful intelligent as Mahel.
Sometimes the new voices in the swimming room can spend the teams, although their messages were the same as previously.
Colly's Aviation of Durha, Ben Stokes, will be shut up in one day, root was given the same piece against Australia, and I have at least no problem with this.
Although all are not the same, trainers and elections do not make timetables.
And you must remember that like players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions have never been made so far.
The EU (Brexit) supporting the United Kingdom (Brexit) may not be able to win if the economy is in difficult times in 2017
David Cameron's half-to-day renewal strategies to maintain the British Union are still more problems, although it would not take into account even the heart of Jeremy, "Isn't it so?", the election of Corbyn to the Headquarters of the Centre for Employment or Employees in Europe.
And foreigners have their own Corbyn and Nigel Farage.
The European diplomatics rather explained that since the EU is in so deeply different crises, all of which is not its own reason, some Member States have sought to have made an independent agenda in Britain, which is fully granted to divergences and advertising agreements that these States do not want to be larger.
In Britain's annual meeting, the Central Organization of Professional Interests decided that it would not want them if they were swept of social protection.
We couldn't call it Daven and George's self-geenage.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of State Securities shall delay the high-school meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign cities, taking its image before the local memory mark, or without her, and then come home, saying that they will win supporters for reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend who wants to look out in the EU-Brittannic Union - "Do not leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that the shortest ministers and officers of certain capital cities are now in such a point that they do not care for our way.
Angela Merkel, a careful and modest partner in Germany, has been an alliance, but has been ten years of authority and wants to leave his step before he goes to the shore as to thatchers for too long (11 years), Mediterranean (14) and Kohli (16).
France François Holland has re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's also a disabled power.
Poland may have a national legal government, Spain left.
It is difficult to see these countries to sacrifice self-electrics when their energy would be supported more to prevent Scotlands from the source of the United Kingdom - they do not want it to be because of their own separation guidelines.
Thus, my friend presents that some of these ministers may even be planned to make no useful comments on the skotlan national style of the Ison-Britannia in 2017 in order to accelerate the Brexit process.
"Review negotiations were organized and there was no meaning for Britain's renewal.
The Europeans have experienced slightly how the newspaper of Fleet Street is part of and how the EU-skeptic newspapers are, as they were not inspired by Tony Benn in 1975, when our membership started in 1973 in the relationship 2.1.
They can pleasantly recall Boris Johnson, the largest European candidate, who made its own name by writeing "the largest bananas of the EU" at the beginning of the 1990s of Brussels.
Ed Miliband may be a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They were part of a booking number of tax vejators, foreign people who had a chariot of telephones, as well as persons whose home is namely other than and who have the most important part of our newspapers.
Tony Blair thinked of them in the same way, but he knew that if you're in a slight gorge with a sweet gorge, the bananas must be shocked because of the smell, if you want to be on that lunch lunch, and later on a day.
In fact, Miliband was more blair than Blair himself, which will be opposed to the renewal of Cameron, and a bar was adopted behind the EU's abandoned Constitution Law, which the French and the Hollanian voters rejected in 2005, and thus gave Blair the issue of exit.
The newspaper never gave her forgiveness.
But my dear Jeremy Corby, who met me friendly at Westminster's parliamentary account on Monday (I told him that he has no longer time to condemn me for me), seems to have a danger to repay the Mordoch Strategy of Neil Kinnock in the 80s.
Although it can take time, however, he must develop a coherent strategy to keep contact with the media. Not me, but unfortunately, Andrew Marri, whose BBC association Corby came on Sunday.
The official position of Corbyn in Europe is beautifully developed.
He said that we would like to be renewed in the EU.
Well, the largest part of the United Kingdom's self-respect of the U.S. war into the U.S. Military Instinct, as well as the most disgusting nationalisms, can certainly be set on the basis of this view.
Hilary "Ben, but not Ben-fani" said in radio and television this week, when his internal party wanted to admit that Corbyn's choice to appoint John McDonnell as the minister of State Security.
It reminded me of the 70th century when his father's television stripped me to be unfaithful against his government partners, without that it would go so long that his government would lose his place.
Hylary paintings were more shocking.
But on the other hand, the fight is that we're staying in "the situation where it's good" - the statement of Benn - wasn't what McDonnell said, and not all about what Corby told the heads and people at the private meeting on Monday night.
Any of that is an inherent, familiar and personal image that Corby wants to describe (remember that even in me), the rationality of the communication is important at the time of the surrounding world television, and in particular in the social media orders, which are an octile growth in persecution and pedoes.
As McDonnell has said, it is just the right to be not to give Cameron an expression to Europe by allowing him to support the Working Party in the people's vote campaign clearly.
Simon Jenkins, at least, thinks so.
However, McDonnell and Corbyn are based on the coherent EU membership (and in line with their Benn's economy and their anti-kapitalist past) are no longer difficult to discuss in the couples of delegates whose neighbourhoods are the key dogma in schools.
With regard to his two-party partners, Tom Watson has convinced that it is not a Corby campaign to rely on, foreign diplomates must only try to explain it to their representatives.
Why would Paris or Berlin endorse political capitals (and they have unbelievable voters) to the United Kingdom when it can be fully disappointed?
The United States have already been struggled by a weak military execution in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in the power of the reducing conservative government, as I was reminded in the launch of the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticized the Public Health Electronics Rating of the Public Health of England
The investigators have said that the State financed Agency claims that electric smokes are less harmful than traditionally, and that the start of 12 souls, where the part of the cigarette industry had contacts.
The British Medical Journal (BMJ) experts contacted the use of the certificates used in their reports for electricity in Lancetin Crisis.
PHE has published this "virus peculiarity" report in the last month, which describes it "two to be regarded as a certificate."
However, many researchers have investigated the sustainability of information and reference to contacts between some experts and the smoke industry.
The Medical Time Journal Lancet published in the last month a chapter that was rejected by the head decision of the PHE 's headquarters'.
Two other investigators written in BMJ have considered whether the arguments were "structed for a ball or a skin."
London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Professor Martin McKee, and professor of the University of Liverpool clinical epidemiology, Simon Capewell say: "The main principle of the health of nationals is that functions must be based on evidenceful efficiency."
They say that the public expects that the PHE claims that the electrical smoke is at least 95% less harmful than traditional smokes, based on the detailed assessment and model of the certificate.
In fact, it will be a 12-style meeting with a multi-critical decision-making model (MCDA) to synchronise their views of the problems associated with different Nicotin products, and the results of this meeting were intensified.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company named EuroSwiss Health, which was reported by the Director of the Finance previously received for an independent investigation from the British American Tobacco company.
He also supported the health capacity of BAT in the Sustainability Report, they say.
One of the 12 meetings reported about the financing of the manufacturer of the electric smoke, but not the financing that it was told before the smoke company Philip Morris International will increase.
The elements of the selection of the members of the panel are not reported, but there are several known electrical supporters in the panel, some also reported about the financing of their research.
Other sites have not been known in their expertise on the monitoring of smoke.
It also participated in the meeting by the Director of the Cigarette of PHE.
The research produced by the group "speakly admitted" that there is a lack of "unrecognised cocktail deficiencies in most of the products and most of the criteria", McKee and Capewell writes.
None of these communications or limitations shall, however, be mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell claims PHE that "we have no evidence that the electrical tuberculosis operates on the road to smoke with children or non-smoking."
Professor Kevin Fenton of PHE's health and well-being said that the claims submitted in BMJ have been answered before.
He says, "Electronic accommodations are significantly less harmful than burning."
You're gonna smell your life's fuming life to die their dependance.
All proofs indicate that the health risks caused by electric tube are relatively small, but we must continue to investigate long-term impacts.
The PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public of what the certificate seems and what it does not appear, especially when the relative risks of smoke are so much public intelligence.
About 800,000 people die annually on smoking disease and smoking pay for NHS to $2 billion.
By explaining the current certificate material, namely, although electrical tuberculosis are not unreasonable, their deficiencies are only part of the traditional tuberculosis of murdering smoke - we are fulfiling our national responsibilities.
The BBC will support the end of EastEnders, says the former chairman Cannel 4
The former Chairman Luke Johnson said that BBC should stop programs such as EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would "don anything" from such "nothing" strikes, such as this Albert Square street.
Johnson said that the permissions should only be used for programs that other employees of British sending activities do not.
He criticizes BBC's establishment of public services programs which probably have a smaller public publicity, the most difficulty of the programs of competitors and the channels of the BBC4.
After the BBC's chief Tony Hall said to want to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson said he had home to Chanel 4: for six years to create a relationship with the BBC.
"I don't know that BBC will produce and send programs that were clearly agreed to non-subventional competitors," Johnson said to the above room's communication committee to the BBC's future research.
If the license is held - and I'm not sure that it would be a good idea to this message or a long-term idea - it should, at least, be limited to the production of programs that others do not and do it.
The Voicea is sent to the most important time of speech, since it is intended to collect the most possible support.
The thinking that nobody else would seem to be a programme, it's ridicule, it's clearly higher.
Johnson said: "I don't understand why return tax should finance programs that could also be funded without State support.
The Voice is one of the same and the other EastEnders, without forgoing to be implemented within the house.
Other channels, as they say, would give anything about it.
I don't understand how this is about the shipment of the public service.
I don't believe that it would be slower to the BBC anymore.
In the channel 4 of 2004-2010, a series of Johnson said that BBC is guilty of the forests "for the purposes of people working in this area, and because they believe that it is the best way to achieve long-term support."
He commented on BBC's most recommended series, remembering the comments of Tony Ballin's former director. He used its 2003 MacTaggart book in Edinburgh to suggest BBC's mixing series like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC's smallest public public public services programs "involve BBC4, which often cannot measure the number of viewers, but BBC will therefore comply with its responsibilities in its area and then can 4 billion of punctuary income when defending the fact that, "we do all these unknown programs that no one considers".
They're putting them into the sending place where no one will never see them.
Johnson's promised payment to the committee said, "I want you to search for the most backing system, who receives the most opposite to it.
Of course, you all think, we all think that 150 reds have a lot of opposition in the year, but I don't know if it's the place for people who have 150 pounds of money, because they're not going to use the BBC.
The former director David Elstein, David Elstein, who also confirmed the committee as a stage, said that BBC should re-evaluate its temporary task to "inform, training and comfort Reithi".
He said that only a small part of the BBC's production is now classified as a education - he said that the numbers are 1% of the TV production and 0.1% of the radio - and that it should take a model of Australia and Canada's general radios and change the task to "inform, select and comfort".
What would be towards partnerships, Elstein said that BBC should focus more on events like Proms-consistent, which, according to him, are shown on only some of the people in the television, and join with commercial companies so that all of these would be considered online.
"Subgenetics" allows the brain management of the cells through the sound systems
The video shows how the sound switchs change the direction immediately when the sound-input is part of them.
Researchers have increased countries with genetically modified neurosystems so that they can be controlled by sound-speed snakes.
Small sugars change the direction immediately when they get the sound imple, which is too high to hear the human snake.
Impulses operate by switching genetically modified business nerve cells with ultrasonians reacting fiber cancers.
Regarding the question: researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said that the madders show a new, sound genital name, the functionality of the method, which can be used to activate certain brain, heart cells and body outside the body.
Screecanth Chalasani, researcher of the Salk Institute in California, reported to The Guardian that a method can be replaced by a deep smiling. It is an invasive action that causes human brain electrical impulses to treat Parkinson’s disease.
Sugar disorders did not normally react to ultrasome, but Chalasani found that when they are around the liquid with a small microscopic complex, the situation changed.
He realized that the balls confirmed the ultrasonal ships that then go into the land.
Verified ultrasonalities affect the TRP-4-ion changing, structures that are in certain cell visions of some countries.
The vote sectors will receive these ionians to open and activate cells that have been enabled in the Nature Communications magazine.
In order to prepare ultra-sum control sugars, Chalasani has modified countries genetically so that part of their commercial cells are TRP-4-ionians.
When Chalasani used ultra-related mathematics, the microscopes confirmed the sound boards and switched them into the maths where they skipped the modified commercial nervous cells.
The method has some of the same designs as optogenetics, a prestigious tool that gives scientists the possibility of skilling hero cells on the top and removeing light pulses by using.
However, Chalasani says that sonogenetic use can be some of the advantages compared to optogenetics.
Instead of the light that must be sent from the teaching to the long-term desires of the brain, the low-speed ultrasonal sectors can pass through the skin, so they can be sent from the brain.
"We know that geneitherapy and therapy virus may be possible by using the targeted human neurocellular cells to react at the moment in certain neurologs in clinical treatments," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on cells produced in body cells and insulin, he added.
It's an illegal competitive instrument for your home!
The reports can be the shock of the British arms trade
Look at the video of Amnesty International's weapons.
Awesome killer machines!
Narcotic football cars!
Booms!
Electronic guards that cause pain but do not leave!
The joyful language of the images and series does not doubt that this world’s largest arms news is a slight parodi that Amnesty International has produced to emphasize the challenge of the British government to trade weapons for the Defence and Security Equipment International Exception at London's Fair Centre.
Objective: DSEI's weapons: Administrative administrations are reached in London
A special campaign also shows many proclamations that require a more accurate knowledge on bus and metroways.
"True Information, Travelstack on DLR lines on September 15-18?" Another question is used to use London's land source and product character, as the DLR board has changed in a bank image.
In September, weapon traders arrive to DLR... customers are requested to help stop arms.
These 300 declares are the works of artists whose work had been represented in the Museo of Cruel Designs (in the museum of the designs of cows).
The Collection named Special Patrol Group helped publishing statements around London by using "Ad Space Hack Packs" packages. This includes six red packs of six cocktails, which, according to collectively, "access hands on the third part of the world's advertising state of the whole bus package."
Transport for London has not been disappointed by this unlawful "just-relatedness".
One of the special Patrol Group Collections from the parodia-mains.
According to Gavin Grindon, Cruel Designs and University of Essex’s newspaper, artists want to ask more and want to bring political work to the outside publics of the gallery.
Many artists have started working with the aktivists in oppositions when they have found that they must go to the outside world if they want their art to affect society.
A second weapons trade proclamation welcomed the workers in the metro.
Amnesty's video has been viewed over 100 000 times during the last 24 hours. It was found freely VCCP advertising office, and also a graphic designer and background manager had worked freely.
VCCP's creative director Matt Lever's found that weapons were not mentioned in any law - and also in the ExCeL calendar were empty - and he thought, "Let them the campaign they try to avoid."
They were thinking of the more realistic corporation of the newspaper, but "the more stopping body pressures things with light colors and animations."
"They have done fantastic work by helping us to raise questions about the unlawful competitive instrument to sell", says Amnestyn Tom Davies.
Now, the United Kingdom government must take action and ensure that competitive instruments are not sold legally by our own homes.
Perhaps all the creative arts are associated with the weapons of ExCeL when showers trade fantastic beautiful products.
Saab showed the status from the United States army "At4CS RS" when his newspaper information was received.
This includes "unfavorable switching body that affects excellent effects on the back of the panzer in the area".
Whatever it does, it's not fun.
Eight gold rules for living in students
11 years later, when I was 19 years old, I changed to a student, and I still believed in barets and moral relations, but now I remember the people's people whom I was able to remember.
Most of my learning can intensify eight simple rules.
Change in the house may be an absolute fearful one who uses any neurons.
It's shocking in a shock: tell me where you are home, you need interim and what you think about Corbyn, and why "in fact, I don't love Marmite or hate Marmite because it's just a sweet Haha me finding in my room."
Take a life.
And help others to spend the spirit... questions and aspect of interest.
It directs discussions and helps you find those you like, and not those who you wouldn't want to talk even if your sights were in the fire and they shared sammuts.
Give people a place.
People’s rooms are often changed as cocktails, leaflets, and most commonly as time-free places, but they also are places where people swallow and correct their bathrooms.
With regard to the question: Don't even imagine your university in your couple
The colleague is a strict place for the introverse.
Your care should be relaxed, but many households are formed by the culture of a different pathway, which is friendly, socially and leads to live friendships.
It can mean hell to somebody who try to relax.
Nothing in this culture allows you to say, "I want to be friend with you, but now you have to get out that I can get back to the energy that I've spoken about with you."
Try to know when a student's friend has cut into socialization, and may be sent text message instead of covering the door.
I'm talking about the computer when it's called: the computer.
One guy of my students' accommodation was aware that if the door wasn't in the lock, he was called in.
He saw a lot of things.
You're comfortable through clothing.
Because you start university at the highest time of Lepomestern, people's doors with a slaughter and their own presentation affects some less strange, less "health welcome to the neighbourhood, I swear to you something, now sweet when I ask you personal questions" -50.
The offering of self-employed sugars is an excellent way of friendship.
Your family partners will have an obligation to talk, and may be that they will continue to combine your face to the surprise.
This really depends on whether you know the clothing.

They are already in Finland some time students, as well as new low safe applications.
All in the shooting buildings have an A expectations.
Some students are at the primary school of adults, parts of professional education and part of the school of Finnish," says Lucia.
A-status is so declared as a continuous residence, which can be granted for four years in Finland once a while in some time in the foreign country.
The East Sweden police investigated the attacks as a shock and a crime in home.
Accordingly, the event was considered to students as a lunch of information, where there was also the need for income.
There's no panic here, and no one wants to get out.
We have been twenty years old foreign students, and this is the first time when something happens to happen."
It's like, the battles have been shocked out of the wall.
As a technician, they were at least three men and they were moved on a skilled car.
I think this is a young weekend of the headquarter when this is now on the roof.
There's nothing more serious than that," Lucifer says.
Any hospital also has been decreased in the hospital that has been decreased from the receipt centre.
The meeting happened last week.
That's what the MTV reported on his website last night.
On the wall of the hospital was drawn by a shock and written in English "You are not welcome."
It's a crime report to the police.

The renewed passengers on the start of this ship in Helsinki’s headquarters.
Some of the undergrounds attacked the volunteers, said, Torbjörn Bengtström.
That's stupid because the number of people grow all the time and workers need speed and close contact in Helsinki.
This may be nothing else than political will, or the lack of it.
Bengtström says that the HSTV video is coming even if in the main city of Tractors.
Also, in the New York Times, there will also be changes in the new country.

The last three-year agreement shall be adopted by the Monetary Affairs Committee.
The Ziunian Bengtström considers that the State's jungle swimming currency is a short-term operation.
We will make the same errors that have been made before and repeated in a very systematic way.
Then it's going to be on the castle.
The Y wine also uses other than raresporians and citizens, as it is fast and takes several positions.
A spood Annina Pöyrye slaughtered the city area for more than a long trip.
"It's named a strike to those who have to be planned again," he said when he worry about the Y junction.
It's a little facility.
The Radar is connected to a new shipping connection that replaces Y-june Helsing's transport in the HSL (HSL) region, or leads to our church.
This increases the costs of HSL, in practice, to the expenses of the region and to their taxpayers.
"We are now going to find different options and their impact on services and lift prices", said the Director of the HSL Suvi Richtnime.
The costs are still unable to be assessed accurately.
My report reports that, on the basis of the number of passengers, HSL has paid its Y-year year for a million years, and the Ministry has been much more.
The R line on the main side will leave two positions between them.

Sixten Korkman wrote the chapter on the date of the capital book: "Marx supports the prostitute"
In 1818-1883) and in 1867-1894, Karl Marx and its final industry, published in 1867-1894, the crisis of the world economy, writes SKP's ex-president, who is known today in the book on the date of Marx's capital.
"He will take more serious than a long time," writes Hakane in his exhibition.
Marx's opinions on capitalistic development, internationalization and development of all the areas of life, focus on capital and the growth of the capital and imaginative capital have proved to be a surprising cities.
The list of writers based on capital seminars is also found by Professor Aalto-syliopy, a valued Economist Sixten Korkman.
The book Korkman writes Marx's a timely "know and eternity."
But isn't it the Director of the Office of the Ancient Research Institute and the Delegation of Life?
Not that.
In the phone, Korkman says that he does not like Marxi as an temporary budgetary, but more interesting society theories.
Today, society sciences have differentized and specialized, but Marx was philosophy, historics, socialists, economic partners, journalists, political attractions, and literature hours.
"Attachmental concept is that academic history tells the wrong views of the dead men," Kurkma begins.
It's true that Marx's prophecies have been ridicule.
Although Marx understood the creation and significance of the industrial revolution, he took too long decisions from the initial capitalism, but Korkman was in mind.
However, Korkman is seeing value in the radial position of Marx.
"There is more reliable in Marx that he asked good questions," he says.
Now again, we are discussed on the interests of Marxin, such as the share of security.
"Marx may give inspiration to the one who wants to understand the grand image, the technologically changed world," Alkman analyzes.
But what the government should decide tomorrow does not help Marx.
He thinked that capitalism was an unexpected case that should just stop.
However, Marx supports Korkman's thinking that he's inherited.
"In the 1970s, Marx couldn't read," Korkman says.
"It's all the capitalism, but more than one another."
Today the debate is more multilateral and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political pressure of the next year.
"Another social media should be known to Marx's thinking world, like other classics," says Korkman.
The United Nations requires military courts in Sri Lank
The United Nations requires the establishment of the Special Court of Justice to investigate the military ratios made in Sri Lanka in the internal war, reports the AFP.
In the United Nations report of 1983-2009 on internal warbase, it appeared in a mid-week after a long delay.
The report condemns the armed weapons, both Sri Lanka and the counterparts known as the counterparty.
In the internal war, Sri Lanka is estimated to die at least 1000,000 people.
There's no checking information about the victims.
In particular, in the last few months of the long-weapon attack, the United Nations report should be examined honestly.
The report of the Sri Lanka’s weapons condemns the complaints, struggles and systematic sexual violence, which would like to be the victim of men as women.
According to the report, the capitals were accused of evacuation of public and children as fighters.
According to the report, both parties are guilty of murder.
Sri Lanka replied in the mid-week that it would intend to organize the investigation itself, but would not allow the establishment of the Court of Justice because foreign judges.
At the I-Cheque of England, the social media was pointed out.
In a mid - week swimming language in the mountain, Syxy was a long visiting language, which was the largest part of the English.
The English art tested more than 16,000 experiences.
In the test, it could be written in materials, even though social media.
On the basis of his own experiences, we should consider whether social media make us unique and unfortunate.
Alternatively, the letter from the English word 150-250 could be shown to the advisor of the network newspaper.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt answers the Finnish Leel's lepotuol.
He asked how parents should look for the matters of young people.
The whole substance was four subjects which had to choose one.
“It was the most difficult,” notwithstanding the three subjects of the Swedish class in the English magazine My Lybeck.
In the third issue, Jose Manuel Barrosol was only one of the former President of the European Commission.
The fourth thing was that Lybeck was nice.
It was supposed to write a phone for the reasons why enterprises should pay young people to work.
"At least in our school has been performed in writing talks," Lybeck says and evaluates the whole experience "too normal".
In the Finnish or Swedish experience, it was answered to the questions of the texts that, for example, adapted the summarized climate change and the processing of large data.
In the medium week, some long Russian students were also written (168 students), Germany (124), French (52) and Spanish (27).
The letters of the fax continue on Thursday in the mountain, the second home, the Sweden or the Finnish test.
The trials in the literature are normally organized, or the mind of the payers does not affect it.
The Supervisory Institute encourages experiencers to search for appropriate transport contacts in time to enhance cohesion.

Trade on weapons was stolen in the lab
The school was stolen in the mid-week trade in the town of Horlon in the middle-week.
Police said the robbery was shocked into shocked clothes, and the faces were shocked into a command pipe.
He's a normal security and about 30 years of age.
According to the police, a man had a staff on his hands and got a small amount of money.
We're investigating this as a robbery.
The police's settled on the arrival of ten-year-old publishers in Helsinki, other than Finland.
The opposition against the operational decisions of the government will be supported by the Helsinki Center on Wednesday, the police.
According to the predecessor data, even ten thousands of people can arrive.
The members of the SAK, Akavan and STTK are assembled at 11 p.m.
The police's also believed to participate in the event.
Instead, the police at work is the task of treating alarms and other police operations, including the safeguarding of residues.
Railway routes are closed from motor vehicles at about 9 p.m. to 14 p.m.
Only the emergency levels will be determined in the area.
From your mouth of the hakane is cut away from the trail line of Kaisanima, from the mouth of Manerheim.
Does Helsinki's police office enough, super-Commissarian Seppo Kujala?
Repeat, at least it looks like it's enough.
I don't want to take care of the police work.
According to Kuchinga, he is coming to the outcome because of the statement, the parties supported other parts from Finland.
I don't know what the police's shooting shooting.
"In some cases we're coming, but we're going to work in our own way," Kujala says.
The police calls us to avoid private cars at Helsinki Center on Tuesday.
Assessing that the worst transport rate is at the level of Hakanie's nuclear center.
A reliable transport is expected from morning until starting.
Change the after-feater from Finland, Helsinki has also arrived a lot of opportunities buses.
They're not going to decide to the Rautator.
The bus will remain in the next time.
The final journey will then be walking to the place of mind", says Kujala.
It's also a stop to the Helsinki army movement.
The police's view here's a positive half.
The case of a trail transport, which is normally in these grandchildren meetings, will now be handled by itself.
The organizations of the opinion have reported to the police that Helsinki may be ten thousands of opposers of the economic policy of the Government.
The police's waiting for an emergence to be peaceful.
At least there are normal workers or unemployment -- normal citizens.
Yes, the Finnish people are reasonable and peaceful," Kujala states.
The various parts of Finland are also organized on Wednesday.
It's like, in the first morning, that's exceptional. Do you remember these laws and minds?
It is often interesting and exceptional.
For example, it does not find a very good comparison of the Finnish political history, says the professor of the Sociology of the University of Jyunesky, professor Martti Sigine.
You're not wonderful that the monster's protest.
If it wouldn't do so, it would spend the hands in front of the government, he says.
A good legal government has attacked the traditional nuclear points of the Finnish corporates, and also towards the importance of the development of the Finnish well-being State.
The rule of the government is missing in the right of the contract.
This is a lot of degrees that we really try to get the poles.
It also has a place to look at the ball.
For example, the games are needed, for example, to be not able to support all payers at the beginning of the week.
The new is now the sharp share which the mind will be held in the team that the age would like to participate in the opinion.
In November 1993, the unemployed ones of the Finnish meetings were welcomed by the committee.
If the summary is looking for a comparison point on the Sunday, it could be a delay of unemployed departure, the Murrostorstai organized in 1993, says the Sicherous.
In the middle of the deeply organized Murrostors, a 200,000 unemployment was collected.
Esco Ahon (kesk) government is a compulsory of the employment market crisis to another.
It was said that the Finnish government and the payment organizations had never been the same bad as during the foreign government of Ahon.
Now, it is likely to be worse than the time of Murrostors.
On the other hand, the Finnish government has always so much, the Single says.
The current government coalition is still interested in this way that it is so strictly legal, despite the fundamentality of the Somalia.
Another time, there were some elements of old job movement.
The place is expected for several thousands of sighters on Sunday.
It also stops public transport and closes possible daily and schools.
The difficulty of mind receives undivided support for payers, it may be for the greatest years.
In Helsinki, the last few years has been organized for about 300 incentives per year.
They're going to be loaded.
Traditionally, in Finnish's opinions, it has been particularly peaceful, although the workers have been overlooked in the past few years.
Traditionally, the Finnish opinion is inclined to a conflict, to be lawful.
Reviewers are trying to avoid damage or destruction of property, says the Sicherous.
However, the end of the 1990s was new.
It's changed in the culture of spectrum.
The EU's membership was nervous to shoot farmers, and the police was able to get their own shock.
The Paloman Law held three months in 1998.
The spectacular laws were also pilots and flight drivers.
Do you remember these ladies and minds?
Metal and electrical strokes of the 1970s
The most significant laws of the 1970s were a metal shuttle in 1971 and the power and electrical shuttle in 1977.
The Metalism Law participated in 700,000 metals.

Treatment passengers held three months in 1998
The Paloman's Law was one of the stakeholders of the 1990s, except the Kingdom law.
Legal authorities opposed the EU 1994 and 1999
Polices were launched in the protest of farmers in the EU in 1994.
"Cyprus teaches, EU stops," was one of the attacks.
The farmers in Spain slaughtered tonnes.
The EU Summit of Helsinki also held in 1999 to protest and to smoke shelters in front of the meeting place.
Doctors agreed with 1983 and 1995
The nurses were injured for about a month in 1995.
The first time they were in law in 1983.
In 1995, some cases of death occurred during the colored Law.
Tehy threatened the laws and caregivers' reports in 2007.
The threat to combating the civilization has finally speeded negotiations to the result.
Medical doctors lacked 2001
"The doctors in the lack of a pack," was the shock of the physicians in 2001.
The Law of Real Health and Hospital Health Center has held a few months and has been discussed how the leaks could risk patients' safety.
After the labour, the public sector raised a doctor's payment.
Students moved in 2013
About 50,000 students from the Senator's Bureau in Helsinki, 2013.
The Debates Police will determine the committees of the Finnish Republic to the Austrian police
The Austrian police has requested help from the Central Labour Police in the detection of the Finnish refugee Diseases.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped in Asterheim near the German border, a ship that had 42 refugees.
There's no information whether the rich was possible to travel to Finland.
The shoes were all right.
We've got information with the Austrian police.
Research and maintenance is at the time of the event in Austria, reports the Super-Commissariat Tero Haapala of Central Radio Police.
In the end of May, in Austria, the passenger passengers were more viable.
At that time, 71 passengers died, apparently supported.
The work with the Austrian police first, reported in the General Radio, is part of the Finnish share company.
The company works otherwise with restaurants and its director is a foreign, some 40-year-old man.
In Austria, two Iraqians have been arrested.
Foreign captain, former drug skiller and upporical businessman - the story of five secret drivers
Upportic king, a violent boat shipping, a typical sender and a smooth taxi box.
For example, such people practice human transport to the European Union.
A criminalist at the Trenton University, Andrea Di Nicola and the employer Gipaolo Musumeci have met ten secrets and these "clients", and their book of the Death Travel Office is expressed in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present the gloods of human transport, make proposals for solutions and submit secret drivers from the different doors of the business.
HS will present five of them.
I'll get out of them right away.
On the east of Tunisia, the islands do not touch foreign tourists, but many Tunisia are directing there to the sustainability.
Instead of their location, the islands are also excellently suitable for the shuttle transportation, since their trip to the Lampedus island of Italy is only 120 miles (20 km) away.
Because of the comparison, the oldness of Helsinki Tallinna is about 85 km.
There, in the village of El Attaya, is Emir, my captain to smoke and six children.
The ships are part of their crafts, but the fisherer is more productive to transport people.
And Emir has done it in a slipper, ten meters of wood ships with hundreds of accounts.
If a boat is full, it's 40 people.
From one shift, Emir takes about 8 000 euros after the expenses.
The orders have five helpers that are looking for him for customers around Tunisia.
The customers come from many countries, but during the Arabian period, a huge number of tunas wanted to flee for disappointments.
Then, the situation was calm until it turned back to a refugee crisis later.
Customers are coming from the maintenance to the Kerkenna Sea in small groups.
Order makes them empty to the houses as long as it's good to see.
Food is given so that customers are right and are still in life.
The message will pay about 75 euros from night, and if the customer ends with money, it is their problem.
We're going to go to the water in the middle of the night.
First night, we'll be shooting out of the island, then stop, wait day and next night to Lampedusa.
Sometimes the marine is hard, and in 20 meters highways, passengers smile and smile.
In the meantime, the human leg has been cast in half hours, and Emir will go back to the back.
Emir wants us to be afraid.
That is why he pains his customers, and at least claims that he is deceived by the gangsters of the spirit.
He says in the book that when the police once shocked him, he took all his passengers over the ship and told them to take them to the nearest island.
"I've seen customers from the shock and I put them over the ship," Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come from the south of Zahara.
His landmen have to hear that he's going to be worried about this.
I'll get them out now.
They have to show immediately who's going to be here.
It's a normal taxi wheel
Goran is just a normal taxi visit in Bogovia in Serbia.
His taxi isn't very good - start engineer, and it has been seeing the best day.
However, the main thing for Goran's customers is that the tax is exceeding, and that it moves to the Hungary border.
Bogoviağ is about 500 pounds of small populations from Belgrade to a lunch of about 60 miles (60 km).
It is located in the area of the safeguards centre, which is mainly intended for families.
From the center of the surrounding forests without their family traveling men in the shopping, low and abandoned cars that everyone has now been able to find or build.
The forests also live in families that have not been caused or otherwise abandoned from a security request in Serbia.
Some are also in private meetings, but it is public secret.
Gora's troops find the largest part of his customers.
These are often swimming - through the Balkan road requires a large number of borders over and weeks walking in a difficult swimming area, often in mountain areas and darkness.
Finally, people are deceived to the Bogovia region, the largest part of human transport.
The Cyctics of Goran are mostly secular, Afghanian, Pakistanians, Iraqians and Kurdess.
The best customers are scrianians, he's telling them in the book.
"They say it once and it's enough," Goran's smell.
He said that the Africans are trying to smile.
Goran doesn't like that.
It's all the way in the hole.
First, it will be agreed to the prices for example 300 euros, then they will calculate it to 200 and provide 150.
Gorran emphasizes it to be a good and good man.
I'm not interested in money.
I'm just doing my job and I'll help people," he says in the book.
Goran tells his jobs by more than others and counting up from the Hungary border only 50 euros from people.
The path is 300 miles [300 km], most of the motor engines.
The colleagues ask for a third or four-lined price.
Goran will be paid for about 500,000 euros per year.
It's not a big amount to the secret driver, but the annual income in Serbia.
Serbia has decided that taxes cannot be transported nearly 12 miles (12 km) from the Hungary border.
Goran doesn't care about it: he knows the ways and the pools and takes his swimming pool from the border of a mile.
Then he shows to his customers the right way and smells out.
In the work of the laptop
35-year-old congoleans are called Settler, and it's not just a lempinum.
He really has a protestant church in the capital of Uganda, Kampala, which is a large number of believers from Congo, and a small center that helps congous children.
In addition to the preaching, the Meeting Saloner is covered by a secret transport business where people are transferred from Kong to Europe.
He's looking at the work of his ladder.
It's important for the sender to look good.
He smells his skin several times a day and takes care of the smell of white pools slowly cut down the low shock.
The shipping car is proud of new Mercedes, its farm car and three motor drivers.
When the missionary is not preaching, he organizes people from Kong to Uganda and forward to Europe.
The customer will initially call some of the five sentences on the phone number.
He suggests that the border will be able to arrive in the morning, hide money visionally, and shut up the border over any of the traders that are walking.
In order to obtain a security applicant or a refugee station, the Uganda authorities must report that there is, for example, home from the North Kivu war areas and that violence has been flewn in their home.
Often it is true, but if not, the Sender will organize a new identity to the customer.
The old personality certificate will be deleted and the state is obtained by another.
That's what you're going to do with the Sender's contacts in the Uganda police.
The customer will then be managed to the same place where certain security applicants go: the security procedure, the establishment of citizens organizations, finally to the United Nations UNHCR.
The embassy feels burocratic, because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He counts on each other: the request to leave Uganda's police pays about 100 euros, the handling of documents to the humanitarian organization by about 150 and the process of change, for example, 4 500 to 7 000 euros in some European countries.
Folders and floors
Tom's starting a secret driver, the former drug runner.

Tom chooses the suitable skill to make sure that it's just on the way to England, not even in Hollanti, and he's shocking a safe snake.
It's going to be quiet, so they're going to wake up.
Sometimes the snake is drunk with you, but then the skin is more calm.
When the road is clear, Tom shuttles his customers in an aluminium folion, similar to that in the kitchen it is shuttered or refrigerated.
It should prevent the police's heat scanner to see the hidden.
Some use the same purpose with swimming powders.
Tom leaves his customer's rich and gets out of the place, hopelessly not at least before Britain.

Customers are maintained in human resources, for example in old industrial chains, until they have time to go.
People will be shooted into minibuses and shoot somewhere behind the beach.
They are ordered to hide vegetation in the group and wait for a sign.
When it is given, it's going to get up to the ship.
The travellers have to keep the whole way under the hidden side.
The marine station can only check how deep the ship is, since other signs of the human team are not visible.
Food and drink are given, but what less passengers will go out and take, it's better.
A small amount of EUR 53.000 after the expenditure of the slowest expenditure.
He does not handle the practice itself, but pays the captains, strikes, guards, employers and other smaller factors to handle their jobs.
In June, transport is organized at least hundreds and smaller prices.

The Master of the World was slow when the Alliance was put into the Norwegian snake: "The Great"
The Norwegian Countries Petter Northug has exceeded at least one of its colleagues.
The Northug and the Norwegian Countries held all over the course of the sports agreement last year.
Although the Alliance has offered Northug better agreement than other sportors, it has not been reduced to a multiface of world masters and Olympics.
As a result of the agreement, the Norwegian Countries decided to close Northugin from the cup of the world for the coming time.
The decision was grateful for the twice-first Master of the World Meeting of Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad that the alliance was put into a snake.
"Thank you've been addressing a shirt," Jacobs wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We can't allow one attractive Sporter to defeat the favor of the union sponsor", he continued.
The Norwegian Railway and Northugin Railway is about the money.
Northug would apparently want to be part of the years of the country team so that he could show his own sponsor.
Jacob said he was happy to represent an alliance that also cares for the future generations and does not give one sportor to the same.
In the same way, he recalled that the alliance has been given to Northug as economic and other privileges for many years.
I know that because I was part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one sporter has completely different rules than just because it's the best.
Northug published its own information in which he convinced his desire to be sported in the Norwegian colors for the next time in the worldcups, as well as then in the MM schools and the Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen wins all six MM-metrics, two golden.
She was with the last winter in Falun in the winter in the winning team.

Media student: Sipila takes the risk of zy
According to the civilian communication, multiple channels are needed, and telephones of the Prime Minister are one channel in other groups.
This is also necessary for the channel of this direct speech.
This will not be the last time, Sipila said to the committee of the committee.
Sippia did not want to evaluate how often the way the Prime Minister's television and radio phones comes.
According to the civilian, it is not necessarily necessary to continue on the Yle channels.
If other channels will be reported as a channel, then we're looking at it.
Now use this channel tonight, Sipila said.
According to the German economic status, it is serious that it requires the maintenance of television and radio telephones to citizens.
This quote, which is now speaking, is a time complex and requires a stronger basis.
That's why we finished this channel, Sipila tried.
The conversation is sent at 21.05-21.20 and on TV1 and the radio in Finland.
It can also look at the General Arena.
The cyclopedia takes the risk of cyclopedia
The media researcher hopes that the Sipilian television phone does not tell the most commonly translated government.
Is it an effort to take the right to define the public debate more closer to its own hand and to refuse the debate on the negotiations of the public? Mr Anu Kovunen, professor of the University of Tukholm.
Soin's silenced comment was to say that he does not observe the media agenda, nor let it be determined by himself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these matters do not join each other.
I understand that the commercial media has been disappointed from Sipil's report.
It would be strange if you don't react the media.
Communications of political headquarters are not reporting in democracy.
The representatives of the Media are definitively trying to do not to be taken into account by political responsibilities.
Surely, the television phone is a great risk for Sipil.
In the conversation, the citizen should import something new and special in order to comply with the exceptional high expectations set to the speaking.
Does it offer more than we have heard today?
Or can he speak to different slowness, different ways, or say something new?
Kovunen says that if the promise is only the same older, it must be wondered why such a great man has done, and Yle gave it an exceptional time.
In general, it is a risk to bear in mind if there is no particular situation, but the call of routine in other groups.
The Risk is that the Ule is a committee of political or commission and government, which is certainly not in line with the General Intress or General Line.
Of the civil open glass
In the future of the civilian talk, it is also important to what the Prime Minister will leave, without saying, that the media researcher highlights.
Tonight, you will see where Sipila is missing and where it is not, says the Scientist Coordinator of the University of the Scientific University Heliked.
I heard that the TV call is open from Sipil, because this is how it will take its own views without the shocks.
This is the message to receive a great public without a journalist filter, other than in the status of information where the providers can submit critical questions.
He's talking directly to the people.
However, it is dangerous that the media comes from something wrong, because it is not possible to submit a question.
I hear it's very important to how Sippia appears on TV... a valuable shoe, shoot your hands.
He compares Sipil's fatherhood, who now tells the people what to do.
If Sippia's part of presenting it well, it can work.
Your situation is different from when, if the government would inform some of the matter, because this person is like speaking directly to another person.
This (US President Barack) Obama and the partners are regularly remitted.
Exceptual
Political researcher Erkka Railo believes the Chairman's speech to citizens as an exceptional.
He said that this has not happened for decades that the Prime Minister is speaking directly to the people.
A slight time requires exceptional means, Railo says.
The investigator believes that the Prime Minister wants to obtain the Finnish churches to be grateful.
The payment organizations are organized on Wednesday and Monday against the activities of the Government.
On Twitter, President Paavo Arhinmöhki, President of the Left Unit, said that Sippia could keep his speaking on the state of the country as an advertising of the Prime Minister in which we could also be able to discuss.
The SDP President Antti Rinne (sd.) again reports its challenge to the Sipil dialogue.
There's no time for monologues now.
Shortly half years of ice.
Infinity you can't hide, Rinne write on Twitter.

Amirkhine tells me he's been struck by a young man's inflicting.
Amirkhan has more than 62.000 followers in Facebook.
The smells shoot the land, sit on the other side and shoot eyelessly without thinking about any of these consequences that happens when you do this videos, Amirkhani will update.
It's hard to defense
Some of the youths visible on videos are immigrants.
According to Mr Jarmo Heinus, the police Commissioner of Helsinki has loaded videos to social media as well as immigrants and youths of cities.
I mean, you're fighting on the street.
You do so much more difficult about the life of many other immigrants here in Finland, the Turkish Amirkhani.
Amirkhani recalls that Finland has pages that are looking for immigrant crimes.
These individual cases have come to very bad.
It's a little hard, kids, to defend you again.
You should remember that you're still visiting the country and you're here for a long time.
That's a little different way to thank you for being here, Amirkhani says.
My Amirkhine calls young people to remember you close.
If they sometimes become a racist, you can blame yourself.
Just think about a couple of times before you go with that, ladies.
Amirkhani says that violent action gives panics to race.
You're going to have a time of hate that I don't like myself.
However, you have things badly, and you don't have any better, Amirkhani decides.
SAK puts its part in the pack for Lyly's decisions on Monday.
The President of SAK, Lauri Lyly, reports on Twitter that as Monday, the Ombudsman's Ombudsman's position to submit to a optional list.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK's proposal on Twitter.
In the past half week, the STTK Office reported to the Government of his proposal to achieve the five percentage of the production scope required by the Prime Minister Juha Sipil (kesk).
The President Sture Fäder believes that the government will accept the proposal, if SAK, STTK and Akva are all behind the proposal.
However, it required that the largest reward organization SAK behaviour to its previous position.
The President of SAK Lauri Lyly, on behalf, commented on this matter on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Committee is treating the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, the SAK is looking for solutions to open the market, and that the position of the compulsory laws is required for an agreement on the active parties.
Lyly recalls that the proposal of the Director-General of the Civil Government for a social agreement was not replaced by the SAK.
Cyprus has previously disrupted negotiations on the Community Treaty when SAK has not agreed to join the five percent to the objective of productivity.
Comments: The majority is threatened to smile - "Think it's a little awesome to smell skin"
The feeling of it is a little smell to smell the skin if you have a suitable paper in the table, write to Pecca Tinane.
The tunnels vary in their loans.
Does it mean to smile the government or then agree with it?
On Monday, the Chairmans of the SAK condemned holy hate against the Government of the Republic.
The entire Finnish was threatened to shut up.
The smell swimming to the aquatics.
OAJ was threatening schools and daily schools.
At the same time, OAJ denied: a school or a daily school is not completely closed.
In the medium week, President Antti Palola (sd) of the Office of Agents STTK was convenient.
He reported to his government’s contact and launched the Prime Minister Juha Sipila (kesk) requires optional presentation for five percent of production.
The President Sture Fäder (kok) immediately tried to report that his appeal paper was already ready.
At first, the SAK office did not belong to any of them.
President Lauri Lylyn (Sd) is difficult to agree when the Chairmans of Alliance just on Monday ordered to spend the land on Saturday.
Finally, however, Lyly reported that the SAK Labour Commission was assembled in the next Monday to address the situation and that the SAK searched for solutions to open the market.
In order to make a common spectrum of payers, the SAK should intend to accept the five-produced area of production as a goal.
No wonder is that Palola STTK has a relationship with the government of Sipil.
Jukka Ihanus, director of the social impact of the Palea, acted as the special assistant of the Central Ministers Matti Vanhase and Mari Kivinini.
Palola also found that the departure of the government has been improved all the time.
It's not, but Palolan's outcome took a little clean away from the Finnish stakeholders who were swimmingly marrying the Marko Piirain (sd).
It's a little awesome to smell the skin if it's already in the table with my adjustment paper.
Modified at 8:00: Added information about Lyly's comments.
The Russian shocked Finland as a bad father: "This can't be repeated."
The Russian Dutch President, Sergei Naryshkin, has criticized Helsing's Etyj Summit.
The Russian Dutch speaker Sergei Naryshkin believes that Mongolia is better than Finland.
In the capital of the Mongolian city, in Ulan Batori, the Parliamentary General Meeting of Etygi, in which Naryshkin gave wide comments on the Helsinki Summit.
The Finnish did not allow Russian policies to the European Union, such as Naryshkin, to arrive in the meeting - the matter which the President has taken to remind the providers.
We believe that it was opposed to the values of the parliamentary democracy and the principles of the open dialogue.
This can't be repeated, Naryshki pressed the news office according to the Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin criticism was addressed to the United States where its access was also being held.
The sanctions are a political suicide from the EU, Naryshk declared.
The Mongolian delegation became complicated, so Naryshk continued the Finnish strike with a shock and thanks to the Mongolian "excellent organization".
I am sure that the parliamentary General Assembly will go to a constructive and positive result - not to a meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leader understands that the parliamentary dialogue does not have obstacles.
Naryshkin has met a meeting in Ulan Batori (kok) which has already discussed with the Russian delegation.
Clear towards the real playoff game: "Maalis in stretch"
Tappara and Luke will continue to be shocked today in Hacamet, when both are coming to the other day of birth.
Janne Lahti was predicting today in Hacamet, not seeing the prestigious breakfast.
Tappara went last night at the Coupe in a 3-2-way shooting flight from KalPa.
It was a man, because the gold group of the last few years was the worst of the two seats of the slaughter.
I've been more mobilious.
The Ramaian visitor of the Blues was shocked at zero point, and the slaughter slaughtered so old 2-3.
The hard game, the lands in stretch, if something plays the same game as the last year, the Luko attacker Janne Lahti predicted the arrangements on the following pages.
The telescope has been formed with a very slight playoff printer.
The Tappara has been shocked in two past periods of just the final date of Luko.
A seventh squad has been required to solve the solution.
In recent years, Luke took a series of views in the fourth games, but Tappara led to the next three lines and ends.
The groups' groups do not have major changes, except the number of groups.
Both of the cassarits struggled yesterday, today.
On the pitches, Mika Noronen makes a place to Tomi Karhus, and Rasmus Rinne is replaced by Ryan Zapolsk.
Visuality: A painted spectrum in the last time
The Chairman of the Sport Chairman hoped that he was the principal deputy of the Rail Case to write to the Santo Silvennow Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote a Rocky showing a headquarter.
Instead, he was in a sense of put into the fields of pregnancy to the worldwide master Apollo Creed.
Rocky had a great sympathy, even though he finally lost a tract.
30 years after Rocky next night, Mika hopela wrote a non-profit motor in Pora.
The unnamed and wooden patent has been a surprise to all the SM-Financies 2006.
Somebody was full of unnamed as Rocky, but sweethearts.
It was a White Indian, Porin Matt and Pele Pelt.
The players swallowed their head red and shocked irokees.
It's a blond of hope.
The maintenance of the TV JP Jalo calls a trainer as Newmann.
You've got the winning gold.
I hope there was one of the heroes.
The handbook hopes that this time's renewal works in the same way as a ten years ago.
The man who works as the Sport Director has built the slaughter of the wicked sons of the slaughter.
Seir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been drunk in the beach like Rocky sugar food on the snake.
Masi Marjamen, Miko Vitase, Juha Kiilholman and Matti Kupari are in some other places than in a strike game.
The hope has forgotten that Rocky VI's headquarter presents Pecca Railway.
Karri Kivi has crossed the Rautacalle Sean Conners.
The Railway is the same principal rapporteur in Rocky, as Connery had been at the original exhibition in 1976.
There's nothing else in the rail fabric than the name of Rocky.
The filthosphof of the rail calibral does not include ringing and small cutting.
He values hard games, but it's a different thing to play hard than a smooth.
In recent years, Esseen Garret Stafford took him into the head of the Tappara Jere Karya.
He's got two+10 minutes from the judges, but the Rautacall was put on a man in the shooting.
He didn't have a minute.
We're just playing those who do.
I don't accept that game and it does not belong to the kitchen where the Rautakal was using after the game to the Sunday National.
The team of this time has been built a strange way.
There are kids, veterans, police and targets.
The best keys in the age of the game have no practice.
It's not wonderful that the primary trainer has chosen an artist.
How much have you been able to affect players, Peace Radakal?
In recent years, the events affected the purchase and, unfortunately, the situation in the market had been over time, and the Railway was diplomatically answered.
I'll be on the castle.
The 1953 Road model is wisely interested in transferring to the hope to sports.
The men's agreements ended in the warm.
In three ligaties there are a lot of losses on the floor of 1-6.
I hope I wouldn't have emphasized the handle of the subsequent part.

We've been using a lot of different circles through their history.
Cirry also to be happy to understand that the Drama is a drama and the truth may have a little color.
Olga emphasizes that Sirka was almost the only one who believed that the island would become the largest in Finland.
The 1990s had a long and a real anxiety.
It was a small probability that somebody really did, but Sirka had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga tells us that he had heard from Tuku's much about this young man already before film plans.
However, the history of parents has been a little different.
Yes, if you're 15-year-old, how many parents really know what you're wooden.
Olga reveals that his own youth was completely different than the wicked snake of Henoa.
Olga was an arch and thanks for a girl who hadn't had a movie with Tuga.
And so he could have been able to shut up.
Olgan said he has done so much to cooperate with the Middle East for ten years that the great joint project is not scared.
Everything's always got a superhy.
Now the whole production group will go for month to description in Heino.
In the meantime, a couple who lives in the age is expecting to be slow because of their little children often at night also home, because the interim is not too long.

They took us so warmly, just asked what are the ways and when they are empty.

The descriptions start in October in Belgium.
Manager Timo Bergensola begins to draw the Iron Sky 2 photo in October in Belgium.
Scifillo image Iron Skyn footage, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, raises Finland as the most exhibition of all times in its budget of EUR 17 million.
Previously, the most beautiful film in Finland was Jalmari Helander's Big Gama.
Annoy Birds animation, which has been made, also has been prepared by Iron Sky 2: because the film budget is more than 100 million euros.
The pictures of the films produced by Timo Montesol and Teo to Delete start in October at Antwerpen near the AED Studio sites and sustain the eight weeks.
The manager Timo Bergensola is going to Belgium for the next week.
You're not scared of the budget.
I've been sick!
I've got such a ratio of the filile's manuscript, because I know what's going on.
All of the working groups feel that they do something unexpected.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though the time is strict, it's not scared in the shock.
I'm more exciting than I'm, and I'm not waiting for the public of this piece, he's talking to the weather.
At first, the budget of the film was 8 to 10 million, but in the development of the manuscript, the budget also increased.
Budget is great, but it's a great store.
However, the movie should be identified by 100 million, since each image and efficacy are so calm.
It's now all been wrong so strict that there's no finding.
In the middle week, Iron Sky Universe's film production company started a funding campaign and a group of funds, which is payed for an annual rate of 4-8 per cent.
The final rate shall be determined as a question and offered during the campaign.
After two years, the company returns the law.
The photos of the action show Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Juntty or cool?
Issue logs will return to packs
The density of the trends has recently corrected the deficit logs.
Another time ago, a modern shooting switch switch slowed clearly and grand logs like Cross' manuscript.
The marking of a skin or a t-payder was shown to some of them as a shirt.
His time is changed.
Sport has become the right model megatred, and so too old, well-known sport spectacles such as Adidas and Nike have risen to the shoot of cool.
And as often soon as it is, the border of the skin and the trend is shocking: if there is a right shoe, it becomes irone and cool.
First, a normal core train, or a smooth model, where trends were surprised by recommending the most smooth basic clothes that could be separated from the mass.
Now it is put into the corner, instead of putting it on the base of the cabin, with the logo of the manufacturer.
What's the biggest and more traditional, it's better.
In addition to logs, for example, the identified Railways, the favorite team games and the New York Yankees bridges have been refunded.
The start of the faculty border Calvin Klein logos are well detailed now.
Tredi seems to be a transferred sport mark to a ice bridge.
For example, the slowness of the seats of Versaz clears what is the sign of the clothing concerned.
Would you prepare to show logs in your shoot?
The Russian politician published the evidence: I didn't know what I felt in the bank!
According to the reports, a special interval would have occurred in Nizhni Tagil, which was considered as Russian Arms Expo 2015 for the war industry.
The Russian media has recently launched a colorful allegations, which indicated that the Russian Ministry of Emergency has been able to overlook the large number of Zotovia tanks for five hours.
So Zotov has done everything to thank the information.
He even published on his public Facebook pages a picture where he seems to be shocking a panzer vehicle in particularly good tunnels and not at least on the basis of their pictures, it is something about a shock or anxiety.
It's a shooting snake.
It begins that I didn't go inside to a fighting barrier, but it was a rhythm of PC-3.
I'm the former soldier. I'm the Prime Minister. I'm serving Ural.
I went inside, watched around me, and came out in peace, Zotov said to Comosomolska to Pravda.
I didn't talk, and I really didn't take five hours in that place, he said.
The Russian television television Zotov explained, in his show, the new technology of Russia, because he himself is an ex-professional soldier.
That's why I'm interested in what's inside the balls, and I'm a chance for our technology.
And I came out through the bathroom, he said.
I've been in all the tanks.
And in the next show, I will be able to visit all the tanks and all the shooting snakes, Zotov promised.
Zotov also shocked as a sweet prosecutor on this subject.
One idiot wrote, and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside and I came out.
I'm long and sluzhba, but nothing like that I had spoken to a tank, he said to the Russian sluzhba newcast to the radio.
The Zotov's words supports that no photo of the declaration has not been published, although the installation has been placed over a few days for a total of 500,000 people.
The deputy of Zotov's audience went on the start of the Bloknot.ru page in which Zotov was told to the shooter of the tank in trying and finally shoot all around him, if he reached the shock.
Later, the Bloknot page published a continued issue in which the demonstration organizers told their own views.
Everyone has only realized that the soldiers switch fast out of pansaroid vehicles.
But as a result of his grandfather Zotov, he simply moved when he came out.

Dancing Copper: IMF will warn too much
The Finnish Country Report, today published by the International Monetary Fund of the IMF, long-term views of the Government and the Ministry of Administration.
The system has patented Finland's structural reforms in order to achieve the economic problem.
The IMF believes that the reduction in over-work and the reduction in the wages of payment had supported Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be necessary for the whole agreement system and the unemployment security.
According to Pasi Cooppama, the main economy of the Danke Bank is agreed to be the same, but small differences are also found.
In the opinion of the IMF, the government has a lot of post-communications, but, on the other hand, a warning is also found on what should not be too much cut.
For example, these are infrastructure investments, which are the counterparty, says to the Taloussanomian.
The Growth projects would also support IMF to implement in the timetable as quickly as possible, so that they support weak economic growth.
The IMF was pre-financed to Finland for this year by 0.4 per cent of economic growth, which will be increased in 0.9 per cent in the first year.

Finnish will be only more lower safe applications
The Swedish Migration Agency has already recognized in February 2015 that even hundreds of children who have come to the country are lost annually.
In other words, SVT and Dagens Nyheter have reported on their net pages that the Swedish Migration Agency has lost hundreds of lower demanders per year.
The supervisor of the Migration Agency Juha Kannelland tells what is the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is that the same situation in Finland?
How much of the applicants will lose "land below" in the year? - In Finland, in 2013, a total of 156 insurance applications were made alone.
They've lost 9 out of them.
In 2014, the applications were made in 196 and lost 11, the Cannelland reported.
The background of the defect may be that the applicant has already registered in some other country applicable to the Dublin Regulation and may have been reported in the full-year age there.
In this regard, the applicant may be more attractive to lose than to continue to be treated in Finland and returned to the country responsible for the treatment of the application.
Any of the losses will also be found later when they search for a safe place from another Member State.
In 2014, the applicants of safeguards were all 3651, whose 134 application had made a warm decision because the applicant probably had changed from Finland, so adult safeguards lost 123 in the last year.
Is there a number of growth?
By 6.9 of this year, we have reached a total of 586 for a lower safeguard application.
The total statistics of lost low-commerce applications this year are not yet, but the number of low-commercies has therefore been informed and has clearly increased the effect of the number of losses.
How does the translation decision be taken?
Does they, for example, fall on the dark labour market?
This is difficult to be assessed by the Migration Office, since the police answers the implementation of the translation decisions, the Kannel country is stressed.
Inside Minister Petteri Orpo (kok) was concerned about the growing gap of unregistered employees.
He's been working in the case.
Orpo, regarded by the EU Internship Council, reported on the practices in which safeguard applicants have been managed through Sweden through the North Summit.

Psychological advice: This is how you tell children about refugees
Many more parents have recently come to consider how to tell children about the situation of refugees in Europe.
Or do you want to tell me anything?
This is not necessary to take a public talk, a member of the SPR crisis group, a psychologist Ferdinand Garoff Council.
The smaller children support the protection, and, for example, they do not let the news alone.
Small children can't always understand their eyes, and it can't be able to smile in mind and smile, he says.
However, if a child has disrupted the newspapers of refugees or has heard about other things, it supports speaking.
The debate is good to visit the child's starting points and to listen closely to what he asks.
The fear of the child may be surprised.
They are not necessarily those who are older thinking of him.
The child's not gonna be scared of it, even if he was worried and feared.
Small children follow the conduct of their parents.
If parents themselves remain peaceful during the conversation, their children also experience their security.
The grandchildren will probably cut into the discussion of refugees in schools, friends or networks.
Parents should be good to take them a matter to talk if you think about the child.
The fact is that all humans have no good things in the world.
Parents can be able to think about how to do this in our family.
But is our mind that the world is finally safe or unsafe?
Parents may also have different trends of education - some may want to protect their children according to the possibilities of suffering.
On the other hand, if the family is also talking about difficult matters, the child will be a model of how to handle the challenges in the future of life.
This may be useful for him.

A smooth smooth smooth smells
The castle North was shocked by the Palestinian Palestinians in the middle of the palace.
It was only the wins and swimming sites, until the end of July at Tampere's rabbit triggered the slaughter.
Because the skin was first slow, the trainer suspected that something was slow and he was able to protect the animals during the time.
The explanation to the smell survived in the precision.
The horse had a snake.
It was not less flexibility, but it requires two medicines.
Since the Palestinians of Apila had been on a slight floor, the North reports that he was shocked by the last shock of the horse.
It was in Turk with the other dark of the SE after the Task Force.
The Palestinian was very pressed when it could normally move only a few weeks.
The small effort of the attention was finally understood, the North says.
The trainer thinks that the competitiveness has made the oil to the oil.
The horse of the sheep certainly went forward, and hopefully it would also be rebuilt.
The Palestinians of the snake have been so many drugs.
When it hasn't been disappointed, it has been able to slow down without even illnesses.
Good day, the shuttles have shocked that the opposers have been wonderful.
At the speed of the day, clients do not work for the Palloawal, which even heat skills.
The hopes of the north are the Vermossa shoes.
However, different things are how the Palestine of Apilan agrees.
It's a difficult time to leave and may be shocking down the car under the tree and it's like that.
I hope the gold would be more peaceful than the Turu goes.
The Palestinians will be able to be able to get out of the cloud too, and we're going to go to the win, the trainer promises.
This is why you don't get away from the wrong iPhone program
Apple Director, Tim Cook.
At least part of the future programs with Apple iPhone phones may sometimes be removed in the future - but not all of them.
Apple will like to remove some of its own software from the iPhone phones in the future, reports the director of the company at the discussion of the Tim Cook Buzzfeed magazine.
Apple from iPhone finds a group of programs which are relatively used: FaceTime phones, Lehtikioski, Health, Pörssi, Podcasts and Vinkit will come in mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which has become packed into iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple intellectual owners.
Cookie says the removal of Apple programs is more complex than it appears from the head.
Some applications have been linked to some other iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems in some other phones, Cook makes Buzzfeed.
Cookie did not mention what Apple iPhone applications operate with other software.
There are other programs that do not work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a purpose to allow the user to remove them, you add to cookies.
The Apple therefore investigates the matter, because the company does not want to torment the memory status of the iPhone phones of users.

The prices increased downward energy.

In August 0.9 per cent was 1,0 per cent of the basic inflation.
The Eurostat's pre-value for basic inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy was 7.2 per cent in the euro area in the last month than a year ago.

The inflation of the euro area is still far away from the objective of the European Central Bank (ECB) which is a two-percent increase in the average period.

The next year increased to 1,1 per cent, the Central Bank was in the beginning of September in its new inflation developments.
The United States, Fed, is trying to declare the money policy following
The next round of the United States starts the fastest after the year, but more than three years after the Fed Central Bank again began to increase its rate.
And on the financial market, the dimensions will start on their part before the next time.
Fed has been able to start its emphasis in this week and last year.
Thus, the next fund may be pressed by the most fastest of its slowest ends and by the expense of the financial markets before it.
Or at least if the greatest economy and financial markets in the world operate as they had been, and if they react to the currency of Fed's money as they have done before.
Such guidelines have been concluded by the German Bank in London market research strategies for Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in the broad range of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed more than 60 pages of Long-Term Asset Return Study for the international research report for large customers last week.
The strategies set out in the research and report do not believe to know when, in particular, Fed starts to increase its rate or what happens in the economy and on the market then.
Instead, they present economic statistics through their realities and accounts how economic and markets have previously been conducted during and after them.
In addition to historical observations, they will consider the key changes in the economic and financial market now in the same or other models as in the time of previous recommendations, and what might it be possible to follow.
It is obvious that the economic and financial markets are now more grateful to sustain higher rates than once before the 1950s.
Maybe it's not a year.
The leaders of the Fed's monetary policy and its golden fluctuation are long-term and starting injuries that the time starts to be shuttle to the expense of the heights.
The first emphasis for over nine years may be incurred in this week.
The matter will be addressed in the mid-week and at the time of the open market committee of the Federation to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
The previous time Fed noted that the Fed funds in June 2006 was called.
At the end of the two years, relative regular, but once again, a series of highlights of 0.25 per cent units, with Fed increased by 1.25 per cent of 5.25 per cent.
The symptoms of the financial market began in 2007 with the most dangerous financing of the United States, and a year later the financial crisis turned to the global pressure of the Court of Justice.
In 2009, the largest tour was taken.
Recently, serious contractual applications of the financial market and real economy began slower than after the previous Fed's emphasis typically occurred.
However, the tests were higher and slighter than once ago the lamb of the 1930s.
The German strategies have decreased the increases of the world's largest economy and rates, as well as the translation of the financial markets from 1950 to the beginning of the 1800s.
Fed's highlights and their economic and financial impacts have been made clear since the 1950s.
At the beginning of the first highlight, it has speeded the fastest time less than the year, mostly less than three years and average less than three and half years.
The rate of the financial market has been concluded two years after the start of the Fed's highlights.
Fed has risen in the mountain and has been calculated in the mountain at the start of the 1950s towards the cycle of pain.
Each time has been deleted from some of the other parts, and the reporter has considered a relative necklace, so it may soon conclude the effects of the following emphasis.
Strategics also recall that this time many things are different.
And we're not just gonna be better.
Rate too long on too far
The reasons for resolving the financial crisis could not necessarily be obliged to find out uncertainly even in decades of research.
However, three strict reasons for which the crisis leads and its destructive strength are inevitably found:
(1) Fed, the ECB and other largest central banks in the euro area had to be too long on the end of the 2000s.
They were placed after the technology, and they grew up on the same.
2) In the various parts of the financial and real economy, the measure was collected for decades and, above all, too large bonds increased on the impact of the financial policy on central banks.
It was the largest debt of the Economic History.
3) In particular, the disadvantaged detention of the financial sector was the majority of the majority of the financial market shares of the largest currency pieces of the economic history of funds, debts and benefits.
In fact, it is very worse that the financial markets in the most complex funds were rarely dangerous and insufficient when Fed and other central banks last time were upwards.
The financing structures covered by the bonds were not able to develop as long as highlighted, and the costs of the financing were turned to increase.
The risks were being carried out as a financial crisis, and it would follow a great deal.
The larger ball and more bonds
The German strategies do not consider what is happening as follows, but give the subject to the summary, for example, the following items:
1) Fed and other larger central banks have now maintained their financing policy as much longer than previously financed.
If the rates were too long before the crystals were too long, they were still slower.
2) The debt has not been long as ten years ago, but the bond is now more grateful than the expression.
Thus, the obligation of the financial and real economy has not been declined, but now in different parts of the economy weakened a weaker debt than before the financial crisis or half of them ever before.
3) For the most part, the liquidity flowing from the central banks has remained in the financial markets and the main values and property raw materials of the funds and ownerships, as soon as possible, has remained in the financial market.
And not only the Latin tunnel strategies in the financial market warning marks, but they also noted that even the United States economy has not yet undergoing the financial crisis and the weakest model that has been made in the past for decades.
The euro area's economy is, of course, in any case.
In other words, the reality is insufficient, but it corresponds to the financial markets and the risks relatively larger than before the financial crisis, when Fed is on the next time to spend its money more closer.
Maybe the French Bank, the Société General Strategy Albert Edwards, is not so strange as it can affect its future image.
He has already prepared international investment customers for the following translations:
First, Fed's upwards, and then the finances are slow, and soon Fed's time is to shoot finances from the most largest QE currencies.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) manufacturing computers and Results will even reduce 33000 jobs.
In the case of HP's undertakings, the company reports.
HP is shared in November by Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Consumed Pc machines and a concentrated HP Inc. company.
HP staff was the largest in 2011, with 350000 employees.
Last October, the staff has been deleted to 302000.
The company books on arrangements 2.7 billion dollars (approximately 2.4 billion euros).
Hewlett Packard Enterprise reduces 25000-30000 employees.
The reductions of consumers remain in 3300 over three years.
HP intends to transfer its operations to low costs so that 60 per cent of its employees would be low costs in 2018.
The company reports that its balanced business is already so that one of its customers does not meet more than ten per cent of its business results.
In other years, the three significant customers were 65 % of the commercial results.

General: Minister Berner has operated in the government of the tax party company
Mr Anne Berner, Minister of Transport and Communication, has been a member of the government of the tax company.
I generally believe that the company is involved in such a tax plan.
This is the Saltri II LuxCo company of Luxembourg, a member of the Government of Berner in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg trade register, Berner is still officially a member of the government.
Berner himself says that he left a membership in May this year.
I checked this, and it's enough that I left the difference.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registering chains will occur in the appropriate timetable, Berner says in the general discussion.
Membership after fusion
By means of the Luxembourg company, the ownership of the Swedish Kerhrs company is managed.
Kerhrs is a parking manufacturer who fusioned a Finnish park manufacturer with Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner operates in the government of Karelia-Upofloor in 2010-2013 and after fusion in the Khars government and the Luxembourg company.
For example, the ownership of Kerhrs is walking in Luxembourg through a multi-portal ownership structure.
Berner says to Yle that he took the government's deputy in the luxemburg company on the request of Kerhrs to be the second largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been together with Hartwall Capital in the government of Karelia-Upofloor.
A cooperative partner found in Swedish.
This company has a capital contractor in Luxembourg.
I realized that my own task was to care for the implementation of the capital of the Finnish family company.
It is important that we take care of the production of capitals of our Finnish enterprises in Finland and the next item was secure in this regard, says Berner.
Berner says to Yle that Hartwall Capital's ownership does not join tax plans.
According to Berner, a complex ownership structure used for taxparts is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kerhrs had the capital fund for Triton for ownerships already prepared by the luxury holding company.
In the spot, it is opened by the management of the company

STTK will prepare an alternative work-friendy package
STTK began to prepare optional packages for the churches of work in the government.
The management hopes, including other payment centre organizations.
According to President Antti Palola, the attention is at the spring of the Monday.
Optional methods to reduce the price of work will be returned after it.
Everyone understands that life continues after spring, Palola observed the meeting of the organization on the table of the prosecutors.
Assessing that the Central Union (EC) is not prepared for discussions.
The Economists of STTK have estimated that the change in the competitive package of the government will pay for the employee from EUR 30 million, when the second half of the package is 2.700 million.
I don't know whether there's a large innocence to visit the discussion if there's one relationship in a hundred.
Palla: Renewal contact was to be built
Prime Minister Juha Sipila (cesk.) has expected options for the middle-week, since the Government has to give its own package information to the committee and initiate the preparation of reforms.
I don't know if the timetable was realistic.
The discussion connection to the government is, according to Paloa, exists, and it has been built to him all the time.
In particular, the operation of Sunday shares on the STTK Office is a painful place in Palola.
The system requires that the government be revoked on a law which would be implemented by part of the clergy.
According to the STTK, it does not make sure that the alternative package would be prepared with the SDP.
The salaryers will be gathered on Monday, Helsinki, to oppose the last week of the government's work-friendy package.
The packaging packaging of the first age of diseases is cut off, overworks are settled, sunrise costs are reduced to 75% and the leakage is decreased.
The STTK stressed that the central organizations have invited payers to report and that they did not have an ordered law.
Thanks for the Acavan Fjord
The President Sture Führer thanks to the notification of the STTK for the preparation of a alternative package.
According to Fjeder, STTK will now be the same line with Akawa, as Akava has already been the most slightest optional models for the Government's presentations.
Fjeder hopes that SAK is also obtained as an alternative to be packaged, as without the SAK package is not sufficient.
President Sture Fäder hopes that, according to the future of the SAK, the leader of Lauri Lyly will prepare a presentation for an alternative for operations.
Antti Palolan STTK told his new proposals in the mid-week.
We want to change security and worktime banks.
The open week has been prepared for a long time of its own presentation, which is ready to consult the Government of the country as an alternative for operational transactions.
Akava has been ready to consult all the time, and we have already written alternative models for the Government's presentations.
We are ready to look at the conditions of the service relations in particular.
On the other hand, we want to change security and worktime banks, reports President Sture Fäder.
Fjeder hopes that also SAK will be on the Akava lines, such as STTK has previously done in the middle week.
Without the SAK package, it is not sufficiently strong.
Now we're preparing a model that comes to the government of the country and the employees, Fjder says.
The Commission of Labour shall be meeting at 15 p.m. on the possible content of the Agreement.

In the 1990s, Esko Aho did President Mauno Koviston, instead of the new year, but it was more ceremony.
In 1976, President Urho Kekonne stopped the telephone law.
One phone, a monarchist mine
The civilian talk has risen on the criticism of the whole day and the thoughts of what will be expected.
The President of the Left Unit Paavo Arhinmöhj said on Twitter that "Child was able to keep Sippia speaking on the state of the country as an advertising of the Prime Minister in which we could also be able to discuss the conversation."

The leadership belongs to dialogue, listening to people.
The SDP's Courts judged in Facebook that "monarchist's monarchy: the Prime Minister tells the people what is best for it".

According to the SAK, it was noted that the President of the President of the SAK was directly sent by Lauri Lyly and Jyri Headman of the EC.
It's a general appreciation for the presentation of the Cyprus talk.

Like us at the time of the Tempels
The conversation has also been shocked.
Tonight, you'll be enjoyed at a good time, kids will be shocked and shooted better.
Mom puts his head the sight's trill and the father agrees with the skin.
From nine o'clock, it's been quiet to the television as before me at the time of the Timony," writes blogger Saku Timone.
"Does the Prime Minister Sippia also talk about the reason why the Finnish government has seen millions who hidden its capitals in taxpayers, which put other laws on the arms of the tax partners and claim to the people that it must be shocked when the State has finances?" asked Pia Lohikoski.

Auditor in Guardian: Western countries against Russia's proposal on the exclusion of al-Assad
The Western countries have been fighting for more than three years ago the offer of Russian President Bashar al-Assad that would have been obtained from the power, reports President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to the Atheist, the Russian UN source proposed a plan that would have been slowly disfellowshipped with the power of Al-Assad.
However, the Western countries did not consider the proposal because they believed that Al-Assad was falling in some weeks.
The Agency discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.
According to Ahtisar, Russian Senator Vitali Tshurk read in the two-second discussion of the three paragraphs of the plan: the opposition between arms, opposition and al-Assad must immediately be carried out with the band of the Al-Assad.
I know Zhurkin.
We do not necessarily have all the same agreement, but we can discuss openly.
I told her what I did there and he said that Alas, Marty, is sit down, so I'll tell you what we need to do, the Assyrian is remembering the Guardian debate.
Diplomatics Do not comment
The expert reports the Tshurkin message to the United States, the United States and the French, but nothing happened.
Tshurk did not confirm the content of the discussion, but Ahtisar says that there are no two words.
The United Nations diplomates also refused to comment on Ahtisar's claims, but said that Al-Assad's troops had already done several civil murders and key opposition groups for all agreements which would have remained in power at that time.
Sir John Jenkins, former Director of the Middle Eastern Ministry, is addressed to the disorders of Ahtisar, because his experience has not been in any stage prepared to discuss Al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported Al-Assadia throughout the war.
Similarly, in the argument of Achisar, Tshurk spoke about the Moscow’s delegation.
If she had told me about the Tshurkin talk, I would have answered that I would like to hear the same President Vladimir Putin to take it seriously.
In the case of Jenkins, he would also be suspected that Putin had been pleased to keep the power of some Al-Assad supporter.
The fleet of our own works
During the negotiations of the amusement, about 7500 people died during the Syrian crisis.
According to the United Nations argued, the number of victims of death exceeded 220 000 in the beginning of the year.
More than 11 million people have been fled from their homes because of the war.
We should have stopped this disaster.
Revolution of refugees to Europe is our own work.
I don't see any other option than bearing good care of these humans.
Now we're gonna pay the account we've caused, the Athesaari says to the newspaper.
Securities applicants' arrangement centre in the Toronto
The Planned Northern European Union's Administration is likely to be established in Tornio.
The debate would be based on the building of the Toronto in the centre of the city.
The Ministry of Inlands has been looking for an appropriate place to improve the control of flights from the Swedish border.
Helsinki’s news was found that the department had already decided to present school construction decisions to the Ministry.
According to Sauli Hyöppis (see.) the Chairman of the city department of Tornion, it does not consider its place.
When the whole department was not together and the português wanted an official decision, we decided to invite the delegation's meeting to decide on this matter on the next Monday, he expresses the STT.
There was 36 delegates in the debate situation of 43.
The Headquarter opposed 13 complaints.
It could be expected to be a positive decision, and it is said.
According to Timo Niiyaze, the city was communicated as an uncomfortable Sunday, and it was reacted soon.
The Community would be able to evaluate 500 security customers once again.
The experts have been examined that it could apply to such use.
The location must be divided from the border, so it would also be active, the Old.
Cyprus is still hoped to alternate for churches on the labour market
According to the Secretary-General Juha Sipila (C.S.) the public's defence of loans would only deal with a part of the government in order to calculate the cost of work.
However, the Government is deeming to adopt an optional package if the market organizations are able to agree.
In the committee, Sipila reported that he had not been linked to the working market organizations.
He also did not know how serious organizations are looking for a way to replace the ways to the churches of the government reported.
If such a treaty is born, we will take it without any other joy with a whole package.
The defence of loans would be of the way to work in Sipil, as it was almost all payers, other than the operation of the government on Sunday.
Employment organizations could be appropriate for the operation of salary funds, as they are registered instead of laws on employment contracts.
The government reports these visions as a medium-week to the Chairman's press as a communication of the State Council.
The proposals of organizations should be informed before.
This isn't the final shop.
Legislative work is going to move, or swimming, and it's going to be more harder for the whole time.
It's a good time now.
There's no long way in these matters, if you want, Sippia's shape.
In the last week, the list of governments has, on the other hand, the change of final and hellaters to free-day years of work without delay.
Furthermore, the payment of the first diseases is covered, the overworks are divided, the sunrises are reduced to 75 per cent and the losses are decreased.
Reforms are carried out as a compulsory of law in the end of the vocational associations, which has been raising a strong appreciation.
The Ombudsman Centres organize action on Wednesday, as well as many professional associations have declared political laws.
The Delegation of Ministers adopted the expansion of the magistrate stock
The Delegation of Ministers agreed unilaterally, but a few of the North Koivu Oy's control, or the expansion of the magic.
Assessed the fact that the project was larger and more expensive than the beginning had been spoken.
Even the urgent timetable was shocked.
It was a little surprising that the conditional need was not known for a year ago when the previous expansion was decided.
In this stage, the expansion of the stock was approved to the investment programme for 400-450 square meters, but the money will be decided to be the most important part-time report.
On the other hand, 1500,000 to 200 000 euros were discussed, but the technical director Erkki Ikonen reported that the price would be estimated for EUR 3000,000.
Investment was encouraged by providing work and tax revenues to the location.
The honor has no risk, since the company pays the investor's loan, the Water Division (p.p.).
Turn in the language even in Joensu
The commercial management of your shipment is previously switched in its position to produce swimming languages in Joensua.
The new decision is important and right to think about the traditions in the whole country.
Joensuu will not be proclaimed as the capital of the language, because it is not historical foundations, nor the skilled language is a creative part of the identification of the region.
The language speaking in the shine of Jeenzua has been more part of the western slaughter.
After a new decision, the centre of the city will not be cutting languages.
However, the city of Joenzue is possiblely well-decisively prepared to use a swimming language, for example, in the information tables and on the market.
Similarly, the city recommends all other operators.
Although Joensuu is officially a single language community, it also supports the use of the language in an abnormally now when the multiculturality lives and is strongly changed in Northern Kirjala.
The language is still the special aspects of the country, as well as the image of Joensuus as the entire Finnish forest capital.
Each of them can be very useful for the multi-markting markets.
The disadvantages of good contacts strike the power of the country
The transactions of the merger contacts are attacked with the power of the country’s lives.
Movement contacts directly affect the environment and competitiveness of the country.
And it affects whether we can overcome the life and work here, President of the city of Joensue, Cari Kari's miracle.
He will also be able to spend the aircraft, which has also continued to be taken in the report.
It is important for the whole country that our opportunities are not to reduce state power measures as now existing.
It should be considered that the effects of delays of these transactions are, for example, on employment, to be stressed.
The deterioration of communications causes additional problems to the university of Eastern Somalia in respect of the attractiveness.
Indeed, what best services are here, such as business and your home conditions, it is easy to get students and employees, director of the East Summit University.
He notes that bad traffic contacts also affect an investigation that is very moved and traveling because of the study.
Marko Junkkarin said that the marketing of the university at the present time is difficult, because the transit contacts are weak in the university.
At the moment, about half of the students of the Eastern Soome University come from the outside of Eastern Suome.
At least 10-20 per cent of them is the New Year, which is explained in part in the main line of the merger contact.
The Jeensue became one of my shoes to the war of Siu
The view of the country's war project of Joensua is apparently unilateral, but one of the spectacles is also in the team.
Mr Pentti Centralsallo (s. e.g.) presented a government at the summer meeting of the project, but its proposal was unfavourable.
The government adopted the President of the city, Kari Kari, a resolution that is still amended at the beginning of October before the meeting of the Cities's delegation, which gives the project a final opinion at the same time with all other committees.
One bunch of buses from Kouvo to the next year
Your personal carriage from the Coast will remain even in the future, even if one swimming snake is slower.
In March, there will be changes between Kotka and Couvola.
One of the bunkers remains away, but five times in the day, you'll go from the Coast to the Coast, and on the other hand.
The complaints are caused by the State's employees.

The kids kissed into the castle, one didn't go down, the boys lifted out of the place
The Savior Office left a swimming snake to a 12-year-old shooting swimming shooting shooting, which wasn't opened from the castle.
Your condition was born at Tornion in Ketoti at half six hours last night.
The place has a old wood of two-wheel-food tree, which has no thickness in the bowl.
It was not prevented by a child who decided to switch up the castle of the house on his side of the radioamers.
The other kids got the same way down, but not one.
It was the fact that others strike out the place and passengers alarmed the place of the Saviation Institute to help the last shops to be safely residued on the ground.
FedEx's business shipping twice, counts on 2016 views
FedEx reported the deteriorating results from the last quarter, and the department switched the whole yearly resulting test, as a result of a decreased question of reporting services and the higher costs of its rural services.
The company also said that it would be paid for about 55.000 sequencies for the time.
In this past year, FedEx reported that it is being rewarded by 50 000 sex-sexercisers for the time.
The share of its share was around 2,5% of the expense for 45 minutes prior to the average week.
FedEx Corp says that it will wait for the next end of May for $10,40-10,90, which is 20 cents lower than previous prophecy.
Analytics waited for $10.84, I'm telling FactSette's question.
In spite of the average 4,9% of the price rates in force on 4 January, and notwithstanding the higher rates in November on the start of adult or large large land transports.
The company said that it is expected to increase trade in the past year, since they have lost costs, trade change has grown and the network trade is growing.
The President and Director-General Fred Smith said that the company "stablely carried out with the expected weakest economic situations, especially in production and global trade."
The planned payments were published in the last day after the UPS competitor reported that 90-95 000 extractors would be paid as the same as the last year.
At the end of 31 August, the result of FedEx was $692 million, which is more than the last year.
The winning per part became $2.42, which remains at the average cost of $2.44. 12 analysis question made by Zacks Investment Research.
The movement increased 5% to $12.3 billion.
In the question of Zacks, six analysis expected $12,23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years on the reduction in international priority transport, which has stopped its development of the Express Trade Unit.
However, the increase in the network trade has improved the results of FedEx Ground.
In the latest fourth country trade change increased 29%, but the results of the operations were in principle the same because of the expenditure and the insurance of the largest packages.
The income of the Express unit was better because of higher base payments, while re-employed costs were higher.
About an hour before FedEx's shares are counted by $3.85, or $2.5 per cent for $ 150.15.
FedEx closed 11% in the calculation for this year and 17% of the precaution of June 11.
The heads of the United States Central Bank are settled this week by two days in waiting for a long meeting, whether it has been time to increase the control rate for the first time for about ten years.
Secondly, the twelve meeting room of the Central Bank is the seaside from the United States.
The map is remindered that President Janet L. Yellen and his colleagues must set up the economic interests of the people in all other ways.
The Congress has been calculated by two responsibilities: they must maximize the employment of the United States and keep the prices seriously.
However, after the largest floor, the leaders of the Central Bank have agreed that there is also a third non-scribed mandate: economic stability.
Indeed , this third requirement may be a resolving factor in the public decision which is so strict that it may not even be predicted.
Although the majority of the information shows that the growth of the economy is stable, the latest death on the global financial market may have already been made by the officials of the central banks in the prerequisite way to increase in the insecurity, which would be fearing how to be affected if the fund rate of the Union would even be tested in the fourth percentage units.
"Overy understanding the labour market and inflation are the first and most important matters that are followed," states Lindsey M. Piegza, the principal report of Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But if they are looking for the right to leave the rate, increased insecurity in the world markets is sufficiently valid to expect yet,” said he.
The decision of the Central Bank has not been reached to a common understanding, which is something to bring nervousness to the economy.
According to the outcome study of Bloomberg, about half of the economic reporters predict that the rate is higher in this week.
Financial markets are still expected that the Central Bank will be delayed, as the main indicator states that the growth possibility is only 30 %.
This refers to the calculation of the values market, if the Central Bank increases the level, unless the financers would then be able to shoot by promised that the next rate will not occur in the next few years.
In time Dow Jones industry average - indexed 228.89 points, or 1.4%, at the new chapter 16.599.85.
It is expected that the Central Bank keeps the level before this week, reports John Lonski, Moody's Capital Markets Research Group Report.
"I'm surprising if the Central Bank gets up the heights right now," he says.
If the deputy are upsetting the heights, "we must see much difficult in their line to support the financial markets so that they are not in panic."
Other experts claim that the total level would calm the financial markets because it would remove the incertitude of when the Central Bank operates.
Only a month ago, the Central Bank was influenced by a high rate in this month in the fourth percentage unit, thus taking the first small step towards the situation of money, which would ensure the stability of the United States.
In general, it has been said that he is expected to increase the level this year, despite the need for liberalians to require more economic development in its elections.
Although the creation of new jobs in August has been long, the growth in the labour market has been stabilized this year.
The rate of unemployment in the last month was at 5,1 per cent of the number of seven years and near the level of the Central Bank to be the full-scale limit.
The growth of the wages has shown signs of disruption.
Although inflation is still under the 2% annual target of the Central Bank, the Central Bank has a significant impact on the price of the oil.
The economic "excellently increased rates and also requires them taking into account the strict situation of the labour market", states Ian Shepherdson, Pantheon Macroeconomics company.
However, the financial markets around the world struggled last week when China defended their wealth.
Dow Jones in the industry - index even 16 per cent of its mixture, when investors feared that China’s long-term economic growth was also a global growth.
The markets have reached some amount in this month, and the Dow index is now almost 10 % below the mixed level.
In the case of the bank's decision-makers, the market is an additional compliance with a complicated balance that reports that the rate of the rate must be increased.
"Unless these events of the financial markets and the last weeks news on the weakness of China's economy, the heads would clarify the level at this meeting," says Stephen D. Oliner, UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate, and the official of the former Central Bank.
Now he predicts that the decisions will expect at least a month to have better effects of view.
"Natural effects to the United States economy are particularly doubtful, and they do not have any information on the use of the results of the Chinese events," Oilner states.
The international economic well-being is not the maintenance of the Central Bank, so it should therefore not affect the decision.
However, the use of the Central Bank of the Union has become the world's money authorize.
In recent years, the impact of the Central Bank has been unplanned.
In 2013, the president Ben S. Bernanken, the conviction that the Central Bank can increase the amount of money, caused a change in the world's markets.
In the world where markets and economics are still in advance, the officials of the Central Bank are expected to be on the other hand, also consulting other central banks and experts in order to achieve a better view of the world's economy.
The decision-making process of the Bank is "more than science", states Zachary Karabell, Head of the World Strategy of Investet Inc.
The Federal Reserve Bank (Federal Bank) in the Virginia State, President Jeffrey Lacker noted in this month that "the Central Bank has previously overregored its financial market trade, which has affected the different economic factors".
The Federal Open Market Committee has requested an impact on the decisions, and Lacker, a voted member of the Committee, is a example of decisions between 1998 and 99.
The Asian economic crisis caused a reference value by the Central Bank at 0.75 per cent unit during the three meetings "in spite of the limited and identifiable effects of the United States economic growth", Lacker says.
Years later, the Central Bank shocked these operations.
The bank also should set an economic stability to the only major crisis, as the markets destroyed in 2008, said Adam S. Posen, the English Central Bank (Bank of England).
Lastly, the voice will not be close to its level, and Posen states.
"No one wants to do a situation where the rates are scared because the markets are injured," said Peterson Institute for International Economics President Posen.
The law of the Member State on the Central Bank (Federal Reserve Act) remains to be included in two requirements, and it is not the economic stability, as long as this is, they do not think that it should be prevented.

Droping can help low-scale diabetes
A new study shows that the benefits of the 2-diabéticos of the bleeding system may be at least five years.
However, it is still too premature to say whether these slowly heavy diabetics are longer than those who are treated other ways than transplanted.
“The receipt of death data is long,” says Dr. Robin Blackstone. He is an adviser who wrote for the new study of JAMA Surgery during the period of time.
The use of different methods in the barrier operations should be reduced.
They reduce hunger and restrict food inhibitance.
In years, bariat operations have been effectively identified in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of those involved in the study have been hospitally meat, and their pressure index (BMI) has been 35 or more.
BMI, or the weight level, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If the MIB is over 25, it shows that someone is super-pressed, and if the MIB is over 30, it is considered to be excessive.
You can calculate your own BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new research, researchers in the Mexican Min-Sheng General Hospital hospital used from 2007 to compare two barriers surgery surgery operations, random interference and reducing the landscape, the medicational treatment of the type 2 of the diabetes, which were slowly limited.
The investigation showed that the average BMI of operational persons was from 31 to 24.5 at the end of the five years.
At the same time, those who were treated in other ways as in the operation, BMI remained the largest part of 29.
With 36 percent of the heavy people, diabetes improved totally and 28 percent of them.
For comparison, in the medically treated group, diabetes improved only by 1 per cent and by some 2 per cent.
Furthermore, blood pressure, triglyserides and "fat" LDL colleagues "was generally taking better in the best surgery group", writers explained.
Studiers also followed hemoglobin A1c levels of patients that reflect blood sugar in a long period.
Hemoglobin A1c should remain in less than 7%, write researchers.
The rate of hemoglobin A1c post-operation was around 9 per cent to about 6 per cent.
However, in the medicine group, it remained stable in about 8 per cent.
However, this best "glyke control", which has improved hemoglobin A1c, has not reduced mortality during five years, reports to Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu collegone.
The research group also compared the average results between two different types of operation.
In the five-year terms, when compared to the group in the slow-sized skin, the group in the slow-scale has been decreased more weight (18,7, and 14,2 kg), the pressure rates increased (7,4 and 5,1), the level of hemoglobin A1c (3,1 per cent and 2.1 per cent), and the total diabetes remission (46,9 per cent and 16,7 per cent).
The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix says that, although the study does not appear a life-of-life or surgery after five years, there are studies on Swedish, where the surgery led to the worst of life by the worst humans.
The Swedish investigation reported that less likely to die 15 years, with a group that had experienced more traditional treatments.
Although a new study does not appear to improve operational patients, Blackstone says that the results are encouraged for persons whose BMI is under 35 and who are interested in the operation.
"The results of the expertise are just resolved by showing that transaction is safe to the group of low pressure indexes", and it does not have a combination with the risk of death or renal disease, he says.
More than Blackstone, both patients and their physicians should take a very serious weight at the stage when BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long before we take this seriously," he says.
I believe that when humans have collected these genetic changes that are constantly preparing his body for excessiveness and diabetes, the elimination of the situation is very difficult.
"All can't come to Europe." - Dalai Lama - RT News
Dalai Lama has said that Europe can't accept any additions of refugees that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is found from the Middle East.
The Chief of Buddhism has requested the end of violence in the homes of refugees.
Dalai Lama was discussed in his speaking of refugees in Oxford at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the British visit.
Dalai Lama said that in the current situation, all humankind needs should be set up by individual nations or even before the earth.
He also stressed that even though the response to the countries of Western Europe is towards refugee crisis is not sufficient.
"All can't come to Europe," he said when he talked.
Although Dalai Lama exceeded the action of Germany and Austria in the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"I'm glad to care for several thousands of refugees, but it must be considered long-term solutions: how to bring real peace and real development to these muslim countries through education.
The original matter is how we can reduce the killing of their country.
We need to reduce the use of power.
The use of power has never solved these problems," he added.
On the basis of the question of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and said that the United States had caused the rail events.
"After the 9/11, I submitted a letter to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem will be found through violence.
I know that his motives were good, but he used strength, and it took unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
In the past four years, the elimination of handling substances of children has increased into neon-linking.
In other parts of the United States, the toxicization data has reported nearly 400% of the increase in alcoholic manipulation substances after children under 12 years of age, reports Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, the director of Georgia drought information, reported to the infectious data of desinfying substances under 12 years of age, increased from 3266 cases in 2014 to 16117 cases.
"Kinds are interested in these products more often and slowly certain percentage of them are to be a copy of ability", reported the CNN.
He said that some children drink the desinfying substance with a purpose when others want to make a reaction to their friends or to respond to the challenge in social media.
YouTube has videos where tein-years drink desinfying substances to get a pleasant increase.
According to reports, desinfying substances have been desinfected to alcoholic sugar to get more stronger drink.
The desinfying products of desinfying substances may affect younger children.
"The child doesn't think it's bad to him," said Lopez.
Many of the most interesting (charse) are those that have been added.
There are substances of desinfectation for manic, wine and vocabulary product, which are very attractive to children.
The desinfiation substance may contain alcohol from any 45 to 95 per cent.
Especially small children need only a few drunkens for alcohol injury.
"It's a very intensive alcohol," Mr Stephen Thornton, director of the University of Kansas Medical Medical Information Medical Information Administration Office, reported to Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So you wouldn't leave the viscoshot to spend on the table, but the hand-infection substance will be abandoned and if children are interested in it, it's a quick way to drink much of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six-year-old girl, who just a few years ago shooted four skins of desinfying substances in the school, and was brought him to the first tree.
His blood alcohol was .179, which is two times higher than adult rats, reports primary polyclinic doctor Chris Ritchey, who handled the girl in the Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was talking to her, and he couldn't walk when he arrived in the first tree.
The doctors followed him the night in a different hospital of children with potential brain diseases, as alcohol was cut off and shoot her head, Ritchey reported.
"It was really horrible," Ortoria Scott said to CNN.
You might have killed my kid.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use alcoholic products or desinfiation requests and transfer from the desinfying substance from children.
In addition to alcohol drugs, some desinfects have been combined with deaths.
In 2013, two emerging women died with a desinfying substance containing an unreported substance.
Health authorities understood that the product contains methane, murdering substance, nor ethyl alcohol that was reported as an active substance.
In January, in the northern part of the New York State, three four-class classs planned to be shocked by proclaiming bacteria drugs in the classroom, the police reports.
The teacher is very allergic in the hand of the desinfiation substance, and it was a tongue with its nature.
The police must prevent the plan as a "comfortable smuggling" and leave the ruling action towards schools.

Why I am witnessing in Oklaho
If no legal income will be occurred, I'll see today when a man is engaged.
If that happens, and I hope not, I sit down in the Oklahoma State Pentintiary press at the time that Richard Glossip is slaughtered in the murdering shoes.
She has asked me to be one of the four official Witnesses of his death.
In January I replied the request by means of his best friend, and even though I was confused, I agreed.
I've started to smell this day.
So why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the death penalty all the story.
It would offer a unique view.
The employees have the possibility of monitoring distortions in the United States, and because the applications are often more than free places, the participants are selected through a tragic value.
Oklahoma has reduced the places covered for the media for the twenty-five reference.
Whoever's ever chosen is looking at the event in a while.
I can't do that.
I'm going to sit near the nearest friends of Richard Glossip, and I have also created him my own contact during my months and through a two- and midst visit.
I like a man.
We're often angry when we're talking about it.
The prison authorities say that I can't be both a witness and a supplier, so I must not have the memory book and a cry to save my view.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
One Western supplier accused of my independence on Twitter.
There's a teaching.
Tell the prison story that she wants to do so, so you're going to participate.
I chose to the supplier.
He agreed that "I could have made it better for you," but it still agrees that what I do is wrong.
Richard Glossip has been different with some of my words and the things I wrote.
He doesn't tell me what I should write, and I wouldn't do so even if he'd say.
I told her that he could just remove me from the witness list.
But he wants that there is an international provider who writes about this.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity helps the opposite direction of death penalty.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware is near me.
If you want to know more about the conversation, you can listen to my series of podcast expenses.
I'm not going through all the details again.
I can't make sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
After the murder of Barry Van Treese, he would have done a guilty for all the case.
But I think it's a very strong chance of not being accused of murder.
I certainly believe that there was no sufficient proof for death penalty.
I think it's wrong.
And so this is the look I'm looking at him to die.
I can't say I'm completely indefensive.
There will be other providers who are concerned about it.
I'm gonna be able to see what you feel when a man I love is going to die without need.
The man was shocked away from the Canning River after a smooth police team.
Canning Vale's officer remained shocked when he shocked a man out of the Canning River.
From Perth's home, a man's company was shocking the police's appeal to go into the shooting when he found himself from the shooting water, only in the metros of the police that tried to "shoot him slowly back to the beach".
The Canning Vale police was called to Beckenham for an unlawful detention.
When they found a doubt, they tried to shoot them through the Canning River.
But he didn't get too long.
"He was standing in the water, saying, "I'm not going to go, get me." Says the older superstar Shandell Castledine.
The officer Lachlan Perhavec did not want to grow up his dream, so he used more safeer tactics: "I think about the police negotiations."
"Something people do a lot of trouble when trying to escape," said the parent superstar Castledine.
Major pattern Ben Cousins is an example of mental pressure.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid infringement and tried to take Swan River joe over.
He didn't have been successful in the company, but inspired locally to start playing Ben Cousins - Biothlon's design.
Peter Moody claims that the officials are trying to steady him and threaten to stop competitiveness
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victoria's employees have tried to solve his stability on his stories last year, and threatens to stop competitively.
He accused of the officials and Racing Victoria's donor insurance by claiming that they have a personal campaign to start with him. In the middle week, the delay of Lady Tatha's late delay because of the treatment measures made on Sunday was the last one.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is the best competition, and that he has become a difficult situation in the unexpected positive cobaltment of the Lydar.
He has been talking about stakeholders for a half years, and he didn't want to say "that would look like a disappearance."
"I didn't have to say anything, and I've been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes it's so disappointed that all of them are slaughtered again," Moody said.
They knew that the situation continued.
Sometimes it must only react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I have said.
I'll go home tonight and I'll sleep well.
I want to spend my head in the power and I want the owners to think I'm doing my best before them.
When they start thinking about another thing, I don't have to continue as a trainer.
Then I should take care of what I do to my license.
Before Moody hit the bomb in the Racing.com website in which he told you that the Unschentable Division had tried to switch his shore.
"Third years ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sit in the room with a man, I'm named him as a question, and they offered him to work in my store if he's talking about what I'm doing there.
It's clear that they're looking for me as an hour.
If that's so, it's true that they're going to be able to separate their lawyer, because they've failed to get me.
Robert Roulston, Racing Victoria's former President, David Moodie, the current president of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, the current director of the Victoria, were all of this, and are now discovering it.
Should I start thinking that this is about personality?
Have Victoria Racing finally decided to be a man and may be able to move responsibilities to others other than trainers about what happens in the field?
I'm in the field?
I'm so angry in the field?
Maybe people think so.
Maybe they have to take my licence and work me on discrimination, and I don't doubt if the matter that I say is possible to think about it right now.
But now I'm on that point, I'm not worried anymore, and it's swearing me.
It really hurts me.
I regret them to make a decision which is responsible for them.
I have a family support, and I can turn my way to this.
The deterioration of the trainer has grown in the late long-term cobalt study of Lidar, and the late abandonation was to state that it could "have a license over the table".
Moody, who is known for the training of Black Caviar, has called on the rules on the treatment of the Tuesday, to be "exercising" after the feet of swimming or swimming smells of horses, which is unregular.
"It is against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility of it," he said.
One of my employees made a mistake to change his feet.
That could have been a sweet last night.
That could have been it last night, like it was.
It was on the breakfast.
Moody may have a prohibition of competitiveness for three months because of the treatment of skin day, which the employees started the study.
It's ridiculous.
People who put these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We all understand that the rules are needed, but this has been too long." Moody said.
An accused driver in Cobram
The police's arrested a man who was accused of being slaughtered by his driver at the end of the weekend in Cobram.
Travellers were carried into the Royal Melbourne Hospital Hospital, when the car slaughter slaughtered to him on the Morray Valley on Saturday afternoon.
The police said that the driver had gone, and he wasn't stopped to help the fertilized driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia was announced to the police in Shepparton.
It will be accused of stopping the accident, the distortion of the aid and other transport vehicles.
The trainer, a 40-year-old man Cobramis, is still in the hospital and his situation is stable.
Melbourne Storm trainer Craig Bellamy attacks competitors in presses
Melbourne Storm, trainer Craig Bellamy, has criticized two NRL-rubbyligan mastersuthers that his teams would be part of the "interruption".
Sydney Roosters' trainer Trent Robinson said the "print" of separate maiden Storm on his own side when it surprisingly wins the final castle in Sydney on Wednesday evening.
Brisbane Broncos Manufacturer Wayne Bennett was shocked with a shooting reference to Stormi after winning North Queensland Cowboys on the finish castle. Bennett called the game as a "view window" and said that two teams of Queensland weren't "sweet excited".
Bellamy defended his teams and said they just focused on the "contacts".
Bellamy adds that his confidence adds two trainers to Storm, because it means that they fear the loss of their team.
"This will always be a conversation... I didn't hear Trent Robinson's pressure when we lost 24-2," Bellamy said in the middle week.
I can see that we haven't changed anything in our defence systems or in our technology all year, and in the last six weeks we've just pushed up contacts, and it has made us successful.
Trent has been in the team three years, and she seems to have a magnificent team to prepare, so he's probably not able to lose, and this has a little reason for him.
Hassan how this will always be talking about this year.
Bellamy deceived the thought of Bennett "smiling rumby" by recalling his master that Bennett's trainer St George Illawarra Dragons wins the mastership in 2010 by playing "sweetly."
Wayne's talking about a shocking rushby.
He was important to compare the game on Tuesday night on our breakfast night and telling how smiling their game was, "Bellamy said.
I remember 2010 how St. George was criticized often by the fact that it is a stupid team, and Wayne said that it could not be less interested.
But now he has a team that is able to play a swimming ruby, especially when he has fast young friends.
You want to play such a game when you have that type player.
He took it in the middle of 2010, now he wants to play everybody in his sweet snake - not who's at the team friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt, so that he can play so.
I'll be more reliable when they say such things because they're a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think we were opposed to the most important games.
Bellamy also noted that the game between Storm and Roostersi was more puzzle than played between Broncos and Cowboys.
Broncos game was certainly good game, I didn't have seen it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
We had 20-18 games, so we had two more lands, but is it a weird ruby?
Or does it deceive the defence line and leave the land?
This is about lines for me.
If they mention us, it means we can play against them.
Stomer has a free for this weekend, because they have already winned home games at North Queensland Cowbosse or Cronella Sharks's pre-finishment at AAMI Park on Tuesday afternoon.
Serbian $20,000 for drug reasons
A man who is threatening the possibility of living in Queensland from the 40 cocaine kidnapper undertaking, has been released against $200,000.
Marko Macsimvic, a 29-year-old man, was one of the five men who was arrested last month after the police of the Alliance had posted 100 pounds of drugs to Solay-Jard, which came through South America through Vanuatu, and worked in August.
Maksimov was seen to see others who were accused of the whole morning, and then he met them in Coomera Roadhouse coffee where the police found 40 pounds of drugs from the Toyota Echo car.
Although Macsmovicia threatens the potential life-based business of the amount of cocaine management company, his lawyer claimed that there is no evidence that Maximov tried to keep the entire amount in its control, and that he could be fully in the coffee because it was not free.
The Supreme Judge Peter Flanagan was worried about trying to run.
"He has strict contacts to Serbia.
He's traveling to Serbia often," he told the court for a half week.
In the case of the Criminal Court of Justice, Maximov lied to the police from the place where he lived.
Massimovic’s mother and father’s parents together offered $2000,000 to ensure his release.
"The lighting certificates of both persons is clear that the setting of $20,000 is a real economic race to them", said judge Flanagan.
But it wasn't enough to stop him unexpectedly before the court, he warned.
Maksimov was granted to the police daily and maintained its foreign transmission ban between Australia and Serbian.
Stevan Hogg used a girl's phone to touch pedofils to send pictures
Pedofil used a 11-year-old girl by requesting images for children's benefit.
Stevan Hogg took a girl in bed with this phone and then registered into the network message service where Hogg received several photos of the children who sent him another user.
The girl wakeed up later, noted that the phone was lost and found it on the hand of Hoggi's sleeping.
The girl investigated his phone, and found measuring messages after she immediately told his mother about it.
When the police came to see five pictures, investigated the computers on the place, and found "required" network applications for applications that were used to search for images of untrained swimming children.
Then Hogg said to the police that he had done this "to shoot pedofils" on the Internet before he "remember he would be the police to fear them."
Mrs Eilidh Robertson reported to the Dundeen Sheriff Court of Justice: "He said that there is an advisory, that he is depending on the fear of people.
He agreed that he had performed the top computer but said that they had only been done because he wanted to do his police so that he could smell pedophiles.
He was asked about the discussions with an unknown person who sent his pictures, and when Hogg asked the person to send additional pictures.
Hogg said he only did this in the food shop.
He said he'd have to get sick, and he wants to look at the pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added: "When the girl found the pictures of his phone, she shouted his mother, your treasure and smile.
Mom saw the shockless pictures on the phone and then faced the accused.
She was discussed, and she told me that he was accused of using computers and Playstation to speak to her girls who showed him more young.
Ward Road in Dunde, a 23-year-old Hogg acknowledged the accused of preparing or taking images of unlawful children on June 14. He disbelieved on 25 January this year and left the Court of Justice on 24 March this year.
The politician Gregor Sim asked that Hoggia would not mean sex-related registers, since it could be claimed that his crime was not “the important sexual elements”.
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal has sentenced in October so that the social office has time to prepare background reports.
It was granted to Hoggi in this case, but in other cases it has been arrested before the process was processed.
He was added to sexual offences before the date of sentence.
Zimbabwen Robert Mugabe took a false talk to Parliament
Mugabe’s older leader in Africa has fallen before the doors of the talking period this year.
He wasn't hurt, but the video described on the fall has spread the virus in social media.
I also have opened the parliamentary view of the arguments of the lawyers that they had been sent to unsigned death situations in which they were warned to rebuild Mugabe during his speech.
In the past months, they burned and stopped him in interviews when he maintained the conversation on the state of the country to Parliament - which speech he repeated.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) supervisor of the Group Force Innocent Gone said in its seven opposite policy telephones, text messages that were warned to them about the angry of Mugabe.
"Numero, from which the message was sent, is not answered, but the title of the message is dead", said Gones to the suppliers after the conversation of Mugabe.
The reports were warned by the Members concerned that the unfairness ends to Parliament and when they are out, Parliament's unfairness is not possible.
The supervisory of the group said that the party, leading to Morgan Tsvangirai, is "in care" of the threats against its policies.
Hewlett-Packard reduces even 30 000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard has been expected to operate 25 000-30 000 jobs in its reorganization and consumption in business services.
After this year, HP will be distributed to two post-listed enterprises, separated by the more rapidly increased enterprises and services of their computer and output transactions.
The expected job operations are at least 2.7 billion dollars costs from the fourth quarter, as stated in the HP information.
"This restructuring measures will enable the new more competitive and sustainable consumption structure to Hewlett Packard Enterprise", said Meg Whitman, President of HP and Director of Agency, which leads to the unit after the post.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than the current HP, and we'll have a wide and deeply selected service that helps firms to move into the new business", Whitman said.
As a particular company, our possibility to respond to the needs developed by our customers worldwide is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be more than 50 billion dollars annual business, and it is "decisive to produce integration of technological firms without comparisons" to companies, in the information of the company.
The company, whose company had been prepared from Stanford University University and Dave Packard in the 1930s to prepare electrical requirements.
HP has been used through a huge reorganization to investigate the transition of traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is a second larger computer manufacturer in the world and one of the major technological companies in the United States, and its distribution is the last sector based on the faith that strictly limited enterprises will be better implemented.
Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says that team friends have to support the fertilized Jack Wilshere before the dinamo Zagreb game.
Wenger has also stressed the Wilshir that now is just September and that he's planning according to the plans, there's no reason why he wouldn't be up to Christmas to play again.
In this best case, at least four of the next English games of Wilshir, and when considering his background, it is uncertain if he participates in European masterships.
The greatest regret of this last problem is that Wilsher's last few years had been stronger after the individual sweet, and he remembered the old skin before the beginning of the years.
"It doesn't threaten urge," Wenger said.
It's a crew that didn't have been improved with honor.
It's nothing strange.
This was just an accident.
It doesn't connect to his necks, or any more weaknesses that he had.
This may take place from the medical view, but, as well as Wenger, the attempt to play through the way to return is always the risk of the worst.
It also has an inadequate model in the modalisation.
First Injuries Ltd’s research shows that Wilsher had 23 different weaknesses after he debited six years ago.
In addition, in the past five years, he has played 157 band games only in 65 games.
In view of the increased totality of Arsenal since 2007-08, the sixth period of the eighth of the Valoliigan teams that have lost the most days because of violence.
Wenger admits the possibility of wednesdays, but Arsenal believes that the past few years of their improvement continues.
"If you're returning from the worst may be a long time when you have to strengthen the body and purchase competition," Wenger said.
Jack's enough young enough to get over it.
I hope that his body is stable, I'm sure it's going to be, and that he's got to be done as a torch.
Wenger is preparing to run his team when Arsenal starts the game of the Mediterranean liga in the mid-week against Dinamo Zagrebia I played after Sunday after Chelsea and the next half-week to Totenham Hotspuria.
Hector Bellerin and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Matthieu Debooky and Arta are probably at the start.
Wenger can also set Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud Aftero Monreal and Theo Walcotti.
"I'm trying to keep up the balance and to give it breath to the skilled players," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is the clear F-lok continued, the Maximir Station in Zagreb is the most fearful European station.
Dinamo also has not lost 41 battles after they produced their own "unexpected" campaign in the past few years.
The stadium was shocked at a shock of the earthquake, which was forced at 3.2 Richter's stage.
It was ten in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has been learning about the dedication of the Messiah in the past few years against Monaco, and he has reasoned to lead the team to the winning of its first European cup.
"This motivation is great," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved it.
We were very close to 2006, but, on the other hand, we were realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not the snakes.
FriendsFest: Comedia series that taught us serious things about friendship between men
It is so slightly how similar descriptions aren't in series, especially when considering the need for men to open the need to be worse than ever, and the numbers of young men’s self-assault by higher than for a referred year.
In 2013 the suicide was the largest death cause in men from 20 to 45 years of age in Britain, and it is three times more common than women.
In the company's problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) reported the men in 2015. The goal was to deal with culture that prevent men from searching for help if necessary.
A friendship is at the point of face of this challenge.
In this study, more than 2000 students of high school and classic students were referred to in lessons, and a study states that the person is able to double the chance, if sufficiently higher percentage of his friends were "healthly minded".
Similarly, those who were not deceived, the probability of provening potential mental health problems faced severely if they had healthy friends.
But so that friendship can work, it must first be available.
In this social media, the style ends into content, and the interface of the answer is often more important than the significant contact.
Our digital life has doubled the need to affect strong, happy and successfully, although in reality the diversity is dominated.
The values that psychologists call for outside: money, image, social status. All this happens in internal values - the personal growth and friendship costs that affect our mental health more.
And as a billion video player explained very much, the money really does not get greater happiness.
The greatness of Francis was just that it was translated on the top of this focus.
Their work was not defined, but, above all, their personality, which clearly differed as friends in the circle.
Joy and Chandler’s several strikes, slightly watched football in those moments, Ross, the age of Rachela, came to know that yes, men may be similar to this whole, although they often suspected to study their feelings completely.
As the volunteer of the Samaritans Organization explained to me: "In my listening people who are depressed and self-enforced, I really understood how small the shift effects with a friend can improve the situation."
Many of us are experienced in a way that they can't talk to friends.
The old thinking of "speaking out" is strong, as well as the feeling that if it opens the problem, we will see as weak.
Frendit is one of the series that will be in mind when I try to provide more long-term survival frameworks.
That highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
Although I am an unfair, external position on the other side of the phone helps people at the moment of disappointment, long-term support will be closed, from the personal family and friends’ network.
And so if you participate in the Comdy Central FriendsFest in this weekend, and all the descriptions have been planned again for the celebration, why don't you bring your friends to coffee in Central France?
Or what's better if you see somebody in Starbucks?
You can't never know how much your friendship can be.
Frendits will be sent to Comdy at the end of the center, all 236 parts, participate in #FriendsFest
Di Maria makes it swallow and helps PSG to heat on the Malmwo page
Angel Di Maria celebrated Blaise Matud and Edinson Cavan against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria made the ligate of the Master's ligature by helping the Swedish teams in Malmay.
Under the fight report and the reactions on the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain began a liga game at the end of the 2-0 vote against Malmö in the park of the Princess.
In the debyte of the Master’s liga, in the late four minutes of the matrix showing the way to the French liga Mediterraneans, but the team stripped a number of opportunities before finally adding its fronts to Cavan’s attack in the 61th minute.
Paris, which was at the same time with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish ligamester, because the game was not only a subsequent place, but also improvement in their fourth final game in the last three circuits
But even though the PSG was shocked, there was no classic game in this case, because the Laurent Blanc team Zlatan Ibrahimovic was shocked in front of the land and then changed from the field.
"It isn't easy to win home or visit, so 2-0 to make problems to the opposer and seem good in statistics, and it's a good start, even if we have things that we're going to do this time", said White.
This was good.
We wanted to win and win, even though we were not able to make one or two more lands.
Ibrahimovic returned back to the couple team together with three changes after the 2-2-th game in Liga 1: on weekend of Bordeaux, but he left the Di Maria's guard in four minutes.
When he moved from Manchester from the United States in the past month, a argentian slaughter was named a man to the new level of PSG in Europe, and he proved why to drink Marco Verratt's food after the Defence Leader of Malma and then shocked the beautiful last of Johan Wiland down the network.
But if someone was waiting for PSG's easier and great winning, he was going to be disappointed.
The Malmoo was a nine international player and a Visual Defense and two players in a deep central.
But the team did not offer any other attack than Nikola Djurdjic's 34-minute shooting, which went through the shooter of Kevin Trappi.
Instead, the PSG came between the slaughtered food and the bad ends, especially from Ibrahimovic, which had failed in all five enterprises only to be the first side and after that Cavani put the ball into the counterparty of Ibrahimovic immediately on the beginning of the second half.
However, he was much more effective when he was making a presentation to his colleagues, and just about Ibrahimovic’s food Di Maria sent a round pocket to the journey that shocked the Wiland landscape around 52 minutes.
At the end of an hour, the second was reached by the Uruguayn Cavan’s sixth country after Ibrahimovic had seen before Maxwell’s crossing left.
The hopes of Malm’s back to the game, and only Wiland's magnificent fighting from the right shooting David Luis had the final numbers down before the changing of Ezequiel Lavez was abandoned in the entire end of the game.
The trainer Age Hareide later welcomed that the PSG was the same level as his team. Norwegian said, "The last time we played the Meeting liga was in December last year."
Then, we just played the Swedish ligature, which is not the same level.
It's not enough for warning negotiations.
Nostan's got to Paris.
This was a great game to them.
Glencore collects 2.5 billion dollars for sales of pieces
In Switzerland, Glencore, who suffered from the price consumption of baskets, collected a medium-week $2.5 billion by sale of shares in its wide expenditure plan.
Glencore, listed in the London Post, reported that it had sold new parts about 1,6 billion of red to reduce its debt.
The company, who lost 57 per cent of its market value this year, fights with the prices of the raw materials when China's economic expansion is slowly demanding and destroying all markets.
The remark has noted the value of Glencore shares in London in the mid-week trade rates.
The shares increased 2,77% of 131,60% in the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69% higher.

The White House confirms the visit of Xi Jinping to Washington
The President of China Xi Jinping, at the end of the month of the United States, has been confirmed by the White House in the opinion published.
The first official visit of X to Washington takes place on 25 September and is the answer to President Barack Obama last November at the Peking visit, said.
The President of the United States and the President Michelle Obama are organizing the X and this party to the Pen Liyuan tonight after they have held bilateral negotiations.
"President X's visit provides the opportunity to extend cooperation between the United States and China in several common interests in global, regional and bilateral issues, and at the same time it gives President Obama and President X the possibility to discuss structurally on issues with differences", was added.
The visitor who was published first in February, Xin is expected to be exempted in Seattle to meet several US technological leaders before he continues to reach the New York City and the United Nations General Assembly in September.

Matt Damon reduces the difference in the film
Matt Damon took together with Ephie Brown, a African movie filmer, in their center of the distinction that, according to Damon, did not need to be in the back of the sculptures.
The shower experienced in the Greenlight project on Sunday of HBO's Sunday, has stopped Brown's need for various views to highlight what will be towards the extraordinary primary character of the selected manuscript.
"When we talk about the distinction, it takes into account the showers in the film, it is not a series," said Damon.
The shocked Brown reacted uncomfortablely, the comments "Ooh! Wah. OK," as the comments of the Martian shower left to the air.
Other producers Ben Afleck and Farrelly's brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss a series of finalities.
"I want to encourage people to think about any driver then is how they treat Harmony's personal fashion," he said at the beginning.
It's the only dark shoes that her white partner's kicked.
The Dear White People producer requires the right to control the film to the finalists Leo Angelos and Christian Brancaccio; Damon responded clearly that their guideline "this would end to give us something we don't want".
When the debate was sent, social media was expelled by the comments of Damon.
The Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his angry to the film entitlement by writeing: "Matt Damon speaking to the only dark one of the room on and explaining the differences to him is NEW YOU.
After its publication, the television collected more than 5000 retwice and 4000 love.
The comments of Damon are part of the time in which a precise random presentation in the media is at the front of the social debate.
After the white police killed a teenager Michael Brown in 2014, The Black Lives Matter moved into a landwide and invited legislators and authorities to stop coloring people to be discriminated.
In February, the songer Prince refers to the movement of the album candidates to the Grammy payment of the year.
"The albums still have a meaning," he said.
Like the writes and the blacks lives, the albums still have a meaning.
Black Lives Matter's leaders recently published an opinion to respond to the Fox News TV at Elisabeth Hasselbeck's question whether the group should be a group of hate.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love," leaders said.
It was often reported that Damon is together in the group of preachers, producers and media muggles, called by the pope’s visit to discuss the picture of the Catholic Church in the west.
It's doubtless if he accepted the call or already met the pope.
First American Ninja Warrior Master Crossed
Professional players and athletes, Isaac Caldier, became the first sportor who wins the American Ninja Warrior, and was rewarded for a million dollars.
At the end of its seventh time, the competition programme has never been a competitor who would have experienced all the parts of the programme.
In the last series of two men, Caldiero and Camera Geoff Britten, survived to the last circle.
The last mission had a shock of about 23 meters of poverty in 30 seconds.
The British kicked first and tried at the time of the challenges, which allows him to become the first sportor of all times, which tried the four renewing part of the American Ninja Warrior. But Caldiero tried three seconds more faster than his winner.
Caldiero gave the discussion to E!News difficulty after the winning reached and was still shocked about the winning of a million dollars.
"There is this wonderful thinking when I have never known or lived as up to $10,000 in the year," said Isaac to E!! after their payment.
So I can't even imagine what this comes to... the inconsistence is unknown.
The producer, Kent Weed, attended to discuss The Hollywood Reporter's final list and why Britain doesn't receive more money, even though he is the first competitor of all times that has been able to switch the road.
According to the rules, the money goes to the most fastest person.
"If more people get away, the money that has the fastest time," Weed said.
Even though money is a great reward and change in life, he receives great satisfaction.
I don't believe she feels beautiful because of that.
He's just so happy that he's done what he did.
His fans have overcome him.
He's a great guy, and I'm good to my family.
He's his son and his wife's hero.
Geoff said to me, "If someone had to win me, I am happy that it was Isaac."
And I think I would think Isaac would have thought like if this would have been on the other side.
American Ninja Warrior returns to the eighth period of which descriptions will be started in the summer 2016.
