In Kenya and in the region, two men have ended their life of self-assault
One of the embassy has already tried to suicide.
On October 30, about 1-00, in the village of Lugová, on its place of residence, 1947, a man was born with self-assault by order.
It's known that he's already undertaking sozide attempts.
What did a man like this step not known.
On October 31, in 11 to 50, the lives of a 41-year-old man, who lived in Kinezham.
The names of violent death were not found, reports the Kinish Press.
You got a black box in your car?
While the American projects are trying to find money for the repair of the shocking road system, many start to see a decision in a small black box, which is fully equipped with your car.
These devices monitoring each passed car hire and transfering the information to the officials are in the centre of the opposite attempt to modernize the US car financing system taken by Washington and the State.
Normally, an unexpected automobile planning area was unexpectedly generated intensive debates and colonial aliens.
The Liberians joined the environmental groups in the lobstering of the Government ' s right to use small sheets for monitoring the numbers of you traveling miles and, perhaps, even where you are going, and then use this information when collecting tax accounts.
The cheese movement is shocked.
The American Civil Freedom Union is also deeply concerned and has a number of issues of privacy.
Although the conventions can not agree, continue or not, several States are not expected.
They think about how the drivers can go through the next decade to the system on which they pay for every miles of road they walk.
Thousands of cars have already tested these black balls, part of which are the function of satellite shipping.
This is really necessary for our country.
“ This is not the issue we may have the right to choose,” said Hasan Ihret, Executive Director of the Government Association of South California, who prepares plans for the start of monitoring the authorities of the State Mile to travel by each califoric automobilist, until 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
Technology for this is already available.
The need for this is to reduce the absence of funds in the Administrative Fund for the financing of the taxes funded by the United States on cars.
Americans haven't sell so much benzine as ever.
The automobile goes more than a miles [1 kg] per hour.
The federal tax, 18.4 cents per galon, has not been increased for 20 years.
Politicals do not want to increase taxes even to one center at high prices of benzine.
“ The benzine tax is simply impossible,” said Le Manich, a transport policy experts at the Minnesota University.
His State has recently established 500 monitoring devices for testing the wrong payment system.
“ This will be the best alternative in a long - term perspective, ” he said.
It's called the wrong user payment.
It is unexpected that this idea affects urban liberalities, since taxes can change the nature of travel to reduce the slower roads and gas emissions, for example.
Planning bodies in California are emphasized to this system in developing strategies for the achievement of the ambitious objectives of the State to combat global heat.
However, members of the Palestinian Palestinian representatives of Bill Schulster (Republic, Pennsylvania) Chairman of the Chamber, said that he also considered the system as a long-term alternative.
The volunteers of the Reason fund also strive to make the drivers pay for each miles.
“ This is not just a tax that will be in the black dark, ” said Edward Mur, vice-president on political matters Reason.
People pay for their receipt.
This movement is also supported by two former ministers of the United States of Transport, which in 2011 called for conventions to move towards a wrong payment.
The United States Senate has approved a pilot project of $90 million in the past year, which would take part of about $10,000.
However, representative leaders rejected this proposal because of the fears of agricultural lawyers representing elections whose daily lives are often a few miles to get to work or to the city.
Many states and cities, however, are on their own way.
The biggest enthusiasm is shown in the state of Oregon, where 5000 drivers are attracted to the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the state for a mile walk instead of the benzine tax.
The pilot project in Nevad is closed.
He's in New York.
Illinois tries it on a limited basis with the participation of loading cars.
And coalition I-95, which includes the transport departments of 17 East Coast States (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), studys how they will be able to make these changes.
This concept did not receive a general recognition.
In Nevada, where some 50 volunteers cars had recently been covered by these devices, drivers were concerned that the Government could follow each step.
“Abusiveness towards a large brother and such things is a great problem,” said Alauddin Khan, who conducts strategies and effective management in the Nevad State Transport Department.
That wasn't what people wanted.
When testing the full step, the United States Civil Liberty Office in Nevad warned on its website: “They will not be difficult to convert these devices into the widespread machines.”
There is no need to create a huge, technological infrastructure that will be inevitablely expanded to store records on daily movements of individual citizens.
There is one of the several states in which difficult searches for an incursive technologie that would allow state authorities to take into account the cars traveling, but without information about place and time.
If you can do this, Han said, the society will feel more calm.
Search for this technology brought some state agencies to a young company in California, named True Mileage.
The company was not in favour of the State tax collection.
She tried to go to the developing market of car traffic, where drivers were paid on the basis of the switch.
But the device that it tests is attaching road projectors because they do not use GPS and provide a limited number of information that is periodically downloaded by modem.
“They will be more tender to do this if you do not follow their speed and do not monitor their position, ” said Ryan Morrison, Executive Director True Mileage.
There were a number of major errors in some of these pilot programmes.
There are many less costs and less strict ways to do so.
The projects are experiencing with the delivery of various options to drivers.
They can select a device from or without GPS.
Or they can totally disappear from the device, instead of paying a fixed collection based on the average number of miles from all the residents of the state.
In other places, they hope to sell the idea of a warning public, putting the device to do more than less.
In New York, transportation officials are trying to develop a loan device that will also take payment for parking accounts, provide “payments” insurance and collect a pool of speed in the real time mode from other drivers that could be used to avoid switching.
“Automobilists will join the benefits they offer,” says in the graphic projecting document.
Some transport system projects, however, consider whether it is not all wrong payment discussions that are just a huge factor.
In the city transport commission of San Francisco, the officials said that the conventions could be very simple to overcome the banking of the Swedish Road Construction Fund, taking up benzine taxes.
Additional timely or annual tax could be able to spend from hybride cars and other persons whose vehicles do not use a lot of benzine to pay their fair share.
“ There is no need to be a radical surgery when everything you need to do is accepting aspirin,” said Randy Rentshler, director of the Legislation and Public Relations Commission.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their private life and many other things.
EU will prepare measures to support Ukraine in the case of Russia’s economic pressure
The European Union has the reserve plan for Ukraine's gas and, as a result of the agreement with the IIF on extreme credit, if Russia takes any measures in response to the possible signing of the Agreement on Association between the EU and the Ukraine Summit.
The IMF has conducted negotiations on stand-by credit, and the other EU official directly participating in the negotiations has added that their aim was to conclude agreement in the nearest time.
In addition to the potential credit by the UKM, Ukraine can receive 610 million euros from the EU itself.
The analysis requested by Reater doubts that Ukrainian and IWF are able to overcome long-term differences in the financing conditions.
It doesn't believe that reforms needed to receive assistance, and the International Research Agency of Ukrainian Sovereign Railway to one step - to "V" from "W".
However, the representatives of the EU say that IWF could demonstrate flexibility in credit conditions, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the EU ' s financial support plan, there is a reserve option to ensure Ukraine ' s gas, which provides part of the supply now from Russia.
It may be a gas from the Green River or a reverse from Swedish.
Lastly, according to the officials, it is the most possible and acceptable way if Russia is "isolated" of Ukraine.
Analytics believe that such a way of reverse delivery in Ukraine can be used only for a few weeks and may lead to reduced delivery in other regions.
"The countries of the EU and the Ukraine are negotiations on the way to create good conditions to enable Ukraine to import gas from other sources, not from Russia, or from the same source, but on other routes," added Rachel.
Russia outside the fight against the pollution of cars
The attempt to solve the transport problems of large cities was observed in most world megapolis from the second half of the X seventh century.
Normally, the switch has been on their restructuring and expansion, or the attempts to reduce the demand of car rental, number of cars and time of use.
The example of Singapore is well known, where a heavy quantity of the growth of private cars has been introduced, and the right to purchase is purchased in acquisitions.
His price may exceed the price of its auto two-third times.
European cities, including London, have paid payment for the entry into the city centre.
In Germany, such green zones, such as Hamburg and Stuttgarte, are introduced, where the entry is permitted only by vehicles with a certain ecoclass used as a fuel quality (including biopolycarbons or electronics).
The Peking Environment Protection Agency, for example, approved the "fifth Year Air Plan" over 250 billion ($40 billion).
According to the Director of the Municipal Environmental Protection Office, Peenna Li Quinchenng, the main objective of five-year-old air pollutants, reduced by 20 to 35 per cent to 2017, increased numbers of private cars to the level of 6 million (that's 5,2 million) and increased by more than 5 per cent of the use of car rentals in one vehicle.
According to the Agency, there is now 22.5 per cent of the global air pollution in Beijing.
In particular, the main steps of the programme are the limitation of the use of car transport, and the introduction of additional taxes for vehicles.
Moreover, the urban " green-five" measures include rapidly compared with the rest country of the fuel stations, the establishment of local cars and marketing systems, the introduction of vehicles in the central part of the city, the prohibition of the use of installed vehicles (e.g. the establishment of the promotional financial programmes for old vehicles to Hybrid or electronic vehicles), the development of electronic transport (including public and services), the public transport development (including high growth).
The number of car rental innovations also includes the prohibition for all private cars to move within the Fifth Rail (all in the KNR ' s capital 6) one day a week (complianced information contains the number of vehicle marks) and the extradition of a lottery registration signs (e.g. 2011, the first year of the lottery, the number of authorisations for private vehicles in Beijing was only third when 2010).
According to the existing Good Environment Safety for 2012-2020, the number of cities with high and very high air pollution must be reduced to 128 (in 2012 were 138).
The Minoproduce reports that in 2011, 41 per cent of the emissions of polluting substances in the urban atmosphere had been the " transfer of sources".
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars are 10 times higher industrial, and in San Petersburgh nine times.
RF is only starting to think about the limitation of cars on the streets of towns.
The Director of the Economic and Transport Policy Institute, WSE Mihail Blinkin, believes that administrative and physical measures aimed at demanding to car renounce, are often unpopular, but they can only be adopted in accordance with their university.
In the case of Moscow, a unique problem related to the structure of its car, where two classes are lowly sensitive to any regulatory effects - service and personnel cars, and the "accepted" users, which are at least 200 000. (e.g. 5 per cent of the total number of Moscow cars).
At the time of the ECOM Center, urbanists in San Petersburgh have prepared a study analyzing the balance of the urban territory between the housing building, the rail area and the number of cars.
The main conclusions of researchers: the city centre is two times less required, and most of the cars in the center are not using cars every day, leaveing them on parking or just on the streets for a long time.
It is therefore proposed to build a park not a park, but to raise the cars, not expand, but to reduce the road (to be more friendly for rents) and to limit the use and location of personal transport in the borders of the historical centre (the common territory of about 3212 g, which covers several central areas of the city).
Strategy for unauthorised legal trade in Wlogde will grow several times
In view of the urban authorities, the increase in the rail size is helping to move in Vlogda and release the streets from natural pallets and lots.
Most commercialists are not paying taxes that they have done, often not to be conducted with the sanitary control.
And that means that health is threatened.
Yes, the lower limit for citizens for unlawful trade with November is six times - from 500 rules to 3000 rules, reports the Office of the Administration.
Goldman Sachs warned the risks for the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned the growing risks for the main driver of Russian consumption.
This is mainly the crisis of uncertain consumer credits and the massive reductions of employees.
Our main concern now is not that growth has been delayed, but that's likely to be the structure of this growth.
Lastly, he was fully consumptioned by the consumption that is almost not enhanced by trafficking,” said the main economist Goldman Sachs on Russia Clemens Grafe, representing the fourth report on Russian economy.
Now the nominal growth in Russia is around 10 per cent.
In inflation by 6 per cent, it is possible to ensure the future consumer demand at the current level, expected at Goldman Sachs.
But Russian companies are retailable, so they may probably take the optimization of staff costs.
Today, we see a significant growth in GDP payments: if payments increased by 10 per cent, the GDP is only 2 per cent, Mr. Grafe explained.
The company was confronted with a reduction in retailability.
If it does not grow, it can lead to disabilities and the growth of unemployed people.
The main economist Barclays Capital for Russia and the SNG Vladimir Pantyshin cannot be able to pay payments.
Employees near historical minimums, high competition for employees.
To move staff from the part or keep the current staff, the employees must be slowened.
The need for support in Russia is living and a very rapid growth in consumption.
Mr. Grafe believes that this type of credit is not due to the extremely high rates of consumer use in the economy.
" We have not seen any uses of the economy from the growth of consumption, the money is not depending on the economy and return to the same banks as the same percentage payment," said the economicist.
But the problem is that Goldman Sachs expects the growth of uncertain credits.
They are in the main of the heavenly people who have nothing to provide.
Ratios for such jobs are high.
As a result, they're not often returning," said Mr. Grafe.
The second threat to the growth of the economy in Russia is the possible crisis of inconsistent credits.
The Director of the Bank Institute of WSE Vasilie Sorocks is now seeing the signs of the bank crisis.
Small credit organizations, without access to deficiencies in the gusbanees, were obliged to allocate the population resources under high per cent.
In response to the guests, wars went and began to reduce credit rates, the economyr continues.
Small credit organizations may not be allocated to the same percentage, otherwise they will have a negative rate.
If the guests aren't dismissed from the defense, Russia threatens the full bank crisis, and trusts the Vasilie Slocks.
A number of bank licenses in the last weeks of the economicist is considered a predict of the mass.
The head of the Institute warns that “the guests of their own situation are not: the tax insurance system has not been initially calculated on the system crisis”.
However, the growth of the consumption is delayed without the crisis, they believe in the investment bank, due to the renewal of the index of guests and military salaries set out in the current version of the budget.
Partial consumption shock will be decreased by natural monopolies (and, as a result, reduced inflation).
But only partly: if investments aren't growing (of preference to do so, see help), the growth of the consumption is still slow, certain in Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantoshin from Barclays Capital is not seeing a presupport for the implementation of pessimist scenarios.
"The main risk is still a decline of oil prices," he says.
According to its assessment, the Russian economy will begin to reduce the cost of oil below $90.
The Goldman Sachs also noted that the CIA had not yet been able to reduce economic rates.
The paradoxical image is observed: inflation has decreased, and the banks began to upload rates.
This may mean that they did not believe the CIA, announcing an inflation targetization,” said Clemens Grafe.
The percentage policy on market rates does not affect only interbank credit rates.
"It's all the hopes for the CB," he estimated Clemens Grafe.
Banks are not used for economic credits, but for the management of their liquidity
Once the rate is decreased, the currency is immediately changed, it means that the means are trying to go to the speculation against the rubber.
"The CB is understood that this strategy does not work", said Mr. Grafe, and recalled that the rule of free payment was planned by the State until the end of 2015.
But it is necessary to do this before or to upload the key rate of the BC (5.5%).
According to his evaluation, the rubber rate is now up to 10 per cent.
I'm driving only one way - weak, expert out.
But if the CIA imposes some shadows of doubt that the elimination of the currency rail is not part of the ruling deficiency policy, it could be much stronger.
The second trail of the peoples of Southern Ural was in Chelabinsk.
The Forum has been joined to the National Unity Day, the 400-year rebuilding of Russian State and the adoption of the Constitution of Russia.
Delegations from all cities and areas, representatives of national and cultural associations, religious conceptions, legislative and executive bodies, were generally complicated by approximately 350 persons.
The Curse forum aims at strengthening international agreement.
We can show the example of not only the other regions but also the other countries.
We don't have differences and differences.
We live in full understanding," says Phoohan, controlled the Chelabian and Zelatousthian.
In the meeting, a number of issues, including the education of patriotics, cultural cooperation.
The results of the seat were adopted by the resolution.
The informal part of the forum continued in the operating theatre and ballet.
There was opened the exhibition of national and cultural associations in the Tyrbian area.
Snowden is ready to “cooperate” with Germany in the case of U.S. expertise
Edward Snowden, the U.S. Discoverer, said he was ready to go to Berlin to give an German Parliament if the United States National Security Agency and his Director of China Alexandre could not respond to his activities.
The German Deputy Hans-Cristian Strewbel, on Friday, met Mr. Snowden in Russia, where he was provided for assurance to discuss his census in Germany.
In a letter from Mr. Snowden, who presented the media in Berlin on Friday, said: “The results of my efforts were clearly positive, my Government continues to deal with an incoherence as a change and is trying to criminalize the political statements of criminal accused that no protection has been given.”
However, the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed that the support of the international community could convince the United States ' s government to reject criminal accusements against him.
The accused of the Ministry of Justice of the United States includes the spy and the ruling of public property.
Hans-Peter Fridrich, Minister of Internal Affairs of Germany, reported Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak with German officials, we will find ways to do this.”
The relationship between the United States and the Germans was stressed after the approval that ANB had heard the phone of the Officer Angela Merckel.
Thomas Opperman, a deputy in the parliamentary group who was smoking, said that if there is a possibility to hear Mr. Snowson as a witness, “no matter of danger and no destructive relationship with the United States”, it should be used.
Mr. Streebel, a parliamentary from the Green German Party, published his photo with Mr. Snowden in his Twitter.
During the visit, two German journalists were sent to Russia.
Mr. Streebel said that Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia, according to the lawyer of the former ANB.
If Mr. Snowden had shown in Germany, he would need to ensure that he would be “in security”, said the deputy.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he was confronted with the “theft and constant” campaign of persecution that tried him to leave his house.
However, he said he was encouraged by the world's reaction to “the political expressions”.
Citizens throughout the world and high-speaked officials, including in the United States, believed that the deployment of a comprehensive system of comprehensive control is useful for society.
The letter contains a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities, “forever the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be resolved.”
Frontier Airlines will spend the payment for the handle
The Frontier Airlines plans to take off the passengers to $100 for they're taking a handle board on their board.
Frontier Airlines plans to get up to $100 for a handle and $2 for coffee or gas, although their statement in the middle stated that passengers would be able to leave the whole bank.
The new payment is distributed in the top bag residues, so small tubes situated under the seat remain free.
Frontier said that it would be $25 if the collection was paid before, and $100 if the travellers would be paid only when they were in charge.
The representative of Frontier Kate O'Melly said that the $100 payment should make passengers care for the payment.
“ We don’t want to get the payment for that, ” she said.
The Abia Corporation began to pay for the first and second payment in the bag in 2008.
The passengers who try to avoid these collections kill as much as they can, in the hands placed on the top of the bag residues, because they are often missing.
Congregations are one of the ways to put passengers less on board.
O'Melly said that this new collection wasn't actually for money.
The case is that the most faithful clients of Frontier claim that the location in the top bag retreats is increasingly difficult.
The passengers who buy tickets on the airline should not be paid.
This means that one passenger in the frontier trip may have a chance to pay a taxi free, while the next passenger may pay $100 for the same tax.
O'Melly said that the change of the website procedures and the Frontier registers intended to ensure that passengers will know about the collection before they go to the seat.
The new collection of Frontier on the handle will not begin to start up to the summer, although the date is not yet established.
The passengers are often complained of payment for bags and other collections, but the aircrafts love them.
They claim that the loan processing has money, and passengers who need this service must pay for it.
Many of the Wall Street consider the addition of bag collections to know that airlines have enough money to cover aircraft costs after a few years of loss.
However, most of them did not relate to meetings for handling.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first collection for a handle three years ago, and another talker, Allegiant Air, later followed her example.
The only other aircraft company with such a collection is the venerian Wizz Air, said a aircraft adviser to Jay Sorensen, which is carefully monitoring additional collections.
According to his evaluation in the report of December 2011, the collection of the handle provides $50 million per year.
Sorensen, an ex-manager, Midwest Airlines, recently flyed by Spirit, and was interested in finding the seat out when passengers were packed with an uncomfortable Spirit assembly.
“The pool was the worst of what I saw for my carriage in airlines,” he said.
I've been waiting to see the dentist and the dragon in the shipping.
Samolet was a pool, and he said, “and the floor was sweet. ”
The frontier should also be paid for the $2 for coffee, tea, gas or sock.
Frontier said that passengers receiving gas or sock may leave the whole bank and that the amount of coffee would be provided free.
She'll still be free of water.
US Airways had long tried to take the drink payment in 2008, but seven months later, after passengers began to complain and no other large aircraft had followed its example.
The initiative of Frontier on payment for a handle when passengers do not buy tickets directly to the aircraft, it is her last measure to administer customers on their website.
Aria company pays online sales tickets, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each sale ticket.
This helped all aircrafts to encourage passengers to purchase tickets directly in them, not to go to the tourist online agency.
However, Frontier continued all in this area.
In September, she began to give twice less than a bonus miles to a flight passenger who purchased tickets through the online tourism agency.
In the midst, it was 25 per cent of the trip.
Yeah, a trip a 1000 miles from Frontier, acquired in the online tourism agency, would be allowed to get 250 miles away.
On the other hand, passengers may be selected if they buy tickets directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has the base of faithful customers in her family town in Denver, but its business is reduced and lost.
The expenditure was decreased to 9 per cent, and the summer opportunities were almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to the financial results published in the Mediterranean Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic is trying to correct the financing of Frontier in the sector of the sale of aviation.
ANB is injury to the internal error, not the hackers in the end of the website
The Occupied Secret Agency of National Security stated on Thursday night that the stop of their website has been made for a few hours, not the hackers, as the network stated.
“NSA.gov was not incompatible during a few hours tonight because of the internal error that occurred during the planning update” reported the informed Agency in an official electronic letter.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Declaration that the transmission of the work has been issued as a distributed type of “service” attack [DDOS] is invalid.
Last night, the server monitoring system registered that the ANB site had not worked at least six hours, and the website is still not available for some users.
The previous representative of ANB reported ABC News that the internal secret network of the non-related Agency was disrupted.
No secret information is in danger, reported to the representative.
At least one online hacker-active group stated that it was responsible for the conclusion of the ANB site using DDOS attacks.
DDOS attacks are developed so that the target website is shut up until the servers are not reloaded and the site is not out of the building.
The hacker tactics are relatively simple, and the attacks are not designed to detect the internal system.
The previous super-secretary ANB, which was ever received by the “No Agency”, was in the centre of public attention and a bad criticism after the explanation of its broad-speed programs in the land, all of the reactions to secret files slaughtered by the ANB and published by the former Edward Snowden.
The growing field around the Agency pointed out that today the incident was the result of hacker targeted action.
Bombardier's profit is decreased with the fall of the delivery and the number of aircraft orders
Bombardier, Canadian flight manufacturer and train company, reported on the reducing of income of 15 per cent under the decreased number of orders and aircraft supply in the third quarry and contract problems in its liquid unit.
The Bombardier company also has not published any data on the annual tests of its new CSeries aircraft in Montreal and provided new information on whether aviation plans would be implemented in the commercial exploitation of its new CSeries, September.
After the first flight of an experienced aircraft that was about half months ago, he flyed only three times that caused questions about whether a graphic test stage is.
The results did not justify forecasts and brought actions to fall by more than 8 per cent to the Toronto Fund.
Cameron Doerxen, an analysis of the National Financial Bank, slowed its evaluation from the “Mediterranean” to the “medior market” because of the conviction that the growth of actions is limited to the nearest quarter or two.
“The decrease of aircraft delivery was generally predicted, we are, of course, disappointed by transportation indicators,” said Doerxen in the review of the fund market.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders to CSeries on the continuation of the annual test programme.
However, if the new orders are not announced in the next months, we suggest that the market will be more skeptically addressed to the programme.
Bombardier's company hopes that the family of CSeries flights allows her to sell place in the lower price segment of the market where Boeing and Airbus are now dominated.
The first experienced aircraft was presented in March, and first flight was made in September after a few months of delay.
However, firm orders for CSeries are not too much until 177, as potential purchasers are waiting for annual test results to verify the approval of the fuel effectiveness company and the potential economy of the new ray.
There are now 403 orders and agreements with 15 customers and operators.
The Chief Executive Director Peter Boduan was convinced that Bombardier would reach its goal at 300 fixed orders at the time the first flight was launched in the commercial exploitation.
In the fourth meeting, the leaders also assured analysts and media that the programme was forwarded to the plan.
“ The tenth flight model remained more than was expected on the ground, ” said Bodohan during the telephone conference, adding that a simple aircraft was planned at the time of a simple aircraft test and the update of the software security.
All producers are planning to test differently.
We decided to take the first flight and break up the update, so we did.
This will happen throughout the annual test programme.
The second of the five tests must be made a flight in the nearest weeks, and all the other will soon follow it as the company reported.
However, skeptical analysis relate to the declaration that the first customer can begin to exploitation of CSeries flights within 12 months after his first fleet.
The Bombardier company stated that it would evaluate the period of exploitation and provide new information within the next few months.
“ This is the lengest time of years tests, all of the visibility, and corresponds to the internal Bombardier graph - supports our point of view that the entry into the exploitation will be transferred to the first quarter of 2015,” said Doerxen.
In the third quarter, on 30 September, the purity of Bombardier ' s income reduced to $147 million or $8,172 million, or 9 percent for action in the past year.
The corrected income of action remained at 9 targets.
The total income was decreased, from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
Analytics expected to be achieved by $4.56 billion and $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth world’s aircraft manufacturer reported that he had set 45 aircrafts for quarters that less than in the previous year - 57.
The total number of orders decreased from 83 to 26 flights.
The port of the Airspace Division orders was $32.9 billion at September 30, not changed since 31 December.
“The results in the aviation sector were in line with our goals, but small numbers of orders and general market conditions became a factor of inadequacy,” said Boduan.
The voluntary income in the airspace was 13 per cent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the largest travel producer in the world, reported that the currency income in this sector was almost 11 per cent to $2.1 billion.
The portal of orders in the transport unit was $32.6 billion for September 30, which was a little above the indicator of 31 December.
The income of the transport unit was negatively addressed to a number of major contracts.
The Directorate stated that the fourth Quartal would submit a new development plan.
Bombardier company, who also declared that the main financial director of Google Patrick Pittat will enter the Directors' Board, was 8.5 per cent to $4.83 in the mid-fourth market.
The Brazilian Emmbraer SA company, a third world-wide commercial manufacturer and the nearest Bombardier competitor, reported on the reduction of the quarter income on 10 per cent.
Sony calculates a lower year income
The Japanese electronic manufacturer, Sony, has finished the last quarter of the clean loss of 19.3 billion, or $197 million, reduced the prediction of arrival for the current financial year.
Sony results from July to September 2013 were more enhanced than expected that television, videocameras and personal computers were falling into Japan's company.
Sony’s Television business in the II quarter of the first three-year operational income of 5,2 billion, again in the reporting period slowed to 9,3 billion of operational losses.
The Japanese consumer electricity market suffers difficult times, especially due to decreasing television demand.
While competitors try to find out of a complex situation, Sony continues to concentrate on the consumer segment.
For example, one of the main partners of Sony, Panasonic, has recently increased focuss on industrial complexs: the sales of the company will grow by high levels, especially through car systems and environmentally clean technologies.
As a result of the end of the financial year, which will be concluded in March 2014, Sony has obtained 179 billion an operational arrival against the previously expected 230 billion yen.
According to the Thomson Reuters Agency, analysis suggested that the data would be significantly higher and up to 221 billion yen.
Sony's trying to get out of the crisis, it expands the product line.
In the midst of this month, the start of sales of "smart-times" from the Japanese corporation was announced that a number of model functions could be removed from the need for 100 times a day to deliver from the Smartphone Carman.

Hen has been the stimulator of the symptoms education
Scientists from the University of John Hopkins and the Medical School of Maunt-Sinae have found whites, through which Foxp2 works, stimulating the education of new relationships between neurons.
The study is published in Science, and you can read its short contents on the site of the magazine.
Hen Foxp2 is the first known gene whose function is directly linked to the speaking.
Its role was made in 2001 through the discovery of the family from several people who couldn't correctly make words and sometimes have not yet understanded each other.
The scientists found that the work of the family Foxp2 had been violated, but how he performed its function was not known.
In a new study, biology showed that at least part of their Foxp2 functions were the stimulator of new symptoms in the brain-related forming.
It works that by another gene, SRPX2.
The past has been found as a result of searching factors that encourage symptoms education.
SRPX2 was one of the 10 similar genes found by the authors, which only involves Foxp2.
What SRPX2 really affects vaccination, scientists have confirmed the test on the mouse.
When the genital activity was artically decreased, they were less cried at the separation of the mother.
If gene activity was restored, restored, and the frequency of the sounds published.
Previous links were shown on the mouse also to the invasion of Foxp2.
Lifes introduced a human copy of the genes eat more active and lower than normal museums.
However, scientists do not know whether Foxp2's work is related and, respectively, managed by SRPX2 with the "mechanical" properties of sound education or more accurate processes.
The lawyer with cocaine dependence, who assigned the head of a police investigation group, was in prison
The 42-year-old Bashart Kitt provided information on the criminal authority of Nila Scarboro
The lawyer was afraid that his secret dependance would be discovered
It was sentenced to three years of imprisonment by the Royal Court of Liberia.
The prestigious lawyer, who told the drugs about the big police investigation, was in prison for three years.
The 42-year-old Basharat child transmitted the criminal authority of Nila Scarboro a secret information on investigation of his illegal drug trafficking activities after threatening the cocaine dependence.
A lawyer who received a call for Bash and a criminal named “the great lawyer” was arrested in his home in 2011 after the police surgery operation for Scarboro, which he had previously represented in the court related to drugs.
The officers noted that the 32-year-old Scarboro left three packages with cocaine at the lawyer house in the town of Blockberg Lankashi, until he was at the dinner association of lawyers with colleagues.
As a result, the child “regulated” drugs of class A, after tests showed the sequences of cocaine in his hair, on his paper officer and on credit cards.
During the eight months from January to August 2011, he tried to obtain illegal information on arrests of two persons on Scarboro, as well as one of his reporters.
All four suspected were at that time under the supervision of the police under the extensive investigation of the criminal organization on heroin and cocaine in Lankashire, Cambry, Mercyway, Berlin and West New Yorkshire.
They were still 32 persons later in prison after the police had issued a series of heroin raids and cocaine for $1.5 million and more than 200 million.
The 42-year-old child provided information to criminals because of the fear that his cocaine dependence would be opened.
Today, in the Chief Chief, who works in the legal company of Forbes Solicitors in Bleekburn, the Chief of Liberal Court was slaughtered after the recognition of his responsibilities in two cases of impetus to prevent the execution of the trial court in the Court of Liberia.
He acknowledged cocaine at one of the previous judicial meetings.
The judicial department occurred after the police, which investigated Scarboro, explained that he had regularly spoken to the child on the phone from February 2011.
Two detectives were investigated and found how he came to the child's house in Blackburn and placed drugs of 60 per cent cleaning in a black golf for a golf under the smooth judiciary.
Shortly after Scarboro was transferred, the child, who was at the dinner at the football station, Jude Park team Blackbern Robers.
The lawyer returned home for drugs; nine conversations were among them.
The court learned that the child had “regularly used” cocaine, after tests were found in his hair, coffee and credit cards.
The child was later arrested, but he refused the use of cocaine, said he had spoken to the suspected diplom because he was his customer and insisted that their association was a “advocate secret”.
During his detention, the child took his paper and tried to get several credit cards, but all of them were confiscated, and he was also taken a hair.
In the police survey, he said he had a home office, and customers came home to him for legal affairs.
However, after important arrests, the court was known that he called to the larger persons of the illicit trafficking of drugs, some of whom he previously represented in the court to tell them that there were detectives.
Ann Wright said, “If anyone knows that it should not be violated by law, it is a lawyer for criminal affairs”.
Mr. Batteth is accused of abuse by his lawyer on criminal affairs because he has undertaken too close relationship with certain customers.
The contact we're talking isn't just a drug trafficker, but a drug trafficker who enjoys the drugs of his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations are obviously lawful because he was their lawyer.
However, this has been significantly translated by the general relations of the lawyer and the customer.
He prevented the police investigation as strong as possible to allow those persons to continue their criminal activity.
Mr. Dadt didn't shoot her professional, but shocked her.
He was too close to some customers, in particular Scarboro, and enabled to consciousise in his irrelevantness.
The child did not admit the guilt and said, "If I would have been corrupted by a lawyer I am, and I would like to give information to Mr. Scarboro, I would not wait for 15 hours, I would do so immediately."
But after the meeting, the senior officer Le Holstead from the Lankashire police said: “Mr. child has become a criminal lawyer in criminal crime, just as he began to get drugs to the representatives of organized crime.”
His attraction to cocaine was unreasonablely identified and vulnerable for the purposes of the principal criminal group parties who were able to get valuable information on the police investigations.
The lawyers should follow the higher standards of professional ethics and enhance the confidence and confidence of society.
Mr. Bateth has relied this confidence and tried to shut up his professionals.
Survey on the case, Mr. Chief, was the Lankashir Unit of a particularly dangerous organized crime, which has already been sentenced on three cases of cocaine conservation, and now on the prevention of justice, demonstrating our efforts to obtain a fair punishment for criminals.
Let this case be warned for criminals that no one is outside the fulfilment of the law.
We'll find you and join you to the court's responsibility.
Scarboro himself was sentenced for 14 years after the recognition of his guilt in order to provide heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
More 35 persons in maquination were sentenced to 153 years of drug crime.
On his website, the child organized a conversation in the form of questions and answers in which he said his dream work is a lawyer with the death condemnation in America, a perfect company for his dinner — Mohammed Ali, and the motivation in the work is inequality.

Italian workers with a stage are on the road of young people
Italy's unemployed people's recursion.
The media showed that 12.5 per cent of the people of the country was now without work.
This was not the case since the second World War.
Among the young people, this indicator above was several times.
40.4 per cent of people under 15 to 24 years have no employment.
In view of the Italian authorities, one of the solutions to this problem is a long-term pension of old workers.
This experiment has already been the largest energy company of the country, and the legislation adopted allows regional authorities to ensure a part of the sufficient pension for workers with the stage.
On the other hand, Italy expects a common problem for the elderly population in Europe.

In Moscow, the construction of the TSO will lead to
With each year, the capital authorities have promised to control more transportation (TV).
It is planned to introduce 255 MTT until 2020.
What the project is being designed, we found our correspondent.
A few months ago, there was a constructive board in the Smolenian metro.
The letter said that it was the installation of a transportation chain.
It was very strange because there was no land transport around the Smolenian, and there is no movement on it.
In order to reach the nearest tropical stop on the Saddle corner, there is 130 meters of order, including the land transit through the Carmanica Travel.
It's almost all finished now.
A color lare, demonstrated for a newspaper, and the asfalt changed the brown before the entry.
That's the whole vehicle.
Transport and transport skys are slightly and capitalized, and they explain in the press service of the Central Transport Department.
Capital SMEs haven't been.
The park building, trade objects, passenger movement, small architectural forms and well-being.
In general, none of the transporters have been employed, but professional budgets from the Capital Restructuring Department of Moscow.
The transport site is not necessarily complex, explains the director of the Institute for Transport and Transport Policy of Mihail Blinkinn's High Economic School.
Sometimes it is enough to shut over the head and the cards that report the time of the transport.
So, for example, there have recently been an entirely valuable swimming swimming area opened in the metro of Jenevo.
Don't be shocked, but with swimming parks and maps that show when the bus comes.
But in the flight of the number of officials, all of them have been recorded in the TSO.
In 2011, Mary planned to build all 151 stones, with 59 capital buildings.
The plans are now at the time until 2020, up to 255 MTS.
Some of them are promised to make it again in this year.
Although there is a TSO development programme, no quality criteria in the city, Alexander Moroso, co-chairman of the World and Transport Organization.
The number of objects are counted, but the quality of the shipment is often worried.
The criteria of the expert should be two: first is a reduction in the time of transfer, secondly, good.
Before the possibility to change the type of transport, not out of rain.
In Moscow there is a smooth contradiction in the university.
A clear example of the VDNH metro.
The previous reserve buses with the Yaroslavian Shoss arrived in the squeeze of the main entry to the UNHCR.
Their stops have now been moved to the opposite side of Yaroslava on the street of Cosmonat.
More than metro, a significantly further than the monarch, closer to the living houses.
Because the people did not want to shoot the car under the windows and to shoot all possible instances.
In Moscow, Capital SMEs weren't undertaken immediately.
First of them began to build five years ago in the Metro Planner.
The draft was intended to be a scripture.
And it was really received as the transfer of strike to investors was converted into the bath trade center.
No, there's shoes for buses, sweet to go from the rainy, and three stages of the car.
Indeed, the chemical trolley No.202 and No.203 in the Moscow SAT did not have the principle.
They were abroad away from the metro.
There's been more trading places.
Only one of the 32 shops, and there is almost everything from the zoometers to the bus.
Really, who of the car passengers will have to buy a new car on the road?
We have a capital ATs, why it's always being obtained in the commercial center.
The situation recently reached its logical conclusion when part of the automobilists decided to make a market.
Now, the third stage of the "Planer" TIRs between the parking fields are a trading fight.
Protection, speech, Chinese jinns, non-Russian speech and guards, who are badly viewing our photo.
The switch is finally transformed into the basement.
It's the fact that the Metro Planner had a market, but they took it.
And in the prefecture of the traders, they were shocked and left on a swimming park.
It's all right because of high prices there is always empty.
It's the most funny thing that the market was slaughtered because of building it on his place... a new swimming aircraft.
That's a year.
At the Metro Caluja, the approach from the metro to the bus was 50 meters away, says Alexander Moross.
After the construction of the Trade Center, such as TPIs, the distance increased up to 170 meters.
In order to bus, we need to walk through the whole trade center.
After 22 hours, when he closed, he must be walked under an open heaven.

This means, for the parking, 2,6,000 cars in Petrosco-Razzom, the order of 80,000 "quadrides" is required.
It's less than third of the machine that it's going to be built there.
Let the two stages go to every bus perron.
It remains at least 1500,000 kilometers of commercial impairment.
And this is almost two GM.
If the swimming swallowing swallowers in stations and inhospitals, the other areas will be swallowed by the metropolitans.
They also promised that there would be many " functional items" including guests, offices and even sports.
The department of Moscow’s property has recently conducted journalists who have developed a draft decision which allows investors to obtain a share in the TSOs directly.
Without any competition.
Because prayers are that the transport questions for the city are priority.
It's, for example, the Harvard Station in Boston or Scene in Toronto, that is sure that Alexander Moross.
There are trolley and traumas under the ground at the metro level, and the distance of the approach from the vagon meter to the tramp is only 50 meters away from the road.
There is no free trade around.
But the Moscow officials are extreme.
Or we will not build anything, or by 25 stages with offices and apartments.
Esther proposes to compare to the extremism of the distress of the patriotic feelings
In order to protect the legitimate patriotic feelings of citizens against Russia's prosecution and distortions, the Honour of Russia proposes to compare the distortion of the patriotic feelings of extremist activity and to punish for the five years of prison.
As reported by the Ezware newspaper, such amendments in legislation prepared by the Olympic Energy Committee are already aimed at receiving a sentence to the Supreme Court and the Government.
Under the patriotic sense of the citizens of the amendment, the amendment proposes to understand the emotional relationship with a country whose citizen is the characteristic love for that country, responsible for its court, respect for his history and culture.
As Mihew indicates, there are sanctions for abuse against formal signs of the State authority, flag and herb.
For this reason, Parliament's view of the protection of Russians, whose feelings can be deceived and distorted by state symbols, and other manifestations of infringeness to our country, are insufficient in Russian legislation.

Involvement in the university and the "alternative view" in history, some publishers are discussed that, as unfortunately, the cultural Germans haven't acquired the Wild Soviet Union!
I read that absolutely invalid in the country where the pride of history remains the main "power" nation, Oлег Miheev says.
Moreover, Mihewa says that the patrioticly established people in Russia are much more than religious, but the law calls for distortion of the believers, and the elimination of the patriotic feelings can be practically unnecessary.
According to the people ' s elector, it is necessary to compare the distortion of the patriotic feelings to extremist activities and to the article 282 of the Criminal Code of the Criminal Code.

United Nations announces new goals to overcome poverty
The United Nations should immediately start working on the new integration of the Millennium Development Goals that have been formed 12 years ago to overcome poverty throughout the world.
Australian diplomates have played a key role in promoting the “Sustainable Development Goals” for the change of the CCT, which is the deadline of action to the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development, started at Rio-de-Janeiro's night.
They were included in the final option of a document signing world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Pan Guy Mun, said to the participants at the summit night that it was now time to “be above national interests”.
“I am glad that UN Member States agreed to start and control the process of establishment of universal objectives for sustainable development,” he said.
These UNCTADs will be opposed to our progress in the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and will become an integral part of the concept of development for the period after 2015.

Safety Peace in Mozambique is a result of the conflict of influential people
Under this statue, Samory Mashela, Mozambique-based President, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to scann the world on one of the rare demonstrations here.
“We want to return peace; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Suza, Executive Director of Investment Company.
In fear of the future of her country, she changed the business cost to a football descriptive “We require security” in Portugal, and joined to the Tower of Independence on Thursday.
During two weeks, practical daily reports were made between the government troops and Renamo, one of the most cruelly strikes since the death of more than 20 years ago.
Renamos was a well-known motion supported by the white authorities of Rodesia and then by the Government of South Africa for the efforts to destabilize the independent Government of the country.
After the death of 1992, it became a opposition party.
Analytics believe that the country is not re-interrupted to a full-scale conflict, but recent events have been struggling foreign investors and local people.
The rates are high for the rapid growth of the economy, since the opening of huge gases and western smokes in the north-west may be more than $50 billion as investments in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko.
The right party of Frilem, the political force leader since 1975, and the Renamo Party accused each other in the established tension.
The Renamo Party argued that the Government was a shutch of the last clamps, attacking its members in the Province of Sofala, the traditional Renamo Army, on October 17.
The Financial Times Fernando Mazang, representative of Renamo, reported the Financial Times Fernando Mazang.
The Government accusates Renamo in the initiative of clashing a party in attack against soldiers.
The President of Armanda Gabus tried to develop fears for instability.
He declared AFP, the French Information Agency, in the medieval that Mr. Dhlakama felt “unfailer”, who wanted to use “all that remained from his power to prove that he could put up his own decisions to the Government”.
Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, fears increased after reporting that Mazanga declared that Renamo was rejected by the peace agreement of 1992.
He reported the Financial Times that was not to be monitored by the Freemo Party Agreement.
“ Our goal is to return to negotiations, but with all the seriousness, ” said Mazanga.
The previous negotiations between the parties have not been made to decline the tensions that have increased the series of pillars in this year.
“ These are two influentious persons (Gebuza and Dhlakama), cut into legs, ” said Joseph Hanlon, professor of the University of Open and expert on Mozambique.
No one is a good negotiator and no one is ready to go to the necessary departure.
The Renamo Party, who is trying to achieve election reforms, already stated that it would be booccotting municipal elections appointed to November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for the next year.
Some comments interpreted this pressure as a slow movement attempt to achieve disbursements and financial funds from the Government.
The portion of votes for Renamo is decreased since 1992, while the new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which is based on the former member of Renamo, is expected to improve its indicators in these elections.
Mr. Mazang said that Mr. Gaboz, who is going to leave from the next year when his second term ends, wants to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn't want a multiparty democracy, he does not want transparent elections, no peace, because he does not want to leave the President” said Mazanga.
The possibilities of Renamo, however, have already undergoned destructive and voluntary attacks against the police officers and cars on a key driver from the north to the south.
Most of the shocks were in Sofala province, which is in hundreds of miles north of Maputus, but includes Bair, a port, which was the hill company, including Rio Tinto and Vale, to export an edge.
In June, Rio stopped the use of hydrocarbon routes for about a week after Renamo threatened the attack on the iron road.
Mazang was worshipped when he asked whether Renamo would repeat the threat.
The Renamo Party wanted to “advertise the international community that the cases in Mozambique are not very good,” said Mazanga.
The instability has increased by the Government, and many also concerns corruption, short-term development and recent defects, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent medical company of Mediacoop.
“They believe that the responsibility for the future country is to be taken by the Government and the President who must find out these problems,” he said.
Omar Surtuan, a demonstration participant, said that people just want stability.
“There are no concerns of Renamo or Frilymo, they just want to renew peace, they want free access to the roads,” he said.

Childs must study Miph and Legends as “models of life” said by the author.

Saying that many mixes are “scandale, too skandal, and in some cases too unacceptable for education in schools”, Crossly-Holland speaks for the "total selection" of text age.
“I think it is wonderful that in America the mif and the folkler are already part of education,” he said.
I spoke for introducing them in the training programme for twenty years.
He added that “extreme morality” authors and providers “estimate interest” in children, and the main ideas were“transmised” in the attractive history.
Crossley-Holland, which translated Beevulf with English and Saxonian language, also wrote the Norwegian Collection for the publications of Penuin and the British People's Words, said: “You may, of course, have an intention but you better keep them with you.”
A large difference between an adult author written for adults and an adult author who is written for children may be the need to feel a certain hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or bring to a happy end, but it is necessary that a national understanding of good and evil.
And that should be subsequent; opened through history, not clearly formatted.
Old principle: Show, not telling.

There should be no vegan in Siberia: the warm tone does not replace the spouse
Why the vegetation does not go for life in Siberia, explaining the RIA News Correspondent.
People who are fully rejected from animal origin should not live in Siberia.
There they do not take winter without loss for health, and no warm measuring meals are not compensated, considering the requested Weekday of the New Silibyan Diatologists and Doctors.
Get Little Oil
Terrific vegetation, not only from meat and fish, but also from milk, meat and ice, becomes a modest life.
However, physicians are convinced that in New Sibirk and other towns of Siberia, there are no need for health.
Full dismissment of animals is harmful.
The animals contain unlimited minosules, which are very difficult to compensate plants.
It must be included in a ratio even if milk or egg is certainly a diologo of Marina God.
For example, it produces a fish containing an unlimited oxygen of Omega-3.
The most richest of them is lunar oil.
"What to need it in the numbers necessary for humans, you need litras to drink!" says diathologist.
Medicines are convinced that the people of Siberia have to be a special attention to the ratio to winter.
In this season, the vegetation is particularly doubtful.
In the conditions of our reality, high demands for food are made.
In order to not measure, there is a higher calibracy need.
"If humans limit themselves on animal products, accordingly, it does not matter," said the specialist.
With this, Dr. Olga Pognok's Diotologist.
She adds that the fruits and fruits are not out.
Humans are better feeding products which are produced in the residence region or where they were born.
The genetic code is designed to improve and reverse these products.
And winter people do not want to shoot a shooter, but a shooter or something else,” explains the doctor's position.
In its words, that there may be vegans that are actually useful for various skins, craps, bombs, local fruits, balls that remain in the winter of nucleus.
But this is not enough for full food.
According to Claudi Arifulina, the physicians in organisms are only sufficient from the midst of August in the middle of September.
The full flow of vegetation in our heavy natural conditions, when the temperature can change to 30 °C and the snow is in May, is not celestial.
The body for life needs energy and, above all, grain," constitutes medicine.
The doctors noted that the vegany is particularly dangerous for children and pregnants.
Childs grow, they need a building material, including a mixture.
We will give them unworthy by maintaining vegetarianity.
Temporary needs also to increase the content of white, vitamins and micro-elements in the menu.
"They are unconscious of them," they are sure of God.
Arifulina says that adult man will choose everything he wants to play in the games that he wants.
He has already formed organs, skelets, organs.
However, children must be fully demanded.
If parents lost him any micro-electrics or aminoxistics, chooseing for him what he is, it is simply a violation of the rights of the child.
"The inadequacy of those or other substances for the development of the brain, the view, the bones are no longer rebuilding tomorrow," says it.
All requested medicators are viewed as an insufficient winter in warmth and vehicles of fruit and fruit.
What they bring and produced in warmths contains less than the necessary microelements we need to do in the open floor.
"The quantity of products isn't there," God says.
Ariphulin also notes that the customs and warm fruits and fruits are far from perfect standards.
The desire of producers to gather larger wealth causes the damage of quality.
"I blocks are not rooted on the face, the shooting swimming and slaughtered, the powders are sweet and shocked, ", adds examples of medical care, and adds that they may be shocked by a limited number of addicts.
And they become not vitamins, but cells.
This does not depend on the laboratory of the Siberian Physical and Technology Institute for Agricultural Problems, the agriculture candidates Vera Peterk.
It says that, in the right approach and compliance with all standards and warming requirements, it could be possible to produce full values.
If they are trying to get more out of a square metro, it will, of course, become more and more strike to raise mineral grains.
For example, when too many azotic additives grow rapidly, they are large, but driving and dishearted," she explains, adding that quality matter, at first, depends on the manufacturer's conscience.

The "on-the-scale" has been practitioned in a few decades in a form, but the number of documented stops have been slightly increased in the administration of the independent Mr. Michael Blumberg, reaching the absolute recursion in 2011 in 684 330 people, most of which black and Latin Americans.
In 2004, four persons, all of the representatives of national minorities, were collective to the court.
The Partyes of the Programme to Stop and Find the Police Department of New York say that these changes will end the unexpected practice, form a more reliable and efficient police service and can affect the way other police departments implement this practice.
Opponents argued that the changes of the fighting spirit of the police, not the crime level, will lead to the unnecessary costs of money and do not resolve a more global complicated problem in the police due to the reduction of the number of officers in the last few thousands of years.
The judge noted that it was not stopping the practice of stopping and searching, which corresponds to the Constitution, but changes the way the New York police stops people.
The third gallery has opened a trace zone
In Moscow, a new trace zone appeared.
It is located in the third gallery area and operates two miles [2 km] from the New York City Station to the Boloth Area.
For all years, we have established strikes, flowers, castles, urnes and toilets, deep burns and illicit advertising.
Besides the Climate and Lawricia Trails, which were already swimming, five streets closed - the Ordenic Tuppic, the Great and Small Tolmache, the Cadachua Beach and the Boloth area.
The movement of Mauritania and Peter’s road movement is not limited.
The Five-Found Street was created to the Climate Trade Conditions of the Climate Travel, without removing the movement and cutting of the past parts, transmits newsmsk.com.
The third gallery, the priest of the clergy of the Pope of Rome, Museums, Librarys, memorials and other adherence.
Previously, the Tuberculous Passage, the Peninsula and the Kuzekimp mountains were completely shocked.
The Great Distrik, where a swimming zone was opened at the beginning of September, was decided to close for weekly and feast cars.
Coulson went to the phone to check the confidential message.
The former editor of News of the World Andy Coulson suggested that he uses “the phone, the phone and the resistance” when trying to confirm the false information about the Roman Charles Clark, who was at the time of the Minister of Internal Affairs.
The accused, the Queen Advocate Andrew Edis reported the Court of Old-Bay that in May 2005, the newspaper News of the World received an uncertain news that Clark meets his “Applausing Advisor” Hanna Polby.
The journal ordered a private detective Glenn Mulkeyr to cut Paulby's voice mail and guarded her home to take an interview, but he also called her and left the voice message, and he heard the court.
“The appointment is that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not a man who will stand around any house, hoped to spend somebody, he who loves to offer the story of people to see what they will say, ” said Mr. Edis.
He said that the newspapers of the World used three ways to investigate historic phones, phones, clips and contradictions.
The editor is personally engaged in the third.
Obviously, he knows the second, he should just be.
What about the first?
Does he know what the phones are broken?
He said, "Ooh, Ooh!
Roman Clark's ears first highlighted the editions of News of the World, when the source, who was sexually interested in Mrs. Polby, said: “No time, she and Charles.”
A vote record received at least three times from her phone was issued from the Mulkeir house in August 2006.
The following also found notes on a private detection computer where Miss Polby and her sister were fixed as Projects.
During the period, when she was under the side, grandmother and grandmother, Mrs. Paulby received anonymous calls on requests to provide information on her, Mr. Edis said.
At that time, the former main reporter, Neville Turlbeck, and the former reporter James Weather, were controlled by Mrs. Polby's movement.
As he left the vote message on 18 June 2005, Koulson said: “I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow and that I would like to very much to discuss with Charles.”
Mr. Edis said that the participation of Coulson in this story was the same scenario as with other influentious people, such as the former Minister of Internal Affairs David Blankett.
The judges heard on Thursday that Coulson had entered a conflict with Mr. Blankett on a marriage with a woman while he himself met the corresponding Rebecca Brooks, who was at the time of the marriage.
Coulson and Brux refused to enter into conspiration with others with a view to the shutting of phones for the period from 3 October 2000 to 9 August 2006.
Mulkeyr, Turlbeck and Weatherap were acknowledged in the shooting phones.
Snowden claims that it is willing to report to the FAO authorities on the case of hearing
Advocate Edward Snowden expresss the willingness to arrive in Germany only when it is available for this legal opportunity, and meets the representatives of the FGR authorities, RI News.

The United States reduces food for the poor
Food rates for the family of four persons are reduced to $36 per month
From Friday in the United States, the financial guarantee of products known as "Fudstamps" is reduced as the operation of the relevant State programme is completed.
The family of four persons will now be allocated to $36 per month less than previously.
This is about 47 million Americans.
According to the Reater Agency, in 2012, the financial assistance for one person was a medium of $133 per month.
In the United States, food assistance expenditures increased up to $80 billion per year because of the growth of unemployed people and the food prices.
About 14 per cent of Americans are trusted in free food assistance issued by Foudstamps, containing such a name from ancient times when they had the form of paper cupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the programme was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
However, the Republicns in the Congress require further reductions in the programme, claiming that it should be aimed to help those who need more.
The owners of food shops around America are concerned that the reduction of consumer costs would be reduced.
The United States Congress continued to discuss how more government financing can be reduced.
Blizzard has freely issued a 19-year-old platform
The Blizzard study has freely issued his Blackhorne platform on the PC in 1994.
This reports WoW Insider.
According to his data, the game was available at Battle.net in the Blizzard classic game section.
However, some gumers noted that it is currently possible for only the users whose accounts relate to the American Service part.
For Russian users, games are not available.
According to the media, Blizzard's version now released on the PC does not vary from the original game option.
Sauntreck to Blackthorne was also unlikely.
The Blackthorne Platformer, who Blizzard released 19 years ago, originally came to the SNES console.
His events were disappeared on the Tuul planet, whose people were separated by the dark and light kings.
One day, the Dark Goal of Sarac decided to kill the light king of Vulros and become a single ruler of the planet.
The main hero of the game is the son of Vlarus Kyle, who saved from death, sent to the earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Tuul to fight with Saracs and protect the people of the planet.
The original Blackhorne was the first game that the study issued after its renamement in Blizzard Entertainment.
To this time, she was called Silicon & Synapse.
The Blackthorne publisher was Interplay company.
New automates appear in the Moscow Metropolitan.
But to sell passenger tickets, they're not for money, but for meetings.
One trip of the 30th rule is a potential passenger at 30 meetings.
The number of meetings will be recorded by the special device using modern technologies, reports ITAR-TASS with reference to the press office of the Russian Olympic Committee.
The first device will be established on the "Original" station on 8 November 2013.
In the presentation of new bicycle sports, President of the Russian Olympic Committee, Alexandre Jacques and Olympic gympics, Alex Nemom and Elena Zamorochica, will take President.
Recognition of the National Security Agency increases the paraoid corporations in respect of the public trading
The day at the end of August, the German police was low over the U.S. console in Francoforte, the financial capital of Germany.
On the instructions of the Federal Constitution Protection Service (BfV), the internal research services of Germany, his task was to photograph the building box of the United States representatives, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Buchensban.
German media said that BfV had hoped to find the anciens of listening devices, and these actions were involved in negotiations between the United States and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clepper, Director of the United States National Intelligence, reaffirmed, in September, that the United States did not use external information for “to strike outcomes of foreign companys in the interests of the United States to enhance their international competitiveness or to increase their gain”.
But since Edward Snowden, a contract officer, began to publish his backup secrets of the United States, the European Governments and the leaders of the company, they are no longer sure if you can believe the director.
It was reported that the United States National Security Agency was monitored by the Brazilian Oil company Petrobras and received access to the data scheduled by U.S. district service providers, including Google and Yahoo, to new higher levels.
The last chapter was reported that the phone of the Office of Angela Mercelle may have been heard for about ten years.
If the most influential person of Europe can be a motive, there is, of course, potential channels are also the leaders of business.
Snowden has demonstrated intensive cooperation between the United States Intelligence Services and the Companions.
I think that these data may be used with a mutual benefit.
“Germany must wake up” says Oliver Green, President of the BITMI Joint, representing the small and medium-sized IT company of Germany.
The German companies are convinced that the United States now represents almost the same risk as China, in the field of industrial sphere and the cutting of data, according to the study published in July by the EC Consulting Agency.
However, in all documents revealed by Mr. Snowden, the United States had not yet proved that the trade secrets of foreign companies have been transferred to their own companies.
Politicals expressed concern that the EU had no need for certain information technologies and the Internet, and expressed the view that it should try to reduce its dependance from the United States.
Budgets are skeptically related to this.
Someone in the German Parliament says that we need to create a German Google.
I can just close the eyes and slowly open them again...
“ This is not a option,” says Gasso Plattner, President of the German programme provider for SAP business.
If there is no need for the powerful European IT industry, it was not necessary to allow it to die over 20 years.
All are subsidied in Germany: carbon from cars to farmers.
All except the IT industry.
However, the scope and technical development of the U.S. Spionage Agencys, which were known by Snowden’s declarations, were shocked for some companies who previously thought that China was the largest risk.
The greatest use is in areas technologies where European companies have better recognized that the data scheduled in the United States are in the same juridiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to an investigation carried out by the Cloud Security Association, some 10 per cent of its non-American participants refused to use the services of the district conductor in the United States after the shipping of the United States for the intellectual analysis of Prism.
Jim Sneeb, one of the SAP executive directors, said: "We see that the consumers take a new question that has not occurred year ago, namely: where my data are stored and can you ensure that they are physically staying in this law."
Many German leaders claim that the last communication is only a confirmation that they have already known: the powerful States want to steal their most precious secrets, and therefore these data should be protected by any value.
What happens to an economic spionage is unexpectedly.
He always had a place.
“ This was the subject of the discussion of many years and has not been significantly changed in the current field,” says Kurt Block, head of the BASF Chemistry Director.
Americans are spy for us at the commercial and industrial level, and we are also spy for them, because it is in our national interests to protect our commercial companies.
Corporation leaders usually do not like to respect the subjects of the responsible measures they have undertaken, as it can provide the advantage of the opposite.
In major companies, there has been a long time the idea of taking a free shipping ship or leaveing a taxi without vision in the hotel number — at least unlikely.
Urrich Hackenberg, a member of the Director of the Audi Automobile Company, said that this standard practice has been to collect mobile phones before the government meetings so that they could not be used as listening devices for many years.
The Federal Protection Service of Germany recommends that the company leaders consider the use of simple mobile phones during the shipping trips because of the vulnerability of phones.
Subsequently, the mobile phones are elected.
However, there are fears that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable for explosions and trails.
In Germany, many such companies are leaders of the world market in their specific lower.
“The small and medium-sized enterprises often have no experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from an unnecessary access,” warns BfV.
The United States warn their own economic spy companies from other countries.
The United States National Intelligence Independent in February, France, together with Russia and Israel, was in the second series of offenders who have been chairmanship for economic intelligence after China, argued the Washington Post.
The member of the Council of Directors of the prestigious German company confirmed that when it was talking about the economic spionship, “Francis is worse to all”.
Bernard Scarsiny, former French director of Internal Intelligence Agency, stated in DCRI in the last month: “The services are well known that all countries, even when they cooperate in combating terrorism, are shocked by their unions.”
Mothers of a boyfriend from Georgia who died in “unfortunate case” believe that their son was killed
Mothers of Georgia, whose body was found within the sporting mood in the second school room, believe that their son was killed, claimed the lawyers of the family on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from the city of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on 11 January, in a vertical standing mother, who was left to the courts in the sport room of his second school.
The following sheriffs in Loundez were concluded that Johnson died in tragic cases, but the family of 17-year-old adolescent adolescence is hindered.
“ They are absolutely sure that their sons were killed, ” said FoxNews.com Benjamin Kramp, lawyer who represents Kennet and Jaclin Johnson.
They never believed that he died, as she said she's a sheriff.
“ They believe that it is contrary to logics, physics, and well-being,” said Cramp.
They think it's a hidden for the protection of humans or persons responsible for the death of their son.
“ They sent their son to school with a school bag, and they returned to the body, ” he said.
The American lawyer Michael Mur stated on Friday that he conducted a official investigation of Johnson's death, noted that a number of key issues remained without answer.
What was the cause of death?
Has his death been the result of a crime?
Mur made a statement on the press conference on Thursday.
I'm going to study all the facts they'd have brought.
My goal is to know the truth.
“I hold the view that there are sufficient grounds” for official investigation, he said.
Mur told the reporters that the primary hiding showed that Johnson died as a result of the “position asylum”.
However, the second hidden, according to Mura, showed another cause of death.
“ There are some questions that should be authorised or detailed, ” he said.
Mur added that if he finds sufficient authority to require a criminal or civilian investigation of Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the sheriff of Loundez district was not available for comments when he was requested on Thursday.
The Court of South Georgia in the Middle East requested the authorities to publish all video records of monitoring cameras that were monitored by researchers.
Young children said they hope that video records have a key to think about how he died.

Diseases control and prevention centres have made recommendations for schools relating to allergic children
The list of recommendations for the control of food allergies in schools has been published in the centres of control and prevention of diseases.
This is the first list of recommendations made by the United States Government, while the number of children of school age suffering from food allergies is growing.
Now one of the 20 children in the United States has food allergy.
The monitoring and prevention centres found that the spread of food allergy among children has increased from 1997 to 2007 by 18 per cent.
The Directorate-General provides information on schools how to improve the knowledge of prosecutors and providers of food alergetic in children and how to assist in allergy reactions.
It also recommends that schools keep adrenaline stocks — mostly for injections are used by EpiPen’s automatic medical smuggling, to assist potentially deadly analysis.
Legislative authorities have recently changed in the regulation to enable schools to make adrenalines with less difficulties.
Notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children with allergical reactions.
Children can say, "That feelings like something you're in my language," "I have a hair in my language" or "slipper's slipper."
Inter-Sexual Child parents may choose “indefinite gender”
Germany became the first European country who recognized the third part of children born with interim sex bodies.
Newborn will not be required to accept a man or woman's gender.
The new law does not require parents to call any of these children, allowing parents to specify the “indefinite” or “uninstalled” in their birth testimony.
The purpose of the law was to remove pressures from parents that could take slow decisions on the transmission of the newborn, and to oppose discrimination against intersectional persons.
One intersectional man, according to BBC, said many years later, "I'm not a man and not a woman."
I'm still a doctor with blue and smells.
About one of the thousand children who are birthing annually is not a boy or a girl.
They have intersectionality, one of about 60 pathological states that are under the diagnosis of “the violation of sexual development” — a collective term for persons with typical chromosomes, gonades (e.g. gender or seminars) or unexpectedly developed by armed sex organs.
Walter Simpson may have been an intersectional.
Generic identification has still not been studied, but most experts in the United States say that, if the age cannot be determined, better use of all information and bring it up than expecting and monitoring psychological and physical development of the child before operations.
The New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drecher, who specializes gender identification issues, said that the new German law “is a good idea.”
Inter-Sexual children are creating the ethical dilemma.
“ Some people have threatening violations that require operational involvement, but most of them are not, ” he said.
You can get off without operation and then see how the personality is developed.
The teaching of a child ' s identity is not too accurate.
Nobody can answer the questions why this happens.
It's like a note of why people feel homosexual.
The report sent to the European Commission in 2011 describes intersectional persons as different from trans-sexual or transgenders, since their status is not relative to the genitor, but to their biological construction, which is not exclusively a man or a woman's gender, and typically not for both the same time or for one.
These features may be shown in secondary sex signs such as muscle mass, sharp, sweat and bodying; primary sex signs such as reproductive bodies and genitality, or in the structure of chromosome and hormones.
The report also provides a general presentation of discrimination with inter-sectional and trans-general persons in the field of employment, as well as the level of prejudiciary, cruelness and crimes.
Childs with gender abuse now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already authorized adults to put a man, woman or third-party in their official documents.
In June, the 52-year-old resident of Australia, Norrie May-Walby, became the first person in the world who was recognised “besple”, was the right to maintain the“indefinite” sex status throughout the life.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, German passports will be used the third marking in addition to M and F to X, namely intersectional.
In the neighbouring of France, gender issues still have an opposition in accordance with the newspaper of France 24.
In 2011, decades of French lawyers, which were expressed by the Catholic country, were signed by a petition of the “general theorie” from school students.
The American Catholic Online website also expressed inconvenience with the German law, wrote that “in the situation where the world is involved in a new state of election, and the sexual activity is not, we turn another two pillars of civilization”.
A mother of the newborn child from Maryland also reported the baby zone website that she would like to be installed at birth.
“Beating a child is sufficiently hard and without additional limitations, especially if you don't know by your child,” she said the website for parents.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historical children, born with men and women’s gender bodies, were called hermafrodotes, on behalf of the beautiful Greek god, who had the signs of both gender.
And only ten years ago, the medical community took Gender as a letter to which it can stand and then write again.
But now many interfere with the ethical basis for surgical operations, known that gender identity is complex, and the doctor sometimes makes an innocent choice, which is not aware of how the child is going to take her dedicated gender when he grows.
“In the midst of the XX century, it was called "unnecessary psychiatric case", said Dresher.
When they were born, you didn’t call a psychiater — you called surgery.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with interim genetics was proposed by Dr. John Many from the University of Johns Hopkins, who believed that the genitor was easy to change.
He introduced the term “general identity” and claimed that environmental signals, including social, as parents grow children, are interacting with genes and hormones of the child, determineing whether a person would be considered a man or a woman.
But in one case, in 1966, his theory was questioned.
He recommended the child whose penis was damaged during an unclean circumcision, fully covered the child, removed his bones, and grew it as a girl.
“ Many presented cases as a successful example of transition, but it was not true, ” said Dresher.
When he was about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married to a woman.
But he was 38 years old.
Drecher said that some doctors still “applicate this model” now.
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, people who survived these gender changes have declared themselves “unpleasant results.”
This was also the case of Jim Bruce, 36-year-old writer of Montana, who was born with male XY, but the genetics of interim type.
The doctor could not exactly determine whether he had a great clitori or a small penis, and were convinced that he could never be able to live in a man 'complete life'.
Thus, immediately after his birth in 1976, the external gender organ and the burns of Bruce were removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He began to give women’s hormones aged 12.
“I knew I was not a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unfortunate, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
He was appointed in 18 years.
But in depression and understood that something was wrong, he needed medical documentation.
What he learned was horrible.
I was sterilised at birth, and nobody told me about this.
Bruce was born with a violation of gender development that did not allow his body to produce sufficient testing for normal development.
When he learned the truth, he became a man again, obtaining the skin of the testisteron and removed his smell.
Operation made him unclean.
Today he speaks to protect others in the organization called Interface Project, trying to make people intersectional.
But Ann Tamar-Matetis, Executive Director of the Califore Legislative Association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law “assums the smuggling and the smile.”
“ Many activists are concerned that the German law would encourage parents to make a decision slow and give a child a “indefinite gender”,” she said.
We're afraid he's going to contribute to the involvement.
We think it's better to get a man or a woman's fellow, and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law will be forbidden, so what we can do is building the provisions.
Tamar-Mattis said that its organization supports Australian law because “there allows adults to choose for third-party”.
“ adults must have the opportunity to take their own decisions on formal sex,” she says.
The German law undermines its dedication at birth.
This is a conviction in which small children should not enter this stage.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions on their own body.
However, Dr. Arlin Baratz, a mother-rentgenologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter in violation of gender development and who helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that the German law “submits” both parents and children.
The daughter of Baraz, Katy, was born with husband chromosomes, but she has a violation of sexual development, named “the syndrome of full inconsciousness to androgen”.
As her advertising receptives are incorrectly working, the women ' s signs have been discovered.
She has a power, but there's no wheats and birds.
Now, in 29 years, Katie is married and is a child psychiatrist at the University of Pennsylvania.
Despite the unfaithfulness of it, she hopes to be a parent by means of the incorporation or of a hestatic abuse material.
“ The Zakon gives time to parents to not take up the slow decisions itself, ” said Baraz.
It gives them time to make any analysis and to consider in the situation, as well as the interim time before they write a woman or a woman.
In that case, you are fine — growing a child, loved by the child.
You have a wonderful child, and you feel joy.
We don't need to do a operation that is unexpected.
“ This allows children to participate in decisions and to eliminate the concern that their parents move, because they are not feeling right, ” she says.
At the end of the time, the child decides to be more comfortable with her or her — and it is wonderful.
This allows children to make decisions self-determined.
"Chicago" Nicolay Habibulin emphasized: He understands the need to play better.
According to the 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work on training.
At the last two meetings, Habbibulin first passed six chairs from Tampa Bay, and then four of the Ottawa, which was replaced in the second game after the fourth shirt.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I couldn't have done it -- brings CSNChicago to Habbibulin's words.
- I have to find a reliability in training, probably to go to them as a game and to try to get the best results.
You must study your last games and work on the shortcomings that were.
There are some small components that I need to improve, but at the training, I feel very good.
But for some reason, after a few heads, it's all turning into a dark coma.
Maybe I need a little relax.
I don't think that I'm that one - always trying to make a perfect game.
If I lose four, five, six, I'm not in a shock.
It doesn't matter what happens before my doors.
I'm still working on myself to not miss such a shirt.
Good, my colleagues support, but in principle, it's just that I have to play better.
Two games are not the whole season, but I wanted to make them better.
But what happened.
I have to put it on the side.
I'll just try to play the next piece better.

Medve vs. SSJ-100 will be placed in Europe
Russia considers that the 100 Superject flights will also be put into Europe after the late America markets and Asia.
"We consider that, in the general complexity, we will receive such agreements more than 170 aircraft exemplaires, " provides an interfax " of Russian Prime Minister, Dmitri Medveveveva, which they have been discussed at the press conference with the President of France Jean-Marco Eiro.
The Chief of the Russian Government noted that with French colleagues there was a serious cooperation, since it was a joint project.
We have discussed some financial issues related to the insurance today, but we hope that after this airplane will be strengthened on the markets of Latin America and Asian and the Pacific region, it will also be put to our partners in Europe.
"I hope he will ever be placed in France," emphasized the Russian prince.
SSJ-100 is a flight built by the Suhjo Civil Aircraft company in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
The liner is developed on the basis of modern technologies and proposes high quality standards and comfort at 100 passenger places.
The Day's Energy began a unique rescue program...
In the elderly to reach the gardens, the villages on a high table, and the heavy nest standed well on it.
Such special oppositions have not been long ago, so the assists loved the columns of electronic warning lines, and the flowing winds are shocked on the guide, with which the assist switch is reliable.
The grandmother Ana, whose home in the town of the Petrick area has lived twenty-ninth years ago, has noted how the snake sits, despite all his efforts.
The birds have a new wind above the top, and the lower shields are already swimming between the driving.
Of course, the painful family of the actors who were sneaking every year in the shooting, tri-third birds were shocked and sentenced in the summer of three-four birds, but they did not want to remain without light.
Only the birds in the warm land, the grandmother Ana called at the King’s REX, which belongs to the opposition.
And I didn't even expect there to react so fast.
When our specialists came to Ivanuk, they were surprised that the nest was still holding, - told the technical director of the DEC "Dneproliferationergo" Sergey Belize.
The guidelines that have been actually already inside the nest, 150 to 200 kilograms, began corrosion.
At any time, birds could die from electricity.
Indeed, local people were risked to stay without light because of the damage.
Thus, line mountains have started a nest saving operation, which has not been the first time in our practice.
They have helped scientists and ornitologs from the Daily National University who have developed a nest transfer scheme.
They trained the district network staff.
The famous day ornithologist Alexander Ponoarrenko consulted energy at all phases of reconstruction of the nest.
For the beginning, it was noted that there were more than 50 Asian " apartment".
For their reconstruction, special metal platforms were covered for the throne.
The main snake was shocked with snakes, and then the old nest moved there.
It is noted that it is enough to put old winds as a basis for the birds to learn the nest and return to it.
The assists have already built their homes.
The first nest was rebuilt for a month ago in the village of New York City.
A new ironethane column was placed with the electricity ring and was placed on it with a older, skilled nest.
The whole operation was covered by energy in nine thousand grivens.
At the same day, the same new village was held in the village of Ivanack, the Petrick area, on the door of the grandfather Ani.

The possible replacement was a secret, carefully protected in the Chicag Pre-selection Statue and the Occupy Office.
Only six of the nearest advisors of the President, including Daley, the former Chief of Obama Messina's predicted stage, and the former Belarus House David Axelrod and David Pluff, knew that the replacement was considered.
The "Stavkey" book states that Daley was an initiative to replace Bayden, despite their "persistent personal relationships", but finally rejected the step when their data showed that the addition of Clinton to the election list would not "accepte significant opportunities of Obama".
In the interview with Martin Daley, the Administration realized the possibility of the replacement of Bayden Clinton.

You should remember that at that time the President was in a horrible form, so we thought, "Oh God, what are we doing?"

“Medium-elected stages do not cost such amounts for surveys and group focuss if they do not consider anything,” said Martin in the AC 360 programme.
However, it was not clear that Obama knew that his team had studied the possibility of replacement.
Martin told the CNN that he asked Daley whether he knew his boss about the possible transfer.
Although Daley said he was not thinking that the President had “the course” a possible replacement, the former head of the Administration acknowledged that Obama knew.
Martin added that “States are double” did not provide a clear answer to the question whether the results of the political consignment to the Obama table were achieved.
Cooper asked Martin whether he was seriously thinking that Obama didn't know about the possibility of deleting Bayden from the election list.
“ Maybe, ” said Martin.
Do you want a lighter in the dark?
The British entrepreneur created the world's first light in dark marine by means of the media.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent qualitys of the sea animal to develop light food.
He came to that idea, read a scientific article on media, and convinced the scientists in China to recovered the light white.
The skin is in response to the language of the man who eats it, increased the level of pH in the skin and put it to light.
Chris says that since the marine begins to light when it reacts to warm route, it means that you're more than you're sweet, so it's sweet.
Charlie, the founder of the marine production company "Lisney, I'm sweet," says, "This is an incredible thing, but still in the first stage, if you're talking about the production, so you'll get about 2 g substances."
The Belock we use in the marine reactions with your language at the neutral pH.
So when your mouth smells a white, it will increase the pH level and the marine starts to light.
We tested him in the past few months, and it seemed to be perfectly present to Hellon, because it creates such a wonderful effect.
This may be the most precious marine of what I did, because the ulminancement of the meau is four times the gold road.
So every shirt's supposed to be about £140.
It's so nice to smell.
Charley's experimental company, located in Bristol, is known as its unfair shoes, including bird, sweet, sweat and sweat of soft gold.
But his next creation should be more ambitious.
He said, "I want to develop an invisible marine."
This is impossible to define because of the bleeding caused by the ice crystals of which is marine, but I think we're gonna find a way to do it.

In this regard, INTERFAX.RU refers to the source of information in the RF guards.
"When the media reported that the United States Finance Ministry of Leps had been introduced in the control lists of suspects in the part of the European Brat Criminal Syndicate, we have considered all the databases but did not find such groups, " said the Countries of the Agency.

Fire teams were called to save the lost shooting shooting, stripped at 50 feet above the earth to a dangerous carriage in the carriage
Ruby's spanish cocktail fled after a small DTD
After three days she was in the carriage, he noticed the man who shocked the dog
Firefounds were cut down on the shields on the shield to save the dog from the unminished loss
It was still forced to save after fire teams were called to get it up and bring it to a safe place, after he was somewhat slowed up to 50 feet (50 feet) to a dangerous swimming circle.
The 11th Skipper of Ruby escaped after the Sunday's car accident and spent three days alone before the carriage was saved.
Her host, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old friend Becky Holl, had been in the carrière of Fleepped in Denholm, western New York City, to join Ruby, and thank you for the rescue service of West Yorkshire.
They were freely searching for their lost dogs and placed treatment on social network sites after she fled to the carriage after a small accident.
About 14.15 in the midst of the star dog, Ruby noted that the carriage was 50 feet (50 feet) highlighted.
The technical saving room with the fire station of Clexito has speeded up to the site of occurrence, went down to the crews to save Ruby, and used the transfer to upstairs.
The Savior Officer Andy Clayton said, “He was in dangerous situation.”
She was just in the middle of a heavy circle — 50 feet (50 feet) to the top and to the earth.
She wasn't driving and muscle while saving, and she was completely slow.
But now she's fine.
Then she was eating a cup.
It was a very uncomfortable call.
The fact that the dog has noticed is unbelievable.
Peter Lau's Savior Officer said, "Robby was very happy that they saved her."
It was likely that she could get a very serious tragedy or worse.
Ruby was brought to the veterinary to review, and it was established that it was all right, except for insurance and salvation.
Ms. Hall from Galilefax, West New Yorkshire, said: “It was fearful to observe salvation.”
I couldn't believe she was there.
It was awesome when she was back in our hands.
The Veterinary said, if she'd worry and lost conscience, she would probably lose.
The fires were great.
It was very courageous — what they did.
We are so grateful, and everyone of them was absolutely grateful.
Mr. Alderson from China added: "We feared that she could get away, but she remained there."
The fires were shocked.
I can't just believe she's there.
Mick Jagger said he didn't win with Kate Perry when she was 18 years old.
During an interview in the Australian Radioshop on this week, post-star said that it was a bike-vocalist for Jagger 2004 Old habits the hard.
Perry said he was dinner with a roer-veterin, and noted: “He played with me when I was 18 years old.”

George Kerevan: the breakdown of Europe gives the Skotlands a choice
Another day, another fear of independence.
This time, we warn that the independent Scotia will be joined into the general European free movement area as conditions for membership in the EU.
The passport control stories in Berbik and the border of the Adrian Way.
Indeed, the Strathclyde newspaper indicated the potential economic benefits of more free transfers in the rest of Europe, although, as we predict, it was not in the titles.
Nobody also indicated that the EU Member States have spent a lot of time to highlight their formal rules as they were good.
As Skotland is now not in the Schengen Zone, the continuation of the non-observation requirements will be a delay for Brussels instead of what he really wanted from the Skotlands.
So it's not a worthy attention to the story.
And the old thing she turned into a channel: first I heard "tonight" that "independence means passport control" at least 40 years ago.
However, there is a interesting moment lost when the old speech was told.
Why should the independent Scotia perform the commandments of Europe?
Why can I change London's ice to Brussels, especially now?
This is the European news: the great subsequent plan to join Europe finally has been implemented.
With the Eurocrisis project Europe, it is officially dead.
In all the European Union, the parties who speak against the EU or for the abolition of the euro as a single currency shall take force.
Even in Germany, the Alternative for Germany, which was based only in this year, appeared from the country and received almost five million votes from the federal elections of September, thus exhibited the Free Democracy (any of our Liberal Democratics) from Budapest.
There was always an internal opposition to the Federal Europe Plan.
However, the current economic crisis has become a deterioration.
Measures of the economics introduced by the Berlin and the European Central Bank, and shops put into national economies through the maintenance of a single currency, brought many people to the mind that the Europe project was too far.
The euro crisis was little related to the work of the national governments with excessive budget deficiencies, which was justified only for Greece.
Indeed, the Eurostat has blocked its members on common courses for German exporters, that German policies and desire to keep them.
Without the possibility of the national currency of South Europe, there is an inconsistent condition of production in comparison with Germany.
The unique savings are to reduce payments and public costs that are actively supported by Berlin.
The current budget and currency issues are the more deep problem of Europe's production capacity.
As a result of the complex of measures on green energy in Brussels, a crypture that means supporting French and German energy companies by consumers, the European industry is twice more than electricity and four times more than the United States.
It's a paralysising worthy conditions, as we have seen in Greydgemouth.
None of the world's wages will stop devastating the weakness of the US low-scale gas over the European oil industry.
This results from the burnt, especially in France, the most wreckful of the EU side.
After the war, the French political elite considered the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris at one level with Washington.
But Berlin is no longer necessary for political legitimacy in Paris, and has already linked its own economic policy in Europe, left the devastated economy of France in a poor situation.
The result is the right to speak against the EU party, Marin Le Penn National Fund, just wining decisive elections by shutting the rule of socialists on the third place.
The “Front” is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of votes — the timely warning of British libraries that it cannot be made out of the provision that is automatically discovered among the left.
What does Le Penn do with his newly open popularity among the French white work class?
She wants to use elections in the EU in the next year to create blocks in the European Parliament against the EU and against a single currency.
If, and that is very likely, the EU party will receive support for these elections, this block can first take the household position in the European Parliament.
This is my view: the rapid growth of the EU and the one currency in Europe are slow to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but will again become a kind of “Europes (sovereign nations)” that liked General de Holly.
Germany and a few dependents of it may keep the euro, but France and Southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I suggest that Britain is disastering from this project, hoped to draw close to the United States.
However, the growing interest of Washington to the Pacific shows that Britain remains without attention to the Atlantic cold.
What situation does it leave Skotland?
We can choose to be a region (in fact) of small England.
Or we can protect our own economic interests, which means, besides otherwise, send Berlin and Brussels to the fucks.
I suspect that Skotland can overcome a more free European treaty, provided that we keep our currency.
Cooperation with other one-industrial countries will be easier in the informal Europe.
On the other hand, we should consider the possibility of repeating the experience of Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The Government of the Skotland National Party is, as a strange, the most successful political movement in Europe aimed at combating a heavy economy that has received a majority of votes in 2011 by reflecting the reduction of the (and realized) Leiblist Canal of Alister Darling and the results of the coalition of the Tor and Liberal Democracy.
Skotland would now be able to vote for independence only to take steps to the green economy involved in Berlin and Brussels.
Previous sexual conspiration: Previous age
African and Latin American girls are generally attaining a full shock before their white neighbors show a study.
Physical changes do not mean that sexual conspiration is close
No evidence that hormones or other chemicals are accused
Experts believe that gender epidemia may be one of the launching mechanisms of early gender resurrection
Tendence to the early sex snake is not expressed in the boys
The former representative CNN Pat Etherij is a journalist specialized on child health and family issues.
Should the mother be afraid if her daughter begins to form the start of milk iron and the growth of skin hair for seven or eight years?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatria on this week in Orlando, Florida, the child endocrinolog, Dr. Paul Caplavitts, explained that these early physical changes were fully distributed among American girls and represented a new standard.
“ I have a lot of time to relaxing my parents — it usually does not mean a fast invasion of full - gentle gentleness, ” said Capevitz.
Evident development signs, such as growing grains, smells, and underlying hairs and body smells, are previously appeared in girls.
However, only a small change in the age of menarhee (first mention) was over the past four decades.
The average age in the United States is 12.5 years and was decreased in comparison with 12.75 in 1970.
“ As the grain begins to develop, at least two-third years before the menarhee,” said the author of the book The Recent Sexual Success: how to address this public problem.
The time is the most accurate verification of sexual conspiration.
The debate is that it is a real invasion of gender rape but it is considered to be “immediate” when the increase in the grain is slowly increased by growth to eight years.
In most cases, the process is delayed or stopped is that the pediator can follow carefully.
More rapid progress can be a basis for analysis in endocrinologs to eliminate serious problems such as shocks or kits.
There are procedures to keep early mention and prevent another consequence: premature older bones, which may eventually lead to decline growth and low growth in age.
Recommendations on medical or hormonal therapy are based on child age, development levels, growth rates and emotiveness.
The psychosocial aspects are also important.
The publisher is careful with the medicines but recognizes that “the abuse of sexual abuse may reduce the behavioral problems and feelings of girls that are different from September”.
Another big problem is that parents simply don't want to have a restructuring of their very young daughters.
“They are worried about the risk of pregnancy or even how they are treated with hygien matters,” said Capevitz.
“ This was a shock, ” remembers one woman whose daughter’s menstruction began for ten years.
Although signs were and we spoke about the menstruction, she was not emotively ready.
She came home from the school of a scared and disappointed school that she was the first among his friends.
There are many degraded theories about the causes of early sexual conspiration.
Nevertheless, there is no follow-up evidence that hormones in milk or other food products, chemicals in the environment, or sexual shipments in mass information.
Childs, as well as girls, have previously come to sexual conspiration.
The Chief claims that the preference of the weight is the episode of fertilizing.
In 2001, he helped a study of girls from 6 to 9 years of age, which links the number of grains in the body with the terms of sexual suspicion.
Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other factors.
In this country, African and Latin American girls are generally reaching sexual snare before their white neighbors.
There are various explanations.
In the world, the premature sexual conspiration, in the whole sense, affects all the things: from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Another note: Although the child’s hair appears in a younger age, tendency to full early sex is not expressed as girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP conference have confirmed the complexity of this topic.
The demonstration of smell and smell hair is found at the youngsters and children of a clear age.
“ We must be careful about how we determine the true invasion of geographical snacks, ” said Dr. Lawrens Silverman, child endocrinologist in the Holivet Hospital in the New Jersey Hospital.
Parents should not be able to receive instructions from the pediator about how to speak to their child.
“ This may mean more early than it was expected, ” explained Capevitz.
If you keep peace, your child normally reacts well.
The girls who grow early must be confirmed that even when this happens before, this process is a normal part of life.
The United States Boeing engaged in reading is ready to go to the airline
The aircraft carried out under the Open Neighborhood Treaty on Russia's Territories and the unplanned aircraft in Chita, the United States Airport on Friday, 1 November, at 8:30 to the Moscow time, will leave the aircraft in the city.
The airport’s conduct has been authorized by a ship ship driving, receiving a fuel pay.
As we reported to the airport, the flight is going to Ulan Woode.
On the other hand, he's going to the United States.
According to the report, the flight in Ulan-Udde was landed in the Zabaykal area because of the tsunami.
It was not issued from Chita's airport because of the unpauted accounts.
30 persons, including equipage, two nights on the airport, reports ITAR-TASS.
As reported in MID RF, in accordance with the conditions laid down by the open sky Treaty of the aircraft, people have no right to go outside the Chita Airport, they may be able to control the border only in two Russian airports, in Cuba and in Ulan-Wude.
The Open Leaf Treaty was signed in 1992, 34 States participated in it.
The observing boards are carried out on the territorys of Russia, the United States, Canada and Europe.
The main tasks of the Treaty are the development of transparency, facilitating monitoring of the implementation of arms control agreements, enhancement of crisis prevention and resolving crisis situations within the OSCE and other international organizations.

Reactive aircraft producers affect the seat width when large commands
Among the manufacturers of aircraft, a devastate controverse of the width of the tourist class on further rays led to a ton to a terrible conflict on the Dubai aircraft in that month.
The spot is around the wide range of seats provided on further magic passengers of the class, whose interests are not always in the centre of aircraft attention, while the amount chosen for the space plays a key role in approving the effectiveness of recent aircrafts proposed by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
The Airbus in this week called for the introduction of a sector standard which would provide the width of the seat (46 cm) in the economic class halls, but its main American competitor Boeing said that this should be resolved by aviation.
The point of view is when aircraft producers are settled in sales, and their two-motor additional magnetic aircrafts are expected to be recursive at the events of 17-21 November.
The part of the behind aircraft, especially if 9 or 10 persons are sit in a series, is central in the statements on the economic efficiency of new “mini-aebouties” projects.
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will be 406 persons, from the economic classe of more than 17 dpi in wide ranges of 10 in each series.
Airbus said that its competitive version A350 will be transported to a class of 350 persons on the seats of a width of 18 dpi, which is 9 in a series.
Auto-release guigans are often interchanged with technical attacks using a professional press advertising.
Now Airbus is directly addressed to the public before the aircraft in Dubai, where 777X is expected to be leader of more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated how to start a new advertising war, showed the funders of the slade that pictured three men in the restaurant who wanted each other, named “Do you agree to this?”
“Boeing offers further magic fleet on seats more closer than regional carbovine flights,” said the director of Airbus John Liki.
With a change in food ratio, people take weight, but the airlines have not been cardinally changed.
Between the beginning of the 1970s, the broadfood Boeing 747 has led to modern further trip standards, and the slowest average American men's weight of 40 to 49 years of age increased by 10 per cent, according to the United States Health Department.
The talent of a medium-american man in the 21th century is 39.7-second, based on the statistical data of the US Health Service.
Airbus claims that its competitor is holding the concept of the 1950s, when the average rate of the talents of those recently called “reactive publishing” was already.
Airbus said that a study showed that the additional thin in the seat wide range improves the quality of sleep at 53 per cent.
Boeing opposes airbus digits on seat size and says that the manufacturers should not be involved in decisions on how aircraft balances are found between taxes and goods.
In its words, the study shows that the goodness of the salon is not only depending on the seat width.
“Indeed, the aircraft is providing to the election companions and the possibility to do what they have to do in order to achieve success,” said the specialist Boeing on Kent Craver's sloves.
They don't want us to decide for them to bring their profits.
They know their business better than anyone else.
The question for passengers is to increase the space on the side, but the suppliers are increasingly a factor that may affect profit.
The controversy is a shock of aircraft orders estimated at least $700 billion per catalogue prices in the nearest decades - enough to change the proportion of the United States and European export.
As the first reported in July, the seat position was that the struggle between the new reactory aircrafts is undergone to the struggle.
As Airbus and Boeing declare that the 20 per cent of the gains increased in one place in their last two-motor additional magic models compared to the market leader in this segment, 365-local Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing's declared characteristics are partly based on the comparison of 10 rows 777X with the original 9-local component of the constructive decision 7777.
The winning of certain self-reliance is reduced by comparison with a 10-local company currently used.
“The risk in which Boeing does this is to get more places and make his aircraft more competitive than our developments,” said Kevin Kenstoon, head of the Airbus Traveller's Comfort in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that salons with fully 10 lines for the existing 777 are indicated that many passengers prefer a meat race that may go over the hand with lower taxes.
“The sydeny of a width eighth duke would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that the Airbus’s proposal was threatened by the 777th model,” said the specialist, on the interview of Mary Kirby, the founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not set a box, but they propose the directory of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
Training aircrafts at peace even takes a routine to check competitive planning.
By enhancing the comfort, all producers also propose a flight with a very fleshy company for the budgetary aircraft and regional shipping company.
Airbus proposes A350 with 10-style lines, but he says that she did not sell it yet.
Having recently, Airbus emphasized the need for additional adaptations to the salon, proposing a more broader shipping place on some of its flights.
Without support of the only other large modern aircraft producer, as the experts say, it calls to the new sector standard instead of flying, but may be highlighted from the sales rails of the model 777X.
New anti-nicotine vaccine may avoid the smoking process of satisfaction
scientists have developed an antinicotine vaccine that could avoid smoking tobacco.
One pre-vacuum was able to protect the mouse from nicotine dependance throughout the life.
There are further tests before the testing is needed for a few years, but Professor Ronald Cristal from the medical college Wayl Cornel in New York said that the first results were the results.
“We are very hoped that this vaccine application strategy may finally help millions of smokers that have tried to shoot all methods today on the market, but have found that their nicotin dependence is sufficiently strong to survive it through these modern means,” said Professor Cornel.
New vaccine contains an improper virus that was developed to provide genetic information for the production of anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus is selectively infected by the pigs cells that then start to produce a stabil anticorps flow.
Antitecles survive any nicotine molecules in blood by neutralising them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker of nicotine attack.
In the tests of vaccinated muscles that later gave nicotin continued their normal activity.
And the muscles that weren't given in vaccine were "sneaked" and this is the sign of Nicotin's arrival to their brain, says the researchers.
These experiments are described in Science Translational Medicine.
Previous taxi vaccines suffered from failure because they had a anticorps.
In order to keep the high level of anticorps, the skins needed to do so often that they had become good and non-operative.
But the value of the new vaccine would probably be much lower because it transforms the pig cells into the anti-tle factory.
Professor Cristal said if the future human vaccine would be fully safe, it would be possible to give children before they try to smoke, preventing nicotin dependence.
But more likely it's going to be used by smokers to smoke.
“They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not receive satisfaction from this because of the nicotine vaccine, and that may help them to get away from this attraction,” he said.
The British scientists said that the results were interested, but warned that additional studies were needed.
Oils: Third agriculture of the Sub-Substitute are completely available
The Sub-Mosk Goal Vice-Gubernament, Juria Olyner, stated that almost the third rural villages of Moscow are fully compliant
The total allocation of the region ' s budget receives 187 populations from 288.
In 2013, 187 visits from 288 receipt of the area budget.
A certain amount of expenditure income in the budget of 122 rural populations exceeds 50 per cent and 83 per cent.
The budget safeguards of the area budget are ordered to 25 billion rubbers,” said Olyns.
The Vice-Gubernate also noted that only in three urban populations, the Mutitia, the single and Pusino budget income is more than 1 billion rule for 2013.
Income in agriculture in many regions of less than 3 million rubbers, "that is fail".
The expenditure of the local administrative device in 88 submissions is more than 70 per cent, " which is observed by the decline of the quality of services", stated Olympics.
He previously appointed the heads of municipal education of the Sub-Subs until the end of November, to consider what residences need to be restructured, linked to urban districts or changed by the administrative system.
These proposals will be made up to the end of January.
Before this, the Governor of Moscow stated that the Administrative Reform in the Submuseum plans to reduce the number of rural housing.
Also, in the Mojay, Kashshire, the Solnekar, the Colombian regions, the Luberty and the Cotelniks, there are requests for municipalization.
The discussion of the issue in the cities and regions of the region begins in November.
The President of the Munition of Jord Bresself also stated that it was planned for some 30 rural populations in 12 areas of the Subspace.
This is linked to the fact that, from the 178 rural populations in the Sub-Mapt, less thirds have a "acceptable" financial basis and 100 is admissible.
Diana Arbeniina replied Helloud with his children
Diana Arbeniina does not cover the great joy that she receives from the education of her children.
In spite of what is now, Armenia gives a lot of time to creativity and public activities, she still finds the possibility of returning to Marto and Artom, which is not only time for their education but also to develop as possible.
In the last week, Diana was twice read before his worshipers about their pedagogical talents.
First she posted a photo in Facebook, which she shows how to teach children to read.
Tonight, he was talking about the fans, showing how Artema and Martha were embarrassed on Helloud.
Our first halloween is ready to go to the legs, so he called Diana's photo of his children in the celebration costums.
What is unwise, since they have no other Russian boys and girls with regard to this feast because they were born in America.
Germany first in Europe introduces the "indefinite gender" at the registration of children
Germany will become the first country in Europe, where children born by hermphrodites are allowed instead of men or women ' s "indetermined " .
Parents will be entitled to leave the “poly” graph in a witness to the birth of an incomplete.
Instead of "F" or "M" parents may record "X" (not specified).
This decision is intended to not underline the parents to the speed of the "determination" field operation.
According to statistics, one of the 2,000 newborns in the world is a hermafroduit.
Thirds refused that the influence of Obed
The former Minister of Labour of New South Wales, Joe Trimou, will be a figure of investigation of the anti-corruption supervisory body of the State.
The former Minister of New South Wales, Joe Trimoy, is checking the changes in the order of the prior objects on request of his political employer, Eddie Obad, who was secretly owner of the duties in three objects of impairment in the State.
The independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC) extended its investigation of Mr. Obeid in a number of ministers of State for the proliferation of the Arrangements in Serkular Kii, where the family Obeids belonged to two restaurants and cafes, without a tendor after the expiration of their action in August 2005.
She now examines the approximation that Mr. Trimoy knew the secret participation of Mr. Obeid in non-motive objects, after the indication of the data by the former Vice-Chairman of the Administration, Mr. Trigoy, Linn Ashpoul, on Friday.
During the years of the discussions started in 2005, the Government urged the open competition.
Ardenators were against this, and they also wanted more long terms of awards.
In 2009, Enterprises for Cercullar Kie, who provided the Ocean family $2.5 million per year, were extended without open competition.
Mr. Trichoy, Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, originally spoke for open competitions.
But he refused that changes were made on request by Mr. Obeid, who, as Mr. Trifoy acknowledged, recommended to make changes in the army policy of the Government.
In August and September 2007, Mr. Obeid, Mr. Trifoy and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the Ministry of Ports after working under the leadership of Mr. Obeid in the Fisheries Division.
“As a question discussed during the phone conversation, is the development of the commercial arance policy,” asked Commissioner Antony Wilil, Mr. Trichoy.
"No," said Mr. Trihoy.
I can't remember what we've discussed, but it's certainly not.
It's not just between me and Mr. Ode.
According to the high-employed official, Israeli military aircraft attack the goals in Syria
The high official of the Fox News interview confirmed that Israeli military aircrafts attacked the Syrian port of Lattakia on Friday night.
The official didn't state that it was for the purpose, but he said, at least one.
The “Association Press” reports that the aim of Russian production SA-125 was to be missed.
At least two times ago in this year, Israel shipped ships with missiles within Syria.
Foreign work on sub-class visa may be tested at "justice"
The “reality” test for foreign workers at Classe 497 is being reviewed by the Government, as it notes the expansion of repressive measures.
The test, in the case of its adoption, will be applied under criteria for preventing the use of the visa of class 477 to comply with unabled posts or as a lace for the movement of family and friends in Australia.
The document submitted by the Government was published today, while the former League-Deputy Maxine McKu discovered the ritric of the Government on foreign work, said that it could be bound by the neighbouring of Australia.
“Another declaration of the type of "extraordinary people at the end of the race" and "the first work of the Australians" represents a very unpleasant disappearance at the time when the professionals needed the protected labour market,” she states today in the Australian Institute.
It was historicly meaning that the white work was to protect - and if some in the region had seen the rejection of this historical art, I wouldn't surprise.
The document presented is 12 measures previously considered by the former Minister of Immigration by Kris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration of Brendan O'Connor, who was eve in Sri Lanke, where he meets official persons on human contract, has already made five of the recommended changes, and the remainders are at the stage of consideration.
If “justice” criteria are adopted, the applicant may be investigated to obtain a visibility in order to “examine whether a candidate is subject to a condition when the candidate is a parent or a close owner or a person with a company financing.”
The undertakings may also need to be counted on the number of owners of sub-class-57, since the undertakings that were intended to spend a small number of employees, then took hundreds of workers.
Between the 35-year-old sri Lanka, who seeks rescue, died from the inflation after the arrival of the ship with refugees on the island of Christmas on that week.
The murdered nine-year-old son of the man led him on the road to Australia, and from the death of his father in the midst, he supported a two-year-old brother who was also on the board.
Australian authorities were successfully sent to a man to the hospital of Christmas Island where he died.
The friend of Semen Varlamma said that okkinist suffered by alcoholism
A friend of the okcayist Semen Varlamom of the European Union stated that it suffered by alcoholism is transmitted to the Russian News Service.
"He has no idea of how to stop drinking," she said, in particular, a woman.
Remember, the Bavarianic was sent to the court for the murder of the Russian College Semen Varlamom, who is also a member of the Corrodo Club.
As she said, the okkeyist shocked her for his hair, and he slaughtered her - after the attack, the hands, the shooting, and the shoes were damaged.
Varlamom himself came to the police of Denver and acknowledged the destruction, detailedly described the event.
He was arrested, but later he was released in $5,000.
The court was not limited to the sports movement in the country but prohibited approaching to the Bavarianic.
He is also threatening prison until six years of domestic violence.
The Government of the United Kingdom has announced a study aimed at improving the economic effects for Skotlands from the project of the HS2 carriage magistrate.
The HS2 draft proposes the opening of high growth communication with Skotland and Northern England, with the beginning of the first stage in 2026
The Minister of Transport of Baroness Cramer noted that the project “United the United Kingdom”.
The Minister of Transport of Skotlandia, China Brown, said that it would be “in shopping” from the prospect of planning with the Government of Britain.
The first stage will be in the construction of a new high-encreased iron line between London and West-Midlands.
When the second stage is closed, the lines will be placed in Manchester and Lides.
In June, the Government reviewed the estimated value of the construction of a high-quality line between London and the northern England from £32.7 to £42.6 billion.
The Government of the United Kingdom, which conducts negotiations with Scotland Transport, urged HS2 Ltd to consider further improvement in the slow-scale and reduced travel costs to Northern England and Skotland.
This should include the possibility of crossing the road from Glasgo and Edinburgh in London for three hours or less.
Baronese Kramer said: “We aim for HS2 to create a real national network that will make Britain and its city close to each other.”
We are developing HS2 because the benefits that it will give are great.
Without him, we're going to face the crisis of passing capacity in our iron-related network.
However, it is also about the transport of cities; 18 cities, including Glasgo and Edinburgh, will be better received by HS2.
The Skotlands Hospital Alister Carmachel added: “The most annual declaration is a good news for Skotland.”
On behalf of the Skotlan Government, China Brown called on Mr. Karマイcle to support the integration of the Skotlands into the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: “The high-scale iron road has all the opportunities to bring great economic benefits in Scotia, but also adds the economic weight of Scotia in general arguments for high growth in the whole of the United Kingdom.”
We therefore are pleased to work in partnership with the Government of the United Kingdom in order to consider the options of building a high-scale iron road in Scotia, creating benefits for all and continue towards the coal line of Glasgo, Edinburgh, which is already planned by the Skotlandian Government.
I would like to wait to consider the results of the study with the British Ministers in the next year and to adopt a joint decision on the following steps.
Tori is a new hope of nuclear energy?
Governments in the whole world continue to think about how to ensure energy needs.
Hidrocarbons (which they are) are negatively affected by climate.
Renewed energy sources require large ranges of generation.
A atomic energy is not otherwise, but remains afterwards the mass of the roads in the notification of wastes.
Recently, scientists focused on the third, another radioactive element of the Mendelassev system.
He meets around the world, and, as specialists say, his discharge does not leave waste that should be saved for centuries.
Rules of use of electronic aircraft devices in Australia until it remains in force
The Australian aircraft passengers will also need to be removed from their plans and phones during the flight and shipping, despite measures in the United States to eliminate the device data rules.
The Federal Aviation Office of the United States allowed American transporters to change their procedures so that passengers could read electronic books, view or play on their devices during the flight and flights, provided that they would remain in the Field Rey.
The passengers can already do this during the main part of the fleet, but many disappoint that they do not have access to their electronic books during the flight and shipping.
Australian transporters consider the decision required by the American airlines to carry out a great number of work to comply with new requirements but indicated that they are not planning to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Security Office also noted that they considered this statement, but stressed that the limitation of the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases still worked in Australia.
“The security management of civil aviation fleet has no special rules to regulate the use of electronic devices in aircraft” said it.
This issue is regulated by the rules required by the aircrafts to ensure security at any time and by passengers to comply with the security rule of which the escape members report.
The Virgin company, which had already discussed with the Office of Civil Aviation Safety, was not against changes, but said that it would follow the regulationr's instructions.
“We would welcome the consideration of the Office of Civil Aviation Safety on the authorisation of the use of electronic devices, as we really think that it will improve the quality of customer services now when it (unfortunate deployment system) is on our flights,” said the secretariat.
Qantas stated that the rules of procedure would be maintained at this time.
“ Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during the flight and floor, and in the nearest time we are not planning to change it,” she stated.
FAU is distributed to American airlines.
However, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will, of course, study the decision of the FAU and the reasons that it has taken.
For the United States transporters, the impact of the decision will vary from the aircraft to the aircraft and depend on the age of their aircraft.
Transporters should prove that their flights have sustainability to radio-auditors from mobile devices, as well as to review supports, training materials, handboard standards and instructions for passengers.
“If the aircraft checks and confirms its fleet, it may authorize passengers to use portable, light electronic devices such as planners, electronic books and spotphones at any height,” states FAU.
In several cases, the escape will give indications to passengers to disable their devices during the flight.
In addition, in accordance with the recommendation of the group, the harder devices should be placed under the seats or in high shuttles during the flight and floor.
The Dagestian head hears the footnotes of extremism in Kubani
The football shop between "Angie" and "Kubaanu" was in a political collision between the authorities of the Krusodarland and Daguestan after the slaughter of the Dagyzstan flag, and Mr. Kubani smiled in a age.
Head of Dagestan Ramazan Abdulatiff, on Friday, invited the Republican parliamentars to go to the court, since the Gunn of the Krusodar area would call for an international discrepance, in particular call for war with "busurmans".
Take the jinn of the Cross dark, which has been adopted in 1995.
It's a shock, and no one does it.
"O you here remember the mother of the family, the enemy, the enemy, we're going to the death battle" - for which such words to be recorded in the himn, to bring some of the believers to the other believers," expressed the solidarity with the Abulathian Chairman Parliament.
Putin's impunity for his friend Asad
Now, news from the ocean, which is from Syria, where we have known today, Israel has attacked the Russian production missiles, which, in the message, called Hezbolle.
Today, Syria has fulfilled the important condition to destroy its production of chemical weapons until 1 November.
This was made within the framework of a Russian agreement and an envoyed United States not to conduct a military operation to which they had been shocked in the summer.
More details of the weapons and that all this means for the Syrian President will tell our primary international representative Richard Engel.
Washington stated that the regime of Assad would be punished for this.
More than 1400 peaceful inhabitants, including hundreds of children, died in August from equivalent gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombs, but in the form of a treaty built by a friend Asad Vladimir Putin.
Syria is denied from its chemical weapons to the middle of the next year.
And today, it's the important time.
The International Experts Group reported that Syria had issued declared manufactures for chemical production.
The longer-term and harder task is the destruction of the tons of chemical weapons and components to it.
As we understand, it's about thousands of tons.
Washington said that the days of Asad were shocked.
I think Assad's got to go.
The question is not whether it will happen, but when it happens.
He's not a lithium, and he's got to go.
But Asad remains.
And it feels more secure.
His troops are still using artilleries, missiles and shocks.
His opposers are dismissed and badly armed.
His people are forced to leave their homes, and many are hungry.
Some need to take care of skins and skins.
Many believe that Bashar Assad has avoided punishment for massive murder.
Chemical weapons agreements are the success of diplomacy, the inspectors condemned the Nobel World Prize, and Asad himself made an impression of a person prepared to cooperate.
Today, in Washington, the United States Ambassador in Syria had to answer unfair questions.
When a child dies from hunger, his mother is not easier than being killed by chemical weapons.
Asad's still holding.
And weapon changes to power.

In Singapore's owners are good, while the medium class is difficult
In the Benderim Trade Center in Singapore Janani Amortharing, a golden brassleet, a roll and a series in order to pay the school education of her daughter.
“ My husband and I have just purchased the house, so all my money are in place,” says Ms. Amorthalynga.
Although it has $3,000 ($2400) per month as a administrator and her husband works, the monthly income of the family is not enough, she says.
Indeed, in various parts of South-East Asia, where household debt grows, the valueMax, where it carries its trade, became a third squad registered on the Singapore fund.
It is not just a fast way to get money (S$1300 in the case of Mrs. Amorthalynga), but also almost as much as uncertain bank credits.
In Singapore, hambates are usually the effective annual rate of 17 per cent — more than 15.4 per cent proposed in the United Overseas Bank Office, local creditor with the branch in the same trade centre.
However, lombards have the advantage that they do not require creditability checking or payment evidence and can provide credits faster than banks.
Thus, millions of people in the whole region are in low-border, since families feel the pressure due to the increased value of life and rapid growth of household debt and consumers.
After five years of sustainable growth following a world financial crisis, and decreased credits undertaken by free monetary and environmental policy in developing economy, families with low and medium-sized income are in low-scale to compensate the reducing of income through the slowening of their economy.
In this week, Standard & Poor's, the Rating Agency, has indicated the increase in the family credit duty, mainly because of the growth of the epothetics, as a factor of the risk for the creditability of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest level of household debt to the monetary internal product in Asia.
Malaysia made this list from 80 per cent of UNHCR compared to 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high-level of consumer debt in Thailand, which had been out of the technical recession in that week.
In the fourth meeting, the continued export reduction and the decrease of consumer demand were shown.
“In fact, with the increased prices of people in the average and lower part [income], they will search for ways to fill their income where they can only be able,” says Seng Seung Won, Economist CIMB, the Malaysian bank.
In the past two years, the high prices of gold have increased the speed that people make personal things, since they use the possibility of obtain money for their family reducing.
In Singapore about 70 per cent of the substances consigned in 200 swimming pounds of the city of State are gold.
People say: “The prices are good for gold, let us put the gold cup of grandfathers and get it back in the next month. ”
In Thailand, EasyMoney's larger operator had observed the increase in the number of customers using its offices in the past months to 20 per cent.
The growth in the low-border business is that valueMax, the operational in Benderim and 15 other in Singapore, is planned to expand not only in the neighbourhood of Malaysia, where he has four shops, but also in the borders of Asia, he says, the Executive Director of ValueMax.
The company will finance the expansion using 60 per cent of S$66 million in the week as a result of the location of Singapore funds.
While some creditors argued the criticism of high rates, Ms. Yeah said that lonbard is not only proposing more lower rates than other creditors, it does not also increase the debt directly.
“A clients have the objects they have already owned, and the monetation of individual assets does not increase household debts,” she says.
The scheme is an increasing public recognition as a means for the receipt of a short-term financing.
In this regard, lambs are not only used by the categories of persons who are in a serious financial situation.
Guest people in Singapore are also using the valueMax office, providing gold swimming or Rolex hour, which can give up to 60 per cent of their purchase value.
We're seeing customers from all parts of society.
“They include state persons who need to take money for commercial projects or investments, or undertaking a small business that is necessary to overcome temporary money difficulties,” says Ms. Yik.
Sometimes they just need money very fast.

Savings package of $325 million to Tajikistan
The Federal Government urges the savings package of $325 million for the weak health system of Tajikistan will be supplemented by a heavy condition that ensures that the Government of the State does not lose funds.
The Federal Minister of Health, Tana Plybersk, declared that the Society takes “urgent measures” to prevent the older crisis of the island’s population, the higher chronic disease and restrictions of the system.
The financing decision was adopted for four years after the Government's consultation with the independent Deputy Tasmania Andrew Wilki.
“The relationship has proposed a package of extreme salvation measures that we believe will solve specific problems faced by the state,” said today Mrs. Plibersek.
The package of $325 million includes $31 million for planning operations.
More than 2600 operations, including ortodotic and cataractic disposal operations, are helping to continue departure.
There are also money for ill-feed clinics without pre-reporting records, in Hobart and London to increase the quality of departure after the station, training of medical experts, psychological health services and introduction of personal electronic cards in local hospitals.
“ These investments will go to the pre-specific doctors of the idea how to help Tasmanian health systems, ” said Mrs. Pliberus.
The Minister said that the Government of Tajika would work in a strict reporting and responsibilities regime.
The State will be required to support the current level of financing to receive money from the Society, and to take account of the cost of the additional resources.
The Commission of three persons will be established to ensure that the State provides services as effective and effective.
Mr. Wilki said today that $325 million would not be resolved, “if the real reform will be followed to the Tajik health system on a more sustainable basis”.
However, he endorsed the Government for the response to his request for urgent assistance to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
“I hope that the federal assistance package will contribute significantly to the outcome of the health system from the state of critical state,” said Mr. Wilson.
According to the Government of the State, these additional election procedures are significantly compensating recent reduction.
However, the Federal Opposition Representative for Health Peter Datton believes that the current statement is “the decision of the same lacuna”.
“The risk we are here is that the Leabolist Government has led to $430 million from health systems,” said ABC TV.
When the State government decreases almost half billion dollars and the Commonwealth contributes to 300 million, it is impossible to make good news.
Mr. Datton requested Mrs. Plybersex to ensure that no dollar from the saving package will be paid for additional bureaucracy.
The screening of Geum Nikla Romana Danny Didro may be encouraging the exceptional decree and historic details, but it is also more seriously understood than it should be.
The film, acting in France of the 1760s, tells the smiling history of Susan, a youth aristocratic sent to his family monastery.
When she begins to boot, she experiences extreme brutality from the hands of the Sadiest and becomes an object of erotic fantasies for others.
The movie is never going to post or sense — and it's all the problem.
Because of its serious tragicity, the event is a risk of being tested by a shock and for audience.
Syria has destroyed its instruments of chemical weapons, said the observer group
Syria has destroyed the main equipment for the production of chemical weapons and bombs with equivalent gas, declared in the fourth of the international observing group, while inflicted cuttings were shocked in the northern country near one of the objects where they believe that toxic substances were stored.
The Syrian active group also stated that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of civil war in the country almost three years ago.
The statement of the Organization on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made for one day before
The extreme deadline of 1 November established by the organization established in Hague in order to destroy or delete Damaskus all the means of production of chemical weapons and mechanisms that enable chemical substances to slow up with equivalent gas and to fill the bombs.
Confirming that it is a primary stage of destruction, the important season in an ambicium graph, which aims to destroy all chemical weapons of Damascus in the midst of 2014.
The destruction of the equipment means that Syria cannot produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus is still to begin the destruction of existing weapons and stocks.
The country, as they believe, has about 1000 tons of chemical materials and weapons, including heat gas and nervous gas.
This statement was made during the terrible battles in the town of Safira, where, in the view of experts, there is an object for the production of chemical weapons, as well as its guarding place, reports that the Syrian Centre for Human Rights is based in Britain.
The active group, who monitored the losses through the network of activists in Syria, stated on Thursday that 120.296 people died.
From that number, as stated, 61 067 were civilians, including 6365 children.
From the Government, the group stated that 29,954 men were members of the armed forces of the President of Bashar Assad, 18 678 were the prosecutors and 187 Lebanese combats.
Even among the dead, as stated in the statement, were 2202 armed overseers and about 5375 opposition combaters, many of them were foreigners.
According to the UN evaluation of 25 July, 1000,000 died in conflict since March 2011.
Since then, the number has not been updated.
The conflict drove about 2 million people to run out of the country.
Assad's war for a few weeks in Safire was struggled with the forces, many of whom are related to the Al-Qaida groups.
The Centre stated that the victims of both parties were on Thursday, but did not bring specific data.
The Bos emphasized the dangers faced by the chemical weapons inspectors that were filled with the deadlines of their mission for the release of Syria from the Toxic Arsenal, in the disaster of the continuing civil war.
In the Declaration of the OSC, which works closely with the United Nations, it states that its team was “this satisfied with the fact that it had checked and seen all declared Syrians critically important production and equipment for interacting/contracting”.
She added that “no further inspection activities are currently planned”.
The inspectors claimed that they had completed the first round of checking, visiting 21 of 23 installations declared by Damay.
They couldn't visit two places from the security meetings, they said inspectors.
On Thursday, the OHCHR stated that both locations were moved in other declared places that were checked.
It could not immediately find whether there was one of the two places that OHCH inspectors couldn't visit.
Syria presented the full plan for the destruction of its chemical weapons, which should be adopted in the next month by the Executive Committee of the OSCE.
“I welcome the courage and closing you all demonstrated in the implementation of the most complex mission that has ever been taken by this organization,” said the Director-General of the observer group Ahmet Uzuimaj in the comments published by the OHCH.
The third year of civil war has been the rebellion, mainly the Islamic Sunnites, with the Government of Asad and its security forces, which are members of its alibi section, the response of the Shit Islam.
As regards other events, the Headquarter of Rami Abdulachman said that it was a strong explosion in the Mediterranean Oil in the coastal province of Syria.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Anger because of the condemnation of the terrorists in Bali
The remaining 202 victims of the bombs in Bali, in 2002, had been angryly reacted to the condemnation of the last complainant who had been sentenced before the court and claimed that Urmar Pattex had to be shot.
Patete, who spent nearly 10 years of fleet as one of the most discovered people in South-East Asia, was sentenced last 20 years of freedom for his role in establishing explosive devices used during therapy.
It may be released for 15 years if it is obtained a timely release.
The 45-year-old sentence was acknowledged as a result of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, where 202 people, including 88 Australians, died.
He was also acknowledged by a number of other terrorism accused, including the worst explosions of the church throughout Indonesia in Christmas Canon in 2000.
The prosecutors needed a lifetime, although they could like to claim that a person called “submerger” for their reputation for the production of explosive devices should be sentenced to the death penalty.
This decision has affected the illness of mother memories from Perth Juni Cortin, who had lost his 39-year-old neighbors Jane and Jenney's daughters in the therapy carried out by Patek and his messagers nearly 10 years ago.
She said that Patterson should be sentenced to the death penalty.
“I really think he must follow the stages of others.
He must be before the shooting team,” said Ms. Cortin AAP.
“I must live every day, knowing that I will have no grandsons, and I will not see my daughters.”
The Sara Club was destroyed when a massive explosive device was carried out outside the furgone, immediately after the 11th weekend of 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was in the Paddy's Bar where the terrorist was shocking the shooting shooting, starting the explosion, just 20 seconds ago.
After that, he entered a month in whom and “more” three times, being connected to the life-care system.
Mr. Huez said that Pattery should share the participation of the three other terrorist cell "Jama Islam" responsible for blood-related fight, named Amrosi, Muslas and Samourah, who were sentenced four years ago.
Indeed, this man has more death punishment than all.
No reason to save him life, uh, no reason to keep him alive.
20 years after he killed 202 people and blessed hundreds, it is not so much.
Patte is the last of the terrorist participants in Bali, represented by the court.
He was hidden for almost ten years, but finally he was detained in the Pakistan City of Abbottabad, where the American troops killed the former Head of Al-Qaida, Usaum Ben Laden, less than four months later.
During the judicial election, the FBI showed that the data showed that Packy was in Pakistan to meet Ben Laden in trying to restore the relationship between the terrorism groups of South-East Asia and Al-Qaida.
“It's not gone,” said Mrs. Cortin.
Before recently, he was not regretted about how pain he had caused others.
The sentence was made in the 10th anniversary of the terrorist, which will later be observed in Bali and Australia.
“In this year there will be much laugh,” says Mrs. Cortin.
The patent can still condemn his sentence.
FAU: “Aviation passengers can now use aircraft (not calling with mobile phone)”.
Abiasaggers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the fleet to read, work, play, look at movies and listen to music, but not talking on mobile phones, according to the long-term new guidelines published in the Federal Aviation Management.
But passengers should not expect to change immediately.
As soon as this change will be implemented, it will be depending on the aircraft, said the Administrator of the FAU Michael Wart at the press conference.
Aviation companies should show FAU how their aircrafts respond to the new guidelines and that they update their training assistance for slow-scale and boarding rules to comply with new guidelines.
FAU stated that it had already received plans from some aircrafts to enhance the use of portable electronic devices in flights.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that have already submitted plans.
“In depending on the state of the plan, we could accept the extensive use of electronic devices very fast,” said FAU.
The passengers now have to disable their phones, planners and other devices when the aircraft is closed.
They should not restart them until the aircraft does not reach the height of 10 000 feet and the captain will not give it a good.
The passengers must disable their device again when the aircraft is low and do not include them until the aircraft is on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, the aircraft whose aircraft aircraft is properly protected from electronic flights may allow passengers to use these devices during the flight, flights and rupture, stated FAU.
Most new aircrafts and other aircraft modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at large high levels, as expected, meet these criteria.
Laura Gladying, President of the Group of Professional Borders Association, welcomed these changes.
“ As the new policy will be well-established (and we're going to work closely with the transporter to achieve this), it will be an unproduced option,” said Gladeing.
We were smelling to feel “schooled in school” when the case comes to this matter.
But the connection to the Cerfing Internet, the exchange of electronic letters, text communications or downloads will still be prohibited at least 100,000 feet higher level, reported the Agency.
The passengers will be proposed to change their phones, plannings and other devices in the aircraft mode.
Thus, no "Wolf with friends" is an intellectual Internet game in which Alex Boldin played on his phone in 2011 when we had been able to get out of the American Airline flight because he refused to disable the device when the aircraft was in the flight.
And the harder devices, such as notes, will continue to be put into the bathroom because they can hurt someone if they fly on the whole floor.
The phone calls in the field will still be prohibited.
Regular telephone powers belong to the Federal Commission of Relationship, not FAU.
FAU may remove the prohibition of certain electronic devices during flights and flights
In the last month, the National Transport Security Advisory, the CBS News Security Expert, said that hundreds of phones still were considered as a risk.
“The phones are really a problem, not only because they can make places for navigation devices but we know through the CCF that they can create a range for more than a hundred connections when the flight is in the air,” said Redner.
The Branch Advisory Committee established by FAU to study this issue recommended in the last month that the Government should authorize more use of personnel electronic devices.
In the past few years, pressure on the FAO has been raised in order to reduce their use of limitations.
Critics, such as Senator democracy from the state of Missouri McKaskil, argued that there is no provision for bans.
The observance of limitations is also more difficult to ensure, since the application of the device has become universal.
Some research shows that passengers forget or ignoring the indication of their devices.
FAU began to limit the use of electronic passengers in 1966 in response to the posts for navigation and communication equipment when passengers began to bring FM radio-accessors — high-technological shoes at that time.
New aircrafts are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations, but are also developed and supported by FAU as sustained to electronic fires.
Abia Company has proposed passengers to use Wi-Fi at the Crescer height for a few years.
The wifi system is also more sustainable to the fires.
The majority of the shipping rays are available to larger use of electronic devices in accordance with the new guidelines, said Werta.
Today, electronic devices are generally removed radio switchs as much lower than the previous generation of devices.
Electronic books, for example, are removed only the minimum signals when the page is moved.
But signals are more powerful when the device is loaded or sent data.
The Amazon.com company was among those who pursue the limitations to use electronic passengers.
In 2011, the representatives of the company loaded the entire aircraft of their devices to read the e-children books and flyed to check the problems that exist, but they did not find them.
Members of the Advisory Committee expressed disappointed feelings regarding whether the instrument is arising.
The Advocate Kidd from the National Aviation of Aviation Aviation said that it was considered to be real, even if the risk was minimumed.
Other members of the Committee said that only individual pilot communications were made to confirm that the device could establish places for aviation systems, and most of these communications were very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAO permits the pilots to demand to disable the device during the installation at limited visibility conditions.
The Group of Representatives of the Tourist Industry welcomed these changes by calling them a healthy step to meet passengers who now use many technological devices.
“We are glad that FAU recognizes that passenger comfort is not incompatible with security and protection,” said Roger Dou, Director-General of the United States Tourist Association.
Auto schools will be able to examine the driving rights
The exams to driving rights will be able to take private companies with their own computer-based car.
In this regard, "Commercent" refers to the Government's draft decision "The permits to the management of vehicles".
According to the newspaper, now in Russia is about 30 such vehicles.
The results of internal testing are expected to be taken to students of such "awarded" autonomy.
In that regard, the Hosato Inspection will conduct a monitoring of reviews each half of the year.
If it is found that more than 30 per cent of theoretical reviews and more than 20 per cent of the students have not received from the first time, this school will be free for a half year.
The technical requirements for automotives contained in the Government's draft decision shall enter into force from 5 November 2014.
The draft also contains requirements for training for the primary of two-cololated technology.
From 1 January 2015, motorcycle owners for the obtaining of rights of category A should provide a review in the conditions of urban movement.
In addition, from 5 May 2014 the company will not be able to work for foreign drivers with illegal rights.
Such employees should receive Russian rights after the examination.
A bird shipped by air in a safe place in the North Sea is returned to the beach of nature
The bird, switched at the beach after it was found in the state of the ocean in the North Sea, was returned to the beach of nature.
The water passenger was placed in the helicopter sent to Aberdin last month and then entered the Scotland Society for the Prevention of Common Training (SPCA) in the Savior Center in Alloa.
The manager of the Centre of Colin Seeddon said: “This is probably a water passport from Northern Europe, which has slovened in the area of strong winds over the North Sea.”
It seems that the bird was shocked and able to find a coffee shock.
He added: "He was not able to flee again, so they called for us."
The water pasture was healthy and in a good condition until he was released.
Is Elite Europe ready to take business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the obligation to gather business representatives and to determine what changes the well-being and workplaces of Britain want to see in the EU.
To that end, we have stated the greatest and most comprehensive investigation of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts about Britain, business and the EU.
YouGov's company asked more than 1000 business leaders representing a wide range of business in Britain on size, sectors and regions.
The conclusions of the survey are unexpected for many.
We have found that the most enterprises are currently looking for export possibilities for the border of Europe, giving particular attention to countries that are modernized and growing, while the EU countries are in the West.
They want the Government to give a priority to new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, not to have spent time for the debt and difficult reform of the EU institutions.
When they asked their views on specific political issues, from anti-monopolitical regulation to the Production Acts, most leaders believed that the control of these key components should be returned to Westminster.
There was a general involuntary of a single market, with business representatives said that the expenditure from Brussels is now transferred of the benefits from the trade zone of Europe, and even 40 per cent of the largest enterprises, traditionally the most industrialized from all companies.
The last and most indicative is our business leaders' investigation showed that the clear majority of Great Britain wants to change the treaty and relations with the EU based on trade, not on policy.
This result, which has been observed among the enterprises of all sizes and the largest business groups, shows that business is a significant change that will return to Britain.
Higher rates: the achievement of the treaty changes and the more favourable conditions for Britain will ensure 16 per cent of the vote in order to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not have any doubts: this question shows that the British business supports its plan to revise the conditions of membership in the EU.
He also pointed out that business expects that the review will bring a significant increase in the current balance of force back to the side of Britain.
The best conditions for the British business are possible and are increasingly necessary while the euro enters into a closer economic and financial association.
The priority should be given to the workplace and economic growth in Britain, and, as our survey shows, this means a strong focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels regulatory activities.
The US Special Services listen to the personal phone of the Pope of Rome
Vatican’s activity is under the guard control of the American Special Services.
New documents from the Edward Snowden collection show that the U.S. investigation has conducted all the negotiations of the previous Pope Benedict, and now the Papy of France is deeply opposed.

All of this has been the head of one of the largest animal companies of the country, President of the Russian Union of Isaak Sheps at the IIIth Annual Conference of the Institut Adam Smith "Thura of a daily question in Russia", which was just concluded in Moscow.
It was discussed by the public market regulation.
From 2008 to 2012 the Russian bird market has already reduced 18 per cent, since in the last few years the country has seen a significant increase in the control of the animal sector in the production and trafficking of birds, with small alcohol, reported to Sheps.
None of the world has such a heavy limitation to the market of birds, which is unpredicted in all new and non-logical bans that are based on the ways of combating alcohol abuse.
The drinker said that many legislative bans aimed at decreasing alcohol abuse did not have a particular impact, but all new initiatives were constant.
More than all of the animal producers have been shocked by the ban on sales of oxygen since this year.
"We lost 35,000 consumers immediately," said Isaac Sheps.
Two predictions for the coming year.
Optimist is the one who Sheps said: Sell drinks are on the previous level.
Psychiatically, there will be more 2-3 per cent.
In order to maintain their arrival, businessmen have to go away from the shoes raised to the consumer in the "premium" classe: the drink will be less, but it will stand the road.
Between, radicular consequences from the fall of sales are not visible to a small number of spys.
"In my monitoring, the level of alcoholism disease remains nearly at the same level,” reported the doctor Alexy Stonner.
Indeed, it has grown the proportion of sick drinkers that use strong drinks, as well as those "population" in the spython-containing drugs like Yagura, while ten years ago, it was an "beer" alcoholism.
In September, 600 people were allowed from Ford's car in the Universe.

However, where closer the problems of workers are to be reduced in the region.
The district deputy of Zakza Alexy Etmans at the meeting stated that 600 people were reduced at the Ford company in the Alliance.
He said that it was still in September: then, on the programme of voluntary voluntary, which was developed together with the organization, about 600 people have gone from the installation.
The workers that decided to take place in their own will were proposed a number of loans in size.
For this reason, most of them left the workplaces in their own will.
However, Etmanov said that this number of people is the whole night change.
I don't think that's going to be limited.
However, in the next two years, the authorities are not planned to take any programme for support for areas undertakings in difficult situations,” he explained that the Government does not take into account the stability of production in the region and a large decrease in workplaces.
This information is not checked or confirmed in Ford.
We're waiting for the answer from the company, and when he comes, we're supposed to publish it.
Discussions on the reduction of workers in the Ford Enterprise have been in the Alliance for a long time.
For example, the company plans to allow 600 people were known in September.
Previously, the company stated that the production of cars was established.
As a reason for the firm, the question of the Ford's automobile in Russia was called.
According to Peterstat, the number of industrial production in Lenoblr has reduced 5,4 per cent as a result of nine months of 2013.
The production of vehicles and equipment has reduced 11,5 per cent.

The Russian mafia finally strengthened the new name: the Broad circle.
This week, a black list of Russian mafia was filled with new names and four companies.
The United States Finance Ministry entered the Brat Circle, the three representatives of Russia, two Usbekistan and the Israeli citizens.
One of the Russians was known as Gregory Leps, who suspected the transport of money for grouping members.
However, the United States ' s black list of 22 people participated in the Broadquarter and six firmed organizations.
Many experts, however, are doubtful that such organization is real.
"Breat Circle" is an attempt to associate discrete criminal groups, "he previously stated an expert on organized crime and professor at the University of New York Mark Galeothy.
He believes that the "Breat Circle" reflects the popular "Russian mafia".
"I have not met anybody in Russian law enforcement or anybody who would confirm the existence of such a criminal organization," said Mr. Galeothy, the American Centre for Corruption Research and Organized Crime.
Mr. Galeothy agrees and Professor George Mayson's University Liz Shelly.
"If they do, it is more like a criminal network, but not a organization," brings her words to the Centre for Research and Organized Crime.
In the midst of the last year, Mark Galeotti expressed the suggestion that the Brat Circle united the most closest Russian murder in the law of Assasan Usoyan, known as Dad Hasan.
The Criminal Authority was killed in January this year.
Similarly, Lashi Schushanashvili and Zacharia Kalashwa, full of the list in 2012, were closely linked to Dad Hashan, and another part of the list, the Timuri Mirzoe, was the Dad Hashana tribe.
Nevertheless, Mr. Galeotti notes that some individuals and have no relationship with Usoyan.
It believes that all of them had better combined the general financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
One of the topics was scanning an integration in the Brat Circle, Gregoria Leps, the loving chairman of the Russian President of Wormira Putin, highlighted the attention of Kremell.
Of course, we consider that we will receive more detailed information from our American partners, as a result of this decision, why it was taken in such lists, said the secretary of the Dmitri Pesko State head.
In any case, he (Leps) is a civilian RF.
Like the interests of all RF citizens, his interests will be protected.
Alexy Miller's head says that the tuberculosis in Bulgaria is marked by the new era in the gas area.
The construction of the South River in Bulgaria is a launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said the Head of Gazproma.
“The year was a marking event: the construction of the South River, the largest and most important project in Europe, began to be built by the holgar gas area,” said the President of Gazproma, Alexy Miller, in his statement on Thursday.
The project is a key part of the energy security of the whole European continent.
The “South River” is intended to diffuse Russia's export routes through Europe.
The contract between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which is a large part of Russia's gas gas, increases the risk level of normal routes, says the officials.
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks related to transit countries were eliminated “forever”.
Bolgarian consumers will receive gas from the South River on the lowest price, just as the project will start working in 2015.
Gazprom said that construction should be started in other countries further on the road of gas to the end of the year.
The annual project slowing capacity of the tube is 2.2 billion cubic feet.

Two officers of the MICA have been accused of sexual crimes before the accused of Jonathan Laurd, as it was known by the King's Commission
Two agents of the NSW were accused of sexual offences against children in 2011 against the Child Child Employee Institute in Caringhan Lard, reported the Kingdom Commission on Sexual Violence against Children.
However, the Commission's entry statement was stated that “he had never had cases of sexual violence against children within its organization.”
The Chief Executive Director Philips Hair asked that the employee of MICA was accused of crimes related to child pornography, and otherwise when a sporting instructor in MICA Caringbah Hall was sentenced for sexual crimes against children under his visit in 1991.
Mr. Hayer said, Gail Fernes, a lawyer who provided assistance to the Commission that he knew about the first case, but did not know the second.
He acknowledged that ICOCA was also entitled to the Commission by claiming that “for external controls of the MICA, which recognized that ICOCA is in the first rows of child security.”
The evidence provided by the Commission indicated that the MICA had been notified that it had received the second from the end of the four possible quality reviews carried out by the Department of Education and Communities in August this year.
Mr. Hayer, who entered in the MICA when he was 21 years old, acknowledged that he and the following leadership had permitted switchs, launched Lord, and did not also have a clear understanding of the staff of its obligations relating to communications on the violations of the security policy of children.
The Lord was sentenced for sexual crimes against 12 boys during two years of his work in MICA.
He was arrested as at least six years of prison.
But Mr. Hair rejected the preference that the MICA corporation had stopped staffing to report on the violations of Lord in the area of child security.
The employees showed that they had observed violations, including that Lord was one of the children, who personally sweared them to the colleagues, said he loved one of them and allowed them to play their mobile phone.
Daniel Okewell, who was under the Laurd leader and asked her to teach children's protection because she was concerned about his behavior, proved that Jackie Barnett, the manager of the MICA Office in Caringbach, was the leader of Lord, “what fearful and often difficult to be available”.
The Executive Director said he did not accept the explanation of staff that they had not been able to report the situation to his superior leaders.
In his words, their friendship with Lord led them from the mind of the need to report to him.
Mr. Hair said he had presented the MICA of New South Wales his view that the lessons for the organization of the event with Jonathan Lord did not “provide information” from the staff and agreed with it.
Mr. Hair said that the decision to make staff signing a confidence agreement immediately after the detention of the accused was adopted by the Director-General of the MICA on the Surveillance of the Children of Liam Whitly.
He said that it was intended to prevent the portion of evidence, but it was “resurrected” and that decision was wrong.
MYCA of New South Wales was not safe for children in their work at Jonathan Laurd during the 2009-2011 period, reported the Commission of Experts on the Discipline of Children Professor Steven Smolbon from the University of the Griffit.
He said that they were “serial problems” at the collection, selection, instruction, staff education and control.
The hearing is addressed to 20 December.

We had to run.
In the past session, we made the task of the fall in Legu Champion.

Look at Qua who held a high-level meeting.
Experts of the transportation events in the Cardiff to fight for the call “Luthern Year” knew that competition would be very high.
But no one was ready to appear to the 3-year-old Finton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolman, just for a few months before his first steps, this little boy with his chethful shooter, Tophi, had passed through three towers to take the main call, left by 30 adult partners away.
This unreparable couple — the same growth — has received high assessments for the external species, conduct and styles of the annual concurrent, which is the centre of Sannibenk’s final sport in the city of Rari near Cardiff.
When he went to the overall survey on the background of men and women in the extraordinary kitchens, he shocked his heads and the horror passed around the two-year-old Toffee.
The judges honored Fronton for his completely unexpected birth-based treatment of horses in the year.
Toffi received a higher assessment for the external nature and nature.
The fund gave to Tomfi his third birthday in March last year, and since then he worked with the Shetland scene every day.

The representative of this year's final exhibition said, “The Fund is only three years, but he knows how to do with his pool”.
Nevertheless, they're a good team.
The judges noted Fenton and Toffi for their external appearance and for their presentation at the show-ring.
They appreciate the vulnerability of the poet and manufacturer — Fronton and Tophi were the best on the market.
I'm sure that Fronton helped his attraction, and he really looked well in his role.
Public appeal to the Chinese newspaper “The Reorganization must be”
The Chinese newspaper, published in the first field, calls for the release of an accused reporter, must be reorganized, reports the press regulator.
The New Express newspaper in Guangoa made an unexpected public statement requesting a journalist Chan Youngjo.
Mr. Chan, however, later acknowledged on television that he had received the record of false articles on company with the public share of property.
Now, the New Express must be on the process of complete correction of errors, as the regulator reports.
The Guanduan Management Command was ordered to correct the press and publications, radio, cinema and television.
Previous investigation showed that the member of Yangcheng Evening News Group of the New Express has published a number of false reports on Zoomlion's board company in the period from September 2012 to August 2013.
“The editing of New Expression” was decontrolled,” states the regulator.
He reports that it was decided to “invite the administrative appeal to Chan Yunjou as an appeal to his reporter license.”
He also recommended that the Yangcheng Evening News Group should correct the errors in the New Express and investigate the situations related to the newspapers, and immediately introduce changes in the guideline of the New Express.
Mr. Chanje wrote a number of articles for the New Express, which stated that financial violations were made by the construction equipment under the name of Zoomlion.
After his detention was detained, his newspaper published two calls on his release, claiming that it supports his journalist activities.
But Mr. Chan, then, appeared at the public television, acknowledging that he published false articles for money.
“ In that case, I have damaged Zoomlion's company, as well as all the news media industry and its ability to rely on public confidence,” he said the public advertising company of CCTV.
I did this primarily because I wanted money and glory.
I understood my fault.
After the recognition of Mr. Chan, the New Express, published an apologist on the first field, stated that the newspaper was not due to check its reports.
Recently, some high-speaked suspects have recognized television.
Experts say that the practice of elimination of recognition in China has continued to be distributed, despite recent amendments to laws prohibiting the authorities to make a self-contraction.
U.S. tunnel - Mexico for the transfer of drugs equipped with its own iron road
One of the most complex tunnels is found for drug contracts between the United States and Mexico, designed by their own lighting systems, ventilations and electrical relves systems.
The United States authorities describe the tunnel of a width of four to three feet as one of the most complex secret steps ever found.
The tunnel, which consists of nearly six football fields, connects installations around the city of Tihuana (Mexico) and San Diego (USA).
The area is filled with unacceptable components that facilitate the hiding of drug loads in the carriage.
The Tunnel was closed before any drug was immediately transferred through it, as stated by the authorities.
According to the judicial documents, the guarders confined eight and half tons of marihuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in the discovery of the tunnel.
Treasury men, according to the law enforcement, were pronounced accused of marihuana and cocaine to disseminate.
In the case of condemnation, they are threatened by decades of ten years before the death of the freedom.
In the city of Nogales, Arizon, the contractors use wide underground channels.
The Tunnel is the eighth large passage found in San Diego since 2006.
A number of largest tunnels were found in Central Mexico after the assembly of marihuana in October, which made the drug carriage a complex task to deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a length of approximately 700 meters of the rainy roads that flew from the kitchen of one of the houses in Tihuan to two sites of San Diego.

The British Police has the notification of expenditure
The British police today has notified the WikiLeaks Julian Assanja's founder who had been opened to the Ecuador Embassy in London and asked for rescue.
In Scotland and Yard, they stated that they had assigned an Australian 40-year-old “official requirement” to appear in the police office, adding that, in the case of the incompliance of this requirement, he would continue to be arrested.
Assanju is threatening the extradition of Sweden for sexual offences after he exempted its possibilities in accordance with the British law when the Supreme Court rejected the appeal for extradition in that month.
When he was afraid that Stockholm was transferred to the United States, on June 19th he went to the Ecuador Embassy in London, asking the South American country for political assistance.
Scotland Yard “a 40-year-old man had the official requirement to be sent to come to the police office day and time at our election,” reported the secretariat.
He continues to violate the conditions of release under the tax.
The U.S. refused to comment on police notifications.
Assange is afraid that he will be extracted from Sweden to the United States to prevail possible charges in spionage after the publication of more than 2500,000 American diplomatic debts against the secret of the WikiLeaks website.

The automobilist was exploded by £1,000 per speed up to 130 km per hour (210 km/h) with a slight drink between the feet.
The 35-year-old Andrew Hooi from Tytre, Essex, was replaced by the rule of Mercedes Benz on the A120 trace in Brentry 27 May.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink between his feet.
In the world court, the Colchester Howy acknowledged the accused of the rulership without a fair consideration and attention.

The Houi also imposed to pay costs in size of £90 and additional collection for victims of crime in size of 100 £.
Taxes for foreign owners will lead to the flow of the London Poster
The Chambership has implemented a preliminary evaluation of capital growth tax measures, but expects the final decision by Mr. Osborn, which in the 2012 budget introduced the State Shipping Tax of 7 per cent for the household value of more than 2 million and annual payments for buyers who decided to possess houses in companion, not as physical persons.
At this time, the honourable residence in Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, which consists of 708 million feet in the financial year 2012/13, has already exceeded the overall amount in Northern Ireland, Wals, Scotia, Northwest, New Yorkshire and Hambera together.
Mr. Cook said: “After the increase in the households and the inclusion of this legislation against the worship, it is very difficult to say that the integrity of the cost-free immobility is decreased independence on the impact of the existing municipal tax system.”
"But this step may lead to some foreign investors to purchase in movement in London or the present of its owners would not want to sell it", he added.
The value of primary non-motiveness, 5 to 10 per cent of the housing market, in the rich Southwest Pool of London, which is promising from Fulham to Wilbldon, has grown at 11,8 per cent in the past year.
According to Savills company's research, the prices in London have continued to demonstrate sustainable growth in 5,6 per cent in annual calculation, but have been actively developed by the “technological market” with the high prices in the south-west, north (7.4 per cent) and the city (6.5 per cent).
Scientists blew the light to how the dog moves are linked to its vision.
More early studies showed that the satisfactory dogs are shocked in the right side (or the dog) while the pretty dogs smell as well as the left side.
But now the scientists say that other psalmist families may observe these points of differentity in the eradication and react on them.
Professor Georgeo Valluturgerar, a neurologist from the University of Trent, says: “It is well known that people with the left and the right of the brain participate in the formulation of constructors that cause positive or negative emotions.”
Here we tried to look at this and other kinds.
He added that the right dog of the brain controls the left side of the body and the contrary, and two half of them play different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs respond to the diversity of other dogs, researchers observed animals when they looked at other dogs.
They measured the frequencies of animal hearts and analyzed their conduct.
Maybe we're already understood why their wounds sometimes move to one side, and sometimes to another.
Prof. Vallorgurar said: "We have shown dog videos with dogs, or naturalistic versions, or strength to get away from any other deceptive factor, and we could handle the movement of the cow and ship more left or right."
When the animals saw that there was nothing in the rest that was not expressed by the dog moved to the right (at the point of the heavy dog) they remained completely slow.
But when they noticed that the skin was predominantly tempted to the left (once again in the face of the honey dog), their hearts were engaged and appeared to be shocked.
Prof. Vallorgirr said he did not think dogs would have been communicated with each other with these movements.
In fact, he believes that the dogs have learned from their experience what movements they should be worried and no.
He notes: “If there are several meetings with other dogs and often the exhibition of their hair in one side is related to more friendly behavior, and the right side gives a less friendly behavior, the dog reacts on the basis of this experience.”
The researchers say that these results may give the owners, veterinaries and auditors more deeply understanding of the emotions of their animals.
The expert on the conduct of the dog John Bradshaw, a scientist invited to the University of Bristol, said that it was not the first study to check whether the dog was important for the left and the right of the dog.
In the past year, a group of scientists from the University of Lincoln found that dogs strike the head to the left if they look at an aggressive dog and right if they look at a satisfactory dog.
And in another scientific work at the University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: “It was more often approached to the dog, when it was sent to the left and not right instead of being shocked, the opposite behavior of Italian research.”
He said that differentity could be because dogs in various studies did not completely accept animals in films or dogs as dogs.
It might be useful to investigate how dogs react to the dogs, he explained.
“ While there are sufficient evidence that two mediums of the brain are used for various purposes, ” he said.
However, taking into account the easierness that they may be registered, we may already understand why their skins sometimes be sent to one side, and sometimes to another.

Pope Francis's first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will first enter the new Catholic Church in the sanctuary for its service on 22 February, as stated in the Vatican Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic church after the pope, and they choose the pope, so France will appoint their first group of people who will eventually participate in the election of his priest.
There are now 201 cardinals.
However, after the cardinal of 80 years of age, he can't participate in the elections of the pope is the predicting group of 120 “cardinalists”.
In announcing this news, the Vienna Press-Secretary Father Felico Lombhardi said that before the sanctuary, the meeting of all the current cardinals, known as consistants, would be held before the sanctuary.
“Papa Frances decided to report on his decision to contact the concert in February to facilitate the planning of other meetings with cardinal participants from different clouds of the world,” said Lombard.
Jack Valero from the Catatolic voice organization said that in February the number of cardinal electors would probably be decreased.
He said that the pope usually calls so much cardinals as necessary to reaffirm the number of cardinals to 120, as well as the cardinal age of 80 years as he wants.
The consideration in the next year will be great because it will be the first from the date of the French election in March this year, according to the Valero's words.
There is now its kind of pre-accession for Europe and especially for Italy.
“It is interesting to see whether the new Pape of Cardinal from other parts of the world is to restore the balance,” he said.
In South America, 40 per cent of Catholics are lived, but few cardinals are presented.
It will also be the first chosen cardinal since the French Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from the world, which has been mandated to search for ways to reform churches.
In the past, Dad decided all of us.
“ At the time, Francis chose eight cardinals to help him, ” said Valero.
He said that Francis would be addressed to the cardinals for the advice.
But we weren't in that situation before that -- that's all for us first.

Obama's elector ' s cry
I voted for President Obama two times, sharing hopes for changes
He said that Obama had allowed the structuringism of the Republicans to strive.
Restructuring cannot be resolved by the Web site reformed by the Health System, the attacks of impilots
The 2008 Obama campaign Memories are the painful memories of what might be
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second student of the Harvard University Medical School.
I'm reading a terrible painful book in these days.
I thought that this book would encourage me during the second course of the Medical Faculty and restore hope in me.
It is called “Dersity for Victory” and it is the Memories of the President-Chairman campaign Baraka Obama 2008.
When I finish the reports about my patients and lie in my bed, the book returns to me while the policy inspired millions of people, and the statements could be able to shut up the spirit.
The benefit of elections was shocked, and the leading news programmes made a pause to understand this historic moment.
My colleagues cryed from joy, and my parents took all the newspapers they could only find.
The White House had to come to the young team of the Strategy, and the people were ready to change.
In 2008, the support level of Obama was 82 per cent.
Then I close the book.
Returns now represents a cruel trial as a restraint from the dream.
It is difficult to remember those days of optimism — they say a further reminder, the painful memories of the launched opportunities.
Over the years since I left my first election bureau, the changes have really been changed.
That was what I couldn't even imagine.
I will give Obama a position for its great and variety of achievements, from the adoption of the Act on Accessing Medical Assistance to the conclusion of our military in Iraq, the amendment of the Rule “Don't ask, don't say”, the murder of Usama Ben Laden.
Furthermore, I believe that the partial restructuringism has blocked too many attempts to advance our country: immigration reform, the choice of public health and the closure of the basis in Guantanamo among others.
But after a few times I was on the side of the Obama Administration, defending it before my colleagues and colleagues, I have finished the explanations I could give.
I reached the political disappointment.
The Republicators cannot explain the permission to hear foreign leaders or the slaughter of unfaithful children in other countries.
It cannot explain the collection of data on the private life of Americans of the National Security Agency or the persecution of deployers who discovered injuries by the Government.
He cannot explain the murder of an American citizen Anvar al-Aulaki without courts and consequences or the non-observation of public financing and expenditure during the presidential campaigns.
He cannot justify the conclusions of the report, which states that the White House's efforts to smell the media are “agressive... from Nixon’s administration.”
In recent times, he cannot justify what is not possible to develop a simple web site over three years after signing the access to medical assistance law.
I don't know if I had to wait.
Should I understood 18 years of age that the leadership could oppose political campaigns before him?
It is obvious that the work of the selected post is not a predicted programme of action, since our public dialogue will be formed by the opposition of a political party and by evental meetings such as injury in Newton.
However, in all of the above-mentioned examples, it is clear that they were a major choice of the Administration.
And that's what I'm worried about.
I have again voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I had been enthusiasm on his candidate.
Mitt Romney represented an unreasonable and strict alternative, seemed that he was not able to decide on his own policies or views.
I thought that, at my second time, Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, justifys the hopes that we have heard for such a long time.
However, when Obama's rating was below 45 per cent in this week, it was more difficult to return in 2008.
This makes me touch in many promises that have flewn away.
In this week, I read a part of the book described how Clinton made Obama a sensible view of primary elections in Pennsylvania.
At the analysis meeting, he told his staff that they should return to the normal routine and remain faithful to their goals.
“ I want us to return our appreciation, ” he said.
"We must remember who we are."
Five years ago, Mr. President, and I agree with you completely.
The comments expressed in this opinion belong to Nathaniel Morris exclusively.

RBS excludes two monetary trainers
The Kingdom Bank temporaryly excluded the work of two trainers in its currency operations, according to the information of two persons known to this situation, that is another confirmation that the global control of regulators in the monetary market is severely collecting trafficking.
Some of the largest world banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperate with regulators of the largest financial market in the world, a daily trading of $5.3 billion.
These two trainers will be the first RBS staff that have been deployed during the developing investigation, which is called on the scandal related to the LIBOR interbanking rate.
In refusal of commenting, the bank reaffirmed that in this month he received requests for information from the regulatory bodies.
“ Our current investigation continues, and we are fully working with the FCA and our other regulators,” reported in the bank two weeks ago.
In the last month, notified persons said that RBS had transmitted e-mail records and mingle communications that received and sent him to the former tremendour of the Great Britain – Financial Control Office (FCA).
This trainer, Richard Asher, left from the RBS in 2010 and, as he knows, provides a departure to his current post of the European Common Trade Director in JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the Chief of European Social Trade in Citi, left a department in this week, while Matt Gardiner, an older currency trainer in Barclays and UBS, was removed from the work of the Standard Chartered bank on that week.
No of these trainers was accused of any violations.
Mr. Asher's contact group included bankers from Barclays and Citi Group, in the words of informed persons.
The UBS Bank reported this week that he had taken measures against some of his staff after the Swiss regulator Finma said that he would investigate the claimed manipulation on the monetary market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six world regulatory bodies — the European Commission, Finland, the Swiss Antimonopolic Authority, the FCA, the United States Justice Ministry and the Valuable Office of Hong Kong — are considering the appeal that the bankers have entered in conspiration for the monetary market.
HSBC, Citi Group, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also started internal checks or received requests for information from the regulatory bodies, said that persons were familiar with the situation.
The banks have recorded mgnumber communications and electronic letters for a few years in the search of crimes.
The checking news has increased tremendous activities in the past years, one of the largest sources of commercial investment banks income, which, however, had faced difficulties because the low monetaryity reduces the benefits of the buyer.
Some bankingers tried to reduce the seriousness of the situation, saying that the wide and high-olivative monetary market was almost impossible to manipulate, but the senior trainers said that it was not always true.
According to the older trainer, despite a large number of daily trade on the currency market, the liquidity fraction between different trade platforms and the more wide use of their internal platforms means that " you can start to make the market influence for a very small price".
This news came on the same day when the credit Suisse bank declared that one of the trainers of London's Fund Trade Trade Division was released this week after the loss of almost $6 million at the end of the last year.
The bank has immediately notified the relevant bodies and cooperated with its regulators.
“We are sure that the trainer has acted alone and that this issue was possible to locate,” reported Kredit Suisse.

In Egypt, the first President is elected freely
Mohammed Mursey accepts a judge, but the day of his complaint is not marking the end of the political fight in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Muhammad Murcy promised the “new Egypt ” when he offered a sentence, became the first chosen President of the country, who changed Hosney Mubarak, who was denied 16 months ago.
In its inauguration before the Supreme Constitution Court, Mursi also became the first Islamic president of the Arab world and the fifth Head of the Egyptian State after a monarchy over 60 years ago.
He took a sentence before 18 courts in black mantieths in the neighborhood of Nila, built in the style of the ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are trying to make a better future, a new Egypt and the second Republic,” said Murcy during the Traditional Ceremony shown in direct ether on public television.
“The seventy-year-old Egyptian people have put the foundation of a new life, a absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Murcy, a 60-year-old engineer with American education from the Bretiv-musulman, the fundamentalist group, who was a large part of the 84 years of its existence prohibited by a museum for the cruel action of those who changed each other Government.
The building was protected hundreds of soldiers and police, when Murcy arrived with a small cortex soon after 11 a.m. to local time.
Only hundreds of persons gathered in the court building to welcome the new President, and, unlike the presidential age of Mubarak, the movement was stopped just a short time to leave the car rental for a normally living road connecting the city centre with the Southern Refugees.
Although Mursey was expressed as an unharistic "safe" wheel, his personal prestige grows slowly from the moment of his victory and the fifth statement he tried to imagine himself not only as Islamic candidates, but also all those who want to prove to the end of 2011 resurrection against the Authority Mubarak.
“The Year of Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” said Murcy, who was obtained in the blue of the business shooting with the red gallery, judges in the slaughter of the tree panel where he has accepted a sentence.
Afterward, Murcy went to the University of Kalifornia where he had to do his inauguration.
He was given an official receipt with the armed orchester who performed the public jinn during which he was “movely.”
The military department was presented by Hussein Tantavi.
His visit was met by the Army and the people, one hand, which scanned hundreds of meetings in the primary university Hall.
Based in 1908 as a plot of light education, the University of the Kyrpic in the 1970s became the opponent of Islamic Study Groups.
Murcy took a symbolic sentence on Thursday area of Tahrir, where the resurrection was born last year by the Authority of Mubarak, and promised to return the authority of the President whose office was exempt by the military council to take the cases of the refusal leader.
But accepting an official judgment before the court, not before the parliament, he does the will of the military, and it is knowing that the fight for authority will continue.
Mursy's talk on Tahrir's area was filled with theatrical polytic helmets.
A periodic meeting of the Tomé Builders Association was held on the basis of the Yalutor Car Industry.
In the context of the event, the new line for the production of electronic tube began.
As the commercial director of Dennis Gribanon reported, in 2011, a marketing survey of the market in the Tunisia was conducted with the new ownership.
It was found that the region requires more than 500,000 tons of electrical tube per month.
After that, it was decided to change the profile and its installations for their production.
More than 7,000 tons of production have been downloaded this year.
Investment was more than 120 million rubbers,” said Dennis Gribano.
In October, a new state that allows to increase assortment.
The manufacture is launched as a small tube profile that is used for swimming households, small forms of construction and furniture, as well as large, for the building sector.
Plan to go to the production level of 50,000 tonnes per year, with approximately 10 per cent of its consumption in Tunisia.
In spite of the other terms of transition, the number of undertaking staff has not been decreased - it now represents 157 persons, in order to purchase new equipment, more than 50 employees.
The company is being prepared for carriage, and the necessary specialists are collected from the existing.
In the future year, a new agregate of the proliferation has become total to five miles [5 millimeters], which allows to reduce the autonomy of product, as well as another condition, with a speed of tube production up to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014, enterprises will be able to release the tube that are used in the housing and the community.
The Enterprises ' s task is to close to 70 per cent of the needs of the Tunisia area in this product.
The Vice-Chairman of the Department of Investment Policy Leonid Islands, calling on the manufacture leaders, recommended greater attention to modernization of machinery companies.
This aims and forms of public support for industry, including the reimbursement of the percentage credit rates for the purchase of new equipment and its liquidation costs.
The current year is expected to allocate 150 million rubbers, two thirds have already been lost.
The last Commission, which will consider the subventional treaties, takes documents from undertakings until 15 November.
Furthermore, the budget is reimbursed for local producers in the international burdens.
The future budget is provided for a budget of 150 million rubbers, which can be used to compensate license payments and credits for the purchase of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated to the wearmarks, 3 million to the energy savings programme.
The reimbursement of assigned and paid equipment which is produced in the south of the Tunisia area for the oil complex is reduced to 72 million.
According to Leonida Ostronau, this form of support will be stopped, as the motivation of its involvement was to compensate taxes for profitable coppers who paid the oil companies in the area budget.
At present, they do not and subsidies are the direct cost obligations of the region.
In this regard, the Government considers the immediate support of industrial companies, not the financing of the oil sector.
Budget assistance will be linked to investment projects that will be implemented for production.
Many firm leaders expressed concern about the situation in the oil relations.
The provision of their purchased equipment is the competitive advantage of the Southern Tunisia industry, and it would be difficult to be recovered by Russia's average pool, where the more delicate workforce is.
Furthermore, the new owner of TNK-DC is the Rosneth company that has not yet placed its orders on Tuman companies.
The Ukrainian Project Agreement is completed in 2013, and its applications were not extended.
At present, the Southern business that specializes the oil sector can not form the orders portal for the future year.
The question remains that the taxes of the oil budget in the Uwa region will be made to the region or they will be paid on the place of registration of the new owner.

It can be said that the prices are defined by a large number of factors, including the customs and the customs payments.

With regard to other goods, the impact of the price agreement will not be so direct, it will be redispensed.

However, 1 November, the "Oboronzeris" case violated silence.
In the interview, Life News Vasiliev said, “It is, of course, that it was a real task: to remove any negative information on the former Minister of Defense from me.”

They're just bringing the people into a mistake, that's all.
Furthermore, in response to the current Declaration of the CCC, that Vasilèva was able to investigate criminal matters, the lawyer said that he and his customer "doesn't know the case materials".
What was the reason for the proclamation of Vasilia’s home arrest, which was still not communicated with the press?
Maybe how was she not able to respond to the accused of bad punishment?
Or is the right of the journalists "Commshoolki", who claimed a couple of days ago, that it was "declined in a larger transmission under the home arrest" because of the reconciliation of Anatolia Serbuki with his wife and his return to his family?
The famous military advisor Victor Balanz in his article "Search has returned to the wife?" wrote: "The slavers do not exclude that after such a struggle, they may become more talking about questions."
Previously, Vasilva had some accused of the illicit sale of the unmovable property of the Minoboron.

In this year, we planned GDP growth in the area of 3 per cent, perhaps even more.

Now it is very important that Russian companies receive normal price credits are the first thing that must be done,” stressed the head of the Government.

Travel, rivers and jungles to provide free medical assistance
Dr. Jorge Bwelle provides free medical assistance in rural areas in Cameroun
Bwelle and his team are conducting almost every week, taking hundreds of patients
In this West African country, the doctors aren't so much — only one per 5000
Call here or through your mobile device.
Dr. Jorge Bwelle is one of the 10 main heroes of CNN 2013.
You can proclaim for him or any other 10 main heroes to become the CNN Heroes.
This person will receive $2,50,000 for the continuation of its extraordinary work.
During 21 years, Jorge Bwelle saw his father returned to life and again in an inconscious state, shooting through hospitals that were not equipped with the appropriate way to help him.
Jamef Bwelle received a tragic in a car accident in 1981 near Yaungda, Cameroon’s capital.
First, he was only cut off his hand, but the infection was spread to the brain and called a gematic that recalled himself before the end of his life.
“ There were no neurochirurgs in Cameroon, ” said Jorge Bwelle.
If we had money, we would take him out of Cameroon.
Instead of that, the Bwell has given his father in overcome clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment they could have received.
“ It’s not easy, ” says Bwelle.
- You can go from home at 5 o'clock, get to the hospital to be the first, but you're not the first.
It's a lot of patients.
Some may die because they have to wait.
The situation was not very changed since the father of Bwelle ended in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, only one doctor in Cameroon was 5000.
For comparison, the proportion in the United States is a doctor of 413.
And even if the cameras could call to the doctor, many of them wouldn't be in the carman.
Two of the five people in this country live in the outstanding poverty, and almost three four health costs are private.
“ The only problem of them is poverty, ” said Bwelle.
And because of the poverty, they cannot enjoy their life."
I saw his father's suffering and many of his partners, Bwelle had decided to do so.
Last year, Dr. Jorge Bwell and his volunteer team carried out 700 free operations.
He himself became a doctor and works with a co-conciliator surgery in the Headquarter of Yaunded Hospital.
He also found the non-commercial organization of ASCOVIME, which organizes travel travels to the agricultural field for free medical assistance.
Since 2008, he and his voluntary group had been assisted by almost 32.000 people.
Once every Thursday, he and 30 people are killed in the shooting, lifting medical ownership to the shops and move to the swimming place to visit the people who need to help the village.
It's not always a chance to conscious them.
Sometimes they had to throw the cars through the river and the shock.
But when they come, they meet as true heroes, it is a celebration of songs and dances and the best places that can only offer local people.
The cost of medical services in these villages is really a matter of celebration, and Bwelle with its wide smiling and unlimited energy more than happily joining.
The next morning, the brigade begins to take hundreds of patients.
“ We take 500 people on each trip, ” said Bwelle.
They come with the whole area in the radius of 60 miles [60 km] from the village, and they're swimming.
Each of these clinics offers various medical services.
Many people have been treated from malaria, tuberculosis, injury, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmissible diseases.
Others may receive cups, shoes offered or free birth witnesses — documents required for schools that many poor families simply can not allow themselves.
On the night of the brigade, simple operations are carried out under local anesthesis.
Operations are generally carried out in the school building, municipality or house; after the procedure, patients are up and go to the post-operation area to release the place for the next man.
Using the operational and sanitary manufacture generators, Bwelle and his volunteers are working until Sunday morning.
This is an unfortunate time, but the integrity of the brigade is usually helping tree musicians.
“ They shoot all night in the barbarat so that we should be guarded and continue to work, ” said Bwelle.
On Sunday, the members of the Brigadier return to the city, but the honourableness of their work.
The group, which was from the Cambodia doctors and foreign students, conducted 700 free operations for the past year, and knows that their assistance could have a great importance for those who are helping them.
One person explained that it was possible to work again.
“ This will change the future for me and my family, ” said a man.
In addition to these clinical receipts in the weekly and work in the hospital, Bwelle also works nights in private medical clinics around Yaounded.
That is the second work, saying, provides 60 per cent of the financing of its non-profit organization; other resources are covered by private donations.
"I don't even know when he's sleeping," said Kathy O'Melly, a medical student of the second course at the Philadelphia University, volunteer in the Bwelle Group.
He is always in the hospital or is trying to pay money for the organization to continue these campaigns.
For future doctors and nurses, such as O'Melly, who came from the United States and Europe, to join Bwelle in the realization of his task, is an opportunity to practice that they would never have received home.
“We got the opportunity to assist in operations where we helped to remove the blood or keep the tools for Dr. Bwelle, ” said O'Melly.
When you were an actor, you would never have received such a possibility in America.
The voluntary students usually pay their travel to Cameroon, often with gifted medicines.
But when they arrived in Yaoundda, their food, transport and education pays Bwelle.
“It is hero, without doubt,” said O'Melly.
He gives his lives to this organization, and his desire to help Cameroon people.
For Bwelle, almost the continuing loading of work is not a hard test.
Helping a happy life of others to fulfill the promise of his father is what brings him great joy.
“ I am so happy when I do this job, ” said Bwelle.
- And I think of my father.
I hope he's seeing what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to people smile to reduce their pain.
Go to the ASCOVIME website and see what you can help.

It rejected its words of health
Among the crystics, President Obama last night went to the appointment of your often renewed, a unique promise that “if you like your medical insurance plan, you can keep it.”
For hundreds of thousands of people have been informed about the stopping of service from their conductors, the Republicns recently discovered the President because he introduces the American society in a mistake.
Last night, Obama submitted a few of its public promises.
“The majority of the health insurance who works may keep it,” he said in his statement in Boston.
In view of the fact that he was called “new use” on the stopping of service, Obama called for the Americans to search for other market options.
Most people will have the possibility of obtaining the best, comprehensive medical insurance plans on the same price or even deterioration of the provision.
“ You will get better conditions, ” he said.
The Administration stated that nobody should surprise that 5 per cent of the people who purchase insurance could be made to change the plans because their claims did not conform to new standards required in accordance with the Accessing Medical Assistance Act.
“ Let me say directly to these Americans, that you will benefit better,” said Siberius in the statement to the Committee on Energy and Trade of the House of Representatives in Washington.

The Rosbalt Agency has lost the media status for an unprecedented burden
On October 31, Moscow decided to recognise the invalid license on the registration of the Rosbalt Agency, writes the Lent.
In the absence of the Media Statute, Roka Navigation has established a systematic and cruel violation of the media law.
During the process, an unpleasant precedence was established: the court had read the possible closure of the media, which actually rejected the publication in the right to issue contracts.
What's "Rosbalt"?
THE Rosbalt Information Agency was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the following years, the Agency opened the second main office in Moscow and a number of regional offices.
The offices also work as representatives in the former SPD countries.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has developed and functioned as Federal Information and Analytical Agency.
At the mid-2000 Agency had been the list of the most known private media online in Russia.
The " Rosbalt " has always been very specifically low: the nuclear of exclusive publications of the Agency (and still constitutes) marks with the sources of the law enforcement bodies.
The discussions on the closeness of publications to force structures continued to be held throughout the existance of the Agency.
On the other hand, Rosbalt had a wide source base in various states, in favour of such provisions, and was said that the project was Natalia Chaplin's wife, Victor Checkswa.
This is the role of the Chapter in the Rosbalt Guide is not clear to the end: mostly it is called the project printer.
The Director-General of the Agency is Laris Afonina, the main editor of Nicola Williams.
Recently, Rosbalt has not been launched in federal media racings - nor citiration or audience.
In October, the Agency took the 25th place to visit Russian media websites via Live Internet.
At the same time, LiveInternet, the mediated rosbalt.ru website audit, is about 1500,000 unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand) monthly, about three million unique visitors.
In addition to the most popular materials in the past five months - notes on the incapacity of Cromela in Ukraine, the death of the Kroal and Shot Group, in the capital Brazil.
The Rosbalt Conflict began in July 2013 when the Amendments to the Media Act prohibited journalists of non-valuer burden was entered into force.
Weeding has found the prohibited pharmaceuticals in two posted video agencys on the website "Jigit from Rosnodar" and "Pussy Riot disabled oil exhibitions".
The further parts are different.
The Rosbalt, on the basis of the detected videomateries, accused Rosbalt in a cruel and systematic violation of the media law and requested the court to choose the license office.
The Rosbalte state claimed that the claims of the State were unrighteous: first, the roles were not editing materials, second, mother words were locked, and, thirdly, the role was removed from the site after warning.
The representatives of the Agency pleaded to the Royal Surveillance Chambers in the World Court and Moskow Court adopted the request of Royal Surveillance on October 22, 2013, and the consideration of these complaints continued.
However, the 25 numbers of world courts have already decided not to use Rosbalt: the main editor of Nichol William acknowledged the guilty of the administrative offences of 20 000 rubbers for each role.
Of course, this was also predicted by the outcome of listening to Moscow -- if it was not to say that the exit could be predicted before.
31 October the Court decided to acknowledge the ineficient witness for the registration of the Rosbalt, which actually removed the media status agency.
It is not possible to say that Rosbalt remained alone during this opposition.
The Agency supported the deputy of the Hospital (the statement on behalf of the Head of Alexander Jarow, on 10 October, was signed by 26 deputés; the same document was issued on the initiative of the CPRC).
The unlawfulness of the closure of publications was declared by the head of the Russian journalists, the President of the Moscow Union of Journalists Paul Husev, and the President of the President of the Human Rights Council, Mikhail Fedotos.
Furthermore, according to Goddan, the Royal Surveillance Guide has even provided to him any guarantee that the license would not be reached before the license was resigned.
The Court on Rhosbalt showed that, under which laws are more safely available in Russia today, a major issue.
Syria has destroyed the carriage equipment
Syria has destroyed all the declared powers for the production of chemical weapons and recognized the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
This first stage of disarmament, Damascus, has completed the day before the deadline.
Before 1 November, Syria had to destroy production and other subsidiary instruments intended for the preparation of slaughter-equivalent substances.
The destruction of the stocks of comparable substances or its chemical components should be completed in the midst of 2014.
According to the representative of the OHCHR, there are currently similar substances in printed stocks.
International inspectors were sent to Syria after more than 1400 people died in Damasco on 21 August during the chemical attacks.
The main task of the inspectors was not to lose time - so that Syrian authorities could not make more chemicals - and destroy infrastructure to interact chemicals and munitions.
These productive powers will now be carefully observed in order to avoid their finances.
The next century, in the midst of November, the OHCHR and the Syrians must agree to the detailed destruction plan for already existing materials.
A lot of questions here.
Where will they destroy?
Who will provide this equipment?
All Syrian declarations will be checked closely by the Western Intelligence Services.
They will be willing to recommend to the inspectors new instruments to check if they have the reason to suspect that Damask is not opened before the end.
The United States believe that the shot was carried out by regular armies.
Syria and Russia argued that this is the case of Syrian rebellion.
The world community was required from Syrian leadership, in accordance with the agreement reached by Russia through, to destroy or bring all powerful powers for the production of gas and heat and to fulfil the equipment of these substances.
Now, when this stage comes, the next step should be the destruction already in the Syrian armed army.
It is suggested that the arsenal may be more than 1000 tons of nervous and parallel substances, every nervous gas and other prohibited chemical substances covered in several decades of different places.
For its destruction, the OHCHR and the Syrian authorities must start agreed with the graph of action - two weeks.
The supervisor of the field operations of OHCHO Gerry Smith stated that his inspectors were "normally observed for the destruction of the equipment".
"They are now not able to make further production or discharge of chemical weapons", he said.
The OHCHR statement states that the inspectors visited 21 of 23 objects in Syria and convinced that equipment and similar substances were destroyed or inconsistent.
The remaining two installations are too dangerous to carry out the inspection, as indicated in the document, but the equipment was transferred and checked by OSC specialists.
According to Smith, the destruction of the infrastructure of the oxygen was particularly unlike, as it worked in the continuing conflict.
At the beginning of October, the Nobel World Premier received, but, as Smith said, the time to redistribute it to the inspectors until there was not found - they were too busy.
John Carry says in his unprecedented recognition that the US spy “is gone far away”
John Kerry demonstrated the strengthening of the United States defence programs and recognized unprecedentedly that in some cases the U.S. spy “is gone far away”.
The secretariat also acknowledged that, along with Barack Obama, it was “in the car drive” during the exhibition of the speed of Edward Snowden on the Spionship of the ANB.
The information losses were made by the Government of the United States in the centre of the diplomatic scandale with their associators.
Mr. Carry said on videolines at the open Government conference in London: “It is not doubtful that the President and I, as well as other Government members have actually taken some of the cases on the car pilot, because such a possibility has already existed, and during the Second World War, and in the very difficult years of war, and of the 11 September.”
Then he became the first member of the United States high-employed Government, who acknowledged that the U.S. Spionship was too far, but stressed that no rights were violated.
He said, “In some cases it went far away.
And the President has decided to shut the light on this issue and explain to the people, and now has a careful analysis for any of the feelings of abuse.
Indeed, I believe in you that there is no wrong-doers in this process.
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the ANB had worked out of good dealings and that his surgery operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We are working in the new world where people are ready to be injured.
There is a radical extremism in the world, an unreasonable and full determination to kill people, to attack people and to attack Governments.
And if you were able to overlook it, would you stop it before it happens?
We actually prevented the violations of aircrafts, the explosions and the murder of people, because we were able to know about these plans."
Among the subject, American legislators are sent to Europe in order to help address questions related to the United States shooting spy and to convince Europeans in the need to continue joint anti-terrorism events with the United States, said the Chairman of the Senate on European Affairs on Friday.
The Senator of the Connective State, Chris Merfi, said that it was unrelated with members of the European Parliament and other persons in this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorism organizations because of disappointment with the national security Agency.
“In the interests of the United States national security, it is really important that Europeans remain our partners with regard to our common anti-terrorism efforts,” said the Democracy, who works for the first time and who is Chairman of the International Senate on European Affairs, at Washington interview.
- And I go to Europe to understand that we must continue to cooperate in the field of terrorism, despite their angry regarding these ANB programmes.”
News that ANB had collected millions of telephone talk records in Europe, have deteriored the relationship with some United States partners, although the head of the Agency stated that they were incertain and reflected the uncertainness of metadata collected by NATO and shared with the United States.
Other disbursements were reported by Snowden, showing that the ANB had implemented the mobile phone monitoring of the officer of Germany Angela Merckel, as well as the phones of some 34 other world leaders.
The Director of National Intelligence James Clapper protected the spirit activities against the unions as necessary and said that it was a common case with both sides.
On the basis of this smile, Murphy said that his office was organizing a trip of members of the Congress, which is expected that this year will be, and he hoped that the delegation would be members of both parties and the two rooms.
The names of other participating legislators should be heard in the nearby days.
He said, the travel program is still at the stage of development.
Although Murphy stated that the purpose of traveling was to improve relationships, he said that some of the “frequencies of the best convictions” would also be shown.
He said that European leaders should be honest with their people in which spy programs themselves were used for many years.
“When we can change our relief programmes to better protect European rights, they must also agree with the fact that we are not the only ones who are doing discernative activities,” said Murphy.
Mr. Carry should be sent to those weekends in the Middle East and in Poland to address the problems of enemy with the United States Strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the disclosure activities of the United States.
The new compositions of the public observing committees increased the impact of prisoners
Today the Advisory of the General Palestinian (OPP) may adopt new compositions of public observing committees in 43 Russian regions.
If the vote was adopted, the troops will increase their influence.
ONG is public structures that control the conditions of freedom of imprisonment.
The case of Sergey Magnith and Leonida Distribuiev, copy-collection concerns, that is, through the UNHCR, a record of most resonance events.
The UNHCR control is the fight between human rights defenders and forces lobbyists.
At the meeting of the ODA Working Group on the Formation, I proposed to make a criteria for choosing the experience of human rights activities.
"He didn't accept and formed the lists, but did not develop criteria," says Valery Bourjev.
Borew is the present Chairman of the Moscow Observatory Commission and the Association of Independent Observers, the Alliance of the Alliance of the Rights Protectors of Criminal Affairs.
In the event of Mr. Gosmith, he developed a law which regulates UNHCR activities.
The OOP Council should vote for UNHCR composition in 43 countries.
At 1800 vaccines, less than thousands of desires were claimed, and in Ingustain and Kabardino Balkara the competitors had not been able to organize because of the lack of candidates.
The OOP promises to organize a donation on vacuum locations.
OCN Moscow is one of the few committees with the competitive, despite the new composition instead of 20.
According to Bourneva, the current composition of the capital Commission of 11 defenders and 9 forces, and in the option that is voted at the OOP, the percentage changes to 17 to 23.
In that regard, 30 human rights defenders wanted to be held in the capital Commission.
The new composition can reiterate the representative of God's Brotherhood Vicheslav Callin.
He was a member of the United Nations for three years, but never visited prisoners.
Borgeist believes that, by appointing his Chairman of the United Nations, the rights defenders will be able to do the work of the human rights defenders, so the rights defenders do not exclude collectively from the Commission.
They believe that the movement of forces is coordinated by UNN.N.C. Anton Colocks, invocating the Russian Officers, is an organization that remains interested in the force states.
"I'm not the girls in the trunk," RBK said daily Anton flowers.
He refuses that the prosecution of any lists and said that it is not intended to prevent human rights defenders to visit arrested opposers.
He had not even interested in the list of votes in the OS.
The publication of Bore Information is considered a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders is the planning change of the leadership of the Chilebian ONG.
Her former leaders are dismissed from copy worries last year.
The General Hall concluded that the leadership of the local committee had ignored the problems of prisoners.
And here, the UNO of Rostova-na-Dona can go from human rights defenders to the forces.
From the new lists "slaughter" of the local Chairman of the Chairman of the Commission, one of his opponents was lacking, despite the Federal Public Hall excluded it in May 2013 for the inethic behavior.
The letters of the Moscow and Growth Commission Bourjev considered the "Coupesch".
Tolokonian hopes did not affect the UNO of Mordovia, which is considered a "weapon", and only one human rights defender was a new composition, and they had not even adopted documents for competition.
Member of the OOP Nicolai Swanidze told RBK daily that he had voted against the proposed list, as it was noted in Moscow and Rostove to Dona.
In his position, he dismissed other members of the Council.
His colleague on OP Paul Huss said that he voted for as he liked the proposed Moscow list.
He coordinated the listing of UNO Vice-Secretary ODP Vladislav Grib, also as a staff of the FIIN Institute.
The group told RBK daily that it was not the right to share candidates to human rights defenders, and it was not agreed that the Chairman of the Commission was sufficiently powerful to prevent its work.
The group is not taken to predict the results of the vote of the OOP Council.
If the proposed list is rejected today, the amended option will be made within the next days of the vote.
Australian woman appeals against the term of prison in Thailand
The 21-year-old woman from Sidnea sentenced to 15 prisons on the island of Phuket for a false appeal for the attack of a taxiist, gave appeal to condemnation and was released under the contract.
Steve Roshel Bamford was initially recognized by the Phucket Provincial Court on 15 June by a false investigation after the police reported that the local taxist was attacked at Sunday, on 10 June, while two other men were holding it.
However, the video watch cameras later found that she was well returned to her hotel after the breakdown of her Australian fighter.
The Phucket police asked Bamford for two days before she acknowledged that the story was manufactured.
She was in local police cameras before the court.
Bamford was sentenced to 15-year prison terms in the centre of the maintenance of the Phukett overseas, not in the women ' s prison for adults.
She is the daughter of the Australian League Peter Tanx, who was called to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for the help of her daughter.
Tanx said to the Siege Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “extremely concerned” by her daughter’s welfare and waited for her return to Australia.
“ Obviously it was a worried time, but we hope that she will return home as soon as possible, ” said Tanx.
Bankford was appealed to his sentence and was released under 500,000 baths.
According to the reports in Australia, it is in that time to carry out its departure in the crowd zone in South Thailand.
The legal sources in Thailand reported that Bamford currently represented a local lawyer in Phokeet, but they warned that the appeal could lead to the court to increase its sentence for two years and allows it to delay the terms for adults.
However, after the recent murder of the Australian tourist Michel Smith in Pucket Tayland, it may also try to restore its subordinated tourist ham, which will lead to a sentence.

Remember, his Roman became the finalist of the four first prizes: "Food Pool", "Russian Bucker", "National Unitseller" and "The Big Book".
In the past year, the writer of this book was authorized by the Government of the Russian Culture Federation.
Roman Saintin is an unbelievable leader in the generation of current thirty-year-old projects.
Practically, every publication of its heavy publications, which are built on the modern lifestyle and events, has caused a thrilling conflict between the most different areas.
It can be said that a single article on the prosecution and publication of Sencin, the reviews on its books and magazine publications are made up a favorite and unexpected Russian literature from the end of the 1990s to the beginning of 2010.
In the discussions on the "one of the most coherent writers" said the criticism of Sergey Chuppin, mostly it is that its participants understand the word "literature" which is real and future not only our word, but also our life.
Unfortunately, the number of books did not allow to include the majority of its articles and reviews from regional media and blogs.
Analytical and review articles are generally given in reducing the Absay Sections ...
