At the end of the exchange, the swimming Prague's boundaries in the negative
After the breakfast of Sunday morning, the beach of Prague rectified his loss.
Transactions with the ΒEZ actions reached almost half of the normal daily exchanges.
Thursday, from the beginning of the trade, the Prague's bourse renewed with its fall of the jungle, when she lost almost six percent.
This time, the slow is due to the fall of the wave street.
The market reaction towards the result of the vote of the United States representatives, which refuses to adopt the American financial sector stabilising plan, is so evident as well as at us.
Successfulness of actions in Asia
Asian bourses lived a dramatic fall, even though the indexes were successful during the day to remove a part of losses.
The Hong Kong Bus index lost 4 per cent during the exchanges, but later, it lost a part of losses and reduced about 2.5 per cent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprise Index following the movement of Chinese Hongkong's bourne action lost 3,8 per cent, the markets were closed in Shanghai.
Sydney's bourse actions lost more than five per cent, but finally losses were able to reduce 4.3 per cent.
According to its index, Taiwan Bourse lost 3,6 per cent.
"The hesitation on the rescue action in the United States will affect the financial markets of the whole world," observes Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office.
Although Hong Kong was part of China, he set up its monetary policy itself, that is, independence from the Chinese Central Bank.
The interest rates are at Hong Kong the same level as in the United States.
According to the first Australian minister Kevin Rudd, the US legislators should quickly re-elect the negotiations and adopt the proposal for support of the financial system.
Otherwise, there would be a risk of the impact of other countries.
The blood bathing of the United States actions
Monday, the United States Representatives Chamber rejected the project of support for the financial system, which had to be allocated up to $700 billion (approximately $12 billion).
The legislators thus denied the call to support President George Bush's project.
According to Bush, the project should solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help to stabilise the entire economy.
American actions lived in Monday, a blood bath and the main index of actions known the largest loss of these last 20 years.
The Dow Jones index lost about seven percent, condemned a decline of such invergence for the last time in 1987.
The index was already lost during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free.
The Cede Congress: the US government can inject $700 billion in banks
The United States Congress Officers and the Government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of the financial aid agreement for the United States financial system.
It will be submitted to the vote at the beginning of the next week.
American legislators made a decisive turnover in the talks on the adoption of a saving plan in the form of a financial aid of $7,7 billion ($12 billion), granted to the US financial system.
Success is not so certain.
In fact, before publishing the final version of the law and submitting it to the vote, the Congressmans must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The financial support plan will be reviewed on Monday at the Chamber of Representatives.
He said to the Reuters Barney Frank Agency, the Chamber's Chamber's Bank and Financial Regulatory Committee.
According to sources, the early Monday, the plan should be subjected to the vote to the Senate.
According to economists, the advertising that the saving plan will be adopted should be the first major psychological factor to rehance financial markets.
However, given the complexity of mechanisms through which market aid can be effective, it will follow a "dislusion".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made a great progress.
We have resolved our divergent opinions on the form that should have the market stabilisation package," trusted the Bloomberg Democratic Agent Nancy Pelosi.
According to it, the final vote could be held since Sunday.
In the Sunday night, representatives of the legislators met the American Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give a final form to the government.
This should be saved, at financial companies, by inventive real estate assets leading to financial undertakings in considerable losses and threatening the stability of the system in its entirety.
"We are at the point of agreeing on a plan that will work and must also be effective on the market.
We still need to continue this market restructuring plan, but I think we are there," said Paulson.
A sign for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has considerable impacts on the markets of actions that are struggling.
According to the Democratic Senator, Harry Reid did not escape the legislators so that the Congress faces a final agreement since Sunday.
They like to calm the investors before the start of Asian financial markets, which are located in the first temporary area, where the Congress decision could affect Monday exchanges.
But for this moment, it is not possible to clarify with certainty when the two United States Congress Chambers will be voted, nor if negotiations are not able to remain blocked by such a problem at last.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted during the coming days.
However, the Law will still keep changes.
The total amount for the system shall be divided into two parties.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wanted, must be available as soon as possible.
But if the Congress has the impression that the programme does not meet its function, he has the possibility to block the allocation of the remaining amount, in two steps: first 100 billion additional dollars, then, to end, $350 billion.
Mr. Bush welcomes progress in negotiations
Although the Chairman could take its scope to this decision, the Congress has the opportunity to put it in minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the programme, which consists of obtaining finances for the purchase of bad real estate, including the value of the cut, was maintained by hundreds of thousands of Americans.
"All work is done.
The Chamber of Representatives should be able to proceed on Sunday at the vote of the Law, and the Senate Monday," stated Senator Judd Gregg.
The American President George Bush itself welcomes the progress in negotiations.
Tony Fratto declared that Mr. Bush was satisfied with the progress made in Saturday and appreciated "the bipartite effort to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy."
Limitation of foreign parachutes
The Chairman of the Bank Committee of Senator Christopher Dodd said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of contributions against losses, the decrease agreement, the deployment of the time-axis plan.
The new law also provides for limited donated parachutes for corporate directors who participate in the programme and establishes a committee that will ensure the monitoring of the funds.
This should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this issue and have made significant progress to a agreement that will walk and will be effective for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also provides assistance to the real estate owners who have problems to pay.
The Government should negotiate new contracts in the case of hypothetics that it will save, while decreasing the quantities of debitors and enable them to keep their houses.
Marek: A psychological help
According to the economic leader of Patria Finance David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its achievement will be very difficult.
"And that was due to the fact that the mechanism and the price of the purchase of assets to problems would be ignored.
This will be determined to shut up the share of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week to the iHNeed.cz server.
If the plan will be adopted now, or at the beginning of the next week, it is not so important as to Marek.
"There is much more important than the Congressmans agree, since this week, that they support this plan and that they will convey it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, predicting the adoption of the plan, is the most important at this time," said Marek.
A extreme struggle: MP3 readers against mobiles.
You will advise how to choose
While almost all mobiles can read MP3 files, no MP3 reader can be phoned.
It seems to be clear that it's better to buy just a phone.
There are sufficient reasons for providing an independent reader.
The choice depends fully on the mode of use and requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house a cheap gram grammophone to put Maxim Turbulenc's new album.
On the one hand, such musical products do not go on wine disk, and, from quality view, there is no objective reason, so that this happens.
Now, if there are in your edges of the entangled line disks, with rock art, jazz or blue, you're at least dreaming of such a grammophone.
It's also music during the movements, namely the composed music, to say it simplifiedly - music in MP3.
There are also categories based on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to cost eight thousand corones for a reader, as a fan of the Pink Floyd would have been hard to support auditors purchased for twenty-third corones on the market.
These are two extreme, among which there are enough places for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The life of batteries is also decisive
Some high-game music readers are capable of much more than a simple music reading, but it is here unknown functions, of course, of most mobiles.
No current device is just the phone.
Besides the first functions, telephone calls and SMS sent, it is able to read music and films, register these lasts, it has a variable quality photo device and, for example, can, even to serve navigation.
And if we take into account the Smartphones and the communicators, you'll have a little computer in your pocket.
Since no fridge knows grilling from the flesh and no television will take photos, we are almost looking at a miracle.
However, the universal character of the mobile is not without inconvenience.
More functions you use is larger, more the interval between two reloads will be reduced.
And music reading is one of the most important energy winners.
It is rarely possible to read music for 10 to 12 hours, in most cases, this number is quite lower.
In this regard, music readers (specially the most rudimentary) are clearly more performing.
In the case of good market mobiles, consider that they will not play music only for a few hours.
If, moreover, you can call on time in time, buy, to be over, a second reload for the job - this is valid even for cherous devices.
The problem will not be posed for MP3 readers, which can, after reloading, have a continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including less performing.
Another problem occurs during the recording of music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, a limited part of the devices has an universal USB connection, so much more than all can not be connected directly to the computer without a special software.
Of course, you can register music directly on the memory map, but few card readers can take it without reducing, given the small sizes of the memory cards used in mobile cards.
With regard to readers, you don't need, except (iPod), any software.
It is enough to fill, through USB connection, the music device from the computer.
Most mobiles and readers will create a media library classified according to the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, style, or then according to the user's judgment.
Some devices show only an index with a tree structure in the form of Windows Exploration, others are capable of both (irver, Samsung, Sony, Cown, intelligent phones with operational system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobiles have more knowledge
In the choice of a concrete device, you're especially interested in the lifetime of the accumulator, the memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the facilitation of the command.
If music is for you, primarily, a background sound and if in the day you will listen to that for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, it is enough for you to read any mobile MP3.
Practically, all the mobiles are available today.
You are not even obliged to take too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or reader is able to read.
Everyone arrives to read MP3 and the large majority of the music that will reach until you just have this format.
It is part of the most dispersed formats and in addition to it, the large majority of the devices are also read of the WMA format music.
The AAC (format used by strong Apple and its iPods) is less common than it is.
High gamme mobiles also allow online music purchase.
It is enough to visit the web pages of the operator (or those of another supplier) from the portable phone and buy the song or album in question.
This service should be a convincing reason for providing a musical mobile.
The offering of operators is unfortunately misunderstanding and, in most cases, it is limited to rapid tube radio.
The prices aren't lower.
However, it is generally considered that this way to purchase music (which is by GSM, the Internet, or the free Internet) will dominate the musical industry in the future.
Most people always carry their mobile on themselves.
Every time you want to listen to something, you just have to get out of your pocket mobile, while you forgot your MP3 player home.
But it is also important if you have always listeners or a free handle with connection.
If not, you can use the integrated pregnancy, which has almost all mobiles, but a minimum of MP3 readers.
For many, the main advantage of musical mobiles is their price.
The less cost costs normally less than 3000.
For a price of three thousand crowns, you may have a very convenient walker.
But in most cases, you will be limited by the absence of output for ordinary listeners.
The price of the best phones and the best tools, also a entry for ordinary listeners, is not exceeding 15 000.
The readers, on the contrary, have the advantage of having a easy command.
Of course, any one is coming to ensure the command of the most rudimentary players - which do not match for the less chers (cf. our choice).
A minimum function; and the similarity of the command with a cassette post, which is used in the past, or a gramphone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a mobile internet branched by hasard, monitoring a huge data transmission facture.
What device to choose
Even the least cheerful mobiles (e.g. Vodaphone 527) have a slot for exchangeable memory cards (M2 type, microSD and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a map, you will not exceed 2 000 corones.
But take care.
Base models are in principle only cards with a maximum of 2 GB capacity.
Only the cheapests are out of it even with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile and want to buy a good MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, a Emgeton, or a iriver.
On the basis of the capacity (max. 2 GB), you should not cost more than 1 100 corners.
If you are part of more demanding auditors, choose specialized walkman mobiles (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are provided independent command keys for MP3, and it is also the exit of the command approaches to the one of an independent MP3 driver.
Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles in the walkman series have the same user menu as MP3 readers separately sold, is the one who went far away in this area.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (by 16 GB) and a living period of the accumulator (normally 15 hours up to 35 hours) is safeguarded by a MP3 reader produced by one of the higher marks mentioned.
One Virtual Operator will win Czech this year itself.
Maybe
The mobile market in Czech is relatively advanced, and our operators proposing practically the same services as their Western partners.
In spite of this, it misses something like something - a virtual operator, which would force classic operators to slow prices.
He mayn't miss for a long time.
We have already spoken on Mobil.cz the fact that Czech operators are part of the most cherishest in Europe.
The ŠTU (Cheque Telecommunications Office), who reported that the price of a SMS was higher at us than in the rest of the Union, confirmed it otherwise.
Thus, following the last steps of the European Commission in the field of the regulation of the roaming resources, a paradoxal risk is to happen - the SMS sent from the foreign will be for certain clients of the Czechic mobile operators less cherish than in the country.
How is it possible that the prices in Czech as high as compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks a competition that would really want to enter into the fight.
This may appear to be paradoxal, since we even have three mobile networks and a penetration that exceeds the 100% widely.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to claim that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this way, Pavel Dvośák, President of the Czech Office's Telecommunications Council (TU), who stated several times that there was no place for another operator in Czech Republic, makes chorus with the operators.
It is probably true that a classic operator with its own network has a lot of chances (e.g., now, it would only find difficult frequencies).
But there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It is just the entry of virtual operators on the mobile market that had a significant decrease of prices, which should then react classic operators too.
However, even before the entry of the feasts such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, voices similar to those that today we heard were left to hear in Great Britain.
However, it was apparent that it remained from the place for such operators and that they could have real success.
We are not obliged to go too far to find examples.
In February we had informed you about the launching of the Virtual Mobilking operator in Poland.
In six months, this operator has succeeded to win more than 100 000 customers and to become the Fifth Operator of the country.
Adds that behind the Mobilking, there is the Penta Financial Group, which has among others the U:phone in Czech.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on a more concrete target group.
In order to be effective, they actually need much less customers than a classic operator.
They are in fact exempted from the costs of construction, exploitation and maintenance of the mobile network, relatively high.
This is as well as in the world, virtual operators are profiled as low-free operators - they propose calls and good market SMS, which is often contrary to a limited service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers SMS at least two times less good than its competitors in Britain.
But, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, misleading on an inhabited target group may also be a good part of advertising.
Indeed, this operator is a specific way for men.
"The real men choose Mobilking - a operator who pleases them and whom they can trust," said David Seibert, the Mobile Entertainment Company CEO, operating this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept could be possible to walk with us too.
Miroslav śepickī, Vodafon's talking port, doubtless: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, which is based on most virtual operators.
More than it is relatively saturated from the view of the service offer."
In Czech no chance, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost sure that if there is a virtual operator in Czech, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this project successfully, but negotiations are not very promoting in Czech.
Mobilking's launch will be placed in other countries of our area," said in a telephone rental for Mobil.cz Jana Studničkova, the port of the Penta Financial Group.
Indirectly it confirmed that the operators in Czech were not in any case favourable to this idea.
On the contrary, they tried to do all their possible ways so that a potential competitive could not appear.
The GTS Novera Group, who would so wish to make a new step to become a real telephoneika competitor in the field of business customers, does not hide its intention to start a virtual mobile operator for a long time.
"We are so able to propose our customers not only fixed telecommunication services but also mobile.
And the most early will be the best.
We have already undertaken negotiations on this possibility several times with all the Czech mobile operators.
With some, we made progress in the negotiations," said the talking port of the Pavel Kadl Group.
So the future may be promised.
According to non-official information, we may be able to welcome the first virtual operator from the end of the year.
But for now, his creation is accompanied by a total silence.
"In this moment, we do not consider that there is place on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
Czech market is in comparison with other very specific markets.
At the moment, no subject of a complex and serious project in this field has not been contacted with us", stated Vlastimil Mšeğ of the Press Division of Telephoneika O2 in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
The T-Mobile Martina Kemrová's door stated in a rare agreement with the Declaration of O2: "We have not registered for the moment of living and bilaterally advantageous projects, which could serve as a basis."
And it adds: "It is practically excluded that a virtual operator appears in the T-Mobile network from here to the end of the year.
To operate in a so-called time laps, we should have a concrete agreement since now."
Vodafone instead directs his attention on the completion of applications to obtain its own 3G license.
Miroslav śepickī said in this regard: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, especially in the field of shared costs and infrastructure.
That is what, according to us, means most of the customer views.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is the discovery of a partner to establish a common network for a fast mobile web."
The responsible authorities: in phase with operators
The starting of mobile operators is easily comprehensible, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to a lower prices and therefore at a decline of their benefits.
What, therefore, is it good to facilitate the event of such a competition?
When it comes to their interests, the operators know that they are like shooting in fire. The kidnapper who accompanies the creation of the U:phone also witnesses.
The most apparent pressure on the U:fon was the T-Mobile company.
Showing information available to the public posting of the Web pages of ŠTU.
But today, the U:fund is ready to serve as a argument to not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrova noted this subject: "The competition on the mobile market has been recently expanded by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
In view of the nature of the mobile market in RT, it is obvious that the entry of an additional player will submit it, and in particular its services, to high requirements."
However, given the attitude of the mobile operators here, the indifference of the Czech regulatory agencies seems unreasonable.
However, it is not just the attitude of the tsunami, which, in contrast with Great Britain and other developed countries, has unfortunately not been the power to participate in economic competition in Czech Republic.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for Economic Competition (UOHS).
However, this last adopted its typical position against this problem.
"The entry of a virtual operator on the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the relevant virtual operator on the location of the necessary infrastructure.
No agreement of this type has been concluded at the time, since the offering of potential interests had not provided sufficient interest for classic operators," stated in response to our question, Christián Chalupa, from the Department of Foreign Relations of the UOHS.
A statement made so would not be surprised by representatives of the operators.
But from an office, which must represent consumer interests and, among others, also care, so that no one benefits from its market position, such a statement is more than exchanging.
Moreover, Christián Chalupa adds: "To the foreign, where virtual operators are normally present, they can see that their income on the market has contributed to a decrease in the prices of mobile telephone services."
Now, making pressure in the sense of a honest market operation and a decrease of prices does not seem to be part of the interests of the UOHS.
What is effectively shocking, is the almost touching agreement of the three mobile operators, which declares their reactions.
The question, if it really is a accident, is naturally.
Similarly, a price of strictly identical essence to all service stations is overly due to the fall and the hard fighting of competition.
"The office has not indicated in this regard signs of anti-competitive behavior, so it has not been reasoned to act in any way or in another.
No operators have dominant position, therefore nor has an increased responsibility of their market behavior.
The tools necessary for the opening of the mobile market to virtual operators probably miss even the telecommunication regulator," stated in its Chaloupa statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many points of discussion.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the UCU, as telecommunications are, from the view of economic competition, a single market.
No Czech operators have a dominant position on such market.
However, some law experts propose another vision of things: to ensure that a virtual operator is possible, it must be obtained at each time the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator has enough logically the monopole on its network.
This is how it is necessary to play a dominant role in a certain segment of his activities.
However, even without granting this argument, it should be at least worried about the UOHS that three mobile operators are visiblely in a similar manner.
However, the complaints of many interests (including the GTS Novera company, already mentioned) show that they face in negotiations with all operators in similar disputes.
Returns the responsibility of the YATU is a sufficiently common tour in communications, through which the UOHS lay the hands of the case.
We have already met this type of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to renew the Telecommunications Act, adopted recently, to enhance the powers of TSI in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many specialists promised a improvement in the situation.
This is why UOHS representatives must know well, but their interests seem to be another part.
When no one looks, it can walk
This says, the function of a type of virtual pseudo operators, several in the Czech mobile networks, remains unexpected.
These are companies who publish their own price list of mobile telephone services, but these are only public.
In most cases, it is the issue of strong occupation of the multi-level marketing.
For example, specialized mobile mobile services are proposed by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many other.
The price lists of these firms are generally obtained only by elections.
The magic tour consists of the fact that the company made before the operator is a classic business customer that controls a large number of SIM cards.
As an important customer, it obtains special price offers (and other).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czechic mobile operators prohibit such a return.
"If it would happen to what you say, it could be a crime of the contractual conditions we would consider and which could lead to an end of cooperation with the society concerned," answered our question on this issue Martina Kemrova.
However, it is little likely that such activities do not be achieved until the responsibilities of mobile operators are responsible.
In the case of the three enterprises mentioned, it may be thousands of customers.
Nevertheless, a number of operators do not oppose such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these firms give their benefits unnecessary, and, at the same time, by opposition to real virtual operators, they do not threaten them nervously with their own official marketing.
Miroslav śepickī indicates the possible problems: "The law allows such spheres, however, services of these companies are only used by a percentage of disadvantaged customers.
In addition, these are bound to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they can't have fully, as normal customers of mobile operators."
But that's precisely that should appear strange to the UCU.
Furthermore, there is another question to the UNOHS.
If mobile operators close the eyes on such procedure, why do they block the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that UNOHS has relatively large powers to declare such activity and if it does not want to satisfy the explanations of operators, which claims to have no idea that this would happen, their contracting conditions would be prohibited.
When we are no longer the most precious country
As we have already mentioned several times, the entry of virtual operators on the mobile market has produced a significant decline in the service price.
However, almost in almost all countries where virtual operators appeared, classical operators were soon efforts to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by these lasts were practically the same - a too small market, or too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, it is precisely at this level that, in developing countries, regulators, who defended not the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
While formal measures as well as informal pressure, they ended by obtaining the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators address this issue in the form of a warm ground pomp that is slowly released by transmitting it to a close target.
According to the experiences we have, we can't be disappointed of the impression that confusion in their skills is in these cases more than profitable.
But don't smell the smell after the coggle.
If collision information is true, and a virtual operator will soon appear at us, the Czech mobile market may be moved.
If one of the operators accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the UOHS would only be difficult to remain unlikely faced with the rejection (discrimination) of other interests.
And we may stop calling more money than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymne has four new versions.
Select the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national symn.
Thursday, at the Day of Czech Nationality, the first Minister Miek Topolánek presents the new records of the National Kde domomæj (Who is my patriarch?).
The symne was reregistered again by the national theatre under the direction of Jiśí Bślohlavek.
We have four versions - with a single male or woman's song, an interpretation with hair and instrumental version.
The song is assured by Kateśina Knśinkov and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the symne arrangements.
You can listen to the four new versions on iHNeed.cz server.
Bślohlavek considers the Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymnes.
As he had previously granted to the Rozhlas (the Czech public radio), he has chosen for the interpretation of the songers only with youth and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"After the beginning, I tried to take care of what the two songers, as well as the laugh, had a good word, so that the words are well understood, that they are sing simultaneously," he said.
The Czech National Hymn will celebrate the next year its 175th anniversary.
The Kde domovj song reserved for the first time in 1834 on the plates of Stavovské divadlo (the theâtre of the states) in Fidlovačka (Kermesse des saveiers), the original checa part of Josef Kajetán Tyl, composed of the music of František Šcroup.
It has become popular, and people have been spontaneously appropriate.
After the creation of the Czechoslavakia in 1918, the first couple naturally became an integral part of the national symn.
It remains one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How Sounds the "new" hymne
Common transport (MHD) will introduce the pocket in their tickets system.
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be registered in the history of Prağský Dopravní podnik (the Pragoise Transport Agency) as the date that the first passengers will take into the metro, trams and bus, which, instead of having a paper ticket, will have an electronic cut in their pocket.
At this time, this last is available for a few hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard card.
Travellers may buy a 30-day or 90-day breakfast (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and then register on their pool card in the information points and offices of the Dopravní podnik (the Transport Agency), located in the Museum Metro stations, Mśstek, Nádraṣṭí Holešovice, Andśl, Roztyly, Letśany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
From this time there is also the possibility of buying internet cups on the Dopravni podnik websites: www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred people benefited from the service during the morning.
Those who will start to use the online store can definitively forget skies in the metro stations, where they should still ask for inpatience in long chains to obtain paper tickets.
Indeed, they will purchase their back by the Internet and register it on their Opencard card in one of the thirty-first Måstská knihovna (munitional libraries).
"In these contact points, passengers have a guicket with a formed staff, which will help interests with the purchase by the internet, and will also register the copy they have purchased on their card," says Martin Opatrný.
Besides the libraries, it will also be possible to register electronic cuts on the Opencard in automatic distributors installed in the clothing of several metro stations.
What are these distributors like?
They are red, remembering the machines to compose tickets and passengers may have already noticed them in the Roztyly metro stations, Budåjovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
" Today, the city in five, but from here the end of the year, there should be twenty," adds Opatrný.
An automate will control the shooter instead of the shooter
Automates that will work from tomorrow are easy to use.
It is enough to introduce the Opencard puce card and the previously purchased copy will register himself on the card.
E-collections are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in the outdoors of the city.
In Peribain trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which mainly use the populations of the Central Body communities to access capital.
"In the trains integrated in Prağská Integrovaná doprava (integrated transports of Prague), the controllers are equipped with card readers, through which they establish the temporary and regional validity of the cups;" explained the control of the Philip Drapal tickets of the Ropid organization, which constitutes the time of transport in the Pragoal Common.
Periurban buses are equipped with integrated card players in the chair.
It is therefore necessary to show the cart on the heating, but it must also place the Opencard on the side of the box.
This is also the control of the validity of the stored cuts.
"In the case of the passenger had to check the validity of the registered cuts, there is nothing more simple than requesting such information to the driver," Supplemented.
The passengers that do not take peri-urban bus and will not remember the date when they expire their validity, the automatic distributors can return to the initially used distributors to store the cards.
Here, on the screen of the device, information on the validity of their document will be shown.
Sudans requested a referendum to the United States
The Sudan Germans asked in 1945 to be integrated in the United States.
This describes a letter posted in the collections of Jihočeská vśdecká knihovna (The Scientific Library of the Southern Bohem).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we would like to live at least under the U.S. patronate.
In 1945, some Southern Alliances groups claimed to the President of the United States with such a desire.
This is among other letters preserved in a private archive, which is currently put in the collections of Jihočeská vśdecká knihovna.
Germans from Krumlov pray to the President of the United States in the letter to allow "Schumavská śupa" (region of forests south of the Bohem) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - to return to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation and we really want to be sure that the words proclaim that the American troops come in the German territory are not oppressors and enemy, but freezers," is written in the letter signed "Persons, whose sort of the Šumava is in heart."
Since the railment to Czechoslovakia is intended to be promised - by knowing the Czech National Charter - that of brutality, incomprehensive attitude, incomprehension, oppression and service, the authors of the letter request the American President to take the protection of the Zhumava forever.
"We can't believe that you would grant this territory to a foreign State to us, which oppresses and destroys minorities and has nothing contributed to the victory of the Alliances without taking into account the opinion of the fourth million people," is written in the letter.
The reason for which the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire of vengeance of "Czechian oppressors".
If the President of the United States had the view of the Germans of Zhuwa, it would be only to organize, according to the letter authors, a referendum in the region to establish whether his people would like to be part of the United States, or to live under the U.S. patron.
Although the text contained in the letter can, taking into account the current knowledge of the history of the next war, appear some naif, according to some survivors, well illustrate the expectations of the Sudan Germans of the time.
While the Czech Germans should at least interview that the issue of their expulsion from the Republic would be, very few of them had given such a possibility.
Some expected that the United States and the Great Britain would be obtained for the Sudans a certain type of autonomy.
Others believed they would just stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born to Budśjovice, confirms it.
During the war, it was, as Almand of śeské Budåjovice, joined in the sea in the Balts countries.
At the end of the war, he was captured by the Englishs and placed in the Holstein capture camp, tens of Czech Almands came to consult him so that he learned the Czech Republic.
"They believed that once they returned home, the Czech would benefit them," said Chalupa.
None of the arrested Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war did not estimate, according to the Beneš Decrees, that he would be removed from the Republic.
You don't think, you pay!
An emotive campaign will attack drivers
Action on road safety is the most costful in the Czech history.
A way to characterize the emotive media campaign that is intended to launch, mercredi, the Ministry of Transport.
The office of Minister Alesh śebæek believes that it will discourage the drivers of a dangerous behaviour on the flight.
This campaign, which costs 150 million, will appear at television, radio, cinema, Internet, but also on shops.
It should discourage the drivers of fast and alcohol at flight.
But also remembering them to take the ceinture before starting.
She especially wants to touch the conscience of youth drivers, moths, peetons, without forgetting professional drivers.
What's going on in the spots?
Over all personal stories that will attack emotions.
The slogan "sanglant" of the whole campaign is also witnessed:
You don't think, you pay!
The phrase "You don't think" is registered in Majuscules on the recording plate.
Then, in a flash of blood, there's the phrase "You'll pay."
What must symbolize that a moment of intention can be paid for life.
The spots will "han" the spectators until 2010.
The Ministry has inspired similar campaigns in the Anglo-Sexons countries, where there are common images with drastic images of the victims of accidents.
He believes that this will cause a decrease in the accident rate and the number of deaths on the Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Sugar and smooth strategy against drivers
"What goes with the drivers is the sugar system.
For them, the sugar is represented, for example, by winning time when they grill a red fire.
The crazy is the threat of an adjustment or an accident.
The risks must be remembered to drivers," said Martin Kośán, the hospital's transport psychologist Na Homolce.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and, in particular, negative advertising, the psychologue considers.
The control panels reporting the danger to drivers are, according to him, less effectively.
"When a static panel is installed against a danger, it will probably be fast to fusion with the environment and the drivers will not see it anymore," says Kośán.
Olmert would make peace exchange in almost all the occupied territories
Ehud Olmert, the President of the Provisional Government of Israel, is promulgated for the refund of almost all the occupied territories in 1967, including West Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Highs, in exchange of peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published on Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must go to an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to make almost all the territories (occupied), or all", says Olmert daily.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we shall have to cease to the Palestinians a similar percentage (of the Israeli territory), because without that, peace will not be done", he added.
It acknowledges that the possible refund would understand Jerusalem-East.
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem, and especially does not want to shoot tractors and bulldoers his feet, as it happened to one of my best friends, he must turn away to the parties of Jerusalem," noted Olmert by making an allusion to the two attacks in the city, in July, in which several people were killed and tens of blessed persons.
According to the first minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Monte del Temple, the sacred and historical places" located within the city of Vieille.
"He who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will be bound to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not be walking," he smiling through the next.
Golan's height retrait
Olmert also pronounced for the retirement of Israel from the Golan, which is, according to him, an essential condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require some of the efforts made by Damas.
"I propose not to conclude peace with Syria only on the basis of a Golan retirement," he reported.
"The Syrians are very well knowing what they're going to leave to get the Golan.
They will have to reject their current relationship with Iran; they will have to leave their relationship with Hezbollah (movely twenty-third); they will have to reject the constant support that they are granted to the Hamas terrorism (move), Al-Kaiida (Terrorist network), as well as from the Djihad (heilig war) in Iraq," explained the first minister.
Questions that emerge after the accident: are stewards in the car illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long road is prohibited
In the context of the tragic accident of the company's University Agency near Patue, Italy, the question is whether stewards and passengers may move inside the car.
"If we wanted to comply with the law strictly and formally, the activity of a steward is contrary to the road traffic law," says Karel Hanzelka's speaking port of the Ministry of Transport.
The accident in question, during which a 22-year-old host was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the road of the car.
The young girl was at this time unfortunately sit next to the heating, on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she was at its disposal of two other seats.
But the car may have an accident, even slowly, even when the steward serves the coffee or distributes newspapers.
What's important, is if the car is in accordance with its technical shuttle equipped with places falling or not.
If this equipment is not authorised, passengers must stay sit.
The long-term cars from the Student Agency have no debole places; which has been confirmed in Update.cz by the director of the company Radim Jančura.
"This is a matter we have treated with the Ministry and, at the beginning, prohibits all passengers movement.
Then they canceled it and we found that passengers can go to the toilets during the traject, provided that they have their own seat," he declared his position.
The law ignores the steward
" There is no unique legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legal prescription is concerned with this role.
On the other hand, no legal prescription is prohibited by the carrier to propose services.
The road transport law only knows the term of vehicle receiver; it does not define its rights and duties," adds with more ambiguity the Hanzelka port.
Josef Pokorný, director of the Department of Trafficking of Road vehicles, estimates, on the other hand, that the law is sufficiently dealing with the problem.
" Everything depends on whether the car has the permission to propose places in its approval.
All living there," he said.
The cars are divided in urbans, where there are limited places and maximum speed, inter-urbanized with higher levels, and higher allowed speed and long-term cars, with the highest allowed maximum speed, and seats equipped with security seats.
Like in the flight, one expert said
Jaroslav Hośín, expert at BESIP (curity of road traffic) in safety in transport, does not see the movement of stewards to board as a major problem.
"In regular circulation there is no danger; the situation may be compared to the service of the aircraft.
Nevertheless, it is not sure when a turbulence will occur and the air hostship can covered the head."
"Ow, in the case of the bus would slowly slaughter, physical laws would clearly be valid.
Like in a city bus or in a tram.
The carrier must handle the safety of stewards through internal requirements," he also believes that, from the point of view of the law, the problem is not resolved.
Jančura is ready to remove these services
Student Agency is the only car carrier to offer steward services.
He's up to two hundred.
Even after that accident, the director does not consider their work as a risk work.
"But as long as I'll have the impression that it's a risk work, I'll remove it.
The passengers can receive their coffee and their newspapers at the packaging.
This would also reduce the costs," he said.
The security concern is the reason why the director of Asiana Alexeï Litvine has no stewards in its vehicles, which ensures, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines.
"We have no hosts, we're opposing it since the beginning.
Soon or later this will end by a death accident," he said, a year ago, in Tøden.cz.
A great tragedy has arrived
A young host of the Plześ region, who worked for the company for two years, died at the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably removed the emergency stop band without using clignotant and locked the road to the car.
The chauffer of this last to try to avoid it through a brush maneuver, but he burned it by his right side.
Jančura refuses that the two seats reserved at the rest of the stewards were sold.
"In the case of long lines, it is not possible to reserve these places, they are blocked."
The company has a complaint against the truck driver.
For the detriment of the young girl's family, the Agency will not wait for the court's judgment, but in terms of financial compensation, it also takes account of the guilty.
Amendment of the law?
Not viewed
An amendment of the law, which has been developed for more than one year by a group of thirty experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide specifications regarding the movement of stewards on the board of the car.
"Ow, she did not reach any conclusion on this point.
In fact, it is not too interested in bus, but instead of the point system, the maximum speed on the car and the use of the portable on the flight," said the experts Hoquín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of stewards as a matter that fundamentally puts into danger of passenger security", concludes the Port Hanzelka, by clarifying that autocar security control is under the authority of the police and the work security office.
The hopes of the Düsseldorfois are on Francfort.
Great words were not missing in the letter addressed by the WestLB Director Committee to house employees.
By an unity of the Financial Institute of Düsseldorf with the Deka-Bank de Francfort, "the Central Financial Market Institute of Spain's Financial Group" could, according to the Monday Public E-mail.
WestLB would bring a double competitive block to a sustainable productivity in such a case.
In total, such a relationship could be a decisive cut to other concentrations in the country bank sector.
It seems like this when a direct committee wants to demonstrate its action capacity in difficult times.
Because WestLB, blessed, has always been a strong pressure.
It is not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Monitoring Authority, which has recently clearly made it clear to the government of the North-Westfale Land that the time was counted in the search for a future solution.
It is, however, questioned for a few years - also on the side of Francfort - of a relationship between the Deka bank, who knew Spain's customers from their investment funds, and WestLB.
The head of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas reported in the presentation of the final half-août numbers that he did not see any meaning in the fusion of the Mainzer Landstrasse house with a country bank, which is Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Governing Board of Deka, whose half is supported by the countries' banks and by the groups of smuggling chambers, was responsible for conducting discussions with WestLB for common trade activities.
It could then be the flow of the financial market, or parts of that.
However, the talkers are just starting, say in the financial place.
It is not the first time that Deta-Bank, who, with its 3000 employees, accounts for one of the most important employees on the Francfort financial place, in their games, is about consolidation of the balance chains sector.
In 2003, Deta-Bank was able to fusion with the Rhenanie Palatinat and Halbab country bank.
There's nothing to do with this thermal leg.
Unlike the plans, they were publicly reported that the Government of Hesse's country was opposed to any participation in the Hellaba.
Then the other two houses did not join.
The country bank of Rhenanie Palatinat was raised in place at the Bade-Wuttenberg Land Bank in Stuttgart.
But there are still new treaties on the regrouping of Deka-Bank with countries' banks.
Lastly, the President of Hellaba's Hellaba Directorate Committee, Omther Merl, however, was pronounced against any commercial fusion strategy with his bank.
Independence on this, feeling seems to be emphasized that the regrouping of the various institutions in the public sector is particularly urgent.
Now that the election to the country of Baviera has passed, a BayernLB Union with the Bade-Wuttenberg Land bank could first be made.
For Helaba, it's not particularly a good news.
If the pressure obliged to new fusions had to increase, the possible partners slowly escape him.
In the south, she would now be a Junior partner, although she had been better resisting to the crisis than the Munich and Stuttgart banks.
The grouping of Hesse-Thuringe boxes, which has 85 per cent of the capital of Helaba, took a shut in the beginning of the year on all Union with WestLB.
The NorthLB would stay on the rigour.
However, such geo-strategic reflections reflect only one of the faces.
Another aspect poses the question of how the different commercial models of each of these banks can be set up.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive issue, namely what commercial model the future capacity of the countries' banks should be assured, had not been resolved by the German group of cash and shipments.
At the end, a WestLb disappearing could have occurred, dispatching that is not obviously desired here.
This is also what it is asked in the letter of the Executive Committee: in any case state, a 'global resolution' would be mentioned for the establishment.
How will all this be put into the same cart with the unity of some entities with Deta-Bank remains to see.
The second weekend of the bird party is also known as the weekend of Italians.
For Elena, it's the first time, for Luca for the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena joins him as a little friend, and so nothing is like, he says.
On the other hand, near to a ton of five litres of the Kaiser Mark, a well-building barbue that shows about 200 visitors of the bird party whose deep sounds can produce its funeral.
Elena's shoot first, then shoot it.
From Bologne, they came to Verone.
From there, from the road car near the new Puorta car, four bus take the start at 23.45 p.m., "Monaco destination, birra party" arrived at 6:30.
Three buses are preserved first for Italians, in one of the buses travel to Brazil only.
In a parking round, South Americans are sing of hours and already next to their dragon, they have already celebrated last night.
And also burning, Marco Watch explains, this is not for Italians.
The bus belong to Marco, which takes a long double shooting swimming pool and swimming to large armed montures.
For five years, they go to the bird's feast, three injured only this year.
They're going over the night, stay on the party, and returning at 22:30.
And the night would include unnecessary costs, Marco explains.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pool with a Kaiser blue, raised in accordance with the Bavaroise cleaning law, the disease insurance and a responsible group in Germany - Marco made a language course in Francfort.
And the bus are already rolling in the night on the "Brennero" Autostrada direction.
There's no bird, not yet.
Quickly, everything becomes quiet in the bus, travellers sleep.
That's better, they will still need their forces.
Pauses will be made in Bressanone, and in Holzkirchen, while many other bus with Italian registration plates do again a little break before Munich, on the 8.
When a little morning, the Marco group finally arrives at six-third hours as planned on the parking near the Terrecee place, about 50 other bus from all Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the other are gathering together, Marco holds a last talk, explains the attack plan.
First of all, covered by the small yellow cake.
Dessus is written to the left 'Bill Feast', in bossica, and on the Internet address of the Marco’s travel agency 'conoscersiviando.it'.
Secondly, "When the doors of the blue captain open, they are short," Marco cried in the small morning.
'Come!' Run and reserve the places on the back of the tent.
"Don't be blocked, and not all the white boxes on the same banks, it must be divided into the room!"
Crying, Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget it!
'Mender to security agents that we do well!
As you leave your places, they're parts!"
Thirdly: ‘Third night, be returning here at ten hours and half of pile!’ Complete?
And that's it, it's going to the bird party.
On the road, a new of the white cakes on the trees to find the way, the panels and even the electoral display of a large bavarian popular party.
We want to be ready for the return.
It's the second weekend of the bird's party, known as the 'week-end of Italians'.
There are no precise numbers; 50 000 are talking about the Alpes and slowing into the bird kitchen, 10 per cent of the visitors would come from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police is strengthened by seven South Tirol police officers, by Italian voluntary saviors supporting the Bavarois Red Cross, which produces statistics on countries where Italians take the first place before the British (60 interventions) and the Austrians (circa 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
Those who are particularly appreciated by Italians, this is the teater of the Hofbröu brassery.
Insomnie nubes for Hypo Real Estate's shareholders
The German banking system is relatively stabil, it stressed the Federal Minister of Finance just a few weeks ago.
What a chance the politician used the word “relatively” and that the German banking sector would not be paid by crisis movements.
This has actually occurred this weekend.
The financing of the Bavarois Hypo Real Estate (HRE), side of DAX, receives a German bank consortium a billion credit to protect market turbulences.
One person in the confidence of the situation said to Reuters Monday that the aid credits are allocated to an amount of EUR 35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate should now pay interests on the fraction to which it had so right.
The money produces both private banks and public law banks.
In the back-plan, this is the Depfa company who supports losses.
The state finance was, according to a newspaper article, a very short term for long-term projects for which he had paid money, which is not possible since the infidelity towards the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s liquidity reserve was reduced from 95 per cent to 2.537 million euros, and the own capital rate was also slightly slightly slightly 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
The current benefits and net benefits from financial transactions were, in comparison with the same period the previous year, to zero point, the benefits resulting from the allocation of determined credits and mobile values, as well as the elimination of provisions in credit operations had increased by more than 70 to 5 million euros.
It is only due to the important benefits resulting from the reimbursement of accountability costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as the reimbursement of interests according to the book of the tax procedures and commercial purchase for the companies of Konzern that the profit deficit of about 16 per cent has been adjusted.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state financial had first been unexpectedly shown on economic realities, which had then been subsidiated at the Aareal Bank.
Since classic state financing was not sufficiently rewardable, Depfa was then more intensified in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects between private investors and State (Privat-Public-Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
On the value of the folk society, Hypo Real Estate must process awareness that should have on the calculation of wines and losses of the group an essential material effect that remains even frozen.
The fact is that the dividends were shot.
By 2007, they were thrown into two thirds.
Hypo Real Estate is a high-important investor from Depfa's purchase.
It is stronger than other interbank market reintegration institutions because it has no customer deposit.
With the failty of the Investment Bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the allocation of credits between banks has been re-countered and the banks have accumulated their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs annually for a part - about 50 billion euros - from all the depfa credits of a short-term rebuilding means.
According to a reporter of Hypo Real Estate, the need for funding of the group is covered with the average-term credit and the protected undertaking of the flow of international markets widely outside the current walking state.
Other sources say that reintegration would be assured by the funds until the end of 2009.
The Chairman of the Directorate Committee of HRE Georg Funke explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group should not have to be used at the average period of financial markets.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Surveillance Surveillance (Bafin) are part of the principle that the capacity of the Hypo Real Group on the market is now assured.
The shareholders and creditors of the bank are only expected.
However, in view of the dynamic and non-popularity of the crisis, there is no certainty.
In addition, it is not impensable that the financing should not be used in its entire expansion.
But the opposite can't be disappeared.
After the fact that the bank is, according to the last reported, still to the doors of insolvency at the end of the Sunday at the end of the night, this savings will not be able to resolve the spirits.
The course of the action was 75% to 3,30 euros.
The courses of obligations, instead, are particularly well-being.
While the debts to the first head moved, the second plan loans are broken.
The most touched are especially the investment funds of the former company Württemberg Hypo and those who have a life period over 2009.
The obligation of the Hypo Real Estate bank seemed to be an alternative speculation placement, and its value must now be considered dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net hardware of the bank crisis and the crisis of the institute that has entered the crisis in the establishment by the Depfa Bank.
While emission institutions, Governments and less-tracked commercial banks are still ready to support the system, there can be a resurrection in time.
Or there will happen what no one is expecting at this time - that the financial crisis could be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in view of the renewed sounds of a partial nationalization, the probability that security approached is now a simple hope.
This should preserve inony nights before all the long-term creditors about the decision to know whether they should separate their commitments.
Short-term investors can always use what they have taken to make a deal of loss report for the next years on the income of the automatically refunded bourse winner capital.
Sylvana and boite secrets in Bento
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years old, has to be presented for the first day at the Tachibana High School, the girls start to ride: Germany is so "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana had already known this word thanks to Mangas - in its new exchange log, she talked about Japan.
"The first course day in Japan.
What was I excited.
Just leave the way to go to school, I was afraid.
I live in Tokyo in direction of Kawasaki and take the train 40 minutes up to Tachibana High School.
I have to find the whole way alone. Happy I'm not lost.
The beginning of the courses seems not to be fixed in a strict way as in our home in Basse-Saxe.
Students appear each other after eight hours, until 9 hours less than twenty, a table tour begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the course starts, it was to me to present me.
I'm not all like to talk to people, especially before a class of 40 students.
As I had not yet the uniform of the school, I put a old jump of my mother's accommodation, as well as a chemist, blue shoes and shoes to eat black.
Thus, I was presented before the pupil and tried to speak correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - I call me Sylvana, I came from Germany and my birthday is in one week.
At that moment, I was very happy that I started learning the language just two years ago.
The 31 girls of the class all made low, smiling and signs, and I constantly heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew him thanks to my eat.
He belongs to the vital vocabulary to the survival of Japanese births and means "mother, chou".
Then I was slowly shooted to my place.
The girl next to me made me a great irone dream, she found that it was a honour that the correspondant sits next to her.
The rest of the time was quiet, but when the gang sounded, I was stolen in the rules.
Everyone talked better, laughed, and made me a lot of questions - in this case, it was very difficult to understand the English Japanese.
During the pause, they all left their Bento.
My welcome mother also made me this kind of Lunchbox - it's really other than the poor in German.
I had rise to the aromatic herbs, small sausages, a concombre sald and algebra, fruits and a kind of meat around Tofu.
Most of the time, I don't know what I eat exactly here in Japan.
The things have a strange appearance and a completely new guest.
What's sure is that it's really good.
Well, if you don't know, you're gonna be able to smell.
Bentos are not only dinners in Japanese schools.
Sometimes, a girl offers a Bento that she prepared himself, and then is particularly carefully prepared - in hope of making a little better knowledge of the boy during the break.
I read this in my eat.
I'm interesting to know if I could observe it too here.
"Why did Japan in particular?" asked me my friends when I told them that I wanted to pass a year to school in Tokyo.
Then I always answered:
"When this is fascinating me, what."
Finally, reading sweet, that's what I prefer for for years.
And to better understand the food and culture that is found there at a time, I also began learning Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there a day.
Because I also have a low for traditions, us and habits.
And here, we are giving them a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the most recent technology and trends - on the other hand, it is severe, discerned and traditional.
And as everything is so well organized, I never felt lost here, even if Tokyo is the largest city I have never seen."
The rats also have feelings
A rat or a cafard fleet before the danger, is that what does it mean that he also feels afraid?
The neurophysician Joseph Le Doux is convinced: many animals also have feelings.
But how can we verify that he tests the same thing when he acts in the same way as we?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions are published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles of responses to the question "What do you think you're true without having the evidence?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other conscious states without me or anyone else has not yet been able to prove it until now, as we cannot prove that other human beings have a conscience.
But in that case, at least it can be expected that all human brain present the same configuration.
As we turn to other species and consider the matters of feeling or in general conscience, we're in difficult practiced fields because Hardware does not match.
When a rat is before a danger, he does the same as many other animals: he makes death, flying or attack.
Human beings are in the same way, so some scientists deduce a subjective life comparable.
But I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the brain structure make the transposition of our life subjective to the of the difficult animals.
One of the aspects is that the circles that are almost always associated with human conscience include the prefrontal late Court (for the participation of the short-term memory and the direction and execution functions).
This wide region is much more developed in human beings than in other primates and seems to be completely absent in other beings.
So, at least for these aspects of our conscience that depends on the frontal Court, among whom we are, and the ability to prevent and decide, it is reasonable to suggest that human being is different even from other primates.
Another significant particularity could be residing in the languages of humanity: a large part of its existence is linked to the language, which often means that its conscience depends on.
In that case, animals could be excluded.
But even though conscience should not depend on the language, it would certainly affect it, so animal conscience, whatever it was produced, would probably differ much of the majority of our conscience states.
That is why it is so difficult to determine what can be like conscience in other animals.
If this, internal and subjective, does not leave or measure or, due to this particular Hardware, analyze on our own experience, then its observation poses great problems.
Most of my developments are referring to the content of the conscious life, but there is another aspect of conscience that should be more scientificly available.
We could consider animal conscience processes without taking into account their content, and this is exactly what happened during short-term memory studies, especially with the example of visualization.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, we are focused on the nervous correlations of conscience than on the cause mechanisms: both may be identical or not.
Clearly, this approach also highlights the prefrontal Court's weight in the achievement of visualization.
But what does it result for emotions?
I conclude that an emotive system, such as fear, is active in a brain conscious of his own activity.
So what we call as "terror" is the mental state in which we find when the activity of the discharge system located in the brain (or its follows, as the reactions of the body) falls from the live memory.
Thus, emotions are closely related to the cortex regions that characterize primates and especially humans.
Subtle degrees of the sense, associated with our voluntary nature, are degenerated, because we can, with the help of words and grammary, distinguish and categorize states to imply them to others than to us.
In the opposite, Antonio Damasio, for example, thinks that the feelings from primitive activities are born in the regions of the body sensation of the Courtx and the cerebral tronk, as well as Jaak Pankseep, which is even more focused on the cerebral tronk.
As this network has not been much changed during human evolution, it could actually participate in transversal sense in all kinds.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I can't oppose it, but I believe it is indemonyable.
Pankseep argues that what is fearful in humans and rats is likely as feeling as in the two cases: how can it be checked if rats and men feel the same thing when they act likewise?
A cafard runs before the danger, but if he feels afraid?
In my eyes, similar behaviors do not suffice to prove identical vercules.
Of course, the nervous comparison helps: the rats and men have similar brain thrones, cafards against them do not even have a brain.
But is the cerebral throne at the origin of feelings?
And even if we could prove this for the man: how can we show it at rats?
I think the rats and other mammals, perhaps even the cafards (who knows?) have feelings.
But I wouldn't know how to show it.
And because their feelings are truly different from us (as human conscience is on special circles and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior than the emotional feelings of rats.
In all cases, progress is made on the nervous plan as the same thing is taken in rats and humans.
As I don't explore language and conscience in rats, nor feelings, I don't know whether they exist.
We could judge this as a short term, but I prefer to advance instead of stiring me constantly against a wall.
I'm actually a pragmatic emotion.
Platini, President of the EUFA: a period of gratitude for Poland and Ukraine
The Prime Minister, Iwan Wasjunik, explained that the preparations were soon placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The Government considers the EUFA decision to Bordeaux as a evidence of trust in Ukraine and its ability to organize, in collaboration with Poland, the Championships of Europe", announced Watjunik.
"But this isn't an amnistic for our country.
The work is just starting, and there is still much to do in the two countries."
In the calendar of construction or destruction of cities, streets, hotels and airports, the two guests run after the terms.
The number of cities for Europe's Championship may eventually be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't lose time anymore.
We have to work at the maximum speed," said the President of the Ukrainian Link Grigori Surkis.
"EUFA has kept us at the eye."
A more radical measure was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the PZPN football ligation was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after many scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, independent administrator.
The Committee was meeting on the request of the Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
"A real danger would be that PZPN is not able to act in rules", Drzewiecki of the Polish Press Agency.
"We have assured the EUFA President that the preparations of the European Championship 2012 would not suffer it."
several members of the First Division's link have already been sentenced in the past season for compulsory relief manipulation; finally, the League's beginning was even dealt in the last minute.
Dennis Quaid unreasoned against attack
She wanted to promote a new movie, talked about his private life in an interview - and now she was enthusiasmed with her ex-hollywoodian Meg Ryan.
He runs - and counter-attacks.
A late war of Rose for the former Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid couple: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors go to a disgraceful battle - in view and south of the world.
Last week, Meg Ryan was expressed in an interview for the American newspaper InStyle about the causes of marriage failure: "Dennis has been my long-time unfaithful, and it was very painful."
She would have learned the extensiveness of the tromper only after the divorce.
The reason for this striptease of the thought resides in the press relationships of Ryan for his new film "The Women" - there is the story of a adultery.
Dennis Quaid's reaction on his infidel marin qualification clearly came: that would be "monstruous", said at "New York Daily News", 54 years old, that "Meg renews the history of our relationship and the handling."
It would be more "recretable" that "the punishment and the burdens that contain a divorce for each child will be renewed in public" for their children of 16-year-old Jack.
While Ryan lived alone since the divorce, Quaid was married and will soon become the jumeal father.
Thus his answer was: "In any case, my life continues.
I'm glad to have a wonderful family that's better."
The prices of flight tickets and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, hotel flights and nights were less cherished than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced to 50 per cent.
The flights and nights of hotel would be worthy - this is the result of a study of the financial service provider and traveller American Express.
The company analyzed its reservations in the first half of 2008 and established, after a price increase in the first quarter, a net decline of benefits in the second quarter.
After the hotel market prices increased for years, hotel nights have already been reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices increased in 41 of the 48 European cities that were still reviewed in a average 6,9 per cent compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities examined.
From April to June the prices were already 3.6 per cent lower than the previous year.
The trend was mainly cleaned in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay from 30 to 37 per cent less than one year ago.
The causes of all this would be for American Express in the low course of the dollar that led to a "booth of American tourists low."
Financial places such as Francfort or London would be more touched by the recule of hotel prices as industrial sites such as Hanovre, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices are increased by 26.3 per cent, the record in Europe.
Thus, in terms of flight price, tendency was increased in the first quarter:
As a result of the increase in the price of the Kerrosen, economic passengers pay averagely 7.1 per cent more than 2007, long-commerce flights, very fuel consumers, even increased to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June the prices of tickets in economic class fell in average 12,5 per cent in comparison with the previous quarter in case and first class, however, price variations were largely less pronounced.
In Germany, prices have seen an even more significant fall than in the other European countries:
From January to March, prices increased by 11,9 per cent, in the second quarter, lost 23.6 per cent.
The German internal flights have even been divided by two according to this study.
The reasons for this loss of prices would, on the other hand, be a frozen economic growth, explaining firmly.
The request would be the field in many segments of the aircraft market.
On the other hand, there would be an accentuated pressure on the competition of the Open Chile Treaty that liberalizes the air traffic between the United States and Europe.
The mark of the tendency is the removal of airlines from non-rewardable traffic companies, as well as the high number of airlines that would have put the balance during the first half of 2008 - 24 companies were nothing but in Europe.
HSV bat Gladbach 1:0
With a simple purpose and methods, the SV Hamburg is first of the classification.
In Borucea, Luhukay has not always succeeded in finding a one of the officials.
From Christffer Klein. Size. Catastrous shooting for international player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player will only be late in the game and his shooting shock failed against the goal.
His message was precisely formulated, and he was out of his lips in conviction.
He just knew he was right.
"We need this second goal," Syfla Hermann Rieger said in the coast of the Humbourg alien's clothes.
There was no big thing in the clothes, the half-time was finished and most of them were raised at their place.
Rieger has been the HSV Physiothérapeute for about three decades, playing a great reputation as well as former protagonists.
That's why his request was received at strategic places.
The assistant Cornelius Jol acquired and took the pocket to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of the head of Hamburg Martin Jol.
The orders seem to have been similar: and that's with this second goal!
The practice was missing.
"It wasn't very nice to see today," Marcel Jansen later said.
Bastian Reinhard would "souhacy would also be detained".
This 1:0 (1:0 at the mid-time), the Humbourg team must be shocked by the head successful by Mladen Petric (a 11th minute); and the fact that the very low Gladbach players couldn't hurt the low players of Hamburg.
"It was a winning salt," said Marin Jol.
Hamburg's SV will celebrate this Monday for 121 years.
On Saturday after midday, the supporters themselves celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the aren and the provisional classification tables on the age screen that identified their club as the first of the class.
It'll be a birthday without a real party.
"We know we're taking riculture," Marcell Jansen said.
It is doubtful that the intermediary result of the table reflects the unprevisible character of the first Liga than the domination of its HSV.
The team with his late arrivers - the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the Petric goal guard as Jansen discovered by the FC Bayern - is certainly sweet, but it does not still brilliant.
"We need more charm and more tribbles," said Jol.

Small material influences space sons flights
Since years, a mysterious phenomenon leaves researchers in the perplexity: the dark material influences the speed of space sounds while the manners of gravitational support are called.
Experts are afraid that the general theory of proportionality is not completely correct.
For almost 18 years, space audio "Ulysses" wants to be in space.
Because of smoking conducts soon heavy, Criogen diet threatens.
Since years, a mysterious phenomenon is caused to disagree among researchers - the anonymity of gravitational support.
The gravitational support is a manoeuvre of spatial sounds, by which they obtain an additional ring in the gravitational field of a heavenly body, for example the Earth.
So, sounds can economize a lot of fuel.
The American-European Research Son of Cassini-Huygens used this physical assumption, as well as the Ulysses Solar Sond.
This is the phenomenon of researchers for many years: flight objects are not always 100% of the way they are expected according to the convenient gravitation laws.
Furthermore, irregularities appear at the level of speed.
Sounds become unexpectedly faster or slower.
Until now, physicians could not explain this effect.
They baptized him the anonymity of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that the theory of Albert Einstein's general proportionality, which describes the attraction force of the matter of space curve, could not be completely correct.
The American Physician Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Study of Princeton always believed hard as the fer that Einstein did not fail and tries to explain the anonymity of gravitational support by what is called the black material that the astronoms have identified in the universe.
"The black material could be responsible for this anonymical, material that is also near the Earth," he wrote.
Space researchers know the existence of black material only for about 10 years.
It seems to be a attraction force with the effect is observable on other heavenly bodies.
On the contrary, it is completely invisible, i.e. it is not sent or reflects no electrical radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the scientists' calculations, black material would also represent a good fifth of the entire universe mass.
Tourists in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their ravisers, the Kidnapp tourists in Egypt should be released as well as the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Italy confirmed it.
The Sudan ravisers requested a ransom of several million euros.
During the shooting before the release, six slaughterers would have been killed.
In the south of Egypt, five Germans were taken.
The ransom negotiations would already be undertaken.
The Germans are in the kidnappers collimator.
WELT ONLINE depends on the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in Sahara are visiblely free.
This is what the Egyptian state television, the Arab TV chain Al-Arabija and the Italian media has been communicated.
The Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the Italian television chain of Sky TG 24: "We were freed by our civilians and others.
We are in control of their health status," reported Frattini.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanians, as well as their eight Egyptian councils are in safety, announced the Egyptian national television.
The 19 excursion participants in the desert should already be on the road to the Caire.
The circumstances around a shock before the release of the shooting remained fleet: so the kidnapers would have been close to put an end to an injury, according to the directions of an Egyptian security agent, before the Sudan army killed six kidnappers without crying war.
"The problem was resolved.
They were agreed with a ransom," the agent declared.
There was no longer to collect the otages," when it was suddenly, "This surprise" has been produced.
The Sudan soldiers slaughtered the Sunday six of the ravisers in the border zone between the Sudan, the Chaad and Egypt, and taken two of them.
The winners requested Germany a ransom of six million euros; the money should be transferred by the German woman from one of the detainees.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" stated that, according to a German mediator, the liberation of the slaughter was late because the kidnappers feared their security.
According to the article, the ravisers wanted to release women's weddings after the payment of the ransom.
The men had to be reserved until the ravisers had found a safe way to run.
The German Ambassador in Cairo refused to comment on this report.
Abus of a beau-pater who kills suicide."
A court was reported that a woman inflicted years of abuse by her beauty father has conducted a woman to suicide.
Michael Trerise, a 57-year-old stithians, in the Cornouailles, was incarcerated for six years after acknowledging eight chiefs of indecent facts.
The large court of Truro reported that he was regularly linked to his beautiful boyfriend, Stephanie Randle, during his childhood, from 5 to 7 years.
Trerise wrote in a condemnation letter: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court was reported that Melle Randle, aged 34, was suicided in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
A child when she lived in Coventry, Trerise was attached and banded to her before forced her sexual acts, while her mother was working in the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in the Cornouailles.
His beautiful boyfriend went to Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Mele Randle, voluntary Assistant of National Trust, was denied by abuses that had been inflicted him twice a week.
The Advocate-General Ramsey Quaife said to the court that friends had told Mele Randle, who was a good supervisory and cyclist, seemed to be "emotionally dead" since 2006, and "he lost all the hopes for life."
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her death in his apartment in Plymouth.
We think she was suicided with a plastic sack.
Mr. Randle faced the beautiful father of her daughter who had otherwise, posted a condemnation letter that ended so, "I'm the attack and the bandist regularly."
"I didn't abuse her sexually.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "You are really strange as a fetichist, your victim must certainly be terrified, especially at the age of 7 years.
"This displaced saga ended by the victim's suicide.
And what more surprised, it is the fact that if she did not, his history would certainly never end in the court."
He adds: "I particularly emphasize, such as describing his father and his mother, the effects of your crime come to Sthephanie for years.
"If those, she would certainly be a young happy, promised woman today, and successful."
Condemnation for the loss of official data.
The Ministerial Office of Cabinet, who forgot top secret documents, in June on a train, will be sentenced by the Official Secret Act, its BBC.
The man of the Ministry of Defence was moved when he forgot two high-classed documents on a Waterloo train.
The documents were carried out in the hands of the BBC before the police was delivered.
This is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any criminal intention.
The BBC corresponding Frank Gardner said that this episode had many Whitehall people.
"They would have thought that this case would remain between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Office of the Office," he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed is accused of violation of the Act Section 8.1, that is, of the clauses relating to the saving of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the Ministerial Officer should be placed under the whole of the Metropolitan police, given the very sensitive nature of his work linked to the Association of Secret Services
The documents that he had lost contained on Al-Qaeda and on security forces resources in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision, Monday morning and then was carried out from his home to a secret place.
Enterprises of the building face the B & B shop.
The British companys of the building could have to pay more than 80 million £ to cover the saving of the Bradford & Bingley bank.
The Government provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million Bradford & Bingleys.
The interests of this loan will be paid by all companies who collect the money of the funds, including 59 building companies.
The Director-General of Building Society Association (BSA), Adrian Coles said that it's "reasonable" to know that corporations and their members should pay the cassed cups...
The loan of £14 billion will be paid when the Bradford & Bingleys hypotheques will be denied.
But the interests that will increase at the same time will be debt, each year, to 700 financial companies that recover the deposits .
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed the BBC that the 59 building companies are included in this list.
It is unreasonable to see that institutions that have been carefully conducted... must now pay some of the factures of the institutions that were much less careful.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is announced that each company must pay a proportional amount to its deposits, and that intermediary companies must pay about 18 per cent of the costs.
The Director estimates that the interests of the loan will be increased in 2009, at £450 million.
This means that companies will have to find 81 million £ to resolve the interests of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Trade Committee of the Constructions, stated to the BBC that this decision seemed unjust.
It is "irritable" to see that institutions who have been carefully conducted in the reprise of the real estate market now have to pay for very less careful institutions.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, date of the first year.
"We have to consider all aspects of this case during the next weeks, to assess the options to take so that the building companies and their members pay this loan facture," said Mr Cole.
The interests for 2009 cover seven months from the end of September to the end of March.
In 2010, the interests of the whole year should be paid, which could also double.
Since the building companies are non-operative organizations, their members are finally finished by paying the facture or by higher charges, or by lower interest rates for expense accounts.
The milk increases up to five penny a litre
Jersey people have to pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy announced that she would increase the large price of her milk, of five pennies a litre from Monday.
This is the second increase of prices that results from a increase in two pennys in February, and following a research carried out by a consulting company.
Detail salers must decide if they go to their tour, increase consumer price.
. Before February increase, Jersey's large milk price has been the last variation in 2002.
A former Bangladesh Bangladesh saw refusing warning
A court in Bangladesh rejected a warranty application for the former Sheikh Hasina, which could so be arrested when he returned to the country.
His lawyers said that the court refused to condemn him for his consideration in order to have distorted a caseman, $729,000,00, when it was PM.
This case is one of the many accused to him.
Khaleda Zia, the strike of Sheikh Hasina, was relaxed before this month.
Sheikh Hasina should return to Bangladesh for a few weeks, but his party, League Awani, requested that the provisional military government of the country first give him his entire freedom.
The respondents stressed that the terms of his release are contradictory because if it is authorized to leave the country for medical reasons, they did not see why it could not remain free to return to Bangladesh.
His lawyers announced that she will now call the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request, saying that she did not need a warranty as she was allowed to go to the foreign country for medical reasons," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will call against the order of the Supreme Court."
His lawyers argued that it was necessary to return to the country to prepare elections in December.
Sheikh Hasina should return after October 17, said a former leader of the Awami Party.
She was arrested last year after the military interim government had taken the power, but was released in June to care for foreign.
Sheikh Hasina as Zhaleda Zia, nor the accusions they do.
Interesting for the Afghan campaign.
In Afghan, nearly 200,000 children missed the recent Polio Immunization campaign, because of the violence related to Taliban, stated the United Nations.
The United Nations held last week, a vaccination campaign in the six provinces.
But she claims not to be successful to contact the children of the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, located in the south.
One door of the United Nations said that it had been done despite the promises of the Talibans not attacking or obstructing the thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB lost the ITV judiciary battle
BSkyB lost his proceedings following the green of the Committee on Competition, which would force it to reduce its participation in its rival ITV transmittor.
The Court of Competition ordered BSkyB to reduce its ITV parts from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission stated that in the past, MSkyB's participation had prevented competition and allowed it to influence ITV injustice.
BSkyB purchased its parts in 2006 after an agreement to actually prevent NTL, now called Virgin Media, purchase ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Office reported that the purchase by BSkyB, parts of ITV, was questioned of the effective independence of ITV, and therefore encouraged the Commission of Competition to investigate
Virgin's patron, Richard Branson, a group of consumers and the Ofcom regulator were all opposed to this purchase.
BSkyB argued that it would not be reasonable to decrease its ITV parts and, on the other hand, was excessive – especially because BSkyB has denied its vote rights.
New investigation in the case of American Prosecutors.
The U.S. Advocate named a special appeal to check the issue of the license of nine American advocates in 2006.
Everything was born from the account of the case of the Inspector-General of the Department of Justice, which criticized the actions of certain minister officers.
The report was critical to the officers of the White House, legislators and the former General Prosecutor Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers who support their license is from political causes.
The Special Prosecutor, Nora Yanehy, will now investigate whether the officers asked during the investigation were lied to the investigators, obstructing the justice so.
"A grave accusations of potentially non-based criminal conduct have not been completely confirmed or resolved," said the General Inspector, Glenn Fine, in his report.
The appointment of a special accuser to force witnesses to be put, was one of its largest recommendations.
The controversy begins by radiation in December 2006 of nine American advisors made by the Department of Justice of the United States.
At the time, the department had stated that lawyers were licensed for medium-sized benefits.
But then it was remarkable that the licensed contractors were not more criticized than their other colleagues, which encouraged some observers to attribute a political connotation to these licenses.
Some advocates were accused of being close to the Republics of the Congress, while others had refused to investigate fraudulent votes against the Democratics.
American prosecutors investigate and continue the judiciary for the government.
It is sure that they can be licensed at any time, but they may not be for political reasons.
The Chief of the Department of Justice, Prosecutor General Alberto Gonzales, has finally been accused of being involved in this case of licensing, and at the end he dismissed.
A number of ministerial officers of the Department of Justice have also given their departure.
The report of the General Inspector was very critical towards the role of Mr. Gonzales in this case, declaring that he would consider the "first responsibility" of these licenses, and ended by "abdiving" his role of leader," noting that he was not involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including the old collaborator of Bush, Karl Rove, were critical to have not been able to cooperate during the investigation.
The epoch of Meat Loaf must be honored.
The Rock star Meat Loaf, must be honored at Q Awards for his epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The songer, who will receive a oscar at the ceremony in London next week, declared being "honor" to obtain this recognition.
The song of nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the shooting album of Meat Loaf in 1977.
The weekend of price delivery is presented by Coldplay, with this year, a limited selection of four categories.
Paul Rees, a editor of Q magazine, said: "There are songs that transcenden things like time and kind, and Bat Out Of Hell certainly part.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a great voice like Meat Loaf.
It starts with a instrumental section which takes almost two minutes.
The song was traded in the United Kingdom, as one in 1979, classified at the fifth place.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell remained nine years in English classs, and was sold to more than 40 million examples throughout the world.
Meat Loaf- or Marvin Lee Aday, of his real name, suffered health problems in the past few years, even with an operation to handle his heart batch became irregular, after being shocked on the scene, in 2003.

A Dark Street in the villa, Suvent forgot, and Remote Soon in the winter.
New York has hundreds of adventures, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, other only functional.
. And even some veterinary taxi as well as long-term local residents do not have to give instructions towards Extra Place, because they have never heard it.
The street is located in the East Village and crosss the north of First Street, and is not confronted with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet long for 120 degrees, it looks like a powdered ring instead of an active artery.
. No panels indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
However, this street has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the constructor of recent luxury buildings on the First Street.
He would like to repay Extra Place, and to create a more fluid passage to shops and shops, which should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers, including long-term neighbors, have been declared charmed by this short-term shooting simply because there is one of the latest and older streets of the household.
But the Department of Preservation and Development Immobilier of the city that manages the street has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of neighbouring owner committees, representatives of the Avalon Bay and the Avalon Bay have developed a proposal authorized by the manufacturer to buy the street.
But the Committee prefers that the street remains in the hands of the city, and asked a new proposal to submit the next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of the Committee No. 3.
"There are only few spaces belonging to the city, and we would like the city to preserve Extra Place," she said.
"If they could propose to give it to state and manage it, what Avalon could otherwise do, but we want to keep it public."
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that she wanted to repair the small street and install it with seats, some would be used by a coffee where the constructioner will consume space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public to the meeting of this month.
Michele de Milly, the door of Avalon Bay's word, said that although the company wants to operate the street, it does not want to be the owner.
"The main interest of Avalon Bay is to relocate this abandoned ship, and to make it public" she stated, emphasized that this was the city to suggest to him the sale."
Seth Donlin, a door of the Reservation of Immobilier, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street, further stressing that the Agency's mission was to develop the property rather than to manage it.
Compared to his colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a slight historic press.
Some believe that Extra Place takes this name since 1802, when the heritage of the great firm of the many children of Philip Minthorne was divided, letting this small leg of land, which remains since abandoned.
The later entry of the CBGB, a rock rock monument closed in 2006, reopened in Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the photo of the Ramones' album cover" Rocket to Russia"
"This place was wonderful," said Danny Fields, manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
She was filled with velries, hailons, barriers, posters, shelves and cordes."
Some residents, including bloggers who had already spoken about evolution to East Village, opposed to sell Extra Place, saying that this humble small property should remain public.
Others have declared extra Place as a real rare - a virtually identical fragment to the city that should be disfellowshipped in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who conducts a blog named Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (the book of Contents: A Review Amendment Nostalgic on A Villa in the Extinction Procedure), reports the history of the Ville and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a straight-de-saac small, dark day as a night, and delimited by the doors of a roofed helmet and persians, full of newspapers in the past week, rounding the shoeting."
A few exceptions near, the street has always the same wide range.
A short short rat on the bottom of the rule, near a door that slaughtered at the CBGB, which now has become the seat of a chic clothes store.
Graphites on the walls, a bleeding bottle of 22 eyes, is at the coast of newspapers that just come to be cast.
Some passengers said it was rare to think about extra Place, and suggested that it was valued.
Mr. Field said that some estimated the attraction of the street in its current state.
"The best years of my life" he said, "we have been launched in dark, humid and degrading places."
The bilateral debate: Immersion in English
In this part of the Education Supervisory Programme, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discussed the position of candidates on bilateral education.

Mr. Obama's campaign stressed that "Afro-American and Latin students have less chance to divorce than white students."
In order to combat these differences, Mr. Obama's educational programme, in particular, supports both other subjects, " bilateral cross-border education" for those learning English.
However, the question for Obama is whether his desire to achieve a bilateral education that defends the education in other languages other than English is also interested in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sexth Street Prep, a primary school of the Eastern Los Angeles account.
Students of this school are largely Spanish, and low income.
More than a third of the students, consisting of many new arrives, studied English.
Between the CM1 students, 100% have been reviewed by the 2008 Math State, an expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students have conducted the review of English and languages-d arts
This unbelievable success was achieved by another ingredient than the progressed by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street on analysis, practice, a constant capacity assessment and an exemplary attitude.
Furthermore, and this is an example that Mr. Obama could cope, report Linda Mikels, the main school of the Sixth Street, established the English language instruction " full support".
The total emerging in English focuses on the almost constant use of English in the instruction.
Small Mikels, instead of bilateral education, stated me "We had a great success with a student who came to arrive from Mexico, 12 months later, if you go without its class, you would have had no chance to identify it."
"It's going, watch, that's the market for us."
Mr. Obama should not take example of the Sixth Street Prep and explain it in other schools composed of Spanish students who learned English.
The excellent results obtained by this school speak of themselves, but education policy within its party (the National Education Associations has been supporting bilateral education for a long time) and its great support for bilateral education, the prognosis of Mr Obama's response.
Although immigrants are favorable to learn the English, Mr. Obama recently considered this question as an insignifiant, when it announces that we all have to stop switching on the library of English laws.
"On the other hand, he said, "You must ensure that your child speaks Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, it should then take into consideration the educational models that operate, instead of defeating them or considering them unlikely.
Petrole Netto Success to News Economy World worries
Oil prices slowly lost Monday, since people fear that the relief plan for financial steps is not able to rebuild the economy.

The Second Times Festival for the Improvement of the Team Record.
After passing at these last eight seasons, more than anyone in uniform of the Jets Shaun Elis, the defender thought that he had seen everything.
He looked at the second time when the Jets transformed a 0 to 0 to an explosion.
"I have never seen anything like this," said Ellis.
The second time began after the Jets and the Cardinal Arizona played in dark clouds.
Then the quarter back Brett Favre succeeded to make a pass in Laveranues Coles with a touchdown of 12 meters, signs a precursive sign after midday when their relationship made a bond in front.
Favre found Coles for more two touchdowns, the first when a back corner was dropped and the second, 10 seconds of the mid-time.
"I'm not out of my area" Favre declared about all his passes in Cole.
"It's a medium player."
"We communicate very well, despite what people think."
While Favre and Coles played at the catch, the defense shocked the backquarter of the Cardinals, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, round back, intercepted a lost torch and led 32 meters up to touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens let him escape the ball because of Warner.
Last change, the loss of the Bowens ballon, may be the most charming event
Cardinals took control of this possession during the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ballon, Jay Feely made a goal of 20 meters from 34 to 0.
It was the best thing that the Jets could march in a time.
"The Coach of Jets, Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this fool, said "the second time or third?"
When the Jets were told to him, the Jets left 21 unconscious points in the third time - Mangini said, "I can tell you that I appreciated the second time than the third.
." Many points were marked in a few times."
Burselasia reposed, exceeding its global record.
Haile Burselasso, Ethiopia, again proved to be grateful of his title of a best courier of the background of the century, after having struck his own world's record at the marathon of Berlin Sunday, thus became the first to fly 26.2 thousand in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory in 2 :03 :59 of an accommodating course on the floor, Burselassie struggled with 27 seconds his record of 2 :04 :26, discussed last year in Berlin.
35 years old, Burselassie reported the 26th world record of his supercarriage in which he returned the world's championship or the world record for any distance, 1600 metres from the marathon.
Last month, Burselassie had missed the Olympic Marathon of Beijing, fearing, could be exacerbated in today's eyes, - that air pollution does not increase its asthm problems.
On the contrary, he promises to run to Berlin.
In perfect-time conditions, 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the arrival-Burserlasia wind Sunday, now a surprising average of a thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds
The piste courses such as Bergerlasia and Paul Tergat, both Kenians, converted into background courses, contributed to the reduction of the marathon record over two minutes in these last decades, since 1998, when the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa winn in Berlin at 2:06:05 .
After the Sunday's winner, Burrselassie declared the reporters, suffering cramps in the mollet two weeks ago, and missing training for a week.
It is obviously clear that the rest has allowed him to stay brilliant, but not stealed.
"I am so happy," he said to the reporters.
"It was perfect.
I've been sent there last week, and today, I had doubts; but at the end, everything went for the best."
In particular in Kenya, the Rival is African of Ethiopia to have too orchestered his courses, avoiding the world stars of marathon, contain in fact on the libraries as if they were in a piste competition, and considering more global records than the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not reduce the dimension of the Burselasian capacity as a fund currency.
Sunday, before four Kenyans, was registered at 1:02:04 at my way.
Two Kenyan electors, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to develop Judases after the file heads disappeared.
At a few more than three thousands of arrival, Bursellas did his final assembly to depart from Kwambai, which ends at 2:05:36, improved its best personal record of five minutes.
Kamathis arrived third in 2:07:48.
In the women's course, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now German citizens, has completed a marvelous year, obtaining the seventh time of 2:19:19.
The English Paula Radcliffe has the global record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, aged 36, surprised everyone who returned to London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She couldn't participate in the Beijing games because of a bad hypothetic, but promised to win in Berlin, improved its third marathon, its personal record of almost five minutes.
It runs for a pleasant strategy, letting the Ethiopians and Kenyans to take a nice advantage, then exceeding about 18 miles after.
Ethiopia's Tafa Margasa second arrives in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenya, ended third in 2:25:01.
In a Ville to part, the Orguil and the tests of the Black Wine
Hidden in the development of his large park, a few thousands of the island, the brilliant and the genital Orlando, there is a quiet town where they are born pride and complications of African experience.
"Eatonville, the first fully black city to integrate, the childhood of Zora Neale Hurston, this description she made in 1935, is no longer easy to do today." The city is at five lakes, three short clouds, 300 skins, 300 good skins, full of shoes, two schools and no prison."
It has now become a city of pelerage
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the Festival Zora, which is holding each year in Eatonville, to honour in Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in several ways, the city that she described has become tourists thanks to its integration in the Tourist Guide of Florida edited by The Depression, Federal Writers' Project, remains a place partly.
She's also independent, dignity and private that she wasn't already in the 30s, when Hurston said that the black rural population of Florida was often reiterate to share his real thoughts with the white man, which "we know so little, don't know what he lost".
Even if this is the year of the election of a black President, Senator Barack Obama, who also called an open dialogue on the subject of the race, many here remain aware of the view of the foreign.
"We are very prudent about how to tell the story," said Hortense Jones, 59 years old, resident forever and the oldest Parisian city.
"It must be in compliance with the reality.
Eatonville has been long defined as a paradox of the triomphe and battle.
It represents both a historical model of black power and a community of almost 2400 people where poverty is two times the national average.
This is a central but also an example of Southern black rural culture, a few times described, often acknowledged, which reminds the birth of the American slavery.
What would explain why the residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented her natal city to the whole world through sincere books, full of dialects, such as "Mils and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the guide of Florida transformed this city, located just at the exit of Route 17, a road that crossed the centre of Florida, often forgotten, which came in the chapter of the black history and human dragon.
Adjudicious such a great cast in life as in literature, Hurston conducted readers to the ownership shop of the first master of Eatonville, Mr. Joe Clarke, who then was divided into several private parties.
"Pasted the way on the left," she wrote, "You will find the modern public school with its gardens and those well-conserved games whose Howard Miller has always been careful, even though he can read and write.
She also mentioned the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn sold drinks of any kind as well as everything that can serve passenger people.
So, unlike a hundred words, Hurston associates Eatonville to a government car, but also to analysis, racing and sex.
Of course, Fodor wasn't so.
It wasn't actually a portrait that everyone appreciated.
Zora well described the reality "Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, said one of Johnson's young girls that Hurston was immortalized, quoting colorless songs, interpreted by men who loving their beauty."
She added: "A certain people have not appreciated."
We always remember Hurston as a living and extreme person, which would often return after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77 years old, recalled that Hurston arrived in a town without warning, on the board of a large Chevrolet, a cigarette to the mouth and brings pantalons here, where even today, we are proud of traditional habits.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin told, while many were motivated by her.
"The people were always happy to see Zora," he said.
But he also adds, spending in his chair of the post-seventh pathio that gives on the Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that " she never remained too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and his books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten it.
Although she became a star of literature, a contemporaine of Langston Hughes and the only black woman of the Barnard College of the 20s, she was entered in a tomb in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she sees.
In Eatonville, no big memory, no plate for the great public.
I don't think they included the contribution or heritage offered to the world " said Valérie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a Hurston's biography published in 2003.
There is a crucial moment in the 1980s.
Public officials from the County wanted to go to five ways in town to replace the Boulevard Kennedy, the main road to two ways of the community.
Olando's development has already posted Interstate 4 to the western angle of the city.
The proposal was made while Eatonville was just a difficult period of his history.
Forced integration, among both other things, has finished the relatively identical isolation of the community.
In the 50s, conflict on the mixing of races conducted hate at the gates of the community.
"To this time, a band of young white people came to launch persons or objects against people sit on the cottage," said Mr. Franklin.
"A woman is even deceased."
They launched a passhake of their car."
In a letter from 1955 addressed to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the request of the Supreme Court for forced integration, defined its decision in Brown v. Board of Education, instead of glory of my race."
Residents now declare that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some aspects, has disappeared the cohesion of Eatonville and defeated youths.
"The black children were the habit of being shocked - I remembered it well, our master was slaughtered the morning, and the evening also," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, as well as director of the Safety Community of Eatonville, a group not benefited.
This has been long, added, until the time when teachers and students weren't coming from the same place.
"You don't miss your white professor because it's white - I mean there's a cultural demarcation line," Mele Nathiri said.
Citizen rights also allowed to create space for other Neale Hurston- black writers, actors and artists who went beyond the damage, such as it, army of a joyful confidence and conduct lines such as: " how can they be free of my company's joy!"
That's over me."
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker returned to the Hurston's anonymous Tomb, and began fighting to re-examinate her reputation.
Five years later, an accumulated biograph on Hurston performed by Robert E. Hemenway, a real best seller, re-introduced as well as the American Canons.
The autoroute project just arrived at the moment when the most famous girl of Eatonville had found her attraction.
And this time, the old neighbors of Hurston considered it a salvation.
The community began to organize a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences that would generate this audience.
Hundreds of fans came to the unuguration of the festival two years later, and many come back in January, to remember it.
After many years, the container resumed the proposal for the road.
"The fascination of the five-way car route, extremely fast, a true citizen pride," Melle stated. Nathiri.
Mele Boyd summarised all the declared that "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the autoroute project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who was commonly our church since 1993, began to come in a large number, and the residents began to reconside the past.
Eatonville is classified in historical city since 1998.
A mono theme library (evidently called Hurston) opens in 2006, on a beautiful Kennedy Boulevard, repaved.
Today, Eatonville remains a anonymy for Florida: at six thousand Olando's, she can at any time be considered as a post-term rear back during a stival rain day, small as she was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Actually 90 per cent of blacks)
Foreigners who have come to discover the story of Eatonville, his reason for being, are still treated with care.
The permission for most interviews must be requested, and some things - such as the walls of the old church of Eatonville, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mele Jones, a courageous teacher, who has a weak for life red, have always feared that their island community is not well understood.
However, see the expansion of the Hurston Festival, a certain level of local pride is experiencing.
The young people, in particular, tend to consider Eatonville as Hurston would consider its entire race: beautiful, difficult and all, no better or worse, but also proud, creative, boseous, fool and mixed than the other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is good for sincere citizen affection that we hear in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nest, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who expects to return to Eatonville after the colleague to work for the local government or the police forces, who need additional forces.
And even for the youngests, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon of 11-year-old Winter Park, they seem to have learned the correct description of Eatonville.
"The majority of the people that pass in this area will think, "hh, this city has nothing compared with other people," Alondra Kenon said after the last Sunday messenger.
But if you stop and take the time to contempt the story, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, everybody talks about funding.
Nevertheless, nothing changed.
If tourists in Manhattan had been away from the kiosque and genital TV screens in Times Square, they would not realize that they are in the eyes of the cyclone.
They could never think that in the offices to see and beat over their tea, bankers and cover fund managers that monopolis New York, pass the worst working day in the office since 1929.
The bookers continue to swim on the throats, with their chariots and muffins plates for morning meetings.
The Latins are always among the residential buildings, such as mulls, a hundred luxurious chemises covered to a game available on their floors.
The office employees continue to make the chair to purchase their morning sandwich to ambulance goods, and it is always impossible to find a taxi between 16:00 and 19:00 a week.
I did not feel the crisis, despite the completely pessimised records until the midday after I decided to go to open a new outstanding account.
I was glad I was planned to work at the end of the afternoon, because I was discovered at my local JP Morgan Chase branch, a twenty-five of people doing the chase.
Not in front of the shopping shops, nor to remove the species or pay a payment, but in front of the customer's service guichet, where ordinary customers commanded their guests, tourists requested the Macy shop, and new customers opened accounts.
The majority of those before me, I would learn later from Starr, my "permissional personal banker", make all the cheese for the same reason I was.
Not in the same way, because they had already removed their economies from smaller banks, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They removed their money from the named trifts (e.g. a company of the building), credit associations, and the type of local sparage boxes and their subsidiaries who work only in a state, and who say to treat customers like their family.
In a recent past, 15 of these banks failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank at the capital of $327, refunded to the failite syndicate, and the New Yorkians returned to the home for the weekend this weekend, another bank, Wachovia, to the expensive accounts of $440 million, was desperately looking for a buyer for saving it.
The office and shops employees who are before me, disappointed from another debacle potential, transferred their money to a bank that seems to be reliable, or the one who makes the most savings to Wall Street.
New Yorkians have become very families in the financing world in the last few weeks.
"I heard a lady to my Chinese local supermarket, talking to Lehman Brothers' phone, the bank that made fail, and of her Major General Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity as she could have to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the uniform concierge of my building, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or delivery of my fruit and vegetables.
She told me, following my visit to the bank. "I put all my economies on the market of monetary funds.
"I changed, I don't want to get risks."
Muslim Tombes profaned while Austria shocks to the right.
Heinz-Cristian Strache, who abandoned the right side of the Austrian Freedom Party and, Philip Dewinter of the Belgian right Vlaams Belang, took part in a manifestation to submit the organization of "which cities against Islamization" in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008.
They have road panels illustrating red mosquees.
The police condemns the extreme right of having pronounced an Austrian Islamic Cimetry, the weekend of the victory of extreme rights political parties to the general elections of the country.
More than 90 tumbles were seriously damaged in the Traun cemetery, near Linz, between Friday and morning night, and it is according to the police, an organised action.
The crimers slaughtered on several tombs, Jewish symbols such as David's Star; the detectors believe that this would be done to deceive the feeling of hate of extremists to the Islamic immigrants.
This accident may be in any way linked to elections.
A word door of the Islamic local community declared being "deeply shocked" at the advertising of this propanion, which is just during the religious month of Ramadan that touchs its end.
Austria seriously thinks of finding her courage, following its strike towards the right in the parliamentary elections of last year.
The two extreme right partys, which were almost 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, conducted an anti-immigration campaign. Some of their slogans were even considered, according to the critics, as xenophobes.
Heinz-Cristian Strache, the Chief of Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the votes, held his campaign against the port of folked and burkas, and even expressed its opposition against the alaha food.
During his final course in Vienna, he spoke of "a European brotherhood" to avoid the assembly of Islam.
The two parties are trying to prevent the construction of mosquees and miners, proclaiming that they would be a political symbol of Austria and Europe's Islamicization.
The reviews and analysis carried out just after the elections have defined the extreme right as the strongest political block in the country, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who did the difference because the concerns of their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter forbids traveling to the foreign.
The courts prohibited the rock star, Gary Glitter, accused of sexual abuse on children, expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed to Glitter a bannment of six months after he expressed to the authorities controlled it, his intention to become in Spain passed through France.
The police in Kent had condemned the prohibition of traveling on Thursday last after testing Glitter's guilty for sexual abuse on children.
Glitter, or from his true name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the hearing of Ashford's limited court courts, but was also represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
The police of Kent requested an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd to travel to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd wasn't now.
Glitter, 64 years, informed the authorities he wanted to go to the foreign to be registered in the lists of sexual abuse accused.
It must notify the authorities if he wants to go to the foreign for more than three days.
He must also inform the police, seven days before his planned start date.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he could purify a punishment up to five years of reconciliation.
Kent's police said that it would not discuss specific cases or potential movements to Glitter in the container.
A door of Kent's police said, "Kent's police will do everything necessary to protect our children as foreign.
"It is easier to monitor someone remaining in the United Kingdom because we have devices to manage any potential risks in a much more effective manner.
"Protection of Kent's people is the most charming intent to the Kent police, and we closely monitor the behaviour of those who are accused of sexual abuse in the region to minimise the potential risks for the public."
. Glitter was returned to the United Kingdom last month after 27 months was cleaned in a Vietnamian prison for abusing two girls of 10 and 11 years of age.
When he was released, Glitter took the aircraft to Bangkok from where he was going to ship for a flight to London.
But he won't feel good, and refused to go to London.
Thai authorities blocked the pass control, and finally he went to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities rejected the entry into their territory, and therefore were obliged to go to Bangkok; Thailand police and immigration officers insisted that it returns to England.
It was finally arrived in the Heathrow airport 3 Terminal on 22 August, and it remained during his lawyer, David Corker, was at the limited court of Uxbridge, West London, for registration in the list of persons accused of sexual abuse, such as the former Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already been cleaned a four-month punishment in the United Kingdom for the detention of abuse images on child.
A source of the Interior Ministry stated that Jacques Smith, the Minister of Interior, was safe and happy to know that Glitter was prohibited for movements in France and Spain.
"I photo the master outside the scene to capture elements of his character" Sonther Bauer - Photograph
We don't have a strike, no eternal clothes.
The essence of the great masters of the flamenco, released from all tensions to obtain the aspect of the man or woman's detained aspect.
On the one side, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Unreasonable except in the intimity, in those unknown moments of the great public, where there are discovered intime gests and shooted views of artists who do not worry to get on the scene.
Dumand Duther Bauer is mixed in "Flamenco - people" the theatricality of some scenes with songers, dancers and guitarists with this less known side of artists.
In this project, the photo reflects the special iconography of the flamenco under different angles.
In addition to the Moon of Photography, the exposure "reflexes the international importance of the flamenco, the largest of each day", explains the Creator, which explains that "Flamenco - people" "to be any one but after having seen the photos, the observer is not typical images of artists on the scene.
These people photod "in the street" are artists capable of transmitting on the scene of passion, tristeness, joy... by captivating the public.
To capture the moments of personality of these artists, you don't need to do photos on the scene.
They have a personality and a own character.
What I was interested was to create an intime atmosphere that allows me to capture with the photo of the moments of personality of the flamenco stars."
With the "Chant Popular des Mines" Festival, Bauer started a long trip in 1997 to photograph the songs, guitarists or dancers with a plate photo.
These are portraits that, by choosing the photo and material, remember classic photography.
The implementation of various stylist means breaks with the classic side of the image, giving him a touch of modernity, reflects the perception of the flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day."
It is not the dance or song in itself, but the personality and character of the artist who captures the public with his art.
The research of the essential and magic was the continuing work that is presented at the El Fotomata gallery in these days.
The flamenco views such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Aigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about seventy-dix artists.
The project was transformed into anhymology of the flamenco, which will soon be published in a collection book of the portraits exposed to the gallery.
The passion for Bauer's portraits led it to repeat the idea two years ago with the "SportART Project" (SportART Project).
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he likes photographing the portrait of people, knowing and able to enter into their life for a moment or less long.
I think in photography the portrait is the most difficult thing.
You find yourself faced by people, personalities that you sometimes don't know or who leaves you just a few minutes to make them a photo.
Despite these circumstances, as a photo, I always try my ideas to become real ".
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco named "Flamenco - people" is exposed to the Galerie El Fotomata, located on the 20th of the Mata Street (parallelele to the Peupleraie de Hercule), which will be open until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa acknowledges that the Roman he wrote is "which lad"
Romans are launched in places that no one knows and treats unknown subjects, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa has decided to advance the new project on which he works, a Roman who has for the main personality Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and who had passed through Amazon.
The favorite to the Nobel Literature Prize condemned last night at the Hay Segovia Festival, that the Roman who is currently engaged in it is "that is a real audea" and "too shows that he should not write it".
"If I was reasonable, I wouldn't do it, but I'm going to do it and I hope to finish it ", he concluded in his intervention at the festival of exchange of ideas and thoughts that for four days had seen disappointing in the city of the shopping a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The city and the dogs" was the most expected personality of the third edition of this festival and filled its contract.
Vargas Llosa, who returned the Ha Festival price to the majority of the participants, made a room similar to the theatre Juan Bravo.
The presenter of the Festival, Felix Romeo, faced a fascinated public who had not seen the past time in which the Peruvine, with a prodigious memory and with a great dose of humor, has turned up the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "the soif of reading" and "the life of new experiences"; how he wrote of a "the very methodical man" through a intense documentation work, correcting and writeing a part of the text to face his "man of inspiration"; comment Faulkner, Victor and Alex Dundrea have influenced his vocation and his inspiration.
The Spanish American Romanist acknowledged that "no means" is to measure and to know if books change life. "I refuse to believe that literature is a pure experience, a ephemer experience," stated Vargas Llosa, who said that it was "a effects" and "return the people less likely," as the writers were asked "Don't let go to the frivolity" and to take their vocation.
The bad time smells the fire of Pozoblanco
The feast of the bandlers that concluded the ball courses of the fire of Pozoblanco was suspended last morning after the horse towers checked that the ale was unraticable.
In this way, the organization committee, in accordance with Ferdin Bohórquez, Paul Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the workshop.

Alejandro Talavante also concluded on two bands planted on the dough of the wheel and a cut ear than the grain found applauded more than his battle in itself with the torch.
Better for El Juli, which is entered in the Arens of Los Llanos without punishment and glory.
When his battle with the second struggle, after a clearly better battle, he was shocked by the majority of the public.

The incident occurred when different officials of the Alva Traffic Unit carried out a control of vehicles on N-1 at the border of the Armenian Common.
They learned to stop an inspector when the driver was injured to orders, slowly accelerated, and the control began.
The police began to continue until the vehicle stopped two kilometers away from the low coast, where the two occupants went down to run in a boss area.
Bask police finally stopped one of the two occupants and took the hachish 2.178 kilograms that they carried and found after inspecting the quarter, a Iveco Daily.
The next part of the vehicle was loaded by hachish balls, and then they carried out to a police post for exhaustive inspection and to weak drugs.
In addition, officials found that the recording plate was "falsified" because it was not coherent to the written written on the grid card of the frogonnette, so that they also imposed the detention of a false crime of documentation.
Herrtzaintza continues his investigation to stop the other suspect, which has succeeded to run and to determine the origin of the drought.
The detention, A.A. J., of 28 years of age, was guarded in order to achieve the different ways and will be judged within the following hours.
Actor Heather Locklear arrested for having conducted the effect of a medicine
Actor Heather Locklear, famous Amanda of the Melrose Place TV series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) to have led to the effect of a medicine.
One witness saw him doing strange works trying to get out of his garage in Montecito, as a talking door from the police patrol in California reported to the People's magazine.
The witness explained that at 16.30 p.m. Locklear "it was funded on the accelator, making a lot of sound, trying to get out of the garage car, and walking back several times, she rolled on his sunlights."
Shortly later, the witness, who first did not recognize the actor, saw that Locklear was stopped in the middle of the road and out of his car.
This person, at this time, called the emergency services because " she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actor sit inside his vehicle, which was partly blocked the road.
"He had a disastrous look," so the agents led him to the specialized center in drugs and alcohol to carry out a test.
According to a police door, the actor has shown cooperation and the alcohol abuse has been deleted since the beginning, although "as the observance of the police officers at first, we think that Locklear was under the influence of a medicine."
Locklear was arrested to have conducted under the effect of a substance which has not been specified and was incarcerated at 19.00 p.m. and left a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was out of Arizona's clinic where she was inside to care for nervous depression.
Callingers requested the Union’s left Union to take its responsibilities in the case of Silva
The General Coordinator and Deputy Left of the Union, Gaspar Llamazares, stated today that this is the regional federation to take a decision on the case of the former Youth Adviser and Sports of the Municipality of Seville, France Manuel Silva, who has been denied last week after being accused of the treatments for the members of his family.
"In these cases, I am very federalist, and this will be the visa organization that must take his responsibility," said Llamazares, as regards the behaviour of the political party that he must adopt within the municipal Council of Seville.
However, the Union's Left Left requested that the investigations show "transparency" for the irregularities that Silva could commit: "The left Union has always defended this kind of business in order to have a maximum degree of transparency".
He also stressed that the political party had “the very strict ethical codes for all officials”.
"Peace of Mayo", the couple of Garci
In inspiring Benito Pérez Galdoos's reports, José Luis Garci re-established the famous Battle of Spain against the French in "Sangre de Mayo", which is the most ambitious film of his film with nearly 15 million euros of budget.
The cinema tried to "scann the many personalities and illustrate the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous Romancizer, explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevar would head the long list of actors.
The film of more than two hours and half of Mayo will come out in the cinema rooms next Friday, which will then become a television series for Telemadrid over four hours.
The great admirant of the literature of Galdoos, José Luis Garci assured that he had done with this "und a child dream" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who has taken it three years ago, to turn a memorial film for the two hundred years of Madrileen's 2 May, which he always accepted when the record was holding on national historic facts.
The 15 million euros provided by the Community of Madrid are for Garci a "single opportunity" to reproduce with suitable decorations and clothes the environment of "A Spain who is inflicted by the leader for the fight, because the fight for independence led the people to rebellion under the reign of Ferdinand VII," he reported.
But the cinema regrets not having received funding as for films "Capitry Alatriste" or "Goya's Fans" - more than the double of that obtained for "Sangre de Mayo" - because he couldn't turn some scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcarcel, with whom he has cooperated for almost all his carriage.
The cinealist of "Rever has started" influenced his usual way to work, on the development of the actors, with whom he used to repeat before starting the turning and to whom he does not casting, since it seems to be "humily" and believes that "the role of the cineaste is to go to the theatre and the cinema to keep it informed".
Many actors in "Sangre de Mayo" repeated before the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillan Cuervo.
Four times a candidate in the Oscar (he won one), Garci believes that the three candidate films representing Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy, "Sangre de Mayo", "Seven French billard tables" and finally the winner," the Aveugles Turns aren't representatives of the young Spanish cinema, "who would be better known," he stated.
With this film Garci does not wait for a price.
"After you think you're working for posterity, then you realize that you're working just for prosperity, and now you're happy to make a film more", explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayon is located in the skin of the sevilla dance Tortola Valencia
A sevillan dancing will make a sevillan dance too.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, daughter of a catalan father (Florenc Tórtola Ferer) and a vibrant mother (Georgina Valenzuela), was born in the triangle area of Triana, who lives in London with his family in three years.
It was a free and specialist dancer dancer.
She was a passioning life, a pioneer of the freezing of the woman, such as Isaac Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was buddhist, vegetarian and pleasant for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked the dance history in Europe of the two-governed warfare has fascinated Isabelle Bayon.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and this last proposed me to interpretate the sevilla dancer Turtola Valencia, and this has stopped incredible."
According to the dance, "We do not try to tell his life but to translate his way to think.
His dance titles made me think of the flamenco.
So, "the papillon dance" made me think of a Cuban popular dance and "the serpent dance" to some tanks.
His dance was sensitive and they told me that my way to dance was identical to the snake ", said she.
The scene was made by two remarkable contributions: the Miguel Poveda who sing again Isabela in one of his spectacles, as he had done "Open the door"; and the professor Matilde Coral, who was exceptionally wanting to cooperate with the one who was his student.
"Matilde transforms Tortola into a mature personality.
I am happy because she accepted playing a role in my work and that's honor to me. "
The scene was also done through the musical composition and guiders of Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, Puga and Moi de Morón; the persecution of El Pájaro, and the violence of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of a actor, Juanfra Juárez, "when plays the role of the eternal companion of such artists that were considered as divines."
This work also tells, in a certain way, the life of this woman that has been shown in so far far away, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, but also in all Europe, as she was normally in London.
"I wanted to remind you because I think that these women who have a great influence in their time and now nobody knows and don't value their work," says Bayon.
The spectacle will start at 20:30 at Vega Lope Theater
The publication of a recently married poet's "Journal" concludes the Triennat
The presentation of the first edition of the "Journal of a recently married Poet" in the Church of Saint Stephen's in New York, where John Ramón Jimenez married Zenobia in March 1916, was registered in the framework of the activities provided by the Ministry of the Cultural of Andal to celebrate the "Triannat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized in order to remember the fifth anniversary of the Concept of the Nobel Literature Prize and their Decades.
Thus, "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" arrived at its end with the redistribution of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum, and with the launched exhibition "Joan Ramón Jiménez: This little light" which was inaugurated in May last month and which, after visiting in the various Indonesian provinces, will go to New York at the International Congress.
Similarly, the Ministry of the Cultural of Andandalousie purchased eight hundred exemplary of the "Journal of a recently married poet" edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the work of one of the most known andalous poets.
America less requested without Paul Newman
"When God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was part of it."
This phrase is of the actor Sally Field, who worked with him in "Assence of Malice", and illustrates well the hope of the American cinema, and from all the Americas, faced the shocking idea that Newman is no longer from this world.
He had to get a Oscar
He hadn't turned back since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
It was a hard shock for everyone.
"When a resident exceeds any expression, and now I lost a great friend," said Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to their existence."
Nobody was afraid to become rigid or exagered.
One of the fathers of cinema and patriarch has died during a specially dark period, where terrorists and boursiers are afraid, the estimation of the Americans is very low, seeking unreasonable reasons of dignity.
When the times are so hard and without reason to live, there is not the humans remain like admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He incarned a ideal of beauty and truth for all people.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of lost and winning causes, such as the foundation for the anti-drock fight created in the honour of his old elder, following a overdose and the creation of his own bio-sweet mark.
This was a victory for a country who was struggling to take place against a suicide food culture.
This expansive admiration vague was balled by Hollywood without taking attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, English Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another English, the oscarist Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked the sum of his career.
The bad boy arrived from Australia, Russell Crowe, had named Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He put the high bar to us," observed George Clooney, who is probably the only day that is trying to see the screen like Paul Newman: being very honest and with a serious and far-reaching private life.
It is not always easy or possible in the median jungle today.
But there's someone who trys, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married to 50 years in Joanne Woodward, who was faithful even if the opportunities weren't missing him to be not.
"But why should I eat a hamburger out of my house, if I have a bifeck in my cold?" he used to smile.
On heaven, he is with honour to meet his girls with his fans on earth, something that isn't so ordinary in America.
"For all the great roles he has interpreted, he has never been so proud that the husband's declared, the loved father, the grand father's attention and philanthrop," he says.
Madrid in the 2016 Olympic Games Organization
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid could organize Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, could be achieved in 2016.
But I'm asking if we're ready.
If we take the example of the last course: we are not!
They call him the perfect course, but I think it was the worst course I never participated.
If they had taken into account all the mistakes during the course, these would be the object of an eliminatory note.
But let's consider it in detail and from the beginning.
Errors start with the retreat of dossards, which makes you unable to go forward.
It's not bad but if they're making you move this would be better than they give you everything (including the electronic puzzle for courses).
And no, no.
They did you go there only to take the dose (first error, move only for this) and (with a long wait file!), there was only the size 'S 'S ' for the maillot (second error, because I need a XL size)
In what world we live?
Is it because of the crisis they have decided to buy that small-scale maillots with less tissue and less cheese?
Well, this is nothing about what happened the course day.
In addition to the fact that you need to go soon to remove the electronic pocket, the wait file is of 15 minutes and, moreover, you have to leave its sack to two to the entry.
The waiting has been over 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible since 11.000 people are expected for these courses.
Since there was a long waiting file, the competitions started and we didn't have left our bag to two in the entry, although once done, the retreat was worse.
Moreover, the rain composed the expectation of more than 40 minutes in which rebellions and shoes of the baraque took place.
I think about 500 people will have the pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me, they'll not even be in the classification with the exact time, because of the pocket they gave me who, I think, didn't mark the start correctly.
Of course, if they asked me to quote an example of perfect course, this would not come to the idea.
So I think we can always dream to become the host city for the J.O. 2016.
Microsoft Search for a Receptionist (virtual)
A new system of recognition of image and interaction, a species of artificial intelligence has little intelligence but is able to carry out some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a ship to move in the company camp) in response to what was requested at a conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of forms and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are, including remembering their positions - and listening and listening to the key words of their conversation.
But also group them according to discussion groups
In the presentation video, the receiptist detects a third person, but she understands that it does not belong to the group who is talking to her and that it is not part of the company.
She asked her if she's here to visit someone and she says she's gonna answer her in a few seconds.
All this without blue screen.
It's impressive.
But of course this represents the future.
Now the company has other things on which you focus, for example, on the next version of its operational system, Windows.
This week was spoken more than a Microsoft strategic change.
Windows 7 will be lighter and there will no longer be so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers were sold indispensable instead of unnecessary applications, they would be five times faster.
This represents a discovery because Microsoft, after version, did not stop adding functions and "extra" to Windows.
Strategy change is welcome.
Microsoft is right, his operational system lost importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who joined the theory that Google Chrome is the first start from Google to make Windows competition.
Many people just stressed that an Internet browser is not an operational system.
The operational system will always be necessary because it is the essential basis for understanding the computer and software.
He takes the same function as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your beauty mother.
That's true.
It will never disappear but it must be seen the "more" of the operational system, not as an absolute truth, but as a relative truth.
This week, Balmer confirmed this idea.
People make less attention to the operational system but more to the Internet browser.
Only the computer is moved to turn Firefox, Explorer or Chrome, and people every day take more time to navigate on the Internet than to pass windows.
Who serves half of the applications provided with the system?
Who can at least.
And Windows 7 must contain less applications, much less than Vista.
Small, months composed, less complex.
For the moment, Microsoft is more interested in starting its own online services so that they will eventually become an alternative in Google.
They are desperately needing of this, in fact, and I show you an example.
The photo presented in this article was taken at the beginning of this month in one of the reserved relaxing rooms for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the drink distributor, one shows their request to use their own search tool - "That Search. Our future."
In 2006, a study concluded that 66 per cent of Microsoft employees used Google to search for Internet information.
Last week a delay occurred in the new Windows Mobile version 7.
It will not be out at the beginning of 2009, but to the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to start at the same time Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, seems to be more like a computer.
But Android's starting is late and iPhone is already on the market, that will cost them.
The Fabuleux Marcel
Paul Picasso was the instant on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio, in the blood Diamant of Edward Zwick, as Al Pacino in " The Parrain " of Francis Ford Coppola and is part of the holding of the association of muscle homos.
And if we put all his appearances down, we could also cite this moustachu coast that highlighted weights in a ambulant circle.
It's not just a simple maillot of men's body in coton, mould and without sweet.
The English calls it "tank" but the Fabulous Marcel of Brussels is different from all others.
First, by his flamboying name - even though it is known under the name of Marcel ' - who has to see with the sport as he takes the name, according to the legend, of the boxer Marcel Cerdan, a loved song Edith Piaf.
Marcel is differentiated by others by its excellent coton, by its unilateral cut, by its distinctive logo and by the small Belgian (approximately recognisable) that the most known body maillots are in the coast.
But care, since the Belgian brand does not only produce top tanks.
But it also produces sweat-shirt, retreat boxers, boxers in cachem, cotton pants, babys, mini-shorts...
Traditions designed for the comfort of subvention.
Even if it's harmful to bring them only as sub-vites.
They're too charming.
"I want to become a young mother, the candidate doesn't worry."
His great likeness with his sister did not prevent him to develop his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Cruz's sisters currently take very seriously their new activity in mode.
According to Monica, they're not only beautiful and famous girls who provide their name.
It was present to the promotion that the Mango mark made in Paris in its new social seat, but also to present the most important prices of the mode than the Spanish house sponsoris.
Monica is warm and horrible.
Tell us what you're doing to Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have even created for Mango for the new winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards and at the dinner of the Opera in Valentino.
A very intense day, but at the same time, exciting, we are waiting.
What is based on your new collection for Mango for this fourth season?
The cinema of the 50s and 60s sweet us, and we inspire it much for our collections.
I like to ball in the city and observe the women to see how they are buried, how they combine their clothes, I often do it.
Dancing, actor and designer, you're a very polyvalent woman, isn't it?
I think that yes, but at the end, everything comes together and these activities have a lot of common things.
Since I was all the small clothes I was sweet; I wanted to go home my grandmother to watch in the shore of my tea and to see his clothes.
It was generous, almost better than go to the attraction park.
Then, when I became dance, I always tried to take care of my way to get away.
The dancers love to spend for courses and tests, to look at it and feel good.
And in the role of the actor, when you smell your clothes is at this time you really put into the skin of the personality.
On the other hand, it's all linked.
You haven't been 30 years ago, have it been hard for you?
Not all.
I feel better than ever, my 30-year-old years are joyful.
I think the woman is more mature, has more experience and saved life with less problems.
Biological clock is not scared of me.
I've done everything I wanted to do from all the small and this gave me a lot of internal happiness.
So, do you think you're mother?
Of course, I want to become a mother because my body asked me and, moreover, I want to become a young mother; I don't want to lose this.
As regards the candidate, I'm not worried about it.
What I'll do is to give a lot of happiness to my son and to remove him with a lot of love.
Let's go to the cinema, you're waiting for the different films you turned out last year.
That's true. I've got them out.
I am a woman from the theatre, I'm very inquired and worried, I would like to have everything now, but of course it's not possible.
I hate the films "The last hour" and 'Search for Christ' tube.
To see what you'll think...
A few days ago you started on the passenger with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't do that!
I didn't get up on the passport to make the mannequin.
Always, Naomi Campbell called me, I have known it since a bad time, to invite me to participate in London in a well-being challenge for his association in support of women and clothes that we show - I have shown two clothes of our created collection for Mango - were sold to the employees to collect money for the Naomi NGO.
The people that Naomi is a person in the heart tend to be.
They say so much about her, I know her, many things aren't true.
Moreover, this so good side of Naomi is fascinating me.
She asked me to challenge me for a so nice cause, but if she asked me to do it, I would even do it.
The importance is to make a better life to women in the third world.
Flight-alcohol reciprocals will have to install the alcohol system
The Minister of Internal Industrial wants that the driver who has more than three administrative sanctions for alcohol have to install in its vehicle a system that prevents the driving vehicle starting, or if it does not suffice.
The initiative has already been announced in June last month and appears in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered as a pilot project that will take one year.
Its purpose is reintegration of the driver by proposing routine re-education courses.
The Ministry of Road Security, but also the Directorate-General of Road Security and the Technological Institute for Car Safety, will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of the arrested automobilists to have driven more than once in the state of driving, the car reiterates.
Alcolock would avoid this because it is a vehicle-based system that measures the alcohol rate in the helium and prevents the starting of the vehicle if the driver does not suffer before; or when the driver’s alcohol rate is higher than the authorised.
The cost of the driver is higher than EUR 1.000 and is at the charge of the driver.
In this regard, a study carried out in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced up to 65 per cent of crimes during the first installation year.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save life to 115 people each year.
This is only the administrative sanctions for two reasons: to face these behaviors before they turn into criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, since the legal reform can be made by ordinary ways, but the reform made by criminal ways requires a reform of organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in no trade form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have an experimental title.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputy will vote on a initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party that proposes to install this system in school bus as it was done in France.
In Mexico without 'peep-toes'
At 17.40 p.m., officially planned, the Spanish aircraft flight in which the Princess of Asturies traveled to the presidential Hagar of the Benito Juárez of Mexico.
The sun was on the floor of sleeping, but his radios were still forced to put the hand in a visa guiding to see the king couple down from the flight.
Instead of the scale, the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours ago, I had asked on the street, the taxi chauffeur, if he knew that the Spanish princes visited the city to complete their official trip.
- Oh, very well, we're not going to the airport to take customers at this time... are you here or then...?
- No, no, sir, I'm Spanish, but I lived here two years thinking.
- Oh, very well...
But Mexico's press knows which are the Princes of the Asturies and knows the importance of the travel.
They are several to wait in the Hangar airport near the red mass and at a military range composed of 27 marine soldiers.
The Prince is smiling and smiling of sea blue, the princess, when she, with the hairs in the wind, was very shocked and did not take its usual 'pep-to'; perhaps they had said to him that a prayer was threatened.
They take a short stop at photos before they pass into the room where the official court is waiting for them.
At the gate of the hotel where they hire, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a rigorous journalist of the Mexican television waits for them.
The most prestigious price of mode
There is certainly no more suitable place in the world to present a mode price that Paris and certainly there is no extraordinary and good living designer than Valentino.
Mango has come to present the second edition of the Boton-Mango Fashion Awards to strengthen the international image of the new talents of the mode.
The winner will be rewarded by a price of EUR 300,000.
Since then Sandrina Fasoli, Belgium winner of the first edition, looked at his models in the vitrine of Mango at 54 bolevard Haussmann in Paris, and she was almost emotional.
Of course, it is the second largest market in the brand in Europe that has been inaugured with 1.335 meters of surface.
The first boat is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the stylist Valentino, chairman of the competitive jury, have found us in a luxurious dinner at the officer of Paris.
With the nearest table of the extraordinary family Chagals, the Presidential table prepared by Mango, seemed to be more spectacular.
Having grown on the heart and done against a bad rich good heart, because of the recent death of her brother, Nati took up a clothes of Mango and a few legs of ELAH, cut the sweet, and arms above, arms down with her son Luis - a beautiful man of nearly two meters of high – she accompanied Valentino to his dinner prepared in her honor.
Andik, Mango's owner, a man's talent, as well as the Rotchil Baron, finished the night without veston because they had prepared them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who was presented in the store with a screen and a chemise - of his own collection - and who was metamorphosed to dinner with a long sexy and dark roof, was shocked when during the night visit of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the room of repetitions of ballets and remembering the older time she took one of the bars and made the gear of a larger.
Ines Sastre was not left for the visit of the palace's dependances, but she showed us before on her portable phone photos of her son's photos.
On the next morning, we were pleased to see Olivier Martinez – another beautiful man who moves in moto - and John Travolta, who arrived in the Paris intercontinental hotel, with his draps, his servants, and asked for the prealable, that there are no dogs in his room.
Stars under the star of Paris.
Oh there, it's life.
1001, the number of anti-stress
There are only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and the vulnerability of daily life.
And to cross all things, they're all repertoried in a book that will bring relax to library on September 30.
Wave-more attracts us almost when he sounds every morning at 7 a.m., but it's worse when we think of the activity rythm we imply the current life.
The office is synonym of tension and the computer of painful pain.
The stress represents the evil of the twenty-first century.
But there are no two methods for combating daily fatigue and the problems related to the work world.
But 1001, no more nine or less.
In addition to yoga positions, classic massage or spa's treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers on the pages of a book a 'menu' of methods adapted to the guest and at each time.
The anti-stress work is referred to as '1001 ways to defeat and will arrive in the libraries directly from the editor Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to get tranquility in places such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' depends on such faith.
Furthermore, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or income 100% of natural income that help you defeat.
If adrenaline is not short in your vein to restore the balance of your body and if stress has become a problem, it is time to sit in the canape, deconnect his mind and focus on reading.
Speaking and sleeping
Some kids speak for the night.
I don't relate to those who wake up well by telling us something happened in the previous day, but to the children speaking during their sleep.
The first time that this happens, it can surprise you, but in fact it is not important.
It's a blessed alteration of the sleep that is called sleep.
It is pretty frequent, especially in children and adolescents.
It's sure there's more than one who speaks for the night.
This phenomenon can appear in a very sporadic way (only in life, for example, associated with a strong fever episode), or more periodicly (all days, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child is no longer remembered.
There is no unique cause that determines its appearance
They are often associated with other sleepalternations such as cachemars, night treasure, night sleeves (sweet pipe) or sombulism, but it is not always the case.
As we have said before, they can also be associated with very strong fever, stress situations or overwhelming situations.
In any way, it's a little studyed phenomenon.
The intensity with which it produces is also very variable.
It may be speaking with a quiet voice, with isolated words, murmurs or instead with crys, laughs, long talks ...
In the case of sleeping becomes very frequent, it would be judicious to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check whether there is a problem that causes much anxiety and to obtain an explanation to this problem.
We have said that it is a blessed alteration, because there is no treatment, except if it is associated with another sleep alteration that can be treated (e.g., if it is associated with a sleep apple or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to smell the child before you go to bed.
So search for quiet games and avoid television programs or series that are more or less violent.
With very nervous children and who have the pain to defeat, relaxing techniques can be used to help them relaxing internally.
This will allow the child to have more peaceful sleep.
As the dreams appear to try to stay calm.
Remember that they are unforgettable for the child and that afternoon it will not remember what happened.
Useful Councils
Don't wake him.
It's unnecessary because he's unconscious and you'd wake him up.
Even if he's talking, he's there and he's staying there.
Remember that if it is very awesome several times, it is advised to consult a doctor or to check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (what is not ordinary), do not have the attempt to ask for information.
You won't get anything, because when sleeping, he's not aware to organize his thought.
Moreover, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what it is in dream, take care of how you will interpret the information and the conclusions you're taking it.
Don't ever tell the child you can ask him for the night to know his secrets.
Don't even smile.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
Finally, don't worry about it, it's nothing very bad, it's a episode that takes just a few minutes.
IleUser... final
Hellaeusern finally found the way of the victory on his terrain after a long period of discount.
Without making a great match, the Yellows and Blacks created the largest occasions and made it possible to transform one for the winning of the match.
The rythm was not very supported during the meeting where the attackers were ill to express.
After a first trial of the visitor Kaffmann, who struck the shooting on a loose shooting, Illhaeusern was going to take slightly the ascendant and tour Funterfick from far, then with Hirn above, Romein of the leg or Debold came to shoot the defense of marinemary.
In the face, we were blocked in the field and just left Riahi's remoting at the point of the attack.
The beginning of second-times would first be decisive with two occasions signed Riahi and Temporale for Dayemary, and soon after the opening of the scene for the Illusionians by Marais, well positioned to recovered a ball retreated on a first trial of Debold (53e).
But Ilyousiens will not save his happiness for a long time and will be obliged to get the clothes a twenty minutes later and thus leave his coachers in digital inferry.
But Makaemarie will not be able to benefit and will not pose great problems to a Illusian Onze who just raised a little to "compact" his defence, struck in all the last seconds of play where, after a large cafouillage, the ball passed very close to the transversal.
Sarkozy to meet fishermen in anger
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a distance by Britain.
In the demonstration of fishermen who have strongly ruined the access of several bretton and standard ports, the President of the Republic decided to make themselves on the Guilvinec port in Finnish to meet their representatives.
They promised to welcome it "with a constructive spirit" and hope that it will "come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that took place at the same time as a general assembly of the "Crise Committee" created by the Breton Fishermen to obtain measures faced by gas prices, which reached a record of more than EUR 1.14 per medium litre.
According to David Martinon's speaking port, the President will "debat with them solutions that can be imagined to help their undertakings find competitiveness and to secure the conditions of marine employment and repayment".
Nicolas Sarkozy is waiting for the fishermen.
Morning morning, they carried out scargots in Morbian and Calvados, attending legs near 10 km.
Quiberon's funeral port was also blocked, but the connections to Belle Island were not stopped.
A filter barge has been started on the Press Island of Quiberon.
The marines have already shown their determination in brushing since the aube, pneumatics and palettes before the fuel deposits of the Brest ports, and Lorient, while manifestations were turned to Concarneau or Saint-Briuc.
The movement was promoted to other ports of the Atlantic and Manche Façade, such as the Olonne Sables in Vendée, where the chaluiers remained in quai, or Havre, where a twenty-five boats blocked trade ships movements.
The fishermen of La Turball and Crossic, Loire-Atlantic Loire, stopped at the evening the block of the important Donges total refrigerator.
Those of Boulogne-Su-Mer decided to wait for the Monday Meeting to decide on events.
In Guilvinec, the "Crise Committee" must actually decide on marchs of follow-up to the movement and its participation in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some braton fishermen do not want to be represented by responsible members of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support their movement.
"The grève will continue" because "the fishermen will not leave anything" and "don't want to move to Paris", says Liliane Cariou, President of the Committee of Fisheries of Lorient.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay gas taxes, are currently paying about 50 centimeters per litre, but they believe that a boat’s rentability steel is only reached with a gas lower EUR 0.30.
Paul Newman the wonderful
"Butch Cassidy and the Kid" in the 83-year-old age of his home of Connecticut is dead.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or Sam Mendes welcomed the legend of the cinema and the actor, Paul Newman, was born 83 years old.

AIG would expect to spend more than 15% of its assets
The American Insurer International Group, which the United States Monetary Authorities have reported, intends to spend more than 15 per cent of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion that had been advanced, according to the Financial Times Financial Edition.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its international insurance and its retraiting activities in the United States, specifically the newspaper that quotes near the sources of the dossier.
The AIG Administration Board was meeting on Wednesday night to examine events, according to FT.
No confirmation was obtained at AIG.
The AIG's assets intended to separate their air leasing subsidiary International Financial Corp., its participation of 59% in the Transatlantic Holdings reassurer as well as its real estate port and investment in private equity, adds FT.
No definitive decision was taken on these delays, continued by the FT.
The AIG must quickly realize liquidity to repay the fund of 85 billion of the Federal Reserve to see the American authorities taking 80 per cent of its capital, dividing the current shares.

At the beginning of the meeting, Wall Street struggled after the unexpected rejection by the Chamber of Representatives of the Bank Safety Plan that would allow to find a little stability on the market.
By 228 votes against and 205, representatives refused the secretariat to the Treasury Henry Paulson the means he asked.
About two Republicns on three have rejected its plan.
"It's a bad signal sent to the market, which sees the Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza, FTN Financial.
"This shows how the market was counted on this plan," she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days is "the late."
"If the project is effectively Moribond (...) then the relaxation will be passed quickly to the Fed (American Central Bank, ndlr) and to other central banks to manage the crisis, which would remain more credit conditions", predicted Brian Bethune, the Economic Chief of Global Insight.
And more emphasising the emergency feeling, "each day that pass the fall of a financial institution" in the United States stressed Ms. Piegza.

Obama, winner at the first tv
In the first week-end debate between the two candidates at the White House, one other succeeded to know who, from John McCain or Barack Obama, brought it.
Without surprise, the QG of Republic and Democratic campaigns proclaimed their own victory in that television which had been followed by a third of the United States families.
The political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although honorable, has not been sufficiently "blunt" to allow him to cut his down in the reviews for five weeks of the presidentials.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion investigation was published in Saturday, granted five points in Obama (49 per cent against 44 per cent in McCain), considers that this is the democracy who slaughtered the game.
In non-decisive electioners, who are those who account, Obama has been winning for 39% of the sons, while 25% of them granted the victory in McCain, according to a CBS survey.
Obama should be able to confirm his progress on Thursday with the expected performance of his colleague, Joseph Biden, at the first and unique public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"It would be an error of sub-stimating.
She has good instincts, but Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The seventh-seventh McCain had stopped putting its insufficient experience in the field of foreign policy, while stressing the "nivelness" of his adversary on these issues, which were in the heart of this first face.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand... Have he accused several times.
"I don't believe that Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary to be President," he also assured.
A marteled attack angle since yesterday in the Republican television advertisements.
Obama stressed him that he represented the future.
Without demonstrating, he showed himself conscious and accurate.
He made his ability to take the good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain has not always understood, while Obama, if," retorted, this weekend, a democratic spot to the Republican to have not taken all the measure of the impact of the crisis on the "American Street".
"When the twenty-third minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you, he declared Obama, last night, for a election meeting in North Caroline under a swimming rain.
It has not even declared the words "medion" or "train"." The financial deroute clearly benefits Obama, which is considered by the Americans as the most to save the economy on the front of the precipice.
"The next week could be a decisive tournant," estimated the influenced Senator democrat Charles Schumer.
The Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, an elder of the Clinton administration, compared the "economic instincts" of Obama to those of Bill Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998.
For the Democratic candidate, the current debate is "the final version of eight years of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reaffirming that even 95 per cent of the American taxes would be reduced, despite the wave-style summers, the Italian Senator also stated that the achievement of a potential energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy was its first priority, with the establishment of a sanitary insurance system.
McCain wanted to build a park of 45 nuclear centrals from 2030.
On the other hand, the two candidates were subject to the financial savings plan of $700 billion ($470 billion) adopted last night by the Congress and extremely impunity.
A Minsk, "Have you noticed that there was a choice, you?"
Youth and opposites showed Sunday night on the main place of the Belarus capital to reject the results of the legislatives.
Some hundreds of Belarus meetings were held on Wednesday after the closure of the vote offices on the central place of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislatives.
While no results were yet announced, many young people had come to demonstrate the power of President Alexandre Lokkachenko: "the dictator, demission."
Some don't even have voted, "Aw what is good, because they will do what they want of my voice," said a young man.
They do not believe that the system that made good figures to foreign observers in order to re-interpreter the language with the European Union is ready to make a democratic turning.
The sanctions, including the prohibition of visa for 40 Belarus leaders and the gele of certain possessions, could be levied if these elections were considered themselves by observers.
They have not been according to the opposition.
"We have been held away from the electoral committees and our observers couldn't participate in the depower," deplored Iouri Potemkine, the parliamentary port of the Union of Democratic Forces, a historical grouping of 12 parties.
"This is a cosmic change, emphasized by Alexandre Milinkievitch, the former candidate of the opposition to the President of 2006 and the Chief of the Democratic Movement, since the importance is that the voice is counting, and in us, is the executive power.
If Members of the opposition enter the Parliament, they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their income to Parliament may mean television space, meetings in the regions and law proposals."
The opposition should therefore be entered into the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union must be engaged.
Because if our economy, which is very detained in Russia, is in crisis, and we do not reform, we can become a Russian Protectory.
Or we want to be independent."
The opposition is afraid that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that has followed the election process does not recognize the validity of the election.
It stressed that the participation figures are too high, and that the generalization of the vote by advance (26 per cent of the elections in Minsk) opened the vote to all manipulations.
"Do you notice that there was a election, you? asked the Social-Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the vote offices.
And there will be at least five Members of the Parliament's opposition, those who agree the best to the power."
The silence of the night comes on the place of October.
At the television, President Loukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Committee are welcomed by their success.
The Interview - The Blood Returned
Hema-Québec celebrated last 10th anniversary of his foundation, and his President, Dr. Francine Decary, had reason to rejoice, because Hema-Québec was one of the most secure and efficient blood providers in the world.
And in particular, he recognised the public's trust that was seriously shocked by the contaminated blood scandale in the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know, national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Cross Transfusion Service were contaminated by the virus of acquired immunodeficiency (VIH) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
The Government of Canada established a public survey in February 1994, chaired by the Judge Horace Crever, which intended to make the light on the circumstances leading to such a tragedy, and to make recommendations so that such disaster would not be reproduced.
While the judge Krever was late to put his report, some provinces then set up a committee aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the General Committee completed this mandate.
Following the Genelinau and Krever reports, two suppliers were established in Canada: Hema-Québec to serve the Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to provide all other provinces and the two territories.
" In 1998, when Hema-Québec began its activities, 38 per cent of the people still trusted in the blood system in Quebec, Dr Decary was reminded.
The situation was unfortunate.
With the efforts to improve the safety of blood and work on the field during the years that have followed, we have registered public confidence," she said pridely that in the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the Québecose population had now confidence in Hema-Québec.
Dr. Decary, however, holds the head that "the confidence is something extremely fragile."
Since its creation, on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec implemented the precautional principle.
At that time, in Europe there were many cases of human forms of fool vessel disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which has been told to have been strong since its foundation in 1998.
"And we did not know all if this disease could be transmised by blood.
It was then supported by one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gelineau reports, which, when it is not known and that serious disease can be deleted, the disease of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain inevitably conducting death, is set out in exclusion measures.
Thus, in April 1999, the blood of persons who lived over a month in the United Kingdom has been rejected since 1980.
But, a few years ago, it has been shown out of any doubt that this disease is transmised by blood.
This episode showed us so that the principle of care that we have applied had a sense."
In 1999 there was a much more sensitive HIV detection technology on the market: nuclear acid tests (TAN) which allow to detect directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus itself and not the anticorps against the virus in which the tests were used until the values were used.
TANs allowed to recover the mute period, which extends between the time the person was infected and the one where the first virus can be detected in the blood by our technicians, explains the specialist.
The period was reduced to a period lower than one week.
Thus, the risk of some donors are infected without knowing and not to detect them.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS by blood transfusion.
Today, a person of 12 million shortly is the risk of receiving HIV contaminated.
"In other words, it means that 12 million blood products should be distributed before someone is infected by HIV.
As Hema-Québec distributes each year between 4000,000 and 500 000 blood products, this will take more than 24 years before HIV transmission was taken by a blood product.
I believe that today we can feel to receive or prescribe blood transfusion to recover health," states Hema-Québec's head.
" Our challenge for the next decade is to keep our products security.
We never know what's going to be pathogenic in the system.
Not later than the last year occurred on the island of the Meeting, the Chikungunya virus, which is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
The Dr. Decary must continue to be monitored before emphasising that Hema-Québec must also provide sufficient supply.
"The needs are increased because the population is older.
Anticanceral treatments are more aggressive, patients often need reloading in red globes or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the network of blood donors who are not grouping at average only 3 per cent of the Quebecois admissible to blood donations."
Any person in health, aged 18 and more responding to the criteria of admissibility can even give blood every 56 days, or six times per year.
In the meantime, 14 per cent of the people proposing their blood are not accepted, because they are reached from AIDS or Malaria, for example, and if they lived in a country where the poorism is seized, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"Before these 3 per cent, we are coming to maintain an inventary that responds to the hospital needs.
The penalties are very rare.
But members of this donor network must be renewed as they are old and can't give their blood anymore.
But it is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but especially to stop them and to encourage them to become regular donors.
Today's life is so excited, it is rarely found the time to pass an hour to give his blood", says Francine Decary.
With a annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec provides not only blood products but also human tissue, including ossed tissue, heart valves, ocular globes and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burned.
These tissue are analyzed, transformed and congeled before being put in Hema-Québec, which also managed the only public blood bank in Quebec.
The ombilical cordon that was considered to be a biomedic dechet resolve a rich blood in soft cells that could serve to treat serious diseases, such as leucemia.
"On a few weeks ago, the banking of our Millennium Blood Sample, and it is expected to preserve more than thousands per year.
The Dr. Decary, who describes this curdon blood precipitation program as very popular, should be started to propose for graffiti at the beginning of the next year.
"Mothers are disappointed to have access to it", because Hema-Québec does not have the way to propose this complex and cost-building program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - Impact in half-final
The Montreal Impact has been qualified for the half-final round of the USL first eliminatory series, thanks to a victory of 3-1-4-3 to the purposes, at the second and decisive match of the final series at the Saputo Stade.
The field environment Antonio Ribeiro marked the decisive goal at the 90th minute of play.
After a first half without goal of one side as well as the other, the field environment David Testo and Rocco Plancentino marked the other files of Montrealese training.
Roger Levesque was the only to join Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Let us recall that during the first match of the return series, Friday, the Impact had a defect from 2-1 to Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in Seattle's bathroom.
Impact will be measured to the Vancouver Whitecaps in half-final.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunder composed a 3-1 deficit in the retreat for importer 4-3, but the Whitecaps also accessed to half-final round 5-4 in total purposes.
The Impact should face the Whitecaps Tuesday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In brief - But victory of Kovalev
The three number of Canadians is ready to take the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn has named the attack in a winning of 3-2 from Canada to the Flood Panthers, last night, at the Central Bell.
Costitsyn, the first star of the meeting, marked a goal, Plekanec loved two helps, and Kovalev collected a pass in this wine, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preparatory matches.
Kovalev gave the victory in marking the only purpose of the fusil.
"I'm not yet ready, welcomed Russia.
I need another game to feel like it."
"He tried too much to do in the first period, noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the end of the match.
He's got a nice sweetheart."
Box on the North
The Prime Minister does not exclude elections before the end of the year
As long as the Advisory General of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest came to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Boldu (to the left), tried to elect in the occasion of today's partial election.
"Repower the limits of our last large northern border": this is the long-term environment which Jean Charest has presented with visual strength while staying in the large lines, in the end of the General Council of the Quebec Liberal Party, Levis, yesterday.
After him, during his speech, was designed a kind of Moulin's images.
Turned on a ball, on three large screens, of spectacular clays of hydroelectric bars, mineral exploitation, from Quebec saw by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great means as in election period.
In pressing point, the first minister refused to exclude that the elections of this autom, even if he noted that his time was very loaded.
The "North Plan" is the fourth bread of a "vision" which the Prime Minister intends to have for Quebec, the of a "new economic space", which includes a work agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Recently mentioned in the talks of the first minister, the opening of the Northern Territory in the 49th parallele had never been subject to a presentation.
However, the first minister was bound to explain why the North was "a joyau to the large potential", but did not give time, investment amounts, nor specific priority in future projects.
More than a few events of what could be developed, including hydro-electricity, forest, but especially the mining sector, depending on the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platin, or, gold, fer, titane, and even diamond", according to Mr. Charest's enumment.
This "territory two times large as France," "It's home to us, it's in Quebec.
It's not only in us, but it's in us," he stressed, as to show that he requested a national founder.
The Quebec has built a lot in his relationship with the North, noted: the street to gold in Abitibi, the Quebecoise engineering, the Baie James Bay.
"It's to us, it's our future," he added, after having made a theatrical pause to emphasize the implant card behind him.
North, 70 per cent of the Québeco territory, including a part of the Labrador, which Kebec has always returned, has specified the first minister at the press point.
"This is a traditional position that all governments have reiterate.
There is a border line on which there is no long time of order and, when the opportunity is present, I reiterate this position in the name of the government," he stated.
On the other hand, "with climate changes, our Northern vision must be remedyed", he stated by speaking about the past of the Northwest, which will open the whole year because of the source of glass.
In this new geopolitical context, the first minister believes that the territory is a duty.
And the inhabitants of the territory, the United Nations Prime and the Inuits?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec Government would be very careful to them and that the project would benefit them, including young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Peter Corbeil and Michel Léturneau (ancient Sink Deputy of Ungava), have already conducted consultations with a thirty-first community.
An inter-terminist committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Sports and Natural Resources) has been an important place to work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a great meeting, "not necessarily a Summit", but a moment in which "common vision will be given".
Northern development would also be in compliance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "concerned, ordered and respected for the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as in continuity with the of the first liberal ministers who had preceding it.
"Besides the liberals that we had previously thought to transform the challenges into new times of growth and development."
This was also one of the recurrent themes of the weekend, which took place on Friday by a large cocktail to emphasize the 50th anniversary of John Leage's arrival to the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposed to restore the Central Beauharnois in Barrage Adelard-Godbout.
"De Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, in Reading which made the peaceful revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectrics, in Bourssa who made the Bae James Bay, our party forced the future," said Jean Charest.
In press point, he called another reference, conservator of that, the "Roads to the North" program of John Diefenbaker, the first minister of 1957 to 1963.
Mr. Charest stressed that his service was planned for 2012 by addressing Eastman1a-Ruper electric hydro-band project.
"It remains among us, but I think it's there," he trusted his warriors, raising their homes of food applauses.
Indeed, the first minister, who said in April, that there was no election in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not disappear the possibility of deploying the autonomy, as the law allows it.
However, he stressed that his time is fulfilled, in particular by a mission of the Federation Council in China and a sum of Quebec-New York.
The General Council of the weekends provided to the Liberal Head a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including the "constitutional aspirations" which were passed as a letter to the post: PLQ, in particular, claims the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also wished to call Québec members of the Radiodistribution Council and Canadian Telecommunications and have a veto right to make decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, the large lines of the North Plan were welcomed with scepticism.
The Sinist Chief Pauline Marois resolved the North-du-Québec Development Policy launched in 2001.
According to it, when the Liberal Government arrived to the power in 2003, he refused to apply it.
If he had done it, "we would be more advanced today," Mrs Marois commented on the sides of his candidate in Jean-Talon (scrrutin today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ said to support the adoption of a North Plan by the Government.
"But what we want is that it's not just a spectacle," said the leader Sebastien Proulx, in replacement of Mario Dumont, who returns to holidays today.
Letters - A Decorated country
This was Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (or Iran) in the Harper Office, which allowed the last summer to say Louise Bauur that she was a "honour" for Canada.
To do so the opposite on this woman who has conducted an insufficient fight for justice and who mere our admiration as long as he said about the slaughter of the first minister and of Stephen Harper himself.
We are in front of a government that is the only one, among all Western countries involved, to have not repatriated his citizen in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take account of the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager at the time of his reproaching facts.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, renews his word and lets an inhuman child-solated child grow.
The only person who has sent it to a parodi of justice to assess the guilty of the accused.
Remember, in reminder, that UNICEF, International Amnisty and the Canadian Barreau Association, in particular, calls for the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order to benefit from a fair process in Canada.
It is the same government that closes the eyes of torture: it is not important that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, uncertainly ever after many years of exploitation.
It is not yet understood, but we are present at this moment at an unfair exhibition of our rights, freedom and democracy, the word that Harper stops to mark and sounds so believed in his mouth.
Here comes the time where no morality is no longer: it can be decreased, tortured, arbitraryly imprisoned by a Canadian citizen according to the right desire of a government leader to this minority (which will be after October 14...).
Many electors believe that they will find the salvation in a party who preaches the Vertue, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has refused to do what the reputation and dignity of our country.
The honour, Mr. Toews, is here in this resignation and not any other.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's oral talks
In its edition of 17 September, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President of the Canadian Mineral Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, it claims that the largest aural company in the world has pursued a continuing disagreement of six million against three authors and a small edition house without it to start a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of persecution, but the law.
Without surprise, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr Garver.
Because, for Barrick Gold, would it be the best way to conduct a public debate to the ruin whose oses support a contrary position to the siena?
Unlike the result of the proceedings, the authors and editors of the Black Canada book will have to cost considerable funds in order to prepare their defence and fight, very inequalious weapons, against a military lawyers supported by the pockets almost without the mine.
The tactic, in these inequalities struggles, is also often to destroy defenders in order to put a regulation to the friend who will struggle the opposition more to shoot anybody to smile again on the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is before the public view that she had to present her vision of facts.
In contrast to what is done in several countries where Barrick Gold works, the debates in Canada are normally conducted by the exchange of ideas and not by matrakes.
It was therefore sufficient to open its books, documents and to establish a real debate, through journals, media, publications and the financing of independent research teams that would be able to make light on the matter.
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust in the public view and reject the demands and letters of support to the authors of Black Canada.
Maybe Mr. Garver could explain how he can both ask for a "public" debate by misunderstanding the opinions of the same public?
In the world of the Vice-President, it seems that this word only calls for fatly paid lawyers and not all Canadians; this is a close view of the concept.
In democracy, even delegators have the right to say.
What you don't understand - or you don't want to understand - Barrick Gold, is that the public who supports the authors and editors of Black Canada does it first because he rejects the brutal way of mining.
This public is ready to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilized argument exchanges, and not in the context of what several findings as a continued-baillon (for the "public debate", Barrick Gold, is also to put them to the end of the use of this term...).
Besides the real talk of Mr. Garver, Barrick Gold is a direct attack against the freedom of university research and the search of truth, essential to all democratic society.
It will never be blocked by the right to quote of credible sources and the debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the same basis for intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss the subjects of the world's rich enterprises in a country such as Canada, in spite of repeating continues, who can do this?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do it according to the scientific standards used by the Black Canada authors.
She has a right to reply.
The university environment, which we belong, has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and to solve conflicts.
The continued Barrick Gold has clearly shown that, in contrast with what she claims, it has no wish to have a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to establish devices that limit such a kind of abuse progress.
Wall Street Saving Operation - Democrats and Republicans hear
Bush Administration and Congress' File Chiefs, both republic and democrats, finally arrived in an agreement on the largest economic saving plan since the Great Depression in the 1930s.
The new version of the United States $700 billion plan to strike the financial crisis that Wall Street has been cut for months must still be completed by the two Congress rooms.
In particular, it provides a better control by the elections of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of the public money undertaken, new provisions to contain the number of payment houses, as well as a right to view payments paid to securities leaders.
The United States Secretariat in Tresor, Henry Paulson, the President of the Chamber of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the representative of the Republic at the negotiations table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after the week, at the end of a two-day negotiations marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an effective agreement on markets," said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
"That has been done to open the real economy and the normal Americans of the current crisis in Wall Street," explained the Democracy.
"This is the fundamental point: if we do not do this, the traumaism, the chaos and the disturbances about the daily life of the Americans will be overwhelmed," said the Republicn Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had turned to the sprint in the last hours by fear of the effect that would cause a new failure on investors' humor.
The limited time we were granted was the opening of the markets this morning.
Against the negotiations, the two candidates at the American Presidential election had shown themselves instead favorable to the agreement, but it was unless they expressed their misconception that it was obliged to reach this extremeness.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama has assigned some provisions to the agreement, including the aim of allowing the owners to keep their home and the payment of the leaders of the State's leaders.
"When the taxpayers are requested to take extraordinary measures due to the inresponsiveness of some, there is no pleasing.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the waves of American television.
Questioned on another chain to know if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican adversary, John McCain, answered: "I would like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The great lines I've read [monstered] that it's something we all have to divide and with which we're going to be able to advance.
The option to do nothing is just not acceptable," he said.
The plan of 700 billion is aimed at saving the money of the taxpayers with suspicious, risk-active and inconvenible credits from American financial institutions.
After 14 months, a crisis launched by the elimination of a real estate bull that first led to the extent of hypothetical risk credits (subpressed) before extending to other more broader forms of credit titles (PCA) and switching on liquidity helmets and the deficiency of banks and financial institutions.
It's a group of Republican elections who had done the first start project last week.
It is believed to be out of this impasse since democrats accepted that some "toxic" assets of difficulty companies are only assured by the government, instead of buying.
In order to raise the Englishs for everyone at the Congress, it was also added that if the government had to take loss for five years with this programme, it could set up new taxes to help it restore it.
The new plan prescribes the payment of a first trace of 250 billion to which 100 billion more will be added if the President requires the judge.
The payment of 350 other billion should be completed by another vote by the Congress.
In exchange of its assistance, Washington will receive participations in the securities enterprises that will be dividends in case of profit, and that it will be able to return when the tour will be passed.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to delay the income procedures relating to housing related to this plan, and to establish limits to payment and departure paid to the leaders of the affected enterprises.
The architects of the plan would like to see it with the vote of the Chamber of Representatives since now, and to the Senate Mercedes.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet sure that their plan will be green.
Indeed, votes continued to be held against this project, both in the Republicn and democratic camp.
"It is obviously, Washington doesn't hear you," said the Republic of Scott Garrett, member of the Chamber's Finance Committee, to the address of his electors.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yeah, there are solutions.
But not the one that is to benefit contributions."
Animator of a small group at the Congress on behalf of the "the sketchs of the sceptics", the Democratic representative Brad Sherman presents the things otherwise, but reaches the same conclusion.
"Cark hundred major economic teachers, whose three Nobel Prizes, wrote us to say: We are asked to not press the Congress and to carefully examine the way to take", he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, there was a new evidence of the world's nature of crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three countries of Benelux announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11,2 billion euros (16,3 billion US).
The intervention of the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas has noted that it refused to purchase its competitor in full demand since it lost EUR 2 billion (2.9 billion) in the crisis of real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85.000 people and is part of the twenty larger European banks and ten more assuranceers.
"This is not the lost money, said yesterday the Dutch Minister of Finance, Wouter Boss.
In exchange, a vote right to the bank and the influence is recovered.
It's just something that the splendors and households now appreciate that the time becomes uncertain."
During that time, on the other side of Manche, the British Government was likely to nationalize another financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would retain all the loans in the Bradford bank and Bringley bank, with more than 41 billion (75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander told last night that she would buy succursale and customer accounts from the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an engaged icon
His beauty in the eyes of a blue was long his card out, no one will say his weakness.
Was he released from the Narcissic View, the American actor in the charming smile?
Yes, and not.
His power, his sensitivity and a talent that was covered from source will have also been removed from the power register that kids the true sacred monsters.
But what a great background course!
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Monday, at 83 years of age, follows a pulmonary cancer in the ring of the Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of the American cinema for fast years.
Not less monumental than Brando, whom he seemed and whom he was a kind of rival on the screen, was more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also the apostle of the freedom and exilation of the dramatic conventions.
Magnificent blood often makes wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, with a German Jewish father and a Hungary mother of origin.
These European roots will be born one of the glorious American dream faces.
Without ego, the latest quality mark.
Because it was designed a whole country of self-profit, the fighter of the Pacific war, who was blessed at the battle, which at the beginning of the 50s, he studied the dramatic art in Yale, then frequently the Actor's Studio of New York before trioping the theatre, at the television, soon in the cinema.
The same man who warned for civil rights was also the car pilot that was classified in Mans at 24 hours in 1979, doubled by a symbol, whose member of a model couple formed since 1958 with the actor Joanne Woodward.
They also divide the dark zones of this secret star, discrete, engaged, allergic to the edges of the show-business, which will not actually be lost.
A honest man, in the nobleest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's disappearance searched for the cinephiles this weekend, while his big roles were shocked on the black screen of memorys.
More than a half centuries of a seventh American art in perpetual mutation slows through him.
Remember the chest cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejected his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on a blulant toile from Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More closer to us (1990), it was called his sensible Mr. Bridge, found in his old age by a marriage that did not fill all his promises.
So many other Paul Newman's passing to the story.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, criminal, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me, Robert Wise, is a role to James Dean, which actually launchs Newman in 1956.
This sympathical malfrat in the brillantity The Sting (La'Arnaque), the best film Oscar in 1973.
Awesome and winner player in the magnificent The Hustler of Robert Ross (1961), he will retrace his personality on the return in The Color of Monney de Martin Scorsese, who values him in 1987 his unique Oscar on nine appointments.
This face through the age was him.
Besides him.
The times are walking through his way.
Young people are particularly familiar with him through George Roy Hill (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, a trainer of a slightly orthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found it in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Brothers Coen.
With the last role of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes in 2003, the ball was cut.
Unlike several legends of the cinema that slowly leaved the work, Newman will remain in sell, while condemning Hollywood, his oral, its fast and its concessions.
The French cinema Bertrand Tavernier would consider it, not without humor, "as a living challenge to "supplicating" which judges his too supported performances.
The professional has not always been tending to the beau Paul Newman, who the roles slept in the cup for a long time.
However, it was less often played as young people first than marginal: frozen, alcoholic, salt or deceptive, the perfect trails reflected detriments and revolts.
As a realizer, Newman reveals the fairly known faces of his real pudic sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (as the Roman of the Canadian Margaret Laurence), with her wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, brought a woman’s portrait of melancolie.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose gave him his film Harry and Son in 1984, the work of pudeur and tristeness.
Among the rain of swimming in Newman, his grand friend and former arms partner Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) remarked, very attractive, "She has made my life and this best country."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrant traces of the disappeared actor.
In addition to his legend career, there is also a great warrior for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, an Hollywood's detriment contestant.
We would have seen a lot of his throne on vinaigrettes, grains, bicycles and other foods, judgeing the process of smelling, whatever it won at the start.
However, the benefits of these sales were paid to its Foundation for the difficulty childhood.
Newman, instead of sit on his myth, will be joined up to the leg.
He left his five girls a letter containing these words: "All and until the end, your father was incredibly recognized by his good star.
It was a privilege to be there."
And a privilege for us to have followed the course of a American artist so luciferous and so generous.
Citizens' models, in summary and in their own.
What could well produce Zuccio & amp; Compagnie in their fabric?
Nearly, on October 8, the hearings will start with regard to the current criminal procedure, against Yanos Zuppo and his companions.
Political and its companions are accused of shocking, in the form of criminal organization, in a permanent and regular manner, with particularly important damages, and other guests of accused have been condemned against them, such as false and false use.
According to the parque, the money from subsidies was expenditure for personal purposes while the benefits were justified by false facture.
The money of the State and municipalities, about 65 million HUF totally, was one part in the boxes of the Fiatal Baloldal movement and on the other hand, in the pockets of some people.
Their method, also made public by the investigation authorities, was to touch the money of the grants obtained by issue of cost factures, which did not provide any real performance, and thus the associations never respected their commitments.
According to the accused act, a large part of the factures were false.
For these lasts, they searched for accounting books on the Yozsefvaros market while they made the cachets in Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that were going to figure on the factures, it was decided, inter alia, during the tours in the northern Balaton Lados province, conducted by Istvan Lados, on the request of Yanos Zuschlag.
According to the depositment of this latter, it was necessary to restore pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he asked a facture, on the model of which they would realize the other factors they would, inter alia, introduce at the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Capital Municipality to access subventions.
The majority of the factures was created by Istvan Lados and by its companion András śri, who, according to our information, was particularly concerned to editing the files necessary for the obtaining of subsidies.
When a "retreating circuit", one of Lados' choice was a bistro.
According to the two factures issued by the Zuppos in 2003, this place has assured the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However, in accordance with the proposals of the manager, it would have been impossible that so many people take care of this place at the same time.
Similarly, during the year 2002, the facture established on behalf of the Jobb Jövæért Foundation, which will then bring the name of Egypt at Harmadik Evezredert, a brown of forms and funds.
A pension situated in Badacsonytomaj was actually only three rooms, and a maximum of ten people could pass on the night. However, the facture mentioned hundred thirty customers.
Factors on the dischargeable images were also dropped in excese, when they mentioned the Pigal Kft company, also belonging to the Horeca sector. In their accountability, nor Jobb Jövært, nor the Hopaah's data appeared, according to the parking data.
Gyśzś Farkas, the company manager, declared the hvg.hu site that when the park called it and showed the factures, he knew, as well, that it was false documents.
"The name of our society and our tax number were placed to a bad place on the cache."
He adds: "Besides the form, the fact that, according to the facture, hundreds of people had lodged there, not yet, because this institution has only one of our rooms, which do not have so much place.
Furthermore, the factur also mentions food, and our restaurant is closed for a long time."
Electric facturers have not yet been listed on Budapest’s travel agencys, which are part of their choice, but organizing only travels to the foreign. Thus, natively, they reported stays in Hungary on factories to be resolved in species, which are also contrary to the accounting practices of the Agency.
Overall, as was appeared at the investigation, they also added TVA on these documents, while travel activities, with the destination outside the European Union, are factured without TVA.
Similarly, the TVA rate of the four factors established on behalf of the Hotel Revfulosop was incorrect, since the performance of the company does not support a 25% TVA as indicated, but a 15% TVA. In addition, hotel employees are only printed factures, while false performances were made on the hand.
The investigation of the parque shows that the "employers" also made errors by mentioning the transport of goods by road, that the factory company could not exercise, since its profile was the investment advice.
Furthermore, it is for forms such as inadequate facture types and false cachets, that the factures issued at the order of Egyuttt to Harmadik Evezredert Alapítvány, XXI. Századi Kukulturalis Egyesület and Biztos Pont have been false.
Just as in the case of the company Ravenna Bt. or the sportive stage of Kunfeherto, which both denied to be the authors of the factures issued in their name.
Faussarys did not have attention to the fact that HIB Kft., established in Nírereregyháza, was in liquidation at the time when (2001) the Fiatal Varosert Egyesület group had to take a feed home. According to our information, this is why the company’s liquidator has never issued this facture.
Delegated facts
Another category of facture emissions is the composed of those who were very conscious that it was asked to issue fixed factures.
The Egely Budapestért Alapítvay foundation, at the request of the Fiatal Baloldal Group - Ifjú Szocialisták, has established a facture on the order of the Együtt Foundation to Harmadik Evezredert for a sum of four million HUF.
According to the accused act, the manager of the Collab Kft company was engaged to issue false facture by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
Similarly, the Biogate Kft company, which is currently under liquidation and was employed in 2003, issued factures to the Jobb Jövæért Alapitvány Foundation, Atlasz Egyesület association and Vörosfenyś Egyesület, for a amount of approximately five million HUF, but after which no benefit has been effectively provided.
There was no financial movement, not yet, since the emission accounts were then cancelled, but it did not prevent the organizations of mentioning it in their accountability.
The following category of facturing companies is the of the companies directly related to the accused.
Thus, the Administrative Delegation of the Director-General of the Delta Trio Kft company, employing carburant and car vehicle trade, whose social seat was in Budapest, but where it was not found there, was Iván Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued a number of factors on the sale of computer equipment for about 18 million HUF.
According to the investigation, these equipment would have been purchased by the Cash Investment Kft Company of Kiskunhalas, which was in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of the company was a Roman man, which Iván Kubatov had also made documentation with regard to the society between 2002 and 2005.
According to what we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation he issued factures to the order of the Atlasz, Hopaá and Egyptian companies at Harmadik Evezredert Alapítvayny, and that he supported their anti-value.
This is precisely the request by Iván Kubatov that Roman shops have created the Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, no of these companies did not work, as the accused explained by the fact that they did not receive work.
He even serves from these companies, because at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, accused as well as editor of corporation acts, he established factures to their names, to the order of associations relating to Zuppo, such as Atlasz and Y-Generacio associations.
Kubatov gave a total of 15 factories, issued by Cash Investment companies, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of 14.2 million HUF.
The parquet thought that 10% of the expenditure shown on accounts, as well as TVA were going to Kubatov's pocket.
The man even used the Szi-Beri company to establish fixed factures that have been used in the framework of the Biztos Pont' subsidiary application.
In January 2006, the Y-Generation Association and Szövetség to Modern Magyarországert introduced a subvention application to the Socialist Party's public utility body, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They obtained this subsidy for a double amount of 500,000 HUF, but these amounts have not been used for the objectives set out in the request.
To avoid that it does not know, five fixed factures received from the Works Team Kft company were submitted to the TMA.
Furthermore, these factures were found during the investigation carried out in the office of Ampalad Kemecsei, the Ministry of Education.
When hearing, a part of the accused will report the facture manufacturing method, as it had already done before the park previously.
What could really be interesting would be that the principal accused, Yanos Zuccio itself, decides to bring the wave over the whole story.
Until now, his grandfathers are not very detailed, and even though he had promised several times to tell the less details, he has not yet done it.
The question is whether it's in his interest, or then, the socialists would then conclude an agreement that would, in exchange of a large part of the fifty million HUF, Zusi would take the head alone.
Today, this last is probably seen, since the requests for his supervised residence, on the basis of a pleasing of his detention conditions, are constantly falling in the ear of a slaughter.
While those who have caused more important damages, and the authors of unreparable economic crimes are free or at least awaiting their own household to the end of the procedure.
Psychiatology: Why are more money expenditure?
When purchaser sales, purchasers tend to cost more, and to supervise the goods.
Neurological and economic researchers at the University of New York have succeeded to update the neurological and economic bases of this known and apparently irrational behaviour.
According to their study published in Science magazine, human beings do not want to be distanced at this type of competition, such as sells on eBay, and therefore they prefer even paying a too high price.
These research tried to generate a neurological scheme of this kind of " game" through sales in experimental sellers.
One of the voluntary groups played at the loto, while the other group took part in the sale of ludical shops, while using an functional magnetic resonance process (IRMf) researchers analyzed the active cerebral areas of experimental subjects.
In the two games, participants could win the money, but during the sale of the sellers whose essential element is the overwhelming of a third, the whole of which was found under the cerebral tronk called striatum was in intensive movement during the loss of the part.
This part of the brain, along with several other functions, plays a role in the "auto-stimulation" mechanism of the nervous system.
This is why, according to the researchers, the price mount is explained with the fleet before the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theories, the economic members of this group of researchers continued financial oversight analysis.
In those groups, three groups were overwhelmed against a partner in different circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the real value of the product concerned and thus carried out.
To another group, they promised that if they go out of the part, they would receive $15 additional in reward.
While the third group had received the $15 before the sellers, but the members of the group also lost the money, where they lost their sellers.
The difference between these two groups is, in fact, that the accent was put at one on the victory, while and at the other, on failure.
Thus the neurologs hypothesis, the players' team members were available to higher shifts than those carried out by the control group and the "for the victory".
"The results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
Indeed, each of them did not explain the phenomenon found when sales in shops only through the joy of winning and parade before the risk.
Only the neurological image methods helped to remove the contradiction between the two theories in discussion now on a third explanation."—Worw Andrew Schotter, professor of the University of New York Economic Sciences.
Hepatitis: When should we consult a doctor?
In the world, about a half billion people suffer chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, chronic illness is mentioned among the first causes of death.
1000,000 patients are estimated to have hepatitis virus in Hungary, but only seven thousands follow a treatment. This is the fact that sicknesses often don't know that they are portators of the virus.
Hepatitis name is a generic name given to infections touching the heavy and caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Fee inflamation and jaunsia are characteristic, but pathogenes and genital diseases differ between ones of the other.
Hepatitis viruses, according to pathogenic genes, are mainly offered under two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tube (e.g., food or water contained), hepatitis B, C, D and other organic viruses (sperme, vaginal secreation, salve).
For travellers, it is in any way recommended to vaccine against virus A and B. There is no vaccine against C.
The symptoms of Hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after the consumption of contaminated food, generally accompanied by a bad general state, weakness, stomach and nausea.
Then it is developed on the skin and white of the eye, a visible jaunce, the sleeves become more clear and the skin takes a thicker color. The curation can take two to three weeks.
Over the world, each year, a million people die in the most serious form of this pathology, such as cancer or hepatitis B cirrhosis.
The main cause is that, according to estimations, only one sick sick disease receives medical treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have serious consequences: if it is not treated, it may lead to surgical or heavy cancer.
Most diseases do not know about virus, because pathogenic gene destructs the heavy cells. In many cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular detection tests.
The contamination is much higher than the average population of three groups: persons who have suffered blood transfusion before 1991, drug consumers and tattoois.
Currently, there are 200 million diseases reached by a chronic type C hepatitis in the world.
Since illness can be detected by a laboratory routine review, it is advised to consult his doctor from the observation of unknown origin symptoms.
The disease can be generous, if it is timely detected. Virus can be eliminated from the body, so the risk of contagion is disappeared and cancer development is prevented.
30 September is the world day of hepatitis, organized for the first time in 2004 by the representatives of the four world's sicks.
Its aim is to address the attention of chronic heat surgery, caused by virus, the causes of its development and the importance of the precoce diagnosis of disease.
Who believes in God is less pain?
According to the results of recent research, religious faith would work as a kind of analysis, which would already help to make the death of the Catholic martyrs more sustainable.
The British newspaper Telegraph published a article that the researchers of the University of Oxford have performed an interesting experience in analyzing at what level the faith in God could affect to the pain of human being.
In the context of this experience, at least weird, 12 Catholic believers and so many victims were subjected to electronics, while each of them observed a painting representing the Vierge Marie.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude a large part of suffering.
Through a human brain palpation technique, Catholics were also able to activate the part of their brain responsible for the cure regulation.
This analysis is the first of a series of experiences, including academics, scientists, philosophers and theologists from different university sectors.
More specifically, the experience is carried out in the following way: an instrument that issues editing electrics is set on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experience to look supported by two paintings, one as the Vierge Marie pending by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady of Leonard of Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers on the origin of this experience hoped that the view of the Vierge Mary was a kind of faith among the believers, while the choice of the painting of Da Vinci, not very different than the first, was on its calm effect.
Experimental subjects occurred a half hour in an IRM scanner, and during that period 20 electronics in four parts were received, while considering the painting of religious theme, or the most general theme.
The Catholics said that at the view of the Vierge Mary, they felt as "in security," as someone who was "regarded" and "called, and peace has envasied them".
In view of the painting of religious thematics, they took account of 12% of pain than when they looked at Leonard's work.
The psychologue Miguel Farias, who himself has taken part in the experience, thinks that the same effects can be achieved with any other strong images, in the athletes, provided to find the appropriate photo.
"We should find a face with which they react very positively, such as a mother or father," said the psychologist.
Tom Wright, the English edition, welcomed the results of these research.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases, effectively change our personality," added Wright.
After these excellent results, there is no longer the question of knowing what would be the effect on the control of the pain of the subjects if the believers are shown a Madone painted by Leonard or a painting of the same calibre?
Does the view of a Vierge Mary's best quality cause better results?
You're what you're talking about you.
On the occasion of his tenth anniversary, Google claims that we can find it on the back of the pocket as the heavens above their head. He knows where they pass their holidays, what specialists they consult and what are their interest centres.
However, this is not enough, According to Eric Schmidt, which is one of the influenced people of society.
While in respect of sceptics establishing a parallel with Olwell's horrible vision, these do not just see the essential web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt said, there's little time in the Financial Times that the main environment of Google is to gather more information on its users. This is necessary for Google's founders to meet their initial goal that played as follows: "Please in a system all the information of the world!".
According to Google's leader, after ten years of a global channel work, they are only the beginning of their objectives to treat all the information.
To the question: what would it be in five years? Schmidt answered that he would like Google to answer questions like "What can I do tomorrow?" or "What is the work that would be the best?". However, the software will not answer this kind of question, simply first view, that the day when they get enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear for all interfaces that the words used during Internet research, the IP address of the computer that launchs the search and pages later consulted by interested persons are specifically repertoired.
By means of the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own research history and consult what they have been looking for, on which they have clicked. Thanks to this, long-term, recommendations, program based on the same logic, will be able to give more personalised answers, and will provide us products and services on the basis of our previous statements and our registered preferences.
What's happening if someone serves my data against me, if he looks at what my job is? they ask users, who are worried about seeing the monopole of Google information.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by the society that can sustain fear, and it is not the retreat, the fear of punishment, the desire of freedom, or, eventually, the revolt against the power that can sustain in international people.
However, it is confirmed that the search terms are not only registered but, in cases justified, they are transmitted to a third, and in such a legal case, nothing protects international personnel rights.
The most refusal example of these last days is probably the action coordinated against Brazilian pedophiles, in which Google has transmitted to the Government of Brazil the information he had collected on the public page called Orcus, which allows a identification.
The concerning internationals of the rights of the person have been able to submit a suspicion in May, when Google, above arms with the EFF electronic legal protection body, proved its right to the court towards the FBI. According to the judgment made in the future, Google will not always be obliged by any of the points of the Constitution to disseminate information on the secret request of the FBI.
(In the same time, the federal government has successfully obtained some 50,000 website addresses and 1,000 search terms he had reported in relation to the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, voted several years ago. But at the end of the end, he has not been able to offer lists of private users' research, nor the full list of the websites and the closed words of the last two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore sufficiently contradicting: it is struck by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they believe that their intime sphere and their private domain suffer when they start using Google services. Therefore, they attack them in the spirit of revolt that they are manifested against the fierce multinational society of their conservatory image.
During this time, American Geek culture and its "sauvageons" together with the passionates, activists and enthusiastic users of the computer that appear in many countries are seeing in Google the next generation of large enterprises, the "fashioned corporation", by opposition to the rival, Microsoft, catalogued as an invader of the world because of Windows, and that, even if all of them are fighting for the same purpose.
This may be explained by the fact that Google, instead of Microsoft, does not ask his users of identification code, do not demand money for its applications. The documentary code and the program package, continuously refreshing, has a much more accessible effect, younger and cooler effect, faced with the practice of the official software genital.
The reason may also be that geeks are very precisely seeing the problematic relationship between the rights of the person and the Internet, and that the website 2.0, the most proclaimed word is just behind him.
Indeed, the web 2.0 does not matter anything else than cooperation, but the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and that we need communication channels that have been made available, and while the size of those changed one by one, the essential remains the same: it is exposed.
A young man can generally hold a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and it can even connect them to other performances, such as Twinter, or last.fm, to list his musical habits. Then he can link them to a follow-up system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also hold blogs, where they are automatically their most recent photo galleries that they store on Flickr or Picasa.
While we can know many examples, such as that of the little friends that easily include the view of the photos of the morning, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom his unfaithful friend pass the evening, or the company who licensed one of his employees, nothing just for the sincere opinions he wrote on his blog on the top management, it can be on one thing: the private life term is completely to reconside today.
Whoever lives online life is constituted of what he himself shows, and that's how it can be defined the principle behind the behavior of young people today.
This wants to hide something, or at least, to try to switch the Google monopole, can (for example, starting with Screen, using the Google search system, but at the same time, not intentionally leaveing any tracks).
The number of people who, delegately, do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them, it is not less. The online Google Services, through text treatment to image treatment, can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not raised to large server parks and who do not assemble our best profile, which existed until this day.
The public opinion expects, without really hiding it, the moment when Google will declare its real nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is more than IBM (140 billion), Intel (124 billion) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars). AdWords/AdSense advertising areas threaten the number of advertising agencies, while the benefits introduced to a more significant speed of migration are present not only in Microsoft but also in many other informal programmes creators.
The critical observers, however, find contradictions with concerns: for example, the top of the company has rejected, in its entirety, the protests of employees, after duplicating the price of the company mother and after the company have seen too unfortunately the multi-day reconstruction, and all of that seems to be deceived by the fact that in 2006, Google has been obtained before the Chinese government and after the terms of their agreement, the company detects all the results that have been obtained in the guest, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime.
According to one of the internal rules of society, new services are not announced only when they can be used. This is, that in the next months and years, they will move the world on new points. While some think that the project of scan and archive of books and magazines of Google takes so important dimensions that the society will be lowly faced with the United States Supreme Court, other trimble before its health system, because in that case, it can be built a complete medical benefit from our previous analysis results, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google sets a genetic database can give a good material first to the next generation of scientists. The Roman of the famous Cory Doctorow, written with half-tons orwellians, describes the future in which a man could be approached in an unexpected way than through Google's data.
Two minors helped to disappear the traces of Ozd's double murder
"The police called two minors to interrogate them in the case of the double murder of Ozd. According to suspicions, they helped to destroy the traces of crime." - said the door of the Commissioner Borsod's department.
Young people have recognised the facts that they have been rejected, and for now they are accused of compliance.
The two minors, who, according to the information of MTI (Télégraphic Agency of Hungary), are young girls, are free.
The murder compliance may involve a detention that can go up to 5 years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ozd, a young man of the age of 23 years of age, was placed in provisional detention, Sunday.
The chiefs of accused accused of him are multiple murder, committed with premeditation and interest.
During the investigation, he showed that the 23-year-old man had a large amount of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to resolve his debt, and that's why he's going to take his creditor, the last Monday, in a site of Ozd where he killed him, as well as the girl of that man, aged nine years old.
According to MIT information, the young man premedied his crime, the weapon with which he would make his discovered crimes on the places of crime is the evidence.
The police considers the weapons and circumstances of its use with specialists.
Varsovia's bourse makes a proposal for the purchase of Prague's bourse
The barrier of the values of Varsovia proposed two hundreds of euros, about five billion Czech Koreans, for the purchase of 100% of the Prag's value bounce package.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Values of Varsovia, confirmed this proposal that the Polandians did, despite previously, that Czechs excluded Varsovia's bourse from the circle of the new potential owners of Prague's bourse.
The cause of this exclusion is that Varsovia's bourse is in the hands of the State.
99 per cent of the actions are in the hands of the Poland State, which wants to separate more than 60 per cent of its actions in a few months of activity.
According to the Czech economic newspaper E15, the Poland's proposal represents the highest offer that has been done until now for the purchase of Prague's bourse.
According to the Czech press, the winter of Vienna, the Transatlantic Nasdaq, the Stock Exchange of New York, London and German Burse offered to this day.
Petr Koblic, director of Prague's bourgeois, declared last week that the Varsovie bourge would be the new owner at least good, and has not excluded the fact that this could cause the disappearance of Prague's bourse in the future.
The value of the Prague bourse is estimated between 5 and 10 billion Czech corones by market specialists.
Based on an agreement between shareholders, some 90% of the papers would be sold.
Prague's most important ownership is the Patricia Financing Bank, with about 25 per cent of participations, followed by 14.7 per cent of the Ceská Sporitelna bank and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 per cent.
The financial crisis of the European press view
In their comments on the mardi dedicated to the international financial crisis, aggressively updated, the newspapers of the European press have already been a "2nd September".
"The global financial disaster, it must be the American President" - accused of the daily Rome, the Republic. "The President has not even been able to block with his own part behind a law proposal, which was soon slow to take back to a desesperate situation..."
On the place of a new Pearl Harbour, as the Military Warren Buffett, it is better to talk about a second September.
A part of the Madrileen press see also the emitting leg in Washington.
According to the vision of the daily world, these are the lacks of the political direction of there, which brought the global economy to the escape.
The risk of the extinction of the American financial system is growing every day, and then the world will pay the strong price.
The Bush Plan was far away to be perfect, but after the vote of the Congress, a real threat, which Washington does not propose a political tool to treat the crisis.
World economy remains in the white, just at the time when capitalism history has been one of the largest transformations.
We cannot ignore the more long-term threat - emphasize Geneva's Day-Anzeiger.
Some states may still have a savings duty to their holding financial bodies, and thanks to the money of their contributors they can save them from the faillite.
Of course, if there are even more banks to be such domains, so no financial means, nor new improvings will be sufficient.
At a long time, we need the states of the European Union to make few cases of their national egoism and to focus on the control over the divided financial markets.
Only Monday, the fault financial institutions have received more than 100 billion euros - remembered the Vienna newspaper The Standard, which adds that the fears that European contributions also have to put the hand to the pocket, very deeply, in a similar way to the United States in order to remedy the crisis, become more realistic.
To this end, the EU has not really been busy with the crisis, which, as a tsunami, is partly through the old continent.
The "safeguarders" should not immediately mark hundreds billion euros, in contrast, if they would be judicial if it would be rational to touch the money of the taxpayers, with the aim of preventing more decades.
Intelligent car defeats the bourdon flight
What method would be better to develop technologies to avoid an obstacle, if this is not the appointment of an already existing obstacle detector in nature?
For instance, the one of the sheep.
In the surprising project at the CHATEC, held in Japan, the bourdonnants had given the strategic idea of starting to Nissan engineers to inspire them on the way they should design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini robot, a bio-inspirated auto-roboted control system, type BR23C, which has equipped qualitys of the balls, the final goal is to encourage the establishment of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
In his flights, each abel is its own space, of oval form, which actually looks like our safe protection machine - explained, at the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the research and development and technological public relations.
The face eyes of the skin plays a primary role, since it is able to see in all directions, in an angle of 300 degrees.
In order to imitate the functions of the faced eye, technicians discussed the idea of the laser telemeter.
This identifies the barriers in an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 meters before the BR23C, he evaluates the distances and sends a signal to the random microprocessor, which transforms it into evitation manufacture immediately.
The perception of the barrier is in a second fraction. Then, the mini-auto robot, imitating the movements of the ball, soon changes the direction of its wheels by turning out of a enough angle to avoid collision.
In contrast to all existing systems, this evitation work is completely instinctive.
"If it wasn't so, the mini auto robot could not react enoughly to avoid obstacles" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Labor and robotized car project.
It must react instinctively and instantly, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and internal cows of the protection cover, a cup where the collision is considered inevitable for now.
All this process must reflect what the skin is done to avoid the other skins.
The process must be launched in an eye cline.
On the opposite of balls, the difference may not go up to the top, to the low or in the diagonal, it may be only two sizes, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn.
Thus, instead of infinite combinations that have the sheets to avoid the other shells, in our case, only the rotative movement, the acceleration and the switch as handworks at the disposal of the mini auto robot
The BR23C uses polymer batteries that are lighter and which are more energy concentrations, which makes their life longer than in Lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, this is the instinct intelligent reaction that is primarily, not the treatment of data, and still less the ability to store.
This mechanism should be treated only a few signs in the second and react to those.
It is not necessary to store them and react with the intuitive logical based on the data of the previous manuscripts, so it does not use only a few twenty-octs of continued memory.
You don't need to remember a giga-byte capacity, nor mega-byte.
It's the first step towards the design of a technological service for immediate evasion. According to Nissan estimates, this system will enter into the seriesed cars in the coming decades.
Another application could be its integration in the GPS navigation system, so that it could lead the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on his way.
Even a name to the baby was given out of price
The written version of the Economic Safety Plan of $700 billion is ready to save suspicious credits from the banks and to use several times.
At first, half of this amount will be expendied.
Reuters announces that in new debates, which are extended until midday, Saturday, the local time of the coast, the leaders of the Congress have fallen agreements on existing disputes for days and days, around a total of $700 billion.
"We have done a serious step forward," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the United States Chamber of Representatives, as it is not only to put paper agreements.
The commitment, born from the plan, is supported by the two candidates to the Presidency, Barack Obama and John McCain.
The United States Secretariat in the Treasury, Henry Paulson, said by commenting on the results of the commitment that the programme will work and will be effective, but other measures must still be implemented.
The written version of the plan was made public prior to Asian markets, Tuesday night at 20:00 p.m. (i.e. Sunday at 2 p.m.) but did not cause spectacular quantity in the bourses.
Thursday, the Representative's room will be the first to vote on the law entitled to the Act on Emergency Economic Stabilisation of 2008, and then it will be among the Senate's hands.
On Saturday night, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, and then the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
"We are satisfied with the progress reached this night, and we strongly appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, the white house's port.
Furthermore, the programme differs from the initial proposal made by the Bush administration, which indicated that the $700 billion should be paid only for the purchase of duly credits.
Dorenvant, the maximum half of the total of 700 billion can be spent. The first 250 billion will be delivered immediately after the adoption of the law by the Congress, likely Monday. This first sum will serve the Secretariat to buy suspicion of banks, while the use of the $100 billion will be left to the President's discretion.
The programme will be monitored by an independent body in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The expenditure of the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new decree of the Congress.
In terms of the law, the Secretariat of the Treasury may establish a combinated strategy: it may at the same time purchase doubtful trusts, titles of suspicious hypothestics and other types of "toxics".
The officials of the Ministry said that the purchase may have been carried out in the framework of a sell, but also directly.
The rule provides the possibility to enterprises concerned, to take part in an insurance programme, where the Secretariat to the Trésor guarantees the worries tools, for which companies will pay an equivalent prize to the expected damage.
Henry Paulson said that the law provides the necessary tools to provide 700 billion dollars for the urgent needs of the financial system, that it is the wide recovery of suspicious credits, their insurance, or to avoid the risk of seeing the system involving an important financial institution.
"We will take the necessary provisions, to be ready to apply the law, as long as it is signed," he added.
Instead, bank leaders who are in bad posts and waiting for the State's assistance may expect that their departure compensations, called just parachuted for other Atlantics, will be refunded by the Government.
The payment platform is indicated only in precise cases. Furthermore, restrictions depend on the way the Deputy Secretariat proposes its aid to the company.
The principle of the schedule means that if the secretariat to the Treasury is acquired in the framework of a sell, they will provide more tax on the donor parachute, less than the President of discreditity is part of the retrait.
Directly after the purchase of doubtful credits, the Government will be aggressively intervention to ensure that the amount paid to leaders is not exceeded.
In order to be complete, the image must even add that existing donor parachutes are not changed. The platform is only related to new contracts, which is to motivate the participation in the plan.
It is the first time in the United States history that legal platforms will be in force on the appointments of general directors - commented by the President of the Commission on the financial performance of the Chamber of Members, the Democratic Barney Frank.
Furthermore, the State provides a right to purchase parts in banks which are part of the plan, so that the risk of contributions is reduced, as they can even be winned in the case as long as the economy and with the saved banks will return to their patents.
The draft legislation indicates that in the coming five years, the Chairman must introduce a proposal to the Congress on the way the losses will be returned to the contributions from the financial sector.
Of course, both sides were those who expressed their doubts in this regard.
This is not why American citizens have sent us, and this does not protect the dollars of the taxpayers - said the Republican Deputy in California, Darrell Issa.
His democratic colleague of Ohio, Mary Kaptur believes that these are the same that pressing the measures, as those responsible for the shoot of Wall Street.

The next year, will we still need visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz thinks there are good chances for the American and Hungary Convention of Visa Exemption in force on 12 January. This is what the Minister of Foreign Affairs declared in Chicago, before the leaders of the local Hungary community.
According to it, "now now, everything depends only on the moment in which additional Atlantic entry and electronic control systems will be in service."
On the occasion, she focused on the fact that in the new system there will not be an entry visa, but tourists will be registered before the start.
The Chief of Hungary diplomacy will be in negotiations from today in Washington.
He will meet the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Condolezza Rice, to which he will put the decoration of the Commander Cross with the Order of the Mediterranean of the Republic of Hungary, and will join the advisers in foreign policy of candidates to the Presidency, the Democrat Barack Obama and the Republic of John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support both the Bank Saving Plan
On Sunday, Barack Obama, as John McCain, the candidates at the Presidency of the two major American parties, have assured their support for the Government's relief plan of $700 billion, but there are politicians that require the demission of the American Secretariat to the Treasury.
After marathon negotiations that have longed days and days, the representatives at the Congress and the Administration finally announced, on Sunday, that they concluded principle agreements on the bank saving plan.
This financing plan, aimed at the deterioration of the Wall Street crisis and the paralysised credit market, was the central issue of the Presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even present themselves, each as a more suitable than the other, to lead the country outside the economic crisis.
According to the most recent reviews, Obama has succeeded again to advance. The advance of McCain, obtained by the appointment of Sarah Palin as a colleague just after the Republic of Convention, founded.
During a campaign meeting held in Detroit, Monday, Obama expressed his hope to see the Congress quickly voted the law on the saving plan of 700 billion.
He stressed that the proposal contains consumer protection passages that it also supports.
"There is now that, with responsibility (...) a danger threatens your work, your economy, all industrial sectors and the stability of the whole economy," he said before a lot of 35,000 people.
He did not miss the economic ideas of McAin overcome.
In an interview given to the ABC chain, McCain said: "We will all be bad to spend it (...) but don't do anything isn't possible."
The Republican Senator stated that in the proposal, the creation of a Treasury Control Committee and the platform of department compensations of senior leaders were mentioned and that it was personally very attached to these points.
Obama said to the CBS that McCain did not have a role in the negotiations while he was in contact with the Secretariat in the Treasury daily.
Nancy Pelosi, Chairman of the Representatives Chamber, declared Sunday that there are serious hopes that the room voted the law proposal since Monday.
The newspaper of the German language territory
The right camp is intact, it's just in the heart of the party that electioners have become more conscious - so the De Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in the Bavaro country.
Haider is ready to dominate Austria to prevent the coalition of red and black.
The spiegel (split.de)
In the Internet edition of the German left information magazine, Frank Walter analyzes the causes of the dramatic defect of the CSU in its article entitled "The Revolution in Baviera devokes his fathers".
According to this recognised polytolog, the CSU's erosion began well before the triste two Beckstein-Huber takes its functions.
Christian socialists have transformed Baviera for decades, and now these are the same modern citizens who turn to them.
This change of time is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and in fact also the Angela Merker.
For the CSU, the failure has not been completely a surprise, but the Sunday has arrived at the end of a process that was likely there just ten years ago: the insufficient hegemonie of the national party has been completed.
10 years ago, in 1998, the U.S.S. raised 47.7 per cent, which was the first time since the fifty-years, with a score below the 50 per cent level.
This has been repeated three years ago during the 2005 federal elections, i.e. at the time of the sworn Stoiber.
The cause may be made to modernize the "devoring of his parents" in the region as part of the CSU.
This makes sociologs 40 years announcing this but have been strongly wrong with the ritm. However, secularization, the results of the education and the establishment of the northern and the Eastern Germans in the Bavière region, in full development, couldn't remain in effect on the fidelity of CSU electors.
Modernization will be paid with the increased opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right camp is intact, it is only inside the party that the electioners have become more conscious, critical and more intense.
It is also surprising that during the past few weeks, it is just the groups of classic citizens who have been displaced from the U.S.A., such as independents, artisans, bag detentors and higher students.
In these groups, CSU support was lower than 40 per cent.
Press (depresse.com)
In its article, entitled "Who? With who?, the President of the Party stands on the reserve to the issues of coalition", the conservative Austrian daily concerns the situation of the confusionary internal policy which has been installed after the Austrian elections.
Austrian socialists of SPVO want to discuss with EVP conservators.
The ESC prohibited the SPU to spend on its internal affairs.
The popularist party BZÃ is open for negotiations. Greens do not still want to agree on coalition.
The elections have now turned around the coalition; at the debates organized at public television, the parties' leaders have to let their maps.
Werner Faymann, President of SPÖ, confirmed that he wanted to discuss with the AVP.
The SPUE wants to show that the cooperation of the two parties is effectively possible, and that is what already exists in certain regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current President of the AVP, as a vice-channel, remains open from the Faymann.
As he mentioned, Schüssel-Molterer's orientation was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of question.
Molterer reacted carefully to the red proposals.
As he has already said, a cooperation will certainly be infructuous if Faymann is trying to take place in the internal matters of the AVP.
In its part, the choice of the opposition or entry into the coalition is at the time an absolutely open issue.
Jörg Haider, Chairman of the BZÖ, reaffirms all proposals.
"To avoid the coalition of red and black, we are ready to take government responsibilities", said Haider.
Yaroka stated: The strict circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit for the Equality of Opportunities, whose host is France, was representative of the current Presidency of the European Union.
In his message expressed before the plenary assembly as one of the main doors of the expert consultation, Livia Yaroka, European Deputy Fidesz Popular Party of Europe, has touched the attention of the segregations in education, because it is a violation of the right that touchs the most Roman children, and in fact one of their main slights to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and on the other hand, by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equality.
Among those invited to take part in the consultation, European social partners, as well as the most important representatives of the European legal protection and civil organizations, in the field of equality of opportunities.
According to the Press Office of Mr Fidesz Popular Party, Yaroka predicted that the Romans are lost from the labour market, first after their low qualification.
"An overwhelming majority of young Romans does not have secondary diplomas, and because of a primary education of bad quality, only a poor part has the possibility of obtaining a higher education diploma."
Furthermore, Yaroka stressed the fact that education as the primary law of human being plays a key role when other fundamental rights are to be valid.
The early educational investment in Roman children means strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the Eurodeputy, there is a need to be aware of these reports in a largest circle possible, also between the Romans and the Non-Roms.
In fact, early a Roman child starts the school, he increases the opportunity to become a productive member of the labour market; by taxes paid from its income and consumption, it participates in the State budget.
"Under nationality of the European Union, the Romans must be assured of their right to quality education and be protected by a low quality and secondary education." - said Livia Yaroka.
According to the deputy, cooperation of the European Union towards a goal and action is necessary for immediate acceleration of the school desegregation process, and therefore, respect for existing and preparing anti-discrimination directives is a primary importance.
"The strict circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken. Democracy to Roman children must be given, so that they may participate as citizens of full right to the future of Europe" - said Yaroka.
On behalf of the "European Year for Equality of Challenges" assured for all, the goal of the Summit for Equality in Europe organized every year since the Summit in Berlin the last year is to ensure a single platform for supporting opportunities for the equality of opportunities and for combating discrimination, referred to at the European level and at the level of Member States.
CSU: Thanks for a transitional period
This is in October that it will be taken the decision on the type of two decade Huber-Beckstein
Despite this failure of election, heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the Bavaroese CSB sums has been broken.
The President of the Party, Erwin Hube and the Head of the Regional Government, Benether Beckstein, can still keep their place.
The type of tandem, who has lost a catastrophic voice of 17 percent, will be at the agenda of the session of the exceptional party, held on the last weekend of October.
The members of this very criticized couple, in any case, feel that they were not particularly in their seat.
Thanks to this, they were used to eliminate the furious members of the fraction and base, which a day after the "tsunami bavarois" were required personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
It's been five years ago - it's still true, under the direction of Edmund Staiber, at the top of his career - the Christian social unity returned 60.7 percent, while today, a year after the shock against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent of their strength remained.
For 46 years, the CSU was the "one sovereign" of the Baviera who gave 18% of the German GDP.
But the conservators are always strong in this South region, with a key importance for the Hungary economy, and will be bound to coalition in the future.
As one of the first signs of an internal reaming of the party, the Vice-President and the Federal Minister of Agricultural, Horst Seehofer, presented as the possible successor of Huber, also received a place in this modest recognition group, which initiated discussions with the GDP Liberals, as well as with the Free Electors, along the right values, about a possible coalition of the Munich Government.
A strange feet of destiny was that through the list of Free Electors, Gabriele Pauli, whose measurement against Struiber was able to put a powder of the two Huber-Beckstein, to then treat the very ambitious municipal political woman without household.
Now, CSU's leaders put all their energy to stabilize, in a way or in another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who has cut the firms into the collisions until now, will also receive an active role. The former Head of the regional government and former President of the CSU, appointed on 28 September as the most loving day of his political career.
Monday, Huber launched some acquired comments to the CDU. According to him, they would have been more worthy of support from the part of the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning for the DDC and Angela Merkel.
Following the Federal Tag elections, which will be held in September 2009, Merkel will be more lucky if they go back in a way or another, with a common force, the US, who played a significant role in the 2005 national success.
According to Merkel, it is difficult to catch its deception caused by the fasco, the loss of the CSU will not affect the large Berlin coalition in a negative manner.
However, it is relative because it will not be easy to manage the blessed CSU, and the crisis of the social-democratics is still hard.
Since 1946, SPD has reached its worst results with 18.6 per cent in Baviera.
Lukasenko - six lines : 110 - 0
No deputy of the opposition has accessed the Belarus Parliament after the Sunday elections.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by a country conducted by Alexandre Lukashenko, which ensures prosperity and stability, while, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained by illnesses made during the deployment of votes.
OSCE, who sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize elections.
While the legislative of 110 people in this country has been very well opposed for 10 million people since the last few decades, before the elections, the opposition joining its forces under the name of the Democratic Forces of the United Nations (ODSZ) would severely hope that Lukashenko, renewing his mandate of President for the fourth time of doubts, on the tracks of the change of the Constitution in 2006, would " allow" this time to be the presence of some Members of the parliamentary position.
In this way, ODSZ rejected its cocktail planned for origin.
The fact that Belarus, more economically depending on Russia, would like to improve its relationships with the EU, where, due to the qualified Belarus policy of anti-democratic, Lukashenko and several high-level politicians not receiving an entry visa, was one of the expectations of the opposition. Belarus has taken a credit due to the decreasing of Russian natural gas imports, and has also contributed to the transition of the Beltransgaz society, the owner of the gas drives through the country.
The fact that the OSCE, during the evaluation of the campaign, focused on positive changes instead of losses, such as the prohibition of presenting for a third of the opposition candidates, refers to a prerequisite cutting.
However, the OSCE Communicator had already responded to the campaign, in which the essential candidates to opposition could not appear in the media, and in particular the fact that opposition could not be presented when voted.
Despite all of this, opposition is also a positive improvement in the political regime: political detentors have found freedom, and Minsk is ready to small comparisons with Moscow, always refused to recognise the Southern Ocean and the separate Abaziya from Georgia. However, Russia with which Belarus forms a paper trust, considers the two independent Territories for a month.
"We did two steps forward, and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue was loved between Belarus and the EU," said Alexandre Milinkevitch in our newspaper.
According to the candidate to the opposition of the presidential elections of 2006, it is desirable that this remains so, although "the power has feared in this Parliament who has no weight, even to enter one opponent".
The opposition does not require protests in view of results, but is trying to make a message about the need for economic reforms to elect.
"We are certainly very concerned about this side: we must print our opposite newspapers in Russia, local authorities put us shocks in the wheels for dissemination, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting the elections, even in the circle of older persons," said Milinkevitch, referring to the fact that in the current system of Lukashenko, which considers social security as its main result, the custom of the more officially supported retreatment is not more appropriate.
"When the country's decline and the increase in trade deficit, the extinction of social security, "he calls the silence of a cemetery," is only a question of time" - is estimated Milinkevitch.
In contrast to the opposition policy, Russian observers have qualified democratic elections.
Serguei Lebedev, the leader of the Community of Independent States, declared to the Russian Press Agency Ria Novosti: "The people do not believe in words but in acts.". Thus, the absence of opposition is only the evidence of the maturity of Belarus electioners.
Brunetta: "When today, a little breakfast before the work."
Never, in the history of the Palais Chigi, we had no turning doors for the entry and out of the employees.
But since now, this new measure is in force against small males, against which it points and then goes to drink the coffee at the bar during work hours.
The new anti-faining anti-faining has been presented today by the Minister of Public Administration Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary-General of the Council's Presidency, Mauro Masi.
"Burnetta's tourning doors are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more presence and more services", says the Minister.
Now starts a new stage of responsibility and transparency.
"It's reformism" in addition to Brunetta.
The installation in all the establishments of the Council Presidency is complete with the Chigi Palais.
According to Masi, "the choice of the turning doors is even important from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance of the employees has been registered, safeguarding the Secretary-General: "This is a process shared by employees, and we had the cooperation of all."
In bread, more little dinner for work hours; more than coffee or growing.
Brunetta's promise, who suggests, "A good cappuccino at 7 a.m. morning is a excellent and sacred resolution."
During a conference at the Supplementary School of the Public Administration
in Rome, the minister communicates that "in three months the absence of public employees has reduced 50%, or 60 million workers more than one year".
And he adds that it is essential to make more effective, the Public Administration.
Italy, "in salary dynamics, the Minister explains that the last 8-10 years have doubled in relation to the private sector, and in addition to inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees joined to meet the standards of Brunetta Decree in Codacons.
"In the event that the Minister of Public Services today provides data on the decline of absentism on the workplace because of disease, writes the association of consumers - the people of active faining" continues to grow.
In fact, in Italy, thousands of employees of the Public and Productive Administration have been gathered to declare war against illegal standards contained in the decree.
In particular, the Tar is contested with the exclusion of additional departments in case of infirmity for service; the prolongation of the home-time time of the sick worker, during which control visits are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions provided by the Minister.
Injuries on the workplace, Napolitano: "Decisive Prevention"
Each day, in Italy, there are 2.500 work accidents, 3 deaths and 27 persons who remain invalid in a permanent manner.
In 2007, Inail data confirm that white deaths have been around 1,200.
Numbers that demonstrate the gravity of the phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death, and causes almost two times more death than the murderers.
To take attention to the institutions, social forces and information means about this dramatic aspect, the famous Emblem today, in all Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of the victims of work, institutionalized on October 2nd Sunday.
"The worried data issued by the Anmil, as well as the tragic events of these last days, confirm the importance of the subject of prevention on the place of work," said the President of the Republic, Jorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of Amil, the National Countries and Invalid Working Association, Peter Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses its sincere appreciation for continued associative efforts to prevent workplaces, protection of accidental workers, assistance to the families of victims and awareness of public opinion"
"Naturally disappointed, everyone has touched the poing to put an end to such tragédics that, by their dimension, suscit the media clamper and the participation of the public, even though the daily reality presents dramatic cases, even repeating in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide only "we're certainly there's a problem of resources: it's essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector take a very special importance for a more direct conscience from young people in the work world.
It is our duty to maintain the attention to this phenomenon, not under evaluation of the alarm on social gravity, apply and improve legislative standards.
On the other hand, the President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber stressed how much this phenomenon of white deaths is an absolute social emergency that endurs the conscience of each of us, and urges all institutions to make a concrete effort to put it rapidly."
The data of the accidents on the work seem to have a slight positive trend, but it does not prevent that the number of white deaths may even be impressive," emphasized the President of Amil Peter Mercandelli later.
"We don't want that this "tradition to the rabais" actually be translated in a less attention, because it is just when the attention is relaxed, which comes to the tragedy.
"We believe that in general, it is not enough to oppose the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be done by several actions."
"In our mind, Mercandelli stressed the need for more controls and inspections, as well as a more important intervention on the training of workers, and this is, since the school."
- He added - " that still need to make an effort in terms of communication and sensibilisation of public opinion.
"But especially, there is a greater sense of the responsibilities of employees towards a phenomenon which represents social emergency."
Mercandelli then declared "the progressive deterioration of the conditions of safeguarding of the immunity planned for the victims of the work" and the "assistence delay to which the system is oriented over the past few years".
"The goal therefore is to return to the employee to the insurance guarantee – has he added so that the destination of the person who has an accident must not depend on spontaneism or enlargement of the legislator"
MP3 driver pointed out the dog, they risk the audition.
Listen to the full volume music for a long period using portable musical devices like Mp3 readers can cause permanent lessons to hear.
This is what the European Commission announces, which, in a communication published in Brussels, quotes the view of the Scientific Committee on the unexpected and recently identified health risks (Csserri) of the EU.
"of this Scientific-Legislative Report states that 5-10% of those who, during a period of at least five years, listen to the full-speed music using portable music devices, for more than one hour per week and for week, risk permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I am worried that so many young people that use frequently portable musical devices and full-volume mobile phones can inconsistently hurt their hearing," said Meglena Kuneva.
" According to the scientific data, the responsible Ue is a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
The most important thing is to sensibilize consumers and to make such public information.
We need to review further, existing control systems in view of the scientific view, so that they are completely effective and can follow new technologies."
Brussels requested the Independent Scientific Committee to consider the problem, in view of the intensive use of the portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the brush.
" Scientifics concluded that there are good reasons to worry, and that the European Commission will now review with Member States and other interested parties what measures could be taken to better protect children and adolescents, against the exhibition of the smiling music and similar equipment.
There is already a European security standard that limits the sound level of 100Db musical devices, but the concern increases the auditive damage that could result from excessive exposure to such sound sources.
It is possible to limit these data using solutions such as the reduction of levels and the period of exposure to the sound.
The Scientific Committee notes that the users of portable musical devices, which listen to full volume music (more 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, exceed the current limits in force as regards the maximum authorised sound level on the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions during long-term periods risk a permanent loss of auditive capacity after 5 years.
This is interested in 5-10% of the users of these devices, and their number can be quantified to around 2,5 and 10 million people in the United States.
Rome, Germany ordered to leave the Commission for the future of the capital.
Today, we start in March, we'll end in June.
This is the calendar set by the Capitole for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capitale", which took place this morning at the new seat, behind the Charcalla Themes.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 components of the Commission will put into consideration the directives for Rome.
In March when they will be completed, the Committee and the Joint Council will evaluate the analysis and projects, in order to present in June, the Strategic Plan for Rome with the Official Head of Capitole and his Master Gianni German.
" The Commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas have been represented in the course of stressing Germany, and it must propose Roma's development ideas that could be used by political decisionyers, which remain the Committee and the Joint Council.
There is no supervision of roles, but only the will to have a coin where developing a great project for Rome.
In March, she will complete its tasks and will then disappear, since this experience must have a precise temporary period.
In June the Master will present the strategic plan of the work carried out by the Commission for the future of Rome Capitale. "
For those accused of being unnecessary, since their opinions will not be binding, Germany says: "All depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, as well as on the quality of its proposals.
If the quality there is, as in France by the Attali Commission, as in other words in Rome, it will be fundamental.
Too often the policy is accompanied by the management of daily and emergency that are at time.
We, on the contrary, want to see before, and far beyond, to a deepest perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future."
Moreover, the Master of Rome wishes to emphasize that "This Commission is not an unnecessary body or a bureaucratic assembly: it is absolutely free and will not cost an euro to Roman citizens, and will serve to study and to participate in the best intellectors expressed by the Capitale.
For Germany, in fact, "we need a strategic, firm or immobile cutting, to allow our city, to improve, what she absolutely needs, while thinking about its future now an unilateral spirit, ".
A future that, specifically the master of Rome, "not will be limited to common borders but that will look far" not only in the optic of the future Metropolitan city and its legal status, but also in terms of the role that Rome may and must have as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama, the first American President.
A famous American politician who wants to pass independence, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, by its decisions, destroyed the United States economy and was reports (for example, it has always been as private citizens today) with the Islamic enemy."
The attacks against Obama increase the date of elections.
A woman of Miami wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambition".
Obama is really covered: he believes he will win the highest function of a nation that is in all, two governments and five black senators!"
Indeed, it is an attack that does not say great things; it is obviously racial attacks, and they do not answer to the question of all electors: would it be a good President? We have also the reviews, which all say that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case, it's still someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain.
A journal from Mississipi, in the south of the United States, wrote a article: once in the vote chain, we know what the American patriote will vote.
This is a aspect of American mentality maintained secret until the end.
"That you want, we'll even see the cross on Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will go out of the United States.
Chooses that have never been revealed until now, as the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
Despite all these reasons, the winning card for democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: what were the errors made by Bush during his mandate? 89 percent responded: Iraq.
America changes.
In Vietnam, the nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was returned to her home to feet.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to make the arms.
Despite this, Iraq was mostly the Bush's weakness point.
Who will take the place of George W will have a great tache to do.
It is useful, the economic devaluation is even feeling at journalists: in the press, it's the time of removal. And many accused Internet, this "assault" of the newspaper.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by PEW Research Center on the status of their professional and mental control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists are today pessimist about their future.
However, they did not openly declare the information attachments, feeling less worried about the credibility.
They don't feel isolated as any time.
The problem of American journalists is money, money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a destroyed economic model crisis.
Furthermore, the eliminations in the newsroom, in the room where editors work at the newspaper assembly, are a great problem.
This is a problem that must be solved, according to interviewed journalists, if traditional journalism, such as the major public, is not decreased accordingly.
A clearer more complex pessimism invaded the American journalism.
Six of ten executive journalists and journalists of printing newspapers are convinced that journalism at the national level is in the way to follow a bad way.
Locally, the executive group is 65%.
Publication printed against broadcast.
Journalists don't worry to see where the web goes.
The largest editor houses are a web passage, made by many as "the killer" of the newspaper.
The "economic pressure" that journalists feel are increased to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists admitted to the technology that hopes that it "does something good" for their journalism.
Today, the largest accross in the American journalism between newsrooms, namely, directors and reporters who work for them.
56% of the directors at the national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level, this percentage falls to 23%.
For some, this is linked to the "security of the work".
Directors who think to lose their job post in the 3-year-old space are 47 per cent at the national level.
As regards journalists, we go to 30%.
The "safe work" at the staff level (no editors, ndr) in America is still at the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a large country like the Use, with 300 million people and thousands of journalists, journalists, newspapers, radio, television and Internet, employees often offer what they want, and this becomes a matter of taking or leave.
The directors are almost always receiving large payments, while the editor can win $100,000 per month, other than the retrait and payment of insurance.
With regard to holidays, the logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in all, a number of years.
But, according to their revelations, the American journalists are often "malades" during the year.
It's the mistake of the climate.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA RETE GROTTAFERRATATION.
The President of the Second Criminal Section of the Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the instance of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who asked to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a room in Rome.
Coppola is investigated for banking road under the Unipol-Bnl Scalade instruction.
In the case of his charge, the last week, he had obtained the transformed home freedom in obligatory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentilni and Gaetano Pecorella, asked that the real estate agent could visit the trail of the city of province to a house in the capital.
According to the Court, such movements (who the pm has not granted) would enable him to influence the company and have access to evidence that they have received.
Eleites in danger.
A few days ago, with the vote of the Representatives Chamber, the phenomenon was to be a $700 billion approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans was, and it is still more interesting to punish Wall Street than to save the American economy.
And it is well the New York Times that confirms us that the current crisis shares the Republican Party, even more shared between its old East Coast, moderate, favorable, federal institutions and community business, and its new soul, to the contrary, conservatory, hostile to " Washington" and the world of financing, particularly in the Central and Southern States.
The soul, just just, has been deeply feeling with the vote I talked to you at the beginning.
However, what comes to be quoted is only a example of changes, great changes that the economic earth's trauma is already predicting or letting it run: not only to the United States but to the whole West, and may not only be here.
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to make the phenomenon that has been covered for a few years, so that in the new climate they are solidarized and revealed.
The first of these phenomenon is the reactivation, the extraordinary relance, the double state-sovereign category, in relation to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of bank-financing institutions which, obviously, have close relationships with the foreign, but which, above all, are involved in a large scale, the balances of persons and families living in a single country.
This immediately creates a political problem for which he governs: how to respond to the difficulties and protests of persons and families that are also a electory.
In short, the crisis appears economically globally, but politically, it is almost national.
The political internationalization seems really out of the game or no, it is not a great thing to say: the obvious evidence is provided by the European Union that, shared as a customly, between the different interests and between the various national strategies is not possible to decide no common political line.
And so it is the government of each State who are waiting for interventions, savings and relaxing plans, new rules, and in particular a appropriation of credits: when a difficult period is over, there are only States who have economic resources, the mass of financial resources that can try to repay things in place.
They also have the necessary means and legislation for the use of them: two resources of an inexperienced value, elements of which no market or international organization will never be likely available.
This new emphasis on the state-nation crisis is in perfect harmonization with the increasing importance that the most recent economic developments of the economy tend to contribute to a sufficiently linked factor: territoriality.
. Paradoxally, while we were convinced that we were now in the Kingdom of the network, the more sophisticated technology, the non-material, convinced that globalized financing was now intended to dominate the world, we have been able to take account of one single, that our future should instead resolve its accounts with enough material things like water, collapses, oil.
things that may certainly be transported from one place to another of the earth, but are absolutely linked to a surrounded space to a territory.
So, who is sovereign, there are certainly more cards than those that are not, i.e., who have the lack of living in a place without oil, without oil and water.
I am now coming to the second newness, which, however, provides a fracture.
That said the Territories, State, Government, inevitablely said politically, and therefore the Leadership.
In this regard, economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
From a count, consciousness of the need for authorised leadership, the search of a person who knows that the situation is in hand.
On the other hand, a wage of discrete for existing leaderships, economic species that have revealed inadequate and full of shadow zones.
Furthermore, something more deeply, in a certain sense, even worried: a discrédit, a suffering, an image of inadequation, a sense of dislocation which tends to engage the whole class of directors in a growing number of Western countries.
This increases the conviction of different classes, before actions are the same ideas of social elites until now, their way to listen and to be, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to remain more foreign to the views of the majority.
In short, the request of leadership, in subterranean way, is a powerful and rational movement of delegations of the traditional leaders and political orders, which are expressed in the unpromised "revolted" elections or well, in the changes of collective humors of these recent times, from the conservative ascension in Bavière, at the disappearance of the worklists in Britain, to the rebellion of the American congressists against Bush (and it could not be possible to overcome the right in Italy).
It is impressioned that the traditional eleites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, their newspapers, their intellectual accurateness, their formats, would be someone, have still more difficulty, which does not give today understanding and therefore represent the deep clouds of Western society, and that the economic crisis strengthens, increased and potentially affects a deterioration.
In view of all this, speaking of a current "rebellion of masses" at the agenda, it seems clearly exaggerated.
But it's well said, to keep the large eyes open, it's not without reason.
The supercool to walk on the walls.
Turn the laws of gravity thanks to a super colle and, in the future, walk on the sides like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various American research centres, and today, a team of four institutions has almost succeeded.
With an adhesive measurement of 2.5 centimeters, researchers have succeeded to keep a body of 100 kg on a vertical park.
The American Science Journal published the discovery of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Acron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Lab.
The material, invented by the research team, is an evolution of those we know that uses a special carbon structure, called nano carbon tubes.
"The principle of the colle can be imagined as a series of tubes available as a pile of spaghetti." Explain Zhong Lin Wang from Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists have inspired the pattes of gecks, microscopical powders that allow the animal to ensure, a perfect adherent.
The tests carried out on various materials, such as the glass, the Teflon, and the drink paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the patents of these pieces, and at the same time, that "it's easy to get out of the paroi" explains Liming Dai, searching for the university's Engineering Engineering university.
MARCHER SUR MURS? – "This material could be used as temporary adhesive" adds Liming Day.
Can it be to walk on the paroes like Spiderman? Maybe it is, but researchers think of a very less fascinating use as the connection between the electronic devices, since nano carbon tubes are heat and electric path drivers.
Other applications could be related to air Engineering.
For now, no super heroes.
AUTRE RECHERCHEY- The University of Berkeley, California, also wants to search for a new adhesive.
In an article of the American Chemical Society, California researchers presented an adhesive form of microfibers such as hair, which pursuits powders during a surface movement to ensure perfect and permanent adherence.
Medicines: never with fruit juices.
Attention to the juice of pamplemousse, humans and bombs.
These drinks, especially consumed in the summer because disadvantaged and rich in vitamins, if associated with some vital medicines, increased the absorption or decrease according to the cases, their effectiveness, with even serious consequences for health.
David Nailey, Professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices, if associated with the infection of certain medicines; during the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he launched a new alarm: a drink of pamplemoussis, humans and pommes, to reduce the absorption of certain vital medicines, cancel their benefits and risks of patients' health.
Pamplemoussis juice has already been strongly criticized because retained responsible for increased the effects of some antiarthmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antistaminal and neurological drugs to toxic levels.
MEDICAMENTS ASQUE- It is the Italian Medicine Agency, which had given the new in a two-year-old information pillar, warning doctors and patients to not evaluate the risk resulting from this mix and to take attention to what it was given, if, for example, the Diazépam or the Methadone.
PAMPLEMOUSSE- According to the experts, even the juice of persons and pomme contains substances that inhibit medicines.
Longue is the list of active principles imposed by pamplemoussis and other juses.
The call by Michele Carruba, director of the Public University Pharmacology Department of Milan: "These are generally discovered are immediately signaled to the various national and international medicine agencies that will be needed to change the information notes of medicine.
It should always be read of the illustrative papers of the medicines we take and, if something is not clear, do not make it impressed, but clearly addressed to the doctor or to the pharmacien," stressed the experts to the Ansa Agency.
The Economy Nobel in Paul Krugman.
The Nobel price of the economy was allocated to the American Paul Krugman for his research on trade models and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a neo-Chinesian who teaches to the University of Princeton and is also a famous editor of New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most critical solutions in economic and foreign policy in Bush administration.
Some months after the attacks of September 2001, Krugman wrote in a New York Times article that the second event would have been more determined than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A prediction that disappeared from many polégics, which was reproved to the economist for years, but now exactly revealed.
"I am surprising and even a little shocked about the speed with which memories of scandals such as Enron or Worldcom's shooting have lost the attention of the public," said Krugman at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a 'economist of great value', but also a very aggressive distributor to style', especially critical to the overalls of Bush administration liberalism.
Open Office, this is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the OpenOffice.org.3.0 distribution, the open source of personal productivity which aims at touching users and users from the office home, public administration professionals, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following a work of prestigious work, a year by voluntary developers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package shows the public with several new news: welcome screens, and the interface revised and became less important to others, such as the born compatibility for the Mac OS X operative system, and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the last ISO standard version.
Open Office took particular attention to the interaction with the Office Suite 2007, and it is actually possible to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.doch, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Thus interesting, some specific functions to certain modules, such as that allows to reduce the sizes of PowerPoint presentations, for example, to send them via email, or to import PDF files into the graphic processing module, keep the original aspect of the page.
Always on this front, it is possible to create "hybride PDF" documents that combine the typical graphic of Adobe to the elements of a calculation sheet or text developer.
The cooperation between several people is an element that has made different improvements within the applications: in the calculation sheet, several users can interact, avoid change conflicts in the development of texts, as each collaborator is allocated to a comment color for a better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are even working to bring some OpenOffice functions on the web ( on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the next weeks they should have the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded to http://it.openoffice.org/download/0.0/download300.htmlet and adds to the English version that was found on the watch since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is as normally available for the Linux operational system.
On request, the installation cd can be sent to house or to work.
And if the theme of freeze can be a way to distribute it in houses, it is just in the business, that Open Office is the main challenge, which can already be taken into account on various projects carried out in the public administration and schools.
Without the realities offering a training, consultation and assistance service, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also be open to business perspectives.
Open Office is composed of five main modules: Writer, for Word equivalent scripture video; Calc, is the calculation sheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for the rival PowerPoint presentations;Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows to work on databases; finally Drwa is the graphic module.
Objective for 2008, reaching up to 5 million downloads, and considering that today almost 3 million and 600 million, it is likely to be exceededed by the new version.
Kohl is also positive, it is the fourth case of doping.
New case of positiveness at the last Tour of France: It's the Austrian team Gerolsteiner, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the best bridge.
It's the site of the newspaper The Team reports the new.
At 26 years, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist in Cera, the epoch of third generation, after the Italian Riccardo Riccö and Leonardo Piepoli, and the German Stefan Schumacher, also Gerolsteiner.
Blood analysis carried out on the tests of Kohl are part of the last few weeks, by Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry laboratorys.
If against analysis confirm the positiveness in Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place at the Tour and must be forced to wait for two years of elimination.
The news of the Kohl's position at the Epo of Third Generation, was confirmed by the Chief of the French antidoping Agency, Peter Bordry, who informed to the Association Press, has notified the positiveness to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian was placed on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, so that the maillot was the best flutterer.
INSTRUCTIONS: WHAT YORK TIMES WHAT THE ITALY?
Italy "as the countries of migrants recently transformed into a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with reticence.
This would turn the Beau country into a country of racists? This is what the New York Times was interested in giving a long article on the subject of racism in Italy, as well as the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, originating Burkina Faso, killed the last month in Milan, to steal a bicycle bottle.
In this case it is clear that New York Times defines the "North Paradoxe": Northern regions are both where the registers are registered more integration and more work", but also "the most strong anti-immigrated feeling of the country and the most important support to the North League"
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, NYT also refers to Milan, Parme, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno's intolerance episodes.
Not just.
Even the new legislation wanted by the Lega to shut up immigration and facilitate the eradication of citizens, it is mentioned as a evidence of climate change in Italy.
Tendence stressed by the Pope, as well as by the President of the Republic: "Georgio Napolitano at his meeting with Benoît XVI in Quirinal, he asked that the State and the Church work together to win racism."
Travellers victims, up to 900 euros for a room.
The place market for students didn't know a crisis
According to Sunia's last survey, a simple room can cost a student, up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 to Florence, 650 to Naples, 600 to Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects in the exclusion of the entire groups of young people, of the right to study due to the very high global costs that source families must support - explaining the responsibility of the Sunia's study office, Laura Mariani, in these cities, the strong demand of students to the market was so deformed that a generalized increase process has been in love for the residents.
In most cases, location offers also include a number of violations: free type contracts, not registered, without limited loans, sub-locations.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions through fiscal reviews are needed to calm prices.
Reading details of the investigation, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brisa area, we need approximately 450 euros; for a simple room, we go to the minimum EUR 650 (Banco Negro area), at a average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) at a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria zone)
A Florence, a medium bed costs, EUR 350/400, a room around 700.
In Bologne, where students concentrate in nearby university areas, 250/280 euros are required for a double bed and from 370 to 500 for a simple room.
In the nearest areas of central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) there are about 600 euros for a simple bed, 450 for a double bed.
lower values (550 euros for a simple) for the nearby areas of other universities (Ostience and Science).
It can only be estimated if it is away in the device areas: EUR300 for a bed, and 450 for a simple in the Predestina area, Center or similar.
In Naples, for a bed, there are 300/400 euros for a simple, 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
Bari, for bed, must be EUR 250/350, at least 350 for a simple.
In smaller cities, prices are absolutely lower, but they have a major importance in the quoted economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, in which local locations are often taken by extra-Community students, are registered an anonymized later: foreign students, the loan requested is 25/30% increased in comparison with the application of Italians.
Together old Paradise cinema, the cities elect the historical rooms.
The historical cinema rooms are closed to multiplex.
"A city without cinema rooms is a green city, it's like a face without eyes."
The image offered by the puter in the Joseph Tornator scene, illustrates well what happens in the large cities of Italy, but also in the cities of province,
The cinema marginalization process, with the birth in the periphere of large multisalles, and the death of monosal consumption in the central areas of the cities, is one of the major events that appear to us inelectable and inconsistent; in addition, it has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
Unexpectedly, these are often historical and memory places, "It's like one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we shared a path and so many emotions," observes the metor in the New cinema Paradise, which offers to Tornator the first Oscar and the Great Prize of the Jews of Cannes, and who told the poetry of a province room, and the nostalgia of a way to live the cinema, can be lost forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of commercialists, want to say all this: in the past five years, 316 traditional cinema closed, and these are the chambers of the main cities that were especially paid the costs: 10 less than Florence, 9 to Milan, Naples, Bologne and Rome, 6 at least to Turin, 5 to Palerme.
The Roman Emilie is headed by 82 lost mono cinemas, followed by Toscane (44) and Lombardia (41).
The evidence that confirms that the first responsibilities of their disappearance is the development of multix, since these are the three Italian regions that have registered the most new multisalal cinemas: 195 screens in Lombardia in the past five years, 81 in Toscana as well as Emilie-Romagne.
"Italian exploitation has developed irrationally," observes Paul Protti, President of Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but it should also ensure the survival of those already existing, because when a close room in a city, these frequencies are not fastly ready to go to multiples.
Notwithstanding the lack of delegation for traders: the previous debt of the State is about 10 million euros.
It is honourable that, at a point of view, the Government does not respect the existing laws.
In order to support the sector, there would be EUR 16 to 18 million per year.
Let us note the case of Bologne, the first Italian city that, worried about these closures, decided to solve the situation through the signing of a protocol between Mayori and Anec, the first of that kind in Italy, to defend and promote the monos of the historical and peripheral centres.
Among the prescribed rules, there are measures for tax facilitations for manufacturers and benefits for the public at the end of mobility: spectrums will be able to enter the limited circulation area and will have special tariffs for stations and in certain parkings.
"It's a initiative that pleases me", observes Joseph Tornator, "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologne in place of other measures.
However, it is obvious that, to oppose the super power of multiples, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, as the public is now more demanding.
The defense of the traditional cinema is a theme that was always important for me: the closure of the supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the one that convinced me to do "New Paradise cinema" which I thought for 10 years.
I live in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk before the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via National, now closed, where I lived so much shared emotions, I turn into the other coast to not see the sweet panks through the powder.
Connection between policy and ‘related’, Master of Gioia Tauro.
“The master of Gioia Tauro was prepared to harmonize the choice of the Mayor to the interests of the Piromalli clan”.
The magistrates of the Calabre Antimafia Directorate, against the Master and Vice-Master of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and Rosarno Carlo Martelli's Master, arrested this morning for external concours for mafious association.
The handets also for Joacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his little lawyer, boss homonym, already condemned for the association of mafious type wickers, as well as paying 10 million euros.
"a face against legal and moral regulations, and especially the right sense" writes the advisers, the two local administrations expressed the will of paying consultations to Master Piromalli.
"As it had been granted to the clan-written-writing the judges- to be officially entered within the chairs, facilitating the possibilities, already substantive, control, and orientation of the public administration."
The Chairman of the Regional Committee Agazio Loiero does not hide only "collections between local committees and organized crime, there are more than one" in its region: "They have places where mafious intensity is stronger than in other, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist to the pressures of the ringheta, the heroes who are honest"
The arrests of this morning follow those of July last, following which the police announced the Piromalli clan.
Since the end of April last, the Joia Tauro Joia's Joia Tauro Joia has been discharged; in 1991, and in the case of presumed conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians were discharged from their function to administration the Ville.
Jorgio Dal Torrione, the UDC Master at the time of the dilution, was appointed a head of the right centre coalition, after the May 2006 ballot.
It creates the scandale when the preference orders the dissolution of the common council.
He accused the Vice-Minister at the time, Marco Minniti, the accused of handling it all for a political issue, but since the request for incarceration signed this morning, the judges explained that the Clan Piromalli had even succeeded to request the variation of the A3 project.
With the ordered interceptions against Dal Torrione, the pm writes, "the availability to marry the requirements of a businessman, representing a more known group, near the Piromallli, uniformized the choice of public administration for the interests of the clan.
When energy is born vagues, the big ones now start .
This is a democracy that is more than 70% of the surface of the planet and now the large world energy companies are discovering it.
Vagues, current, marges, here are the new renewable sources on which collapses like Chevron have put the eyes, and now they try to put it on.
The possibility of obtaining energy from marine movements has been studied for hundreds of years, and in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has been intensified.
When the price of the low oil price, until 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put on the side, but now the ecological institutions and the new increase of oil give a great shore to the sector.
London's World Energy Council (WEC) estimated in 2007 that 15 per cent of the global electricity needs could be covered by marine oil systems.
This amount would be the double of that which produces nuclear centrals.
And moreover, there would be skills and marchs..
Colosses at the attack.
The first undertaking on marine energy was Enersis, which was in 2005, signed an agreement to build an installation in the northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, we would have said a real revolutionary step.
For two years, even more candidates among those enterprises who have always been intended for traditional energy are on marine energy.
"Chevron is currently studying the ocean energy technology, and he declared the door of a company associated with the American oil colosis, at the Wall Street Journal economic newspaper, and she evaluates the possibilities of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question relates to the obtaining a permission delegated by the American Energy Commission, necessary to provide a project for the use of marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially if it is considered just in Alaska, the use of the oil continues to be extracted, and recently President Bush has established a project for new scavations.
In addition to Chevron, there is Verdant Power Inc. From New York and the Ocean Power of New Jersey, which spends on the way of the energy coming from the sea, and they are invested until now, although their details are not known, indicated by observers, a growing interest.
Technology to set up.
Experts speak of a technology still to its beginning, in addition to the fact that marine energy does not dismiss the fears of ecological impact.
At present, the systems like Portugal, or some in Scotia, are small, and they do not seem to create a great problem with the ecosystem.
However, in order to produce a large scale of energy, technologies must be used with higher ecological impact.
" And choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a bottle system connected to each other.
The powder of the vagues, which makes the bottles move to the top and down, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of pistons and cylinders inside the fleeters.
The pressure makes it turning a turbine that is on its tour, food a generator.
Energy is sent to the river through marine cables.
For now, we have four systems of this type in project phase, in waiting for an federal approval and a part of energy could serve to a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, has already produced energy for a commercial center and a parking using six turbines under the Eastern River of New York.
The water movement during the sea, turns the turbines, creates a rotative movement that produces a generator.
Verdund announced a long list of customers waiting for the authorisations required for energy power.
After the vagues, the shoes.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for Electrical Research, which is now entitled to the potential of marges.
Although it is an intermitting phenomenon, the sea is more predictable than wind, sun or vagues, and therefore more reliable as energy source.
And it's just about merger energy that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, with other coasts, invested $7 million in 2008 and prescribed investments up to 35 million in 2009.
