Inflation in Europe has declined on food
The accelerated inflation measured in the euro area is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
In November, the increase in prices in the 13 countries of the euro area was more important in comparison with the previsions, after a inflation rate of 2,6 per cent in October, a annual inflation of 3,1 per cent was registered, reported the office of the European Community statistics situated in Luxembourg.
Official previsions indicated only 3 per cent, reported by Bloomberg.
In contrast with the United States Central Banks, British and Canada, the European Central Bank (BCE) did not reduce the direct interest rate, saying that the reduction of interests, with the growth of primary materials and the decline of the unemployment rate, would lead to the generation of a spiral inflationist.
The ECB would wish to maintain the inflation rate below but nearly 2 per cent.
According to an analyst, it is Catch 22 for the ECB: "It must be dissuaded" inflation to have no longer to intervene on this subject.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3,3 per cent is a record in these last twelve years and in Spain, it is deleted from 3,6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has decreased due to the rapid increase of food and energy prices.
The term market rates of cereals increased 88 per cent and the soja rate also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and milk products also has significantly increased in 2007.
This year, the global oil price increased by 52 per cent, and the last month, a black gold bar costs almost $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008 the inflation rate will pass from 2.1 per cent in 2008, this year, to 2.5 per cent, but in 2009, it will slow up to 1.9.
According to analysts, the inflation rate of 12 months remains around 3 per cent, however, the next 3 to 4 months, the average annual rate of 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, they expected that the ECB reduces the management rate twice in 2008.
Gallup indicates a government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of young democratic parties in Fidesz has significantly increased in the beginning of December 2002. Thus, since 2002, it has now a larger number of partys, while Gallup (Ensight Institute) has never found such a low socialist support, namely 13 percent.
For faithful electioners, the difference would be, due to the largest determination of opposition electioners, a support of more than two thirds (71 per cent) against the support of a fifth (20 per cent) for the MSZP (Hungary Socialist Party).
According to the survey, the MDF (Hungary Democrats Forum) and SZDSZ (Free Democrats Alliance) are below the parliamentary level: their support is two percent in the whole population.
On the faithful electors some to vote, the number of parties of the two parties increased by 1 per cent.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate in comparison with the lowest point, the proportion of those who believed that the economic situation of the country was particularly seriously not so high, there is 41 per cent and 46 per cent of the situation is sufficiently serious.
After the most optimistic perspectives of the spring and last summer, families are again pessimish about their financial situation.
For the next year, the majority of the population is expected to increase, and only a tenth is expected to improve the situation.
In December last, 71 per cent of the investigated persons, namely a majority never seen in previous Gallup surveys, found that the first minister had done its work instead of good.
13 per cent of the sons trusted or lots of trust in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 per cent supports Victor Orban.
54 per cent does not make any confidence in the Prime Minister and 27 per cent to the President of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the political situation is the proportion of society who think that the unconsciousness against the first minister can be treated without change of government.
While according to the last October emissions, 35 per cent of the sons wished that the Government and the Prime Minister remain in function, this rate is only 20 per cent, and the relative majority (33 per cent) estimates that the holding of new elections would be the solution to this situation.
In the issue of the vote intended, 60 per cent of the sons respond that they will certainly vote and 20 per cent of the supplementary claim that they will probably vote.
In order to compare, for a "legislative election next Sunday", only 55% of the sons would be involved, and 15% would likely be involved. In accordance with the current intentions, the result of the referendum would not be doubtful.
74 per cent of the people were not to register rights in higher education, 79 per cent would not be the consultation costs, and 84 per cent would not say to the hospital residence costs.
When we consider only the same proportions among those who have expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, respectively 81, 84 and 89 per cent of voters would reject the introduction of registration rights, consultation costs and stay costs in the hospital.
Also the cheapest Tesco has increased its prices near to 20 percent
The hypermarks imposed in the commercial triangle of Budaors maintained the average increase of prices of 16 per cent of the last year to the difference that the rate of TVA has not increased this year.
Article of Napi Gazdaság (day economy)
This year, in the commercial triangle of Budaörs, the Daily Christmas Carier also increased by 16 per cent in average, there was a clearly higher value in all hypermarkets.
The prices, "what were already enrolled" in the large food stories in December last, have no longer increased brutally in comparison with the previous higher base.
However, consumers are obviously shocked to see that the items purchased clearly below nine thousand forecasts in the last year cost more than 10 thousand forecasts.
The daily carriage in sound hypermarks exceededed 91 forins at least the psychological level of ten thousand forecasts.
And the highest value of the carriage was 10,573 forens.
(In 2003, this value was 6 800 forecasts.)
The prices of the Unicum and of the Living Fishermen remained almost at the level of the last year, however, the prices of the dinner, nickel and pavot were strongly increased.
In the store, the price of famine and bread followed the data of the KSH (Center of Statistics Institute) but also, at the same time, 1 kg of bread was found only 139 forenses.
Competition has not decreased the price of the product below 200 forecasts.
It was surprising to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the bottle of two litres of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, therefore it was only 257 forrents of the designed and included bottle.
It prevents only this year, in terms of the daily Carier Carier, also the most cherished and the least cherished Cora.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of its daily carriage of 15 per cent while Tesco and also increased the prices of about 18 and 18 per cent.
By comparing the cherishest cart in the last year and the less cheerful carriage of this year, we find a distance of 12 per cent, while the difference between the less cost of the last year and the most precious of this year is 21 per cent.
Prices increased in average 1 480 forcings.
Last year, prices increased at average 1 206 forecasts, noting that the impact of increased TVA rates had already been observed in the Christmas prices of the last year.
This process made simplified trade, and hypermarkets could not be visiblely determined what margin to apply on products as they were impossible to prevent the impact of consumption price change.
(If a commerciant calculates badly the rotation of a product, it is risking to lose a great benefit on the margin adapted to trade intensity.)
In view of changes in TVA's rate, the price increase of the daily carriage has grown so too extensively that the cheapest carriage was more than 1,720 funds than the value of 2006, while the difference between the lesser carriers was only 844.
This year, the difference was not so excessive as the value of the carriage was more than 1,630 funds than that of the last year, and the prices of the less cost also increased 1 284 funds.
By approaching the two Christmas seasons, we found a catastrophic increase in prices, at least 20 months the prices of the daily consumption items increased by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not strongly confirm KSH data: for some first foods, the statistics institute has found an increase in prices of more than 30% in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, of fat and egg.)
According to the daily Care Care, this seems almost absurd because the price level of this product, which has already been careful in the last year, has increased by more than 10% in relation to the base.
According to the index, the providers employ a stronger position than egg suppliers because they have succeeded to accept the brutal increase of the prices also by multinationals.
In the commercial gold triangle, hypermarkers do not regret, they constantly register for good years.
According to our experience, most customers no longer look at the prices in the three visited hypermarkets.
They purchase everything in quantity, they take long conservation foods by palettes.
Mercredi's morning of the important ones were formed in the boxes of the three hypermarked, as the number of customers has grown slowly.
However, according to our information, the number of businesses is less important in the province, many multinationals are not even reaching the number of business, not only for food, but also for sustainable consumption articles.
Many hospitals make the economy on desinfects
This year, more than thousand infections, mostly caused by the incorrect use of antibiotics, were recorded in hospitals.
The hygienical conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the increase of medical personnel does not help to block infections, claim the doctor of the National Epidemiology Centre.
Many hospitals also make the economy on desinfects
A MRSA infection has not been diagnosed in the Yanos hospital's trauma service.
The resistant bacteria of antibiotics was detected on a hospitalized man after a serious accident.
The sick was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, similar infections occurred at the same place.
The wound of a serious car accident was out of the hospital but a few days after it returned to it because of an MRSA infection and, since, doctors couldn't make a significant operation because of the bacteria found in his body.
Until 10 December of this year, 1 094 hospital infections generated by a multi-resident pathogenic agent were declared in the National Nuocomal Monitoring System, Carolina Böröcz, Head of the National Epidemiology Centre.
Knowing that it is the number of infections caused by a multi-resistent pathogen agent who has been actually registered in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
About two thirds of the infected infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, otherwise, by the urine staphylococcus resistant to the methicilline-oxacilline.
A third of the people are the bacteria of the Staphylococcus areus (SA) in their nest without developing a disease.
Infections caused by SAs (such as angins, amygdalites, cutaned infections, traumatic infections) are well reacting to antibiotics, they are easily healable.
However, if antibiotics are used in excessive or inappropriate way, the bacteria, which reacts well to antibiotics, will develop a very resistant bacteria to antibiotics that will soon proliferate in the bad hospital conditions.
In the case of interim or prolonged immunity system, this bacteria may cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or sectycemia, age sickness, small weight or a pregnant body.
According to the doctor of Yanos Hospital, there is nothing special in MRSA infections, these infections are part of the hospital’s daily.
In particular, it is not necessary to confusion the infection with epidemia, no MRSA is found or is not searched for them, said Tibor Nyulasi.
SAs are antibiotics.
"The diseases are isolated, the careful staff put gangs in coutchouc and protective masks and we have adjusted antibiotics to cure them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Precedingly, hospitalized diseases are examined if they are MRSA's portators, but infection can not always be avoided.
The sampling of the sample is not in mode
The majority of infections caused by MRSA may be prevented but the current conditions and circumstances are not favourable in Hungary hospitals to prevent the development and proliferation of multi-resident pathogenic agents, Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection is particularly shown in hospitals and residents for older people, hospitals should control hospitalized diseases and immediately isolate MRSA diseases.
However, microbiological prelevation is not mode in Hungary hospitals.
It is necessary to know that the National Social Security Case does not finance these reviews.
The majority of the cases not only see the day when MRSA infection is detected on the disease, the physician head of the epidemiological centre declared.
The European Union has strict recommendations on the adapted use of antibiotics in human medicine, and there are also Hungarian guidelines for the curation of certain infections and syndromes.
The antibiotic therapy should be targeted, and otherwise, microbiological reviews should be conducted in order to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take into account.
The achievement of microbiological precautions is even more rare in ambulatory care and basic care, Karolina Böröcz reported.
Many hospitals make the economy on desinfects
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA proliferation of diseases to another most often through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to lay hands, put gangs and protective masks, but important lacunes are also detected in hospitals in this area.
MRSAs proliferated by infection transmitted by rublets inhalation and contact, but because of the conditions in Hungary Hospital, contaminated disease can not always be isolated.
Furthermore, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each of the other while in the term of epidemic, sicknesses should be removed from one of the other 1.5 meters at least.
Unfortunately, we also find that hospitals, in difficult financial situations, make economies on desinfectants, they lack nurses, sicknesses are many, so the risk of contamination is even greater, Carolina Böröcz stated.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures, the number of infections is less demonstrable or the proliferation of pathogeneous agent may be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection represents exorbiting expenditure for social security boxes, and this is why we are struggle with this infection.
In England, for example, the Government has established a programme to prevent or reduce the impact of MRSAs.
According to the data published, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Heart Prevention and Disease Centre (ECDC) is among its priorities to prevent multi-resident pathogeneous agents (such as MRSAs) and to prevent hospital infections caused by these pathogenic agents.
The Commissioner, author of a death accident, was not in the state of slaughter.
The official report on the death accident caused by the Commissioner of the 22th Arrangement was deleted.
It may be excluded that the Commissioner of the 22th rounding, the deputy of his position since, who has decreased a peetton by causeing his last Monday death, had led to the state of evil or shooting, has reported the sale of Attila Morvai, the port of the Headquarter of the Capital Ministry, after the relative constat was established.
The test confirmed the first result of the investigation that has already found that the former Commissioner had not consumed alcohol before the flight
Last Wednesday, the former Chief of the 22th Rounding Commissioner was a 55-year-old man who had faced him when he turned, with his personal car, in the Kossuth Lajos Street of 22th rounding. The man wanted to pass through the road by not passing by pietons.
(In addition, the fact that it passed the road outside the track for piettons is not an accurate circumstances, according to the road code, a car that loves a girl must leave the piettons.)
Pieton died after being transported to the hospital.
Following this accident, the Commissioner dismissed his post and requested the detention because, according to the police communication, this accident was a lot of struggle.
The investigation of this case is conducted by the Budapest Park.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former Commissioner co-operated the beginning with the judges to conduct the investigation.
EUR 400 million additional for infrastructure
Yanos Veres, Minister of Hungary Finance, and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (BEI), signed, on Thursday, three agreements of a total value of 400 million euros on a credit line in order to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure, and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (BEI) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for Hungarian budget funding for transport and environmental projects to be implemented from the Cohesion Fund, which has already been signed by the parties, and the signed contract refers to the use of the 200 million euros remaining.
The EUR 150 million credit agreement also applies to the funding of educational projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungarian, 150 million remaining to be used later, following the extension of the credit contract.
The parties signed a contract of 50 million euros for innovation. The state budget will first use this support in the framework of the research and development project to achieve the Debrecen University.
In the negotiations, the project of line 4 of the metro has also been discussed.
The parties agreed that they would rediscuss the possible amendment of the initial contract when Hungary had completed the details of the financing of metro with the EU.
According to Yanos Veres, this could be done at the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has granted a total of EUR 8.4 billion for the financing of 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants its credits according to the EURIBOR interest rate, with a period of eight years and without commitment committee.
Bulgaria, Paragraph of the EU real estate market
The evolution of the bulgar real estate market is spectacular, and the attention of Europe is turned into this country of the Balkans in the past.
What, or who has purchased on this EU market, which is always less cherished but who will become rapidly cherished?
Analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Today, in the immobilier, Bulgaria is inconsistently the most viable target of Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and its houses on the edge of the good market.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, at the edge of the sea, Albéna, the "Grod Sables", the former Sozopol and Nessebar, but more are looking for a building in the Kavarna and Balcik region.
According to Re/Max Bulgaria's analysts, soon or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also increase the interest of investors and are also more to buy in the Russian area.
Sofia, the capital, also offers attractive opportunities, trade surfaces and offices promise the highest standardisation rate.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive golf paradise in Europe and is thus a priority destination, after the summer season and winter season, also in the other two seasons of the year.
The most supervising investors have already purchased a larger number, for example in the Banksko round.
According to analysts, people buy a building in Bulgaria are looking at the same time to change their life, their life mode.
Most buyers are English but other arrive from France, Belgium, Spain and more than Romania.
Malta and Cypriot investors are also present. On the edge of the Black Sea and in the most reputed ski stations, we'll see traditionally a lot of Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, said Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who are able to purchase renewed buildings, a varied price between 50 and 100 000 euros, or old houses slaughtered, at a price from 5 to 15000 euros, which are then renewed.
The criteria are easy access and communication opportunities, nearby a large city, shops and generally that of the local doctor.
The second group includes secondary residence purchasers (on December last, Bulgaria is mentioned among the first 10 vacation destinations in Germany).
The third group is composed of commercial investors who purchase in hope to achieve a higher or long-term value.
The price of capital buildings increases without a stronger demand.
In the European Union, the real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the past five years they increased 21 per cent each year.
The increase of real estate prices is mainly exceeding payments.
Fodor and 6% Hungary
According to Gabor Fodor's communication, the Minister for Environment and Water, professional meetings have reached march, however, after official opening, the negotiations of Ministers on the international climate regime will continue after 2012.
The experts and political men from 192 world countries will discuss on the Bali road fleet, which is intended to define the efforts to be made after the Kyoto Protocol reduction period until 2012.
There are live discussions on this subject between developing countries and developed countries.
The United States also reported that, at the time, they did not want to discuss exact figures, but they were ready to sign a reduction agreement until 2020, gas emissions from 25 to 40 per cent in 1990.
Another important topic of the Conference is to see whether the developed countries are involved, except the emissions, to provide financial and technological assistance to countries that need it.
A agreement was also signed on aid to developing countries.
The Kyoto Protocol support fund will be managed by a administrative advisory of 16 members likely in the framework of the United Nations Global Environment Fund (GEF), reported Piac ees Profit (Market and Profit).
6 per cent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, confirms the EU's ambition to maintain the role of a friendly vessel in global efforts to protect the climate and to encourage the signature of the new international agreement before 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU was able to reduce its gas emissions from 20 per cent to the level reached in 1990, depending on the success of the signing of the Agreement after 2012, and was ready to reduce them up to 30 per cent if other large world regions and/or developing countries were also ready to take appropriate commitments to their responsibility and capacity.
Gabor Fodor recalled that in 1997, Kyoto's signatories countries had a total decrease of 5,2 per cent and all of the 15 EU members at the time had taken the commitment to at least 8 per cent.
Hungary has undertaken the commitment to reduce the expenditure of gas emissions of 6 per cent in relation to the period 1985-87, and our country will comply with its commitment, remindering the press communication of the Ministry of Environment.
The extent is great in Bali because the long-term international climate policy agreement should be implemented within two years, unless the entry into force of the Agreement would be certainly delayed after 2012. In this case, the commitments under the values provided for in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international system of emissions reducing, which was stressed in the new IPCC report, international scientific body, which obtained the Nobel Peace price of the United Nations, which is responsible for the care of climate change.
The reduction in emissions would be delayed and the average temperature of the Earth was more than 2 degrees of Celicio could not be avoided which, according to the scientists, would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
The British army recruits YouTube
The British Army units communicate, on the video share site, records carried out during its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to become popular.
First, it is the British Air Force (RAF) who has been on YouTube: the special units in Afghanistan and loaded video sequences on the operations carried out against the Taliban since March 2006, announced the BBC.
These registers, mounted by shipping miniature cameras, are controlled in the general district of the airline operations in Kandahar and then transferred to London or partners who load them on the Internet.
Political message is inconsistent
Airline soldiers have already been 139 sequences on the net by this way and their "chain" has been reviewed by over 75.000 people.
The British Defence Ministry was registered in the spring of 2007 and communicated videos on operations in Iraq and Africa while the Commonwealth Commonwealth Office and the international peacekeeping forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own YouTube chains.
Mission in Afghanistan
According to the initial objective of airline force, videos were carried out on the net to recruit. According to the Ministry of Defence, they also served to inform the real objectives of the presence of the army to the foreign.
The propaganda published by this way does not cost practically nothing in respect of ordinary recruitment advertisement advertising to television, which is communicated to the BBC Gordon Mackenzie, consulting in defence, and it is also inevitably a political message because it justifys in a special form the well-being of military operations decided by the Government.
Americans have played a game
The army is embarked because, unlike the well-composed videos, amazing videos have passed on the share site, which also presents the death of soldiers, for example, in the "official" propaganda films, a little hypocrite, officers do not avoid talking about losses but never present the bloody side of the fight.
Furthermore, many videos were already on the network with operations in Iraq and Afganistan, which were performed in real mission, but the British army has not paid for the load of these videos since now.
Americans make the recruitment a little different in serving a fusillade america's Army freely downloadable. In this game the player can put the soldiers directly in the context of a more or less real simulation.
Christmas tombs and births in the Ministrys
Monika Lamperth, Minister of Work, does not seem to be sensitive: instead of Christmas feasts, she will hold a year-end meeting with its collaborators who will be able to add in 2007 by taking births and coffee.
Another minister will organize a holiday with life music, another will engage the officials with a tombola and offer a drink to create a Christmas ambience.
Festival, Christmas ambience, concerts and buffet, so it diverted the power.
The public authorities also prepare Christmas.
This year, the largest Christmas party will be organized by the Defence Ministry, but they are not the employees of the Ministry who will be invited.
In Christmas of the Orphelins, the children of lost soldiers will receive gifts for the missionary Christmas, the family members of soldiers who are currently serving in foreign missions are invited, and a press receipt will also take place.
The Ministry provides a budget of 25 million foreigners to create the end-year environment.
In comparison with the other departments, the National Development Agency (NFO) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will celebrate.
The GKM Festival will be held in the future's House with a total budget of 4 320 000 forecasts and, on the six hundred large employees, three hundred fifty.
At this celebration, Christmas environment will be rigorous, there are actors and also a stomach.
The NFU Christmas costs 4 700 000 forecasts and was organized in the building of the National Justice Council (OIT) with concerts and a dinner.
The location of the room costs a million forecasts, the remainder has been expensed for more than four hundred visits.
According to our information, a NFU service is invited to another Christmas feast, which is organized with European money by the National Economic Development Centre, the management company of offers.
The building of the Gaîte Theater was lodged to these purposes.
This information has not been confirmed by MAG Zrt because we have not been able to join the responsible.
The cost is not binding
The OIT building was not only welcomed by NFU but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which, instead of a Christmas party, organized a bal at the occasion of Saint Luca on 7 December.
ILO did not pay the use of its rooms.
The bal was five hundred people.
The celebration began by the words of the Minister's Welcome and dinner was followed by a night before life music.
Answer to the question of [origo]: the dinner holding was not all of the obligation to this bal.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Local Communities will prepare a party over.
The Ministry of Health will organize a spectacle and a party to its employees in its walls for 4000,000 foreigners.
On the contrary, Monika Lamperth, Minister of Work, does not invite its collaborators to a Christmas feast but to a final year workshop.
Hundredty-two people are expected to be invited to take a coffee and eat nuts, reported the press service, the party will not cost and 3500,000 forecasts.
Gordon Bajnai, the Ministry of Local Communities, will simply invite his collaborators to take a drink in the hall of the Ministry of Local Collections and Territories.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will organize a Christmas feast in its large room at which 436 employees are expected.
It costs 2 500 forecasts per invitation including a buffet and a drink.
Since Yanos Veres arrived, PM employees celebrate Christmas every year in the same way.
Not a prescribed party environment, the official character is strengthened not only by the Minister's exposure, but also by the hour of the afternoon party.
The Agricultural Ministry will organize a receipt on January 20 to celebrate the new year, the Christmas Festival will not be held.
The receipt will be held in the Vajdahunyad Cathedral, located in the city Bois, and, according to the Ministry's Communication, 1 000 foreigners are calculated for the hundred guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomas in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are engaged in a few of the welcome words of the Minister's follow-up of a modest food.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Cultural is not a party for Christmas, reported to [origo] respective press services.
The press service of the Ministry of Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas party.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the celebration organized at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The Great Mega forces gather
The Unions of the Ligue and the National Employer Councils Association will, on Friday, represent their grief committee, which will be responsible for the coordination of the greenland on Monday.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and Monday, on the day of the final vote on the law on health boxes, the grief will begin.
This will certainly cause important shuttles in the traffic because rail traffic will be almost totally arrested and the employees of BKV (common transport company) will also grow up to 13 hours.
The trade unions will know, on Friday afternoon, the details of their colleague of Monday, organized with the National Workers Advisory Association.
The LIGA greve committee - MOSZ will also be constituted, and it will serve as the coordinator of Monday Actions.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and from Monday, the organizations joining the Great will stop working for an undetermined period if they cannot find an agreement with the Government.
This means that the date of the end of the grief is not defined from the day of the vote to Parliament on the Law on Health Case Acts.
If the national Assembly does not adopt the Health Case Act, the unions will immediately retire the call to the grief.
However, if the law is voted, the grieve commissions will gather and decide to follow.
According to the day of Monday of the National Assembly, it is likely that the vote on the law on health boxes was only late night and evening.
As a result of the planned strike for Monday, important shoes are planned in the movement: the iron roads will stop the work for an uncertain period and during the morning a part of the common transport in Budapest and more than half of Volan companies are risked to be arrested.
At different points of the country, half of the road will also be blocked.
Many of the citizens and organizations joined the call to the grève, the list of those are continuously updated on the Liga's website.
Some organizations have reported to make the grief for an uncertain period, and others have declared a temporary stopping.
To Thursday after midday the MÁV (Hungary ferry Chains) and the Free Travel Syndicat (VDSZZZ) have not been able to find an agreement on minimum services, or, at the approach of Christmas feasts, more are those who take the train.
According to the current communications, the common transport of Budapest will be decreased from the beginning of the service until 13.00, the Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 p.m., the Industrial Systems of Electricity and the Heavy Energy of Liga will be a degree of four hours, the Syndicat of Professionals and the Democratic Syndicate of Professionals called to make up for 2 hours and 2 hours to 8 hours.
The National Medical Association will strive in the whole country, the Syndicat of Health and Social Employees (EDDSZ) raised to the SZEF will be a degree of 2 hours warning.
The most important of the four versions formulated by the Ligue requires that the Government remove its proposal on health reform and submit a new concept to the social debate.
The second recital requires that the new calculation method for the retail to be implemented from the next year will be introduced in several steps.
The third revendication wants to ensure the starting guarantee before the legal age, which would enable the functions granted in the system before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection of the Freeway Travel Syndicat (VDSZSZ), raised by the Ligue Unions, the proposal for the Ministry of Economy and Transport on Second Railway Lines and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: Hungary Garden has increased the country's risk
According to the Political Capital risk analysis Division (Risk Analysing Division), the activities of the Hungary Garden, which was established in August last, with the support of the Jobbik Magyarerszágenrt Mozgalom (Mozgalom movement for a better Hungary) increased, under several aspects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its “risk warning”, the company notes that, in relation to the activities of the Hungary Garden, the largest political risk is already that “in short terms of aggressive ethnical conflicts may result in the aggravation of the already existing ethnic tension between the twin and non-twin population of Hungary”.
The research institute added that the Hungary Garden's policy strategy is likely to cause this situation as the main reason.
As they say, this is one of the main lacunes of the Hungary political actors: “Peace actors held the public debate on the case of the Romans to representatives of the radical and extreme political grouping groups that have founded a political strategy on the difference between the Tzigans and the Hungarys”.
The problem is aggressive, the normal dialogue is impossible, the extremists are strengthened and the arrival of aggressive conflicts is more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, the activity of the Hungary garden in Hungary has significantly deteriored the image of Hungary to the foreign, in particular on the trust in the stability and democratic maturity of the country.
They recall that, due to a larger publicity given to the reorganization of the extremely Hungary rights groups since autumn 2006, many associations have been established in Hungary since the summer 2007, named 'national self-defence association'.
"The common treaty of these assemblies is that they are defined as a civil organization while they publicly declare the preparation of their membership to defence missions (catastrophes, national defence, defence of the order), if necessary, overwhelming, calling on the invalidity of the police, of the army, otherwise say of the state," they added.
They reported that everything happened according to the method which, based on the ransom of the policy and parties society, seeks to develop various political ambitions under a civil aspect.
The citizen character and the association status are therefore only to avoid the legal stages of the registration of these associations to the court but are also a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that Hungary Garden's activity is a factor that also increases the risk in relation to neighbouring relations.
"In recent months, many neighbouring countries quoted the Hungary Garden as a potential risk source and the ultranationalist politicians of some limitrophe countries want to justify their anti-Humanish policy, referring to the Constitution of the Hungary Garden.
This influences the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research institute, the Constitution of the Hungary Garden is not a unique phenomenon in Eastern Central Europe, political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the operation of the Hungary Garden is like, for example, to the activity of the Bulgarian National Garden whose Constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (UNB) in August 2007.
The many Roma problems that have been covered in a Sofia district (Kraszna Poljana) are originating the Constitution of the Bulgarian guard.
By benefit of these events, UNB decided to be a guard by saying that the objective of the organization is “national self-defence”.
According to them, in the past 17 years, the Tzigians have “terrorized” Bulgaria but the state remained inactive and neutral, remembers the Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had been on a Vienna debate in the Bulgarian public view.
As they say, the declaration of certain Bulgarian Roman organizations on the constitution of their own residue guard signals the increase in the risk of ethnic conflicts.
The function of the Hungarian garden showing similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Garden does not exclude that Hungary Romans respond to the threat of the same way by organizing their own self-defence, it may be read in the risk warning of Political Capital.
At the request of information from the Telegraph Agency, Attila Juhász, Political Capital Research Director, said: The risk analysis is one of the research institutions.
As he said, their risk analysis is published every year and if events could have an impact on the risk change, they report the public opinion, as in the present case, by publishing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red all over
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the feast days and, around the festivals, it was used to reorganize the working days that will reduce the number in the next year.
Festivals are not uniform in the EU and the United States anymore.
Hungarian legislation distinguishs national, state feasts and rest days.
Repos days are often related to religious feasts or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the new year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the new year are also relaxing days, which is much more that the wakeholders can be quiet.
Furthermore, in one year, we have every nine Red Festivals.
The 15 March is a national party, in the event of the revolution of 1848, as also on 23 October, that is the Memorial Day of Revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrate the constitution of our state, on 1 May is the work party and on 1 and 2 November, we remember members of our family and our deceased friends.
Moreover, we have two days in Pascal, Pentecost and Christmas.
The days of our state feasts, national or religious feasts randomly falling on a weekend, according to the calendar, it was used to reorganize the working days in cases or only one working day before or after the marked in red.
It is true that we pay the prices of long weekends in working or going to school at Saturday prior to the long weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has been in a special regulation on the days of replacement of the days before or after the feasts.
The law is extended for all employees and for all their employees, on staff and on persons working in the public service.
However, it does not cost the services companies, the institutions turning without interruption and service, by their vocational vocational and for the rest days.
This year, the working days will be changed only around the end of the year: from 24 December, life is almost in the country because, according to experiences, the majority of people makes additional hours or takes holidays they have finished for these purposes to be able to pass through Christmas and the day of their new year home.
In the next year, many feasts fall at the middle or end of the week, so there will be less changes at the level of working days compared to this year.
The calendar will be reorganized first time around the work party to allow employees to stay home for four days.
Saturday, 25 April, will be a working day to have a day of rest on Friday, 2 May.
Another change is planned for October 23: Saturday, 18 October, will be a day of work that replaces Tuesday, 24th.
Instead, the next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of the festivals since 24 December, everyone will be a pause not-stop even if the day of the new year falls on a lunch.
Six shooting things that can shock the colleagues
E-mails that we forgot to send, vocabulary messages that we never receive, innocent lies that make us almost more: these are things that "beat" the daily place of work.
The question is to know whether these problems are involved or the challenge is raised, and the ambiguous situations are consciously avoided, causing anxiety to others.
Examples.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that we called you on marketing service," a colleague said.
Did you smell you?
Better he's sorry and trys to arrange things by calling the marketing service to tell them that he forgot to pass the message (that's the least used solution).
In most cases, the thing is arranged with apologics.
Before having punishable explanations, it is useful to consider how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
Do you have something that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more urgent than wanting to take a folder, a office tool or the phone, and you don't find them anywhere.
You remember the old age you put the board on the office, but she's gone next morning?
Do you find your style that you thought you had lost on the office of your college?
Don't take anything to your colleagues without asking, except they have reasoned to be angry against you.
Don't get back, from post to your pocket, because it may be embarrassing that there's no more and you need it immediately.
You're papoot of the private life of colleagues?
There are no good ways to stop pounds that offer.
Who did, with who?
Or why?
Don't tell everyone of your (supply) information about your colleagues' private life!
If a colleague shares its intime secrets with you, don't blame his trust!
Enter the shared information into you and don't discuss it with your colleagues in their absence even if your colleagues are also known.
You say you're sick without just reason?
When you call the office and you're declared sick as a pretext of a declarant headfout because you feel bad or you think you need to have a rest of this day, think that your job, your urgent business, your missions should be carried out by someone else in your place.
Don't worry about your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next morning you're not going to work or that something may happen to you to stay home, don't forget to prevent your chief and colleagues to prevent them from your absence next morning.
Fredoning, riding, phone
You're putting up in your job, but your colleagues' rebuilt it brutally?
You've become, without wanting, a witness of a phone discussion that you could better not listen to?
Don't cut your colleagues with freshing, changing, high voice discussions (which you put up above their head), feet battles, great words or unconsciousness expressed with high voice.
They may deplore even if your colleagues are not launched in a project (redaction, design, organization).
You're accusing others for a mistake?
If your job is not done for the deadline, you forgot send an important email or message, no accusation for this forgot!
Don't put it on the possible chaos account in the office or your bruyful colleagues!
Recognize him if you made a mistake and if it has presented inconvenience for others, repair the fault!
Ask how you can repair your fault, repair your neglect!
You feel too much at your office?
Put a game and chausons are comfortable at home but they do not agree to the office!
Don't put comfortable jogging even if your function allows it!
Don't be deceived, respect your colleagues and your own colleagues by properly hiding, and if your function requires it by putting sweet and elegant clothes, to go working!
If you want to answer the expectations, you're not more interesting.
We're slowly advanced in the morning's normal bottle.
However, a special melodia is heard at the radio: the voice of a violin to which electronic effects are associated.
I'll get the sound.
The music change of rythm and the low arrives to accompany the tones of all the time, then a woman's chorale joined there as a real wheel.
Mr2 diffuse the song Wings of Love de Zagar.
Hungarian musical life has not built us for a long time with an electronic pop of good quality.
But now it seems to be different if you listen to the new album of Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the several new interesting productions born from the Hungary Digital Underground began little to change the image of the whole and, despite the new mode of the garage rock, the Hungary Elektrop proves that there is a new under the sun.
Balaz Zságer arrived from Pex and himself played in the Yonderboi group before he launched on his own way, perhaps because "no place for two feet in the same chaussure."
His project (Zagar) and his music, a jazz alliage, an electronic and pop music alliage, began to know when the composition of the filmed soundtracks was confined to him (e.g.
The season of Ferenc Török.
The training at first in small clubs began to be known by a larger public when the wan2 magazine mentioned their first album of 2002 among the fifty more important disks of the Hungarian market and to declare Zagar, with Yunterboi, the only creators of the Hungarian trend, which would also be competitive in the west.
Zagar and his together became inconsistently "Traindy" but nobody asked them if they wanted to take this label well.
The group reacted as necessary, out of a new and better disk.
The titled Cannot Walk Fly Instead album, which recently appeared, can open new ways for them, although the title wants to represent a continuity with the past years in Pécs.
It was a line of the old group of Balazs Zságer Pecks.
We are well with the flight reference but by the air music now appears, according to the spirit and trend of the time, the stronger guide, the impact of rock and roll.
Gağagy Ligeti, who is currently working in England with the Puzzle Group, showed his talent in these songs during the first time of the album at the Millennium Park.
On the album, a real tube is found for the radio, Mr2 Petæfi, which was spread from a few of the morning's popular music, began to introduce the melodies of Wings of Love, registered with six Hungary songs ("Underground Divas").
So it's all right (?).
hvg.hu asked questions to Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new tube tried to ask me: Is your music well remained a music for a certain kitchen?
Zságer Balázs: The term of music for a certain dinner does not tell me a great thing.
For me there are two boxes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial music and sincere music.
Musics who say alternatives, underground can also be mediumcred and only made to sell them and become so commercial.
But a good pop song can also be honest.
The receipt attitude also works in this spirit independence on language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between the Hungarian and foreign public, is one or another more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Foreign, especially western, light music has older traditions.
The people go to concerts and not only the young ones of a ten or 20 years, but also the older ones.
They follow with much more attention the changes in light music because they think that it is also part of the modern culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who, or how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: I'm obviously pleased to see that people come more to our concerts.
However, we have never made music for the market.
For us, music is not made to achieve a goal but for a specific reason.
The role of the public is more important to concerts or mutual influence works, but it is not only under the unfair changes of the moment.
But I noticed that if you wanted to answer the warnings of the public, you're not more interesting.
hvg.hu: Do you have to follow Yunterboi's example?
He works alone and made career instead of western.
Zs.B.: We do not really follow his way even though some try to find tracks in our music.
Instead, we are team players who trust in the musical presence of the other and let it move.
At the beginning, it was well inevitable that our music is compared to Yunterboi because we are several to leave his group and take another way.
hvg.hu: On the Palmarès of mr2 Petōfi, Wings of Love takes the first place.
Many of those who heard the name of Zagar for the first time by the way of this song.
With this most popular style you opened consciously to a larger bed?
Zs.B.: We have not planned to make a tube to sell the disk.
This song means more things.
We wanted it for the end of the album to try to adopt the sound management and the most difficult topics discussed in the entire disk.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six songs?
Why were they the direct line?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a shore of the kind of gospel.
We had the idea to compose this chorale of good solists from the Hungarian musical scene.
Thus the chorle was composed of six members, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikś Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, which was then baptized Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like that or the girls have changed it a little?
Zs.B.: This track has already been in a instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought that it was still missing something to this song.
The suite of agreements has touched the voice of the song.
I sing the night even the melodie that the girls learned later.
I had it almost soon and everything was terriblely spontaneous.
I remember that this has galvanized me at the time, but surely we need Divas.
With my voice, she wouldn't have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the disk and concert also seemed to me that girls were in the back.
There's no single (except only one piece of Judy Jay), they don't have a role alone, they sing all together and they're not sing stronger than music, so music does not only meet their song.
They were back on the scene too.
Is that desire?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the back is only to technical problems.
On the contrary, what was voluntary, is that we did not want to distribute soleist roles.
The song also says that we must forget our ego, forget that comes from where, who goes or, must just leave these families, the love familys, to us.
I wanted the others to feel this euphoric state that we have felt when the song is born.
hvg.hu: The song has made you the most working one?
Zs.B.: Really, no musical creation process has been harder in the melange.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play in a concert plan, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the biggest didn't want to work for a long time, and then, a little little, everything became in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all time with concerts and the fact that I've already left this disk.
Now, these are the prophet Is A Fool, Escape from the Earth and Never The Same.
Training it perfides to risk billions because of the complex of infection.
A smiling frauder.
In this way, his former employee is the French Gender the General Society, owner of the Czech Bank Commerční Banka.
The bank lost about five billion euros because of him.
But instead, it seems that Kerviel is only a big player who wanted to equal his colleagues, and which, in addition, cannot be considered incapable.
On the contrary to all large bank houses, he recognised the crisis of the American Hypotheks market at time.
"He's fragile," they left to hear his superiors who sent him to the police.
However, if Kerviel's deposit was reported by the French media, including the World, the transactions of this man in the end of the last year have produced a profit of EUR 1.6 billion.
The crisis exceeds the United States
"It was all I wanted, it was winning money for my bank," he states in the deposit.
The past succeeded to benefit from the American crisis to win a half billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity since the beginning of the year.
Information began to evacuate in February according to the fact that hypothetics called " sub-prime " were granted to low income customers or to those who had met in the past reimbursement difficulties would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it, and he was well cut.
Thus, at the end of the year, its benefits were up to EUR 1.6 billion.
"When I had winned my first half-million, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel trusted and adds that he, of course, had nothing guarded for himself."
In all the questionnaire, he admitted that the reports would not be dealt with.
He succeeded to dump his superiors, although the Eurex bourse began to interest in his transactions.
Who does not risk anything.
Did he be discovered?
Not soon.
"I think that the simple fact that I got 1,6 billion for the bank would be satisfied."
Where does his will come to risk so big?
He has not been progressively achieved at his position.
He had started working at the General Society in 2000 just after finished his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual wage turned around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already assisting to trade, and in 2005 he became an independent sale of $90,000.
However, he knew he would never win as well as others.
"When I had first entrepreneurship in 2005, I knew that I was considered very less than the other.
In view of my university course and my professional and personal journey," Kerviel explained.
But, just after his entry in function, he brings his first big success.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, he wins a half billion euros through the decline of this title during London's attacks.
And the mechanism was delayed, and he wanted more.
As long as you win, we'll leave you in peace
"There was like a nest effect," he said to the police.
But the higher were well known, or instead, they were swearing it.
"When I win, they were doing it like closing the eyes."
But that's when the start of the year happens.
He lost a billion euros in one day.
At mid-year, after the weekend, he decided to hide the sum.
Monday, when he arrives to work, he isn't employed by the bank.
A few days later, the bank announces that she lost EUR 5 billion because of him.
And how did we find it?
He has become a suspect because of his ships.
"In the last year, I took only four days of congestion.
A trader who does not take vacation is a trader that does not want to leave his book to another", concludes Kerviel.
Czechium has the opportunity to get 365 billion
Today, the Czech government ministers signed in every nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, bring 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion Czech Koreans) to the Czech Republic.
It is nearly half of the total amount that Czech can obtain from Brussels in 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion corones of seven operational programmes will be used to the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to get about 100 billion corones under the Business and innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit from the largest part, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the most important operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the financial resources that the Czech Republic can obtain in the framework of these projects.
This money will be due to an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund that will be managed by a sum of 90.8 billion corones in the next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation Programme, for PMEs and entrepreneurs, must provide financial resources to encourage innovation within the company.
The companies should obtain financial means for the introduction of new technologies, research in the industry, but also for the introduction of new more efficient management methods.
At this time, the Czech Rep. was part of the beneficiaries of the EU's least successful funds.
The Court confirmed the sentence of 20 years of prison for the former President of Nicaragua
The Nicaragua's Call Court confirmed the sentence of 20 years of prison for the former President of Arnold Germany, which was sentenced in 2003 for a fraud of $1,8 billion.
But later he was released and lived in his hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
If the former Chief of the Central American State, functioning between 1997 and 2002, it is not clear, according to the AP Agency.
According to the Chairman of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on prison agents, or they will leave Aleman to end his punishment at his home, or will again be in prison.
4 years ago, the Court has proved that Germany regularly moved the government's money towards foreign companies in Panama.
It was tax companies, and accounts were in fact belonging to members of his family and its most closest party.
A part of this money was taken into the funds created by Alemán to finance its election campaign in 2001.
The budget was adopted
That's it.
The state budget was adopted.
What is this budget exceptional?
It is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the majority of the government without the support of the opposition.
This one for the current year has been a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - SSD, since it was the Minister of Sobotka who prepared it and the SSD could not allow it to refusal.
In contrast to the agency debate before the vote of the Government ' s deficiency declaration, this time, nothing dramatic.
The Chamber of Members has adopted this law without any problem, which, although the most influential, is normally denied.
That's a kind of paradox.
Any chapter and each article are the beginning and end of any government.
The budget is part of the policy, which has been hidden behind the competitive government and opposition competition.
This last is more mediaally attractive and therefore it is given more attention to the media.
Political men's controversies are much more interested in viewing than disrupted numbers.
The national socialist budgets of the past socialist governments suffered from three degrees that the current budget is not able to resolve both:
The first is the important part granted to the expenditure of mandates set by the law, which is not only by retreats but also by the social charges adopted last year by the "coalition" silencious grouping parties sSD and KSṣṭM.
The second is a deficit economy, resulting in the first evil.
The third obstacle, he, is constituted by the deficit of public finances, namely by the deficit of cities and communities.
However, this is not the deficit of the state budget that represents the largest alea.
This is public and relatively under control.
The truly late bomb is the deficit of the cities and communities.
Many carriages often issued obligations, deeming out their municipalities, to obtain, from money from taxes, tax rights and bank credits, new investment sources.
In the past years, they were successful to repay these debts by sale in mass distribution systems, including the energy systems obtained from the State in privacy.
Today, they do not have any more than this source.
If only official and verified facts are carried out, it is noted that:
Our economy has already been over a few years, as the rest of the world, a growth phase and SSD is missing to sell it.
It was a unique opportunity for the successive governments of this party to regulate public finance.
However, instead of that, they ended the State even more.
Other countries, including Hungary, Albania and Egypt, have managed their business in a much more reasonable manner than our Republic.
This is a monstruous shame that is mainly back to the previous governments.
We are part of countries that are the least threatened by poverty at the global level.
We therefore do not need massive social programmes that have been, just in recent years, unnecessaryly inflated.
Although a part of the absurd popular expenditure was successfully removed, the last year approved before the elections, if a decay of the age limit for retrait, as well as a reform of the retrait system will not be placed next, then any policy will stop existing in this country and whoever will be the power, it will only be administred.
By exercising punishment, political men will become bureaucrats which mechanically distribute the majority of the money imposed between retraits and social benefits.
This is the reason why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that makes usual costs are refunded by mandate costs.
The deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be absolutely unnecessary if previous governments had not dismissed all their money.
If we really don't want to happen that policies in power become simple bureaucrats, we need to be patients and to grant this fragile government coalition, conscious that the State cannot expend only the equivalent of what is going to preserve taxes and tax rights, the peace necessary for the preparation of new reform laws.
There are only the latters that will enable progressively to achieve a balanced status budget.

Banks want to regulate the crisis
The Federal Bank, the European Central Bank and the English, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to combat the financial market crisis together.
More than 100 billion dollars will soon be placed on monetary markets through securities.
It will be involved in banks to sell the interest rates for which they are ready to pay money by a shopping system.
For example, the US Fed will send $40 billion to the shopping and, moreover, provide 24 billion to the European Central Banks and Swiss.
It is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the Central State Banks have decided to take action to this concerted point to prevent and to reduce the impact of the financial crisis.
"This current tends to resolve the main problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capitals that banks could prepare," wrote in its report to the clients Bernard Baumohl of the Outlook Economic Group advisory company.
"The concerted action of Central Banks reduced the probability of recession to the United States of 65 per cent to about 50 per cent", adds Baumohl in its report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion because of non-employed loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts are still waiting for other losses in billions.
"If the Central Banks have chosen this way, they must really appreciate what can still be done", said the ECB's head of the ADN Amro Kieran Davies.
"He seems to be really bad," he adds.
The Central Banks are afraid that if the banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will pay more money to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and decline the American economy in a recession that could affect global economic growth.
The Central Banks made this choice after the decrease of London's interbank rate, called LIBOR, was used for banking on the interbank market.
This means that banks always fear the mutual loans, although the United States Central Banks, Canadian and English banks have reduced several times during the automn.
"It will have the same effect as a new decrease of interest rates," said to the Reuters Greg Saving company Tempus Consulting Agency.
Some analysts do not believe that the movement of Central Banks will not contribute to the crisis because it does not resolve the main problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the United States.
President Klaus: The debates of ecologists are incredible
Global climate changes are predominantly weak to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus reiterated the problem of global warming.
The criticism has been on the United Nations International Conference on Climate Change in Bali this time.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not see, he said that the debates of ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the Conference, which is a curious medium of representatives of non-governmental organizations and non-governmental organizations, which is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the register and the reality.
"The debate is not structured, it is only a smoke of words, replaces solutions to current problems," said Klaus.
The Czech President stressed, at the presentation of its book, that his subject has a great importance for him, and that is why it is also engaged in this cause.
He also expressed its satisfaction of what his book appears as well in the German translation, as he said, "I often meet only the load of my opinions."
Now, interested persons can read their positions without being deformed.
Klaus recalled that, although it is not climate, he, in his view, had enough provisions to edit such a book.
It is in fact academic to follow and appreciate scientific treaties, he has the practice of statistics and is also economic.
The major conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following themes: the climate evolving without end, the changes of it are therefore normal, there is no opinion shared by all researchers on global warming, the effects of the current changes are not too important or too serious, therefore they do not represent any dangers and, finally, efforts to influence climate development are inutile, inefficient and inacceptable.
In addition to experience of a totality regime, it is considered unacceptable to impose uncertain opinions to others, which it is as a dangerous arriving to freedom.
In response to the questions of the present persons, he explained several times that it was not against "a reasonable environmental protection, but against an integrated environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the benefits they give".
In Vienna, Klaus had already spoken about this two months ago at Hayek Institute.
600 000 people have not been able to renew their driving permits in time
Six hundred thousand drivers left the deadline and failed to renew their old driver permits whose validity is coming to the end of the year.
We are the last day in which people can still ask for renewment, so that the authorities are through delivering them a new permission before the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers have been able to spend the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their permission to conduct, especially those who do not want to conduct.
While the Commons report a disappearance of the number of requests for renewment of the permission, the capital authorities are invaded for applications and the number of requests for renewing the authorisation has been increased in this week.
Mayor was satisfied with about 2000 clients per day.
There's a chain of a half hours near.
Prague, nearly 140.OOO drivers have not yet renewed their driver permits.
The release of a new permission takes 20 days.
But it is possible to request deliverance within five days.
In that case, the driver pays an additional of five hundred corones.
The vehicle drivers that will not be able to renew the obligation of the driving permit from the end of the year and take the road without a valid permission, will risk a amendment since January.
The guilt will be obliged to pay two thousand corners to the maximum.
However, the police may also treat infringement with a friendly approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the amendment is influenzad to 2500 corones.
According to ancient information, it was likely to be an amendment even a person who would not be circulated.
This could be obliged to pay up to 30,000 corones.
The Ministry had called the authorities to modify and to impose amendments not exceeding 1000 corners.
According to Karel Hanzelka's Minister's Chamber, nobody risks amendments in tens of thousands.
The driver permit is, according to him, a document which people can decide whether they want to have it or not.
It is not like the identity card that it must be valid without exceptions.
Persons who do not want to conduct should be allowed to drive.
It is sufficient to bring or send it to the corresponding municipality.
The driver permits from 1964 to 1993 will remain valid at the end of the year.
However, vehicle drivers are also forced to progressively renew other types of driver permits.
Persons with documents dated from 1994 to 2000 have still three years for renewal.
The validity of driver permits issued in the 2001-2004 years expired in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2,6 million other documents.
The Court has reduced the punishment of the detectives treated with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Kośaśík, elderly police accused of conciliation with David Berdych's gang, will be respectively thirty and ten years of prison.
The Supreme Court of Prague has so finally condemned them by decreasing their punishment respectively of 1 year and 2 year.
The detectives of the Department for Combating the Organized Crime were risked by 14 and 12 years of prison.
It is no longer possible to call against today's judgment, only a call to the Supreme Court is expectable.
Although Berdych is also accused of this case, he is not waiting for the moment only for the first instance.
However, he has already received in other proceedings of punishment over 16 years of prison.
He can't receive any more.
In January, the Departmental Court acknowledged 19 persons to participate in hold-up, and the Supreme Court had now treated the appeal interventions of 16 among them.
The majority of the infringements remitted, since the beginning of the investigation, the accused of it was a manipulated case.
According to the Court of Justice of the Central Body, the police members, after another agreement with Berdych, transmitted to the criminals of information from police sources, covered the different hold-up and helped members of the gang to avoid criminal responsibility.
The gang was 30 per cent of the latrine in Opava and Kośaśík.
In the accused, it is questioned of the criminal activity of the gang in the 1999-2001 years.
In particular, army flights whose victims, most of them, suffered seriously from health, but also of the abuse of the power of a public and prohibited weapons.
When home searching, the police actually discovered illegally detained guns, buses with a shooting shooting, a shooter for the direct laser shooter or a snack.
According to the accused, the gang was rid of tens of millions of corones.
In addition to a twenty-four men of this case, the courts have already recognized the guilty of other hand flights of Berdych and the whole number of other people.
Other men in the Berdych neighbor are still in explanation before the court in another proceeding, and some cases have not yet occurred before the court.
At the moment, the main hearing avoided Tomáš Pśta and Maroš Šulej, who are now in detention in Ireland, where they are waiting for the final decision on their extradition in the Czech Republic.
Child substitution price: 12 million
Igor Veleba's lawyer wants to obtain a detriment of 12 million corones more expenditure.
Three million for each mother, two million for fathers and one million for each child.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each of the parents.
This is why the lawyer of the Hospital Ondśej Dostal is not absolutely agreed with the Veleba's proposal.
"We refuse such a revendication, that is very high," said Dostal at the outdoor of the hearing.
"In order to make an opinion on the opposite, we need the expert report of which the counterparty has commanded the edition.
We'll check if it has any explaining value.
But we continue to think that total sum should not exceed hundreds of thousands," said Dostal.
The amount should, according to him, be fixed between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jablośov's family requested a million corones for each month where she couldn't get her biological daughter.
Veleba took place in the expert report, drafted for him by the University Hospital Center in Prague-Motol, as a document for support for defect negotiations.
According to psychological experts and psychiatrists, parents suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress at different levels and deep deep.
The situation of stress was better supported by men, although they were faced with the reigns of not have prevented the substitution of newborns.
Women, they remain less severe before the life of traumaism in the current and what happens in this day, summarised the content of the Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurse in the hospital of Tjabíč on 9 December.
Last week, children were returned to their biological parents - Nikola at the śibyslavice and Veronika at Libor Broś and Jaroslava Trojanov in Jablośov.
The Governor of the Vysočina Miloš Vystrčil, finally in October, delivered 100,000 coronary families for the repayment of the expenditure caused by the H.I.T.E. by the hospital managed by the region.
All hospitals in Czechy are undertaken by the Act to Insurance in Civil Response.
In the case of lack, they must be powered in the reserve fund, exceptionally, they may request support to the manager.
While the courts now recognized relatively high deteriorations, the rates calculated according to the tables were the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally of millions.
Polívka lost Valašské Kralovstvi (the Kingdom of Valašsko)
Bolek Polívka lost the punishment about the Valašské kralovstvi (Royaume de Valašsko).
According to the court of the regional court of Ostrava, he was actually used for the first time the King's title of Valašsko, but the project was put on foot by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, the former partner of the actor.
Polívka was not present today's hearing.
But, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not finished, and his customer will call.
"The complaint relates to the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team are on the popularity of Bolek Polívka," said after the prosecution of the Polivka lawyer.
According to him, the Kingdom words of Valašsko speak to all the people just this actor and comic.
Harabiš is the same opinion.
"There's been a job of almost ten years behind us.
Search for money and development at the point of events," he said.
According to him, it's the money that is the cause of the crime.
"Besides the years, they realized that the project had success and that they could benefit it.
They want to go on our work," he added.
It's a children's book, right?
According to the court, it is Polívka who first used the Valašskī král title (Roi of Valašsko) in his television.
Actor Radoslav Brzobohatý had kinged it in 1993.
But at the time, it was not a relationship with the project to put a valid kingdom on foot.
Some years later, Harabiš came with the idea to show passports from the Valašské Kralovstwi.
From a humoristic action to origin, it has been a lucrative business and a lucrative trade activity, followed by Harabiš, the Valašské society kralovstwi.
In 1997 Polivka accepted his name and signature to be quoted in the passport and even proposed to the payers on the price of his closed visit and the theatre spectacles.
Who's going to sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš was only using the null idea published by Polívka in the employed emission for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka has certainly helped the Valašské kralovstvia project", said the judge.
However, she added that the soul of the project was constituted by Harabiš and its team that would be intensified to the project.
The cooperation between today's enemy parties continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized a official curling for Polívka in Vsein.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, who culminated with "the King Boleslav 1er elected forever".
The ruling in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabiš, taken by the song Jarmila Šulákova as the Reine of Mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka was complained against Harabiš and its company, asking that the court has rejected today.
What could clearly shoot the case is the throne planned for the throne and a half of the princess.
He should get out of a new king.
He did not still want to trace details and date.
"We don't want to go quickly.
This would be something like the kings' slaughter in Slovacko.
The king would be elected for a certain time.
Even Mr. Polívka may, of course, be inscribed," added Harabiš.
Test of Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VT: loss of prejudice
Actually, I have never been a great fan of the Peugeot 206.
His rolling quality was nothing extraordinary, the quality of speed change, conduct, and also the manufacture could, at the same time, be qualified by medium infernality.
However, the Peugeot 207 is now on the market, which is quite better.
As far as the named SW is going to be a further step, I'm still more to think better.
When I tested the classic haschback of the Peugeot 207, I pleaded for example the space for the head on the back seats.
When you finish the complaints because the combiner means that even the great devils will be in this regard.
Let's see
I'm going to smell the inside so that I can't repeat.
This is a shortly successful design, my only comment on the central tunnel that seems to be poor.
There, I would like a little more inventive design, since the car is so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the time when they could be complained of seats or files are revolutionary.
The Latin Guide has also been clearly improved in comparison with the 206 model.
As far as space, the increase in the machinery dimensions is sensitive too.
The amount can also disappear the lack of place above the already mentioned head.
A coffee in the coffee
The most important on this vehicle is, therefore, its bag shoot.
I have to evaluate that as well available (e.g. thanks to the back ice) and a quite easy switch.
The green spaces are munius of arrest elastics that are an ideal compromise.
It is not composed and can be extended as possible to hold sufficiently heavy objects.
But let's stop the volume.
This is, according to tables, 428 l in the basic configuration, which is a relatively medium number in relation to competition.
Skip to škoda Fabia Combi, the most sales vehicle from this category in Czech.
If 207 SW is compared with the new generation of Mlada Boleslav product, it is noted that Peugeot remains very sensitive behind, the difference is 52 litres.
When it is to go to the foreigner or to load a pocket, this number is almost critical.
But if I had to do the advantages, I would mention the lower box left after the reverse of the back seats perfectly right, or a very low walkpied.
120 redistributed horses on four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with a Otto motor of four cylinders with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And in fact, this should be like a 1,6 that makes walking a family hashback.
He's quiet, consums little and, especially, he puts well.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by škoda that often gives the impression of having a shooting pool shocked by a snake, then I can only be an enthusiastic.
Costs
The vehicle price is not approachable by all.
However, it must be aware that we have tested a pretty well equipped car with a space and a very good engine.
The base price of a vehicle with a Otto engine 1,4 litres resulting from 329 900 Kč is still passable.
The vehicle we tested from 410 900 Kč, which is already enough.
Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price of 80 000 Kč.
But we have had more head-up airbags, automatic climateization, automatic swimming-switch, automatic windows automatic command...
In fact, the vehicle costs at the board of the account 531 900 Kč.
It's a lot, but try to add additional equipment to the Fabia price and you will get a very similar number.
So there is no more to choose the mark.
The integration of Slovakia students in British schools is bad
The number of children originating in Eastern European countries will grow up in British schools, which results in the remaining concerns about the development of local education.
The integration of the Europeans at this time is at a series of obstacles.
The British schools even find cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of origin are transformed into violence.
The case of the Ken of the north, where the opposing conflicts of remaining and immigrants from Slovakians, the problem of the integration of children originating in Eastern Europe is well illustrated.
The conflicts, chicans and bagarres between students have been transposed in the relationship between parents.
The situation was so far that the police arrested a Slovakia woman in Chatham who struck a ten-year-old student.
The accused defended by claiming that the boy was insulted by racial proposals.
The police also had to be involved after the attack against a Slovakian immigrant conducted by two adolescents.
The young girls were pretty addressed to this man of racist comments and cast stones to him.
"When we returned to the house, a young man gripped on the bus stop and began to cry over us.
When I told him to stop, he answered by pounds and weight and then found his fees," described another unpleasant adventure a mother of Slovakia students.
The complaints are made by the two parties.
One of the remainers went to qualify conflicts with immigrants in the fight for survival.
The higher cases show that atmosphere in the British schools between the people of origin and immigrants begins to be tendencied.
70.000 Slovakia comes to find work is registered in Britain.
And about 30,000 Slovenian students are frequent to British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors, it's really a island of freedom.
Everything you're waiting for your conges can be achieved if you do a good choice.
Deep and white beaches such as snow, high waves, or then a calm sea like a tang.
Palms and all inclusive with servers offering you on the beach a pizza, glass or swimming cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and routine.
On the Caribbean Islands, you will not find this list only in its integrity but enrichy.
But there's only one island on which you'll find much more and it's Cuba, the greatest and beautiful island of the Great Antilles.
During Spain, Cuba was the base of their American invasion.
Christophe Colomb qualified him as the most beautiful place that human eyes have never seen.
Havana has become the depot and the place of transbordation of the treasurers shooted by Spain and transported them in Europe.
Then the American era came.
The National Hotel was established at the beginning of the 20th anniversary.
It's Lucky Luciano, one of the chiefs of the American mafia, which made it built, since all that was a crime in the United States (for example under the ban) was accepted and supported in Cuba: drugs, hair games, prostitution.
Among his customers, there was, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havane, high buildings were rolled and cars, belonging to the cults symbols of the last 50th century, circled on the large boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway purchased a property in San Francisco de Paula, near the Havane, and in Cojimar, he had his yacht.
The stars of the business show and the political men of America left their signatures on the walls of the Middle East.
And today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of the Havane Bodeguita.
In the National Hotel bar, a luxury hotel, you will mix the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars are always driving to Havane, since the imported jigolis and fiats have already been in a so-called and humid climate, perri.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is sensitively decreed, there are no wonderful colonial monuments that there are precisely there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Since tourism brings money if necessary, its development has green fire.
During the past 15 years, new hotels were not only in Havane but especially in Varader, on the coast of Holguín, and on the small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba also proposes a fantasy that is unique in the world and that will be particularly appreciated by small train amateurs.
The cane was returned from the expansion plants in sugars on a closed way by small vapor and motor trains.
Their rolling material has not been renewed for decades and it is so that it can be seen in walking of small locomotives whose contemporarys are not only in museums.
To where to direct his steps?
Most visitors do not miss the most known places.
Therefore, there is no need to write it long on Varadero or well on Havane.
Unless remembering that in the property of Hemingway, already mentioned, there is a museum and that those who love this writer should not raise the visit.
The Valley of Viśales, west of the island, is one of the most pintors in Cuba.
A excursive vegetation and pulled on a calcaire soil.
Mogots, calcary balls and stones mounting in cooks from the base of the valley, and, from the fertile land, they are taken into their feet, even their stones are recovery of a very deep vegetable butt.
The valley is the place where you probably cultivate the Cuban smoke of the best quality.
You can meet the final form of this product if you visit one of the Havane cigarette manufactures.
Someone may also be interesting that there has been turned the Chile episode of Major Zeman.
Trinity
An old man founded a few days after the Spanishs colonized the island.
This is the market of slave trade and the sugar that brought to him glory and riches.
The richesse was incarnated in the beauty and the vitrine city of this reduced city.
Colonial španṣṭlská architecture, vørazná ovlivná pozdjschími Francouzskými osadniky, if it is the rhetoric steleti têmníla.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the mountain massive Escambray, is a place that is so different than in the last 50th century, there was no way to link this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay on the side.
We didn't build anything, and that's why we didn't demolize anything, everyone was pleased to have a teeth above the head.
If there are, in Trinidad, more than a midday afternoon, it's the pain to go also to see interesting places in the neighborhoods such as Playa Anconn Beach or the Valley of Sucreries.
Then, the evening, it is worthy to go to the House of the Music, who lives after the sun bed and where music is just a little morning.
Baraco
Some designate this bargade located in the extreme East of Cuba as the most beautiful island.
This opinion is certainly influenced by the way that takes it.
The two roads from Guantánamo have to switch high and accidental mountains and through a landscape almost without marks of human activity.
UNESCO has registered the East Cuban school, through its intact landscape, on the list of the global patrimonie.
There is the best chocolate, in the church, there is the cross of Christophe Colomb (in fact, she has seen a few hundred years after the Columbia Perplex) and from the colline where the old chateau-force and the current hotel El Castillo is seen several table mountains, the most famous of El Yunque.
About the coffee, the rhum, the cigarettes, the mountain massif Sierra Maestra, the Baiie of the troops and the island of Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the sanctuary of Cuban Caridad del Cobre, Santia, the African religions practised by the elderly slave descendants, all of this could be filled with a number of pages.
Just as we just say, it's better to see once.
Alliances in Afghan are passive, saying the Americans
The lack of soldiers and equipment necessary is influenced, according to the United States, on the launch of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to the Minister of Defence Robert Gates, NATO should choose a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghan did not take place as it should, in Edinburgh, Scotia, the representatives of the countries with troops in the south of the country agreed.
In addition to the growing contest from the Taliban movement, the eight States involved discussed today also on future plans and the coordination of the allies.
While the United States called this week by the Minister of Defence by Robert Gates the NATO troops to a greater activity, Great Britain considers the strengthening of the Afghan Government's authority and the intensification of development aid.
"Evolution in Afghanistan is perceived, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the people to start a new development of the economy and security", said the BBC Chamber, the British Defence Minister Des Browne.
Four-twenty-dix per cent
The activity of the Afghan insured is, according to the American Army data, the most intense of these five years.
The number of violent actions has increased 27 per cent in the past year, up to 60 per cent in the province of Helmand, located in the south of the country.
NATO countries have some 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, with nearly one fourth in the southern part.
However, according to the United States, the allies reached their absolute limit and in the organization and in the equipment of armies.
Concretely, they ask other helicopters, soldiers and experts for the training of the Afghan armies.
"We should seriously reflect on the concrete goals for the future period, as well as on the way to achieve them," said Gates.
The Secretary-General of the UNOTAN JAP de Hoop has held similar proposals today.
"I am not pleased of what we have on the ground and at the air in Afghanistan.
We've got some 40-10 percent of soldiers and equipment we need, and that's not enough," said De Hoop to the Reuters Agency at the end of talking with the Japanese government in Tokyo, which had three days.
Who is passive
These last months will also reign among countries involved in conflicts on the issue if all partners are effectively in Afghan as possible.
For example, Germany was criticized for its passiveness.
"The Germans have a relatively numerous representation in Afghanistan.
But they are undertaken in areas where violence is minimum, the fight requirements that they are subject to are not so strict than those in the South and Eastern parts of the country where we work", said Gates.
The British Sun Table has qualified German soldiers this week.
"The Afghan fans found: Germans play, while we fight," wrote Sun in a document complemented by photos of German soldiers playing at the table tennis.
The German Journal Image was on the counter-attack by publishing the photo of a British troop in a ruby match in the south of Afghanistan.
The debt of the State will be a million in 2009
The charge of a debt of the State exceeding 84.000 Czech.
The total debt has been allocated to 842.7 billion of corones at the end of September.
The government had planned to acquire this year 159.2 billion corones.
The Ministry has reduced the sum expected to be 152.8 billion corones by an evolution of the budget of the State.
The debt of the State of the Czech Republic is taken to the end of September to 842.7 billion corones.
During the nine months of this year, he increased 40.2 billion corones.
However, from June, he decreased from 13.4 billion corones.
Today, the Ministry of Finance confirmed its data on the debt of the State in the beginning of October.
The load of a debt exceeding 84.000 Czech.
During the last year, the State was over 111 billion corones.
"For this moment, it seems that, through a less important deficit planned for the next year, only one billion of corones could be exceededed in 2009.
The next year the debt should be between 900 billion and a billion coronary", said Patrian Financing Analyst David Marek for the iHNeed.cz server.
The provision of the next financial analysis Vladimír Pikor is likely: "We could exceed the billion in 2009.
The specific date will depend on the next budget that is not yet known.
If the situation on the political scene seemed to be changed, that policies were prepared for more economicization, the date could be retreated in 2010.
But I don't expect this change," he said.
Debts grow
The debt of the State is constituted by the debts of the central government and is primarily generated by the accumulation of State budget deficiencies.
The debt of the State is financed by goods of the treasurer, retail titles, direct loans or, for example, by employees to the European Investment Bank.
The State's internal detection has increased this year for the moment of 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion corones.
The external debt of the State has increased this year at the time of 1.7 billion corones to 123.3 billion.
The debt of the called negotiatable State reached at the end of September 803.3 billion corones and from June he decreased 13.7 billion corones.
The average requirement of the State debt was 6.5 years old.
" The total debt has increased annually from the first to the third half of 13 percent, which is, taking into account the current economic health of a too high number.
It is interesting that increases are generated in particular by profit titles where it reaches 20 per cent.
It is bad that debt believes, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be a matter of negotiation when the retrait reform will come", commented Pikora's data.
Better than we waited
It was understood by the State financing and debt strategy for 2007 that the Government planned 159.2 billion corones this year.
However, at the beginning of September, thanks to the evolution of the budget of the State as expected, the Ministry has reduced the sum expected to be 152.8 billion coronary.
The sum is mainly constituted by the deficit of the State budget, which is obvious to reach 76 billion corones this year, at the place of 91.3 billion of initially planned corones.
It is then the maximum sources for the Czech Agency for Consolidating Consolidation, which are 13.3 billion corones, the reserve of 10 billion for the payment of retraits, the financing of state retail rates for 43 billion corones and the reimbursements of the European Investment Bank resulting from 1.8 billion.
She compared today before a court in Khartoum for named a sweet bone
The British Teacher judged in Sudan for insulting in Islam was sentenced on Thursday night by a Khartoum court at 15 days of prison and exploding, announced his lawyer.
The British was accused of having left students from 6 to 7 years of age to give Mahomet's name to a sweet bone while all representation of the Islamic prophet is illegal.
She was able to pass the punishment of shocks.
This British Institutor of 54 years of age at the High School of Khartoum in Sudan was arrested Sunday at her home and sentenced to Islam and Section, under article 125 of the Sudan Criminal Code, following several complaints of student parents at the Ministry of the Sudan Education.
The story was in fact restored in September, when this teacher asks his students 6/7 years old to choose a name for the shooting of the class.
"There are names from the mouth of children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," reports the director of school Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 children on 23 have chosen Mohamed as a favorite name.
Mohamed is certainly the name of the Muslim prophet, but especially a very common name in the Sudan.
The children then performed a book for the class with the photo of the ear followed by the legend "My name is Mohamed".
The smell itself did not have any label with that name, but the problem is just the representation of the prophet considered as an insulto in Islam.
One of the Islamic colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who teached in the same school in Sudan, explained that he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that could be insulting against a religious faith, "I regret that she had asked the children to vote for a name," it is not according to him that "innocent error".
Advisory shared by many students from the institutor who describe it as “a very careful towards his students” and “who never speaks of religion in class.”
Remember, the first name Mohamed is also the second most name given in Britain, he writes 14 different ways from English.
This name often chose by Muslim families is a way to honor the prophet (which is given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules on the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give him a game?
It is, of course, a question of interpretation.
They have not reached a merger agreement on the future status of the province at the last negotiations meeting in Vienna.
Finally, it's failed.
The Serbs and the Albanians of Kosovo finished Monday in Baden, Austria, a sixth and last discussion meeting without having been able to overcome their divergences on the future status of the separate province.
“It is regrettable that the parties were not able to reach an status agreement” said the European Mediator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Substantiating that peace in the region was “in game”, his American homolog, Frank Wisner urged Belgrado and Pristina to respect their commitments to maintain peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
“We do not preserve violence in immediate but we are in a very difficult period” he added that “because tensions exist.”
End of mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the Troika, who group the European Union, the United States and Russia, will be the last Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province of 90% of albanophones could become clearer when Ishinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will return their report to the United Nations Security Council from 10 December.
Baden's debate, near Vienna, was the sixth and last negotiation session since Troika was taken by the United Nations in August last.
Americans and Europeans believe that their mediation will be completed on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the octroy of independence in Kosovo, insist on a further negotiation over the time of busy.
“The Russian was and remained undertaken for a negotiated solution, a compromise solution” said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Declaration of unilateral independence?
After eight years of the Dutch administration of Kosovo, the Westerns believe that the EU's independence under supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina is willing to declare it unilaterally if the Security Council does not give its favor.
Belgrade insists on an increased autonomie.
"Nevertheless, no agreement has been found", announced the President of the autonomy authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the Baden Hotel where these "negociations of the last chance" were deployed since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, the former commander of the cosovary rebellion and the future Prime Minister of the province, was a part of his regrets.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "it belonged to a past that led to murderers and deportations".
‘Domain effect’
The Serbian President Boris Tadic estimated that a compromise was always expectable and maintained the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of an unilateral declaration of the province's independence.
Belgrade, in particular, said to reduce a “domino effect” in a region still fragilized by the 1990s' independence wars.
“For Serbia, did it say, it does not mean that a compromise is impossible.”
On Mardi, the Serbian delegation had emphasized that any decision would return exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian alliance had a veto right.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word"
“As a solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia” said the Serbian Prime Minister, Vojislav Kostuni.
"These negotiations have been held for two years.
They must end as they have started: to the Security Council.”
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had answered that “the Kosovo Parliament will be the last word on the status”, adding that any unilateral declaration of independence from the Albanophones would be ‘in concertation’ with the Western.
Bush struck an agreement between the Israelites and the Palestinians
President George Bush announced, at the opening of the International Peace Conference, that the Israelites and Palestinians finally agreed on a common declaration in Annapolis, Maryland.
He stated that the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had heard to initiate negotiations immediately in order to find a definitive regulation of the age of 60 years between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them to conclude a " peace trading" before the end of 2008.
Among the time, the Palestinians must defeat terrorist infrastructures, and Israel must finish its colonization activities, said Bush, recalling both parties to their obligations in view of the “route fire” for the peace they have accepted in 2003.
The Chief of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim " to conclude a peace treaty which resolves all issues suspended, without exception, including central issues".
This call is recovered by the three deep problems of the content between Israel and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestinian, the status of Jerusalem and the sort of Arab refugees discovered from their homes today in the conflict of 1948.
By taking the word after the President of the United States, Abbas emphasized that the future negotiations should be "global and deep" and address all aspects of a regulation, entitled "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others".
As far as his tribe turns, Olmert has committed to be "direct and continuous" and to "unsure to strike them in the course of 2008".
Bush has established at the end of 2008 the period of implementation of its "vision of two Palestinian and Israeli States" which coherently exist.
Saudi Arabia revealed that she had received a commitment to Bush before decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a successful success for Washington, is the origin of a plan involving all the Arab countries, which proposes Israel ' s peace in exchange of its retreat of all Arab territories in the war of 1967, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "A carrefour in the Middle East history, more particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", believes Prince Saoud in his interview with the Saudi Arab newspapers.
For the provision, the police are not responsible.
What happened exactly Sunday?
As every time in this kind of fact, official and rumor versions are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the survey of the National Police Inspection (IGPN), a police car was circulated in the Sunday, just 17 hours after day, Louise-Michel rue in Villiers-le-Bel.
“It was not in intervention but in patrol, and circulated 40-50 km/h, without gyrophare”, explains a police source.
A green moto of the Kawazaki Mark, “not homologed, therefore not allowed to circulate on the public road” (lease below) and piloted by two young people without ships, circled “to very alive”.
“He surveyed the police car on his left, after a priority refusal to the right,” said a policeman.
The control of alcohol practiced on vehicle occupants was negative.
The state of the car (only discovered, shocked, shocked par-chocs) witnesses the violence of the shock.
Soon in the morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Therère of Givry, announced a investigation for "involuntary murder and non-assistant murder" at the IGPN, which is the departmental direction of the public security of Val d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the procurement expressed that the investigation of the IGPN at this stage was deleted by the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, hearing Sunday night, confirmed “the version of the police, that this mini-moto has arrived relatively quickly on their left”.
Yesterday, a kind of rain, unlikely caused by the fleet of the soil chairs, showed that the two vehicles have remained over the time when the police's car is going to shut up.
The vehicles have been entered and will be obtained in a technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsised yesterday.
What happened just after?
In Villiers-le-Bel, a router was quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, as the police would soon leave the places, not ready to help both youths.
The IGPN, despite remaining careful, would also disappear “all serious fault” in this regard.
"This is a aspect of the harder investigation, which requires more surveys, which must be very careful," said a police source.
Liberation met a ocular witness of these several moments that followed the accident.
One of its windows given specificly on the scene.
"We are immediately down, with my cousin who is nursing to the hospital, to try to rebuilt them, tells this witness.
There was nothing to do."
He then saw “un fully haughter, who bought.
Two other tried to restore one of the young people, the fourth talked on the phone."
With the tension that quickly rounded the scene, and it seems to be the certainty that the young people have found the unexpected situation, police were taken into car by colleagues arrived in the places.
Only twenty minutes after the department of the police, the help has been arrived according to this witness.
They also practiced cardiac mass, just.
"I'm not gonna let you say that police services have not helped youths.
These young people have been shocked.
The bombs arrived immediately.
Everything was done to try to save them,” stressed the prosecution on his side.
The mounting tension to Pakistan
The Pakistani police repressed the first events since the launch of the emergency status two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, on the east of the country, about 2.000 lawyers who expressed the measures taken under the emergency state were blessed by the lacrymogen grenades used by the order forces, according to witnesses.
The last ones were reposed by stone jets, blessing policers.
At least 350 lawyers have been interrupted.
Such scenarios in Karachi and Rawalpindi, or police officers have loaded and blessed lawyers.
several were interrupted.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court called to a general grief and announced manifestations, following some 500 arrests during the weekend of opposites, human rights warrants and lawyers.
The streets given access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday to prevent the assembly.
Other manifestations would have been held in Multan (center) and Peshawar (North-West).
The movement of lawyers greeted the support of the religious parties grouped in the powerful Buthida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose President called for the people to send flowers to judges who were proclaimed against the state of emergency and detrition to those who were prepared to be slaughtered before Musharraf'.
'The promise of Musharraf does not hold'
The Supreme Pakistani Court is directly referred to by the measure of exception announced Sabbath night.
It should be held on the next days on the legal equality of the election to the President of the President, on 6 October, at the indirect question of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was administered and replaced.
'That we assist is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the arrests of the Supreme Court' said the judge in the newspaper The News.
The promise of Pervez Musharraf to leave the head of the army and to become a civil President 'no more' after the establishment of the emergency state, he said Monday, the Advisory Minister of the Tariq Azeem Information.

More than a third of premature weakness remains unexpected
This calculation takes into account the unwanted weaknesses (24%) as well as the unexpected or unexpected births.
Today, more than a pregnancy of three (36%) is not planned (36%), a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographical Studies (Inded), 40 years after the vote of the Newer Law, which liberalized the contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account the unwanted weaknesses (24%) as well as the unexpected or unexpected births.
The different contraception methods such as pill or sterel are still a failure rate of 5% to 6%, estimates the Ined.
The liberalization of the contraception has also enabled a better “fecondity mastership”, according to the Institute, which notes that the use rate of pill in women from 20 to 44 years has been from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight births on ten would be well planned today.
You can be calculated near a month for a couple in five and if possible in the spring, it's been judged as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
There will be more than seven hours of work in space at the Scott Parazynski astronaut and his International Space Station (ISS) team chairs to perform the spectacular reparation of a discovered solar panel, essential for the continuation of scientific activities of the station.
A risked output that accumulated the records from the fact that it was long, from the distance of habitable modules, of the speed with which it has been imagined, of the tools "brilled" by the astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem occurred march while the astronoms had downloaded the Harmony Module, a large cylindric part of the European and Japanese laboratorys (see framework).
This module is a type of appendix for laboratory modules.
But there's a need to be able to supply them in electricity.
The second task of the equipment was, therefore, moveing an electricity production module by weighting solar panels 17.5 tonnes, already present on the ISS, to put it on its final position.
After moved it, the equipment took the redistribution of the module's solar panels with a 76 meter inch.
And that's where one of the panels, which divides as condenses, was damaged near one meter by a cable cut.
The displacement was stopped to do not hurt the panel anymore.
The astronauts, who had to originate a control out of the Discovery ship, then go to repair another solar panel, the rotation system was defectuous, were obliged to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And this is Scott Parazynski that was chosen to go to character in the top of the 30 meters of the telecommanded arm of the ship added to the station to perform the repair.
It's one of the best "spacewalker" (space march) of Nasa.
The big, resisting, very widespread, he had to torment him very developed and long arms.
For 46 years, this training doctor was therefore responsible to operate the sun pane "feated".
After specifically inspected the disappearances, he separated the fault cable and installed types of "atticles" on the damaged area.
He was helped by a second "spacewalker" remained near the salt and, inside, by the other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the team commander.
The tool that he used is a mini-hockey channel developed by isolating to avoid electricity on the solar panels which produced several hundreds of volts, was designed and broken by the astronauts on the board of the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski expected that the panel was completely deployed before making the inventary of its tools and restore the inside of the station.
Last after mid-day, the astronoms benefited from a half-day detention before today, seven astronautes do not control the Discovery ship for a return to the Planned Monday Earth.
The EADS title sanctioned in Bourse
The EADS Action is currently slightly slow in Paris's bourse, after the aircraft and defence group announced that it should be expenditure between 1,2 and 1,4 billion euros to face the delays of A400M.
EADS lost 4% to 21.96 euros at the Paris Bourse currently.
The group was obliged to revise its operational result prevision for 2007 following the delays generated by the slow progress of the development of the A400M engine, which constitutes the inaugural flight of the aircraft.
The costs for rolling the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft, announced in October, are '1,1 billion to 1,4 billion euros of which are more than 1 billion for Airbus', announced the mother house of the European EADS constructor.
As a result of these burdens, EADS will be obliged to announce new operational results (EBIT) targets for 2007 during the presentation of its next quarterly results, it adds no more crypted specifications.
The group also indicates that the estimation of new charges is coherent with the delay of six months.
In reminder, the operational result of EADS was 86 per cent in 2006, mainly because of the delays of another program, the one of the very large loads A380.
Initially, the Group prescribed a first delivery of A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The selection of the quo status
There will be no suspension, Sunday, at the exit of the urnes: the Russians will spend massively for the part of President Poutine, Russians.
Reaffirming their aspiration to stability, even the authorism, after a very cut-up campaign.
In three days of the legislative elections, the Russian President Vladimir Poutine addressed today to elections a television message on public chain, already already, but whose content is secret.
He made it as the head of a Russian list, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is advertised.
Last night, the President has left nothing transparency by receiving foreign Ambassadors, joying to deliver a new load against the Western accused of inheritance – his prediction theme during the campaign.
“We know the price of a real democracy and we want honest, transparent and open elections, without a growing election,” he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we're far away from the account.
It declares a press campaign.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov said that there have never been "also selling elections, even at the time of Eltsin".
After the repression of the manifestations of the last weekend, the former champion of the world of failures Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days of prison for illegal manifestation, remains forbidden to visit according to his lawyer.
"The Russians maintained the mentality of the Soviet Homo"
Next, these unsupported legislatives are profiled two more open issues:
- Who will happen in Poland at the presidency?
The official newspaper published on 2 March 2008 the first tour of the presidency; the candidates were until 23 December to take place.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Poutine cannot impose a third consecutive mandate.
Or no successor is embarrassing.
- What role will Poutine play after March?
Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and all the powerful Russian party that would choose the Government and the President?
Whatever it is, both legislative and the presidential, the triomphere power exhibits.
It's a tradition.
“The Russians have maintained the mentality of the Soviet Homo, they do not feel masters of their destination”, estimates the sociologue Lev Goudkov, director of the Levada Independent Centre.
The historical Nikolai Kopossov, from the University of State of Saint Petersburg, was far away: civil society has delayed in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous Community spirit has delayed the training of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Poutine renewed with the model of a paternalist State, perfectly accepted by the population as much more than this new parentalism has not been followed by the terrestrian, but by a certain economic asylum," says Mary Lipman, the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians “affirmed full gratitude to personal responsibility” which they had writtenly proved after the U.S.U.S. dismissed.
"What do you think?"
The phenomenon affects all social couches, including the business world.
And the administrative election is intended to preserve the status quo: 65 rulers (up to 85 Russian leaders) leading to the local lists of Russian governments.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonyms of chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
On behalf of which the Russians will not vote for extremists.
Tamara Tcherednitchenko's conclusion, Professor of 54 years of age: "What do you think?
Those who are in power are not too bad, why change them?”
A Low Memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi Archives of Bad Arolsen, who retrace the destinations of 17.5 million victims of the Chile regime, are in free access.
The 47 million archiving documents, which were transferred on 27 km line at Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were only consultable in a “humanitarian purpose”, namely individually and nominatively, on request for an elderly victim or his right.
11 States supporting their management - from Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open their researchers and historical researchers.
The ratification process by all States has been completed, the opening is effective since yesterday.
Sensible information
The access of historics to Bad Arolsen will be enabled to conduct research “in particular on the movement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health status of forced workers”, explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, opposed the opening of these designative documents to the public, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the proposed homosexuality or mental disability of certain deportation victims.
The registers of the concentration camps or arrest mandates established by Gestapo were gathered after the war in a practical purpose: finding the deported citizens or undertaking the binding work and, where appropriate, providing them a proof of their internal provision to open the way to their compensation.
Today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees are treated in tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is a limited interest.
“There is nothing more new to wait for these documents,” said P. Wolfgang Benz, director of the University of Technology of Berlin in 2006.
EU and India want to achieve a free exchange agreement in 2008
Today, the Indian-European bilateral trade has reached nearly 60 billion euros per year.
EU is India's first commercial partner and represents 18% of its external trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free exchange agreement in 2008, reported the European Commissioner to Commerce Peter Mandelson and its Indian homolog, Kamal Nath.
The Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the EU gave in April their green fire to the European Commission to take negotiations to sign free trade agreements with India, South Korea and South-East Asian Nation Association (Asiaan). The Indian-European bilateral trade has already reached nearly 60 billion euro per year.
EU is India's first commercial partner and is 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the nineth commercial partner of the EU, according to the European Commission figures.
"A free trade counterparty of the two economies," and "India would improve its access to a market of 450 million Europeans prospered," justified Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, specificated the European Commissioner. The Asian and European Gentiles are exchanged annually for “47 billion euros of goods” and for “10 billion euros of services” this week, Daniel Smadja, Head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, who regrets that the bilateral trade has not reached the potential.

The daily interbank rate was 5.829 per cent.
The three-month rate was 6.6%, one higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer’s financial crisis, the markets carried out by the Bank of England were assured by a significant penalty rate that had deteriored the banks to have recurred.
According to some rumors, corrupted by the evolution of the book in relation to the euro, many prefered to subscribe market allocations by the European Central Bank, to more advantageous rates and with more secured discretion.
UMP and NC reject the review of PS proposals on purchase power
UMP and New Centre groups refused to discuss articles on the proposal for socialist law on the purchase power, which is equal to a rejection of the text.
The text was registered in a socialist 'now' (as part of the Parliamentary Group initiative), the text declined a decade of measures taken by the National PS Office, among which the 50% of the employee prize, the restructuring of the floating TIP, a cheque-transporting or the scope of loans.

The Chairman of the PS-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of its proposals as amendments to the draft corrective funding law reviewed by the Assembly in the next week.
A new festival seeing the day
Following many rumors about the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promotor/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with the British producer, Melvin Benn.
“For our company, it's a honour to work with a person who has no longer inspired the current movement of festivals in America” gave Charlie Jones from C3 to Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza of Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vienna, in New Jersey, is a substantial destination for the camping.
The festival should be held from 8 to 10 August on a private firm of 500 aros at about 40 minutes of Philadelphia.
Another known as Mean Fiddler, the director of the Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festivals in the world.
In 1989, he took the Learning Festival Bar in the United Kingdom, which spends about 800,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, then in 2006, the Festival Republic created the Festival Festival Latitude of Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as a co-owner, Melvin Benn was also responsible for the production, granting licences and organizational tasks of Glastonbury Festival, which can now welcome up to 177.500 people.
Qualificing Glastonbury's most inspiring event, Charlie Jones of C3 said that his company and Melvin Benn's company work parallelly to give the region a European festival of style.
"Our aircraft chose Philadelphia as a market and work with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in the centre of Philadelphia," supported Charlie Jones.
"We were talking to the city and the Commission was motivated and encouraging by this project.
Unfortunately, we have been engaged in policies because of the current administration, Charlie Jones, continues.
"Happy, we have been able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we learn to create a super festival on a exceptional site that will lastly serve the population of Philadelphia. "
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza Festival in 2005 at the Grant Park of Chicago, after being launched in the camping of festivals in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The two events registered brutal income of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals are held in the urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a camping festival, while our people are placed in urban green spaces," says Charlie Jones.
The objective is to fusion, in one way or in another, the two forms to give both a press of camping festivals to the European and urban American.”
Vienna is close to mid-chamin between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The community of Vienna, including the master, enthusiasmly supports the holding of this event," says Charlie Jones.
This latter refuses to reveal the conditions of the intention, but said, "It is sufficiently interesting to allow investing in such an event and welcome a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones said that the accommodation capacity of this festival is "sweet big" instead of the 800,000 people of Bonnaroo Music Festival at Tennessee.
He said that invitations have been launched to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed at the time to go under press.
"Vineland will be saving rock, but music will be varied there, in hope of shooting all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His partners from C3, who received the Top Independent Prize Promoting the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal addresses the Terminator
It's not easy to touch Hollywood film plates in Montreal when no other than Terminator is opposed to it...
This seduction mission is part of the delegated functions.
A mandate - “politically difficult” because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denotes the “reunaway productions”.
Is it difficult to play in the "Governator" packs?
"It must be careful, it is the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she'll go.
Our role is to offer those who will judge the best", he says.
The course to festivals
For now, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is the promotion of the film here.
The course in Oscars is started.
It will be all the celebrations of the Western Cities, which is the Sundance, Denver, Seattle, or San Francisco, to present whatbecous films, to put them into value and to ensure that the realists have interviews.
The age of darkness had a beautiful vitrine at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is at the show in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival, November.
The Quebec also presented four long and four short meters to the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Is there a final year-end rally in swimming?
In less than five weeks of the completion of the year, investors are already frozen by expecting the arrival of the final year-year rally tradition.
However, this year, experts are not even some of them that will happen.
Banif believes that " on the statistical point of view, the month in December is generally a positive behavior.
However, it should not be made exclusively based on statistics, as the current context has been given, incertitudes are at least on markets, in a short term. "
Although they are not partisan to take the ball for the last few weeks of the year, these experts noted that "the bourse market is feeding by the existence of liquidity, prepared to invest the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially the fixed income, affected by the effect of escape to quality values as well as in the long periods and in the short."
For this reason, they believe that the barrier will be a rather laterious behavior, not unless volatilities "for all, because it is not known the impact of the probable decline of the Fed rates, given the high level of brutal and the risk of inflational tension stimulation."
Javier Barrio, who is responsible for BPI sales in Spain, agrees that it is not the right time to say that there is a rallye.
"It's not the best thing," ensures the expert.
Ibex, the Spanish boursier index, lost about 4% since 8 November when the index was closed to 15.945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative vision.
Juan Solana, an analyst of Intermoney, believed that Ibex 35 could close the year to 16.000 points through the reorganization of portfolios and traditional delivery to the retreat schemes that are produced every year during these dates.
However, the expert noted that things will be a little different this year, since he believes that the rallye will take place from the second week of December after the bridge of the Constitution (6 December).
The analyst does not consider volatility to affect the market trend.
For its part, Federico Olucha, an Investis Bank analyst, evaluates that we are near the technical levels and "for that reason we may observe a rebonding of the index that could be caused in fonction of the information coming from the European Union in terms of the consequences of the crisis on the credit market."
The analyst hopes that these will be positive.
Analysts are agreed to choose the values that are responsible for conducting the Ibex to new maximum counts.
Solana, of Intermoney, claims "the great values are back for him this year."
The expert would include the two large banks and some constructors in the portfolio "for when the date is near, the electrical sector will be very valuable."
While, Federalico Olucha, Investis Bankco ensures that the hair will be from the bank and the industrial sector.
Constructions can also benefit from this rally, where they put it.
"ACS has been backing positions for several months and we hope that the other constructions like Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same way," explains the experts.
Cyclic consumption will be protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technological enterprises will do so very well, although there are no representation on the Spanish market in this case.
Five times for seven years
During the last seven years, only for two occasions in December a month was a bathroom.
The authentic finish rally of the year took place in 2003, during which the bourgeois markets have been deleted from the crisis caused by the technological swimmingness.
This year, in which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17 %, registered an increase of 6,68 % in December.
It should be seen if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of profit (for the time Ibex has increased 8,36 % since January) and if it has succeeded in computer on its final year rally.
The Popular Bank will open 200 offices on Sunday at 12 hours
The Popular Bank decided to renew a large part of its offices.
In total, 200 banks are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These succursales, who will operate under the Popular Max mark, represent a great change for the bank.
So for the rest of the Spanish organizations, since it was the first group that decided to start talking on the opening of its agencies until 20:30 and to open the Saturday from 10 to 20.30.
Another group that also reiterates several times that it would like to extend the time of its succursale, BBVA, even if it has not yet decided to do the first step.
It is on the point to conclude an agreement with the unions to close 75 per cent of its agencies instead of opening a after-midday but not to the public.
The results of the experience of the Popular Bank will be decisive for other organizations to adhere or not to this initiative which coheres to trade hours.
This is precisely the objective to search for the Popular Bank.
To shoot autonome customers in these areas to make their purchase in SMEs and street trades to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 agencies throughout Spain for about 18 months, since it is not the opening of new agencies but a renewal of existing agents.
For that reason, the body will modernize the succursale that he has already in the commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of customers in the different streets.
Thus, the simplification of time is composed of a different design from the succursale and a new, more modern design, with lighter colors.
The banking manager, Angel Rivera, ensures that this renewal does not include large investments, but the shipment of staff, as the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine by agency.
The Agencys, which will also have spaces for SMEs to gather there, will sell non-financing products.
A positive experience for the group
The Popular Bank has already tested its initiative in three Madrid Agencys.
And the experience was positive, as Angel Rivero explains.
The Succursales of the Murillo Brave Streets, O'Donnell and the Great Vía of Madrid are the streets to have been selected, and apparently successfully, according to the Rivero.
The People's Bank has now 2.500 succursales.
And 60 other who worked under the Mundocredit Mark, specialized in the case of immigrants, also with very wide times, even the Sunday and the holiday days.
In these PopularMax agencies, they do not copy the BBVA model, where many of its agencies have a large number of non-financing products for their sale.
'We do not want to competite our customers ', notes Rivero.
At the time they arrived in an agreement with Telephone to sell mobile phones, with an external staff to the bank.
Double TV for the first time the value in Bourse of its rival Antena 3
We've been here.
With this phrase, Paul Vasile, a delegated adviser from Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction, at the closure of the bourser market, when he found that the chain he directed doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
One aspect of his joy was: "What is bad to me, it's not the fact that we've increased but that we are less low," he stated.
However, he emphasized the fact that on a low market, we had less declined.
Telecinco finished last day with a progression of 2.54 per cent.
This gain stabilises its loss to 15.66% for one year.
The value in Bourse of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52 per cent of the capital) and announced by Vocento (13 per cent in more) reaches 4.488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
His Rival Antena 3, which has ceased 1.3,52% last night and which accumules 40.5% from January, costs half, 2.193.46 million.
The value of the other communication companies covered in Bourse is of 3.575 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.2.518.53 million in the Prisa (editor of Five Dias) and 1.779 million in the Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is due to the fact that we talk to two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do, on the same market, to what price and how we reward it in terms of hearing. '
Telecinco announced last week that he intended to become the first television chain to exceed 1,000 million brutal advertising income, such as Joseph Tringali, the delegate advisor of Telecinco and Publicspana, the branch that manages the advertising of the group.
In order to be realized, the television chain should register for the current year an increase of 3.6 per cent in its facturation for publicity compared to 965.4 million of 2006.
For its part, the net facturation of Antenne 3 increased by 1.6 per cent in the first nine months of the biennium (by reaching 734.4 million), while net television income increased by 0.7 per cent (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to the best relative development of Telecinco in Bourse is the important payment that he has maintained until now: in 2006, Alejandro Echevarría has distributed 100 per cent of the benefit between its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that, although it is early to take a decision, this ratio could vary after purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
' We have the official commitment to give at least 50 per cent, although we have always said much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to congratulate our shareholders, to those who have already given us titles with 33 per cent of Endemol.
According to analysts, the market gives signs of fatigue at this time.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced TV benefit estimates in 2008 to 4 per cent and 2009, to 7 per cent.
This should be explained to the decline of the expected growth of income from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5,5% to 5,1% in 2009.
The same company has reduced the prevision of Antena’s 3 to 4,5% in 2008 and 7,5% in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
The Ibersecurities company recommends to buy the two values, especially based on its significant rentability of dividends and its long-term potential.
2.
The Caja Madrid sees better Telecinco than Antenne 3 (many) for multi-actors and the increase in business.
3.
JPMorgan: It recommends to consider the two cases because it had similar threats (a clean market and a bad economic climate).

The harmonised consumption price index increases from five decades in November to 4.1%
This indicator, which serves after Eurostat for the calculation of the inflation rates in the European Union, provides a budget on price evolution in Spain during the month of November.
His publication responds to Eurostat's policy and the European Central Bank (BCE) by providing comparable data in time and in quality to those produced in the United States.

José Martínez Andreo replaced me last May, Juan Morales, the current deputy of the right, and until the municipal adviser of the matrix, which, according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Chain, could be the 'menor' of this trauma.
Agents continue to struggle municipalities and Uruguay's councils and are not discerned by the possibility of new arrests in the next hour.
Furthermore, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the principal suspect of the urban corruption tram, found at the beginning of this week, was imputed.
As the last night the SER Chain at the lawyer of the Deputy of the People's Party Juan Morales, it was arrested by the household of Morales with the important documentation in its ownership with regard to tram.

Good accepted to be the candidate of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo and to preside the Congress if they win the elections
The former Minister of Defense José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary-General of Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to be head of the list of Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the next general elections and to be President of the Congress where socialists will win general elections.
Thus, the organization secretariat of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco, and Bono even announced it during a press conference after the meeting that held the midday at the federal seat of this party with Zapatero.
The Executive Chief justified the offer to the ex-Minister because "that's important to account on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best."
He also stressed that "hey it seems to" that the political man of La Manche will be the candidate of the socialist group who will preside in the Congress if socialists will win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of the Congress, who made it public on 15 November his decision not to be presented to the next general elections and to abandon his political career to engage in fighting climate change in the university.
The former Minister acknowledged that the President of the Government did not stop attending that he returned to the previous political guard since he left it two years ago.
He also noted that, even though the citizens already know who will be the Economic Vice-President if the Spanish Socialist Party wins elections, his party wanted to announce the president of the Congress in a "transparency act".
If he reaches the post, Bono hopes to transform the room into "a house of respect and not the insulting or the cry" and to make "this seems more likely to the citizens".
"When it seems regrettable that the only local in Madrid where we cannot speak calmly and calmly is the Congress, the President of the Government in Senate has been interrupted 26 times."
Similarly, he had words for his current President, Manuel Marín and "to know" and did not want to do as if he had already worked for not to fall, as he noted, in which his adverse could be considered as "a domination".
A climate propaganda
Since the movement against climate change is subject to a persecution without misunderstanding also the sceptics of its predictions as well as those who give priority to other political and social battles, it must be demonstrated a coherence of fer.
This is the case for a leader of the movement that is President of the Government as Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than that of Islamic terrorism and that is even proposed to sign a “new contract for the planet”.
This approach is obligation to explain why the action, or inaction, of its Government has contributed decisively to Spain's head of the European Union in the non-compliance of Kyoto Protocols.
Those who are responsible for non-fulfilment, in which sectors it has been produced and why his Government, the contract with the planet, did not avoid it.
Furthermore, it must clearly explain to Spain what measures it will take to prevent climate change.
What enterprises will be affected, which habits of citizens should be covered, which individual and collective energy economys will be obliged to do, what economic consequences this would cause.
I mean, he will sacrifice and pay for saving the planet.
But there's nothing and there's no explanations.
precisely because it's to sacred and pay.
Measures against climate change, real measures are unpopular.
Costless, uncomfortable and threatening for business accounts and individuals.
Until the 100th of the essence suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party, he was so dangerous as in Zapatero that he was in the ancestor.
It is to say that it is to save the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With phrases that have the impact, committees, committees, protocols and new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this man is so useful for the election campaigns that do not speak, who does not rely, and who does not require meetings and inspires the tendency.
Since this is limited to be a purely virtual contracting party that does not claim to what we move in bicyclet or we refrigerate with the event.

My treaty doctor told me one of his articles on an estrange research: " The money produces cerebral activity, especially if others receive less than " .
It is to say that the feelings generating the monthly payment of workers depend on what the colleagues win.
The study was conducted by tomographic magnetic results at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest scientist number.
According to Bernd Weber, the author of the study and director of the group of neuroconscience images from the Life & Brain Institute in Germany: "The strongest activement was when the participant responded correctly and his companion failed."
The researchers noted that when the two persons were deemed to receive the same payment, the activation was moderate, but if one of them received the double, the activement was larger.
I don't know whether this conclusion would require so much science.

What insurance do I do?
The car insurance, which covers the driver towards wrong events, implies an important expenditure that depends on various factors, such as age, sex, old age, civil status, type of vehicle to ensure, or use, among others.
Having a car is the main one.
And it is that, selecting the suitable car assurance is even more difficult than selecting the vehicle model.
And it is that, selecting the suitable car insurance, it is even more difficult than to choose the vehicle model.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurance company.
This commitment is materialized by an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the granted and in exchange it is responsible for the obligation to pay the indentification in case.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is covered by taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, oldness of the driver permit, civil status, type of vehicle to ensure or actually use.
Insurance companies set their prices in accordance with statistics, so that the most likely to spend an accident is higher, the payment rate is higher.
This is why people over 25 years and women have to pay lower prizes, since statistics show that they have a weaker rate less than their care.
Similarly, the company concluded that marriage persons tended to have less accidents than celibatary conductors.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and therefore the probability of having an accident.
By increasing the frequency, the probability increases.
They are many of the variables that the assurancers take into account at the time of establishing the price of the premises.
That's why, the driver must well study the situation to choose the car insurance that is best adapted to his profile.
We will explain the most significant variables when you choose one or another type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the assuranceer, offers it a reasonable price.
Youths under 25 years of age must face different inconvenience when they are insured with an insurance to a available price, as they may be the low experience in conduct and the oldness of the driver permit.
Although the ideal to be well assurance is an insurance at any risk, there are other more economic options.
The most predicting drivers may opt for an insurance any risk with franchise, so that they obtain coverages of an insurance at any risk but to a more accessible price.
This convention implies that the customer pays a part of the left amount.
"The part of the left amount of the client will be established according to the value of the premises, which will be higher the amount will be lower", says Luis Noguera, responsible in Spain of First Europe, a mediator of online insurance.
Another option is the insurance of extensive third-party insurance, so that the customer provides protection to face damage caused by third-party, but by those caused by its own car.
Furthermore, it would cover the flight, fire and loss of the vehicle.
A advice.
If you are less than 25 years trying to be careful and avoid malicious as possible, because this will be impacted on bonification, which can reduce the insurance price for the future.
A bonification is a reduction in the base rate that has the company.
On the contrary, sanctions are a majority of the basic tariff.
" Bonifications and sanctions will depend on the company and benefit of that.
If the company has had a good year, it may allow you to increase bonifications ", explains Noguera.
Over 25 years this becomes easier for drivers at the time of a contract with an insurance, as the weakness rate is reduced by accumulated experience.
This is why it is preferable to choose an insurance any risk with franchise.
"True youths cannot benefit from the pre-acquired experience after an accident," ensures the director of the European company in Spain, and adds that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of conduct, once the fear of the novice is passed. "
However, if the customer is married but not yet a child, it is preferable to negotiate any risk insurance, at the time that its economic situation allows him.
Marriages with children are considered by assuranceers as people with the lowest nervous rate, since majority will be lower.
In that case, the best insurance would be an insurance of any risk with franchise (which could be 300 euros) or an extensive third-party insurance from the third year of life of the vehicle when the assurance has a high bonification level.
"They have a more decontracted conduct and have a larger purchase power to allow the luxury to assume a more important amount of franchises," judges Luis Noguera.
For retraditions, a risk insurance is preferable (e.g. 150 euros) or an enlarged third-party insurance when the assurance has a high bonification level.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver faced with events left, but also because it represents an important expenditure, it is why it is essential for a convenient study of the insurance that is the most appropriate to us according to our personal situation.
The Celtic will try to win a point in Milan to reach the eighth end
The Milan AC and the Celtic Glasgow are measuring next Monday in San Siro to find their lack of their respective objectives in the closure of the Champions, since it serves to Italians to be the first and the Scotias to classify themselves.
Italians totalize ten points and have already been qualified during the fifth day by a null match in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but it still needs another point to ensure that Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and which receives Benfica, who has four, does not pass before him.
These two matches of the D Group will play a week before the sixth day ends, since the Milan AC must discuss the semi-final of the Clubs Coupe in Japan on the 13th of this month in searching for a place for the end of 16 December.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the nucleus match at the Joseph Meazza stage seems to be the most expected result, although the two teams were trying to get victorious, since Italians did not want to split their homes and the Celtic Glasgow knew he would remain first and would ensure a better growth in the eighth end.
A defect of the Gordon Strachan's team could be enough to classify if Shakhtar Donetsk does not win, but it will not only be able to computer on this because with nine points the game returns to Ukrainians who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanians tried to empower the evening to the universists, who have a good hope to classize themselves for the eighth end of the second time at the League Champions, after being struck during the last edition by a purpose of Kaka during the prolongation (1-0).
By waiting for the victory of the "rossoneri" the triomphe would only return to Shakhtar, where the Celtic would lose, to classify himself for the eighth end end to enable the link to EUFA champions.
And it is that Benfica, although it is last and without possibilities to continue European competition, could reach the third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend in Vancouver at the first concert of the Spice Girls tour
The Spice Girls started in Vancouver (Canada), before about 20,000 spectators, their first tour since the group was deleted in 2000.
'Posh Spice ' (Victoria Beckham), ' Scary Spice ' (Melanie Brown), ' Baby Spice ' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice ' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice ' (Gereri Halliwell) declared a few days before starting their concert at the GM Place of Vancouver stage that the group meeting was "brilled".
About 20,000 people have shocked the tickets to attend the concert that was subjected to a video in which the group's history was raised at the end of 1990.
World meetings and tours are consistent with the launching of a new album which reiterates their primary success as well as two new songs, Headlines and Voodoo, which EMI is published in Spain.
The five members of the Girls Spice are mounted on the scene by showing the bracelets that the wife of Posh Spice had offered them, the British footballer David Beckham.
The sport was found in the public that filled the GM Place, even if Victoria had forbidden him a few days ago.
Beckham noted before the spectacle that the British footballer "I haven't seen our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think about spectacle."
Sporty Spice, which is part of the group in 1998 " because of the differences between us " and which has caused the dilution of the group two years later, has also expressed its nervousity during pressing, two hours before the beginning of the spectacle.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous, but I saw that the feeling of people changed, the feeling for the Girls changed.
And I thought why not, I am glad to have taken a decision," said Chisholm on the meeting of the group that she dismissed for nine years ago.
The song also noted that at the time, "the things have been arranged and we appreciate very much."
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl has been exhibited last time in 1998.
To begin, according to the CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver in a special aircraft of Virgin Airlines.
When they arrived in the airport, a baby army was waiting for them.
They account for her five sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the group was exhibered in California (USA), in San José( on 4 December) and in Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
They will be exhibited in Madrid on 23 December.
The new gas case between Russia and Ukraine is alarmed.
A disagreement on the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia, increased in the risks of the export of fuel exports to Europe.
The majority of Russian gas exports to the European Union (E.U.A.) are covered by gases, and each drive is slowly monitored.
Kiev announced that if Russia increases the fuel cost, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an alternation between the two, has caused a decrease in the supply to the United States countries.
The last conflict between Kiev and Moscow was after the Ukrainian Government and Gazprom, a Russian monopole company providing gas, tried to find an agreement on the cost of Russian gas for 2008.
Gazprom said that it would increase as expected, its prices to Ukraine as he agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gas from the Neighbor of Turkey.
The analysts said that this would be for Ukraine, an increase of 40% of the import costs from Gazprom.
“It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the conversation, remembering that we are a country through which most of the gases transit,” announced the Ukrainian minister of Economy, Anatoly Kinkh at the Press Agency.
"Gas cost fluctuations would certainly be related to our discussions on transit taxes (western Europe) through Ukraine"
The latest change between Moscow and Kiev was in January 2006, the interruption of Gazprom supply for Ukraine.
This resulted in the loss of exports to Western Europe, resulting in increased prices.
Russian gas is a fourth of the supply of the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, even though most of them are still developed.
Accordingly, Gazprom completes its own supplies with gas from Turkey and other countries of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health 'does control its foreign employees'.
The Scotia Health Ministry must improve the controls to be carried out on its extra Community employees to check whether they have previous criminals, the Board stated that it had the control.
The warning of the General Reviewer, Robert Black, occurred after a foreign doctor working in Scotia, was involved in the attack of Glasgow Airport in June.
Mr. Black also expressed concern about the fact that the Scotland Health Ministry has no specific data on the number of people employed.
The report also has been able to support other decisive controls, correctly carried out on a sample of five health authorities.
The general reviewer has conducted controls on the extra Community staff following the attack of Glasgow airport.
Bilal Addullah, 28 years old, was arrested by the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Pasley after shooting with his jeep in the main terminal doors.
He was part of three doctors who were filmed in the Old Bailey in October because they were suspected to be involved in various car explosive attempts in the UK.
The Ministry of Health must carry out pre-employment controls on other sea personnel, in order to be some of the validity of their qualifications, experiences and work permits for the United Kingdom.
Although the Scotland Health Ministry uses the ECSC to carry out previous criminal controls, the Agency has no right to obtain such information outside Britain.
Among the many warnings, the report of the general reviewer now states that the committees are obliged to address the Office on the Control of Criminal Preceding, which allows employees to undertake controls on different countries.
“ Although we have found that some information on staff have been well verified, it is not every time done.” report states the report.
Mr. Black said that the Scotland Health Ministry carried out most of the pre-employment controls that it would be done, but he also added: “The report is in mind of the aspects in which the system can be improved in order to ensure adequate information on some other health personnel members.
Mr. Peter Terry, BMA President of Scotia, said that it is "extremely impossible" that pre-employed controls could be identified by employees likely to make future terrorist acts.
He stated: "The report suggests that the pre-employment controls are being performed well in the Scotia health system and that it is not sure that these warnings can provide some additional values."
Scozian health authorities have declared employing 1161 other people from the sea, constituted for most doctors and nurses.
But the general review stated that these figures must certainly be revised to increase, in part because of the problems relating to the identification of uncertain contract personnel members, which could be chosen or not, to remain in our country.
The investigation showed that the current health control procedures in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are completely appropriate.
These controls are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
At this time, the Scozian Government reviews its policy and its pre-employment control system for other ocean staff members of the health service.
The Nicola Sturgeon secretariat said, "I was encouraging to realize this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow airport. "
It added that the Scotland Government associated with the health committees would consider carefully the warnings listed in the report that should be published in the next month, and would be able to ensure a better implementation of recently updated pre-employed and valid for all employees, including other people of sea.

The warrior, encouraged by the calls launched against the Saudi government for western, Osama Bin Laden, leader of Saudi origin, has targeted for foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
The last five months” stated the door of the minister of Internal Affairs at the state television by the armed forces.
Among the detentors, 16 members of the Media are organized in a “mediatic cell” to promote “Taxi thought”, the ideology of Sunni Muslim Radial Muslims who supports violence against unfaithful and apostate musulmans.
Among the detentors, 32 persons are accused of having supported warriors.
The climate of Venus could reveal the future of the Earth.
Scientists told last night that Venus had certainly been a pleasant planet to live.
The data from the European Orbit ship showed that the planet is certainly two times smaller than the Earth, in contrast with what was previously thought.
Venus is the nearest planet of the Earth.
These two worlds are almost the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the sun.
Scientists now believe that there are billions of years, Venus could have had similar conditions to the Earth, and could even have been habitable.
But the heat effect of carbon dioxide, the atmosphere due to solar radiations associated with a slower rotation led to Venus to all other kinds of evolution.
Today the planet is private of water, it is raised by weagans and light temperatures and has a quite warm surface to found it on the floor.
The discovery of Venus Express, the study of the European Space Agency, which studied the planet for one year, offers a tragic vision of the potential future of the Earth, due to the catastrophic changes of the climate.
Professor of the Physical Department of the University of Oxford, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the mission of Venus Express, said: "We begin to understand the reason why Venus’s climate is so different from the earth, although the planets themselves are practically similar.
"The new data allow us to set a scenario that has been thousands of years, Venus had been originally identical to the Earth, may even be with a habitable surface. "
The uranium was ricaned by the police.
A kilo of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was seized by the Czechslovakia police and Hungary last night.
One police said that three persons were arrested and that the material is currently analyzed.
It has not confirmed that it was well uranium, but showed that the goods had a value of $1 million ($480,000).
Still open to
Mitt Romney said not to be a candidate to the presidency to answer the questions of a good nest man.
Despite this, the Republicn candidates to the Presidency finally agreed to participate in the Youtube debate, during which many regular electioners have registered their questions, submit them to the candidates.
Wednesday, 28 November, no questions were so rigid that the issue of a further debate from You Tube, when a good neighbor asked the democratics their position in relation to the warming of the planet.
But this time, questions and answers have much reflected the conditions of the Republican Party, candidate to the next elections.
We do not know what criteria the CNN producers, who sponsorized the debate, have chosen the Tube clips to show to candidate aspirants.
But the first half of the debate, the longest approach of one theme, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strong ones for the Republicns.
CNN requested some phone electors when they heard a pleasant thing: The regime highlighted approximation hairs when candidates were slowly expressed.
The hardest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney, who is heading for the important elections of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to reiterate the fact that he was accompanied towards the native immigration during his New York Master's mandate.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former Governor of Massachusetts, to employ clandese immigrants in his home.
The two fighters became particularly fellow when they were asked whether they were ready to promote an amnesies (of citizens a regular status and the possibility of become citizens).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressist, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado Congressist, have been able to extend this topic.
No one has the possibility to be elected, but both remain in the course, it may be thanks to the fact that they have started fighting immigration before and more incisively than others.
Generally, candidates, at least in terms of immigration, have the same views: more strict borders, and Zero Tolerance for Czech immigrants.
This subject, associated with concerns particularly caused by the case of the toxic games manufactured in China, or other fears against the external world, encourages the Republicns to forget or minimise the divisions between freezers and Catholic conservators.
However, the debate was particularly encouraging when other issues have been understood.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether water in the nest should be considered to be tortured.
One of the intervenants asked whether the candidates believed in their totality, the content of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even if it is not about to believe in Jonas' story and baile.
Another intervenant asked whether Jesus had been in favour of death penalty.
We were not expected to see Mike Huckabee, - in pool position in Iowa at a recent election, thanks to his long-term Christian conservatism - to declare that death penalty is painful as necessary.
When it was emphasized to know whether Jesus had been favorable, he was riding and said that Jesus is too chic to present elections.
Human race remains unsolvably open to all.
Mr. Huckabee in Iowa co-initiated with the recent prodigious research of subventions conducted by the freezer Ron Paul, and the results during the mercredi debate.
These two are embarrassed by the native because the two protectioners of the party are not able to agree to decide who is the most known and more traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party in good-by-hour and convincingly thanks to a successful message on the United States size, thus approaching the leaders.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from being clear.
The pain of workers
Gordon Brown found a new throat in which darkness; even if he was dismissed, the situation would not change.
In view of the trend of the British Scandales, it is not particularly judging.
No sales decorations, neither parish hotel accounts of politicians, no swimming swimming feet extra swimming swimming.
But this is that a revelation shows that a rich businessman had been massed for four years, under false names, its contributions to the current Working Party, equivalent to $650,000 ($1.3,000), that the party would not have declared: a new battle of Gordon Brown would have been done.
Two months ago, the first minister went back in his electoral project, insulting the British intelligence proclaiming that the opinions did not influence his decision, and hoped that it would, in the other way, provide a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, Vince Cable, the brilliant liberal liberal leader, said that the terrifiant Mr. Brown turned from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The purchase of Northern Rock, a difficult bank on the board of the crack, showed a fall of directives and a medium-sized judgment in cases of emergency.
Inadequate proposals for change in the tax code have resulted in coalition of industrial groups against the Government.
The loss of 25 million personal data from the tax authorities revealed an incredible administrative barrier.
A three-general retreats launched a revolte among the Lords, protesting against the reduction of military expenditure: they declared that being Minister of Defence is for them, a part-time job.
At the present time, the suspicion of loose donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary-General of Travailists (and his former chief of supervisory) made that they had to leave.
Nothing does mean Mr. Brown's heading uncomfortablely to the outdoor.
However, governments may arrive at a point where it would not be able to rule.
People do not love politicians, and do not trust them, but generally leave their doubts of conciliation when a new government arrives to power.
It seems obvious that the first minister could not improve the things or even govern it for a long time when it risks the suspension: public administration does not work; the offices of the Ministers are balanced; the press for bad stories; and the government becomes defensive and without any goal.
In a sense, the position of Mr Brown is particularly difficult, as in contrast to other political leaders, it cannot be a starting man.
Although he would like to repair Tony Blair, he's just been his higher tenant.
The problems relating to Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to the decisions taken by Mr. Brown when he was lucky from the British treasurer.
And even if it is not directly involved in Blair's disasters, so the long investigation on the funds of the Party 'the money accounting for the members of the Chamber of the Lord's elections could think the other.
But the difficult situation Mr. Brown isn't so tragic that she's in the air.
Gaffes are not so monstered as the members of the Tories party believe it.
Like Mr. Bean, there's no victims or shocks.
And the remedie, although painful, may be to make the stalinian trends of Mr Brown always, in favour of a reliable and slightly cruel government.
The new scenario on political donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very particular person who compares his gifts to the charity, said that he did not want any public recognition of his welfare.
He may have his opinion, but it's not to him to decide.
The laws against the anonymation of the large political subsidiaries are clear, and they exist for a good reason: the public has the right to know who contributes to the success of those who will rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who was declared to be aware of the programs of Mr. Abrahams, without knowing that this was illegal, should therefore be interviewed, as well as Jon Mendlesohn, responsible for the collections of subsidys that had talked to doubtful donations in October.
But until now, Mr. Brown is not involved: No one lets think that it has been known about these steps, even though most of the payments have been made after his arrival to the government in June.
As far as the first minister has done the half.
He quickly condemned the legislative fault of his party, but he did not take attention to the fact that the decision-making authority is on a matter that he knows well, to rebuke an investigation committee on this subject composed of an each to the recruitment and a judge.
In that case, lessons to learn are not complicated.
And if the law was slaughtered, it's the police's resort.
Furthermore, there are other things that Mr. Brown must do, such as a permanent President for the independent Committee of Public Life Standards, without leadership for six months, and prepare a good reform on the financing of political parties.
This would force the Working Party, at a moment of weakness, to cooperate with the Tories, which could bring him to reject his special financial report with convictions; in short, a loved pillar for a partisan such as Mr. Brown.
But it should face some partisan facts.
The Conservatory Party now has a good advantage for elections; he has two years to reconcile elections, and the only way to obtain a victory is to demonstrate unreasonable integrity and solid skills.
Card shocks.
Does the crisis of hypothetics contain the American market of credit cards?
When there is blood in the water, it is normal to see shocked nagears, tourbillonner around.
Now that the American Immobile Market is through a critical stage, the predators are seeking the US credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts think that losses related to credit cards could be reached by $99 billion if the contagion is expanded to other credit forms for consumers.
Tension signs are clearly visible.
There are hairs in costs and insolvency rates, which measure the parts of the unrecognisable balance or which are, over 30 days later.
HSBC announced the last month that he took $1.4 billion in its consumer credits, partly because of the weakness of card ports.
He's too early to panic.
The costs and insolvency are still modifyed.
According to Moody, a fiscal agency, the insolvency rate of 3,89% of the third quarter is almost a point compared to its historical average.
Tax deterioration is partly explained by technical factors.
A change in the law in 2005 in the United States, on personal banking route, has caused a decreased fall of banking archives, which has caused large losses for credit cards; the number of archives (and therefore insolvency rates) could even increase if the payment conditions had to be empowered.
In addition, the industry announces fixed payment rates, which put the monthly sum of consumption to be resolved.
and confidence in the security of the capital of credit cards is sufficiently strong, despite the paralysis of other aspects of the structured financial.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the emission volume for 2007 will be over 25% over the last year.
The direct infection link between the hypothetic crisis and the credit card market are certainly existing: consumers could prefer to increase their ends now that equity real estate loans have disappeared.
But card issuers make more attention to species flow than to the value of the patrimonie, and therefore the loss of the prices of the immobiliary has not forced to change the credibility of the employees.
They could even benefit the credit appropriators.
Consumer prizes for the payment of hypotheses falls if the property cost less than the value of the payment; therefore, credit card incentive would be a priority to repay.
Card issuers are able to respond much more quickly than hypothetics and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or change credit limits.
This should, in the theory, reduce the risk of having a rapid recovery of actions.
“We're not going to wake up a morning and to review all the employees.” said the director of Capital One, Gary Perlin.
If a financial disaster of credit card market is impossible, there are strong risks to have a decrease.
If the lower prices of immobiliary and a contract on the credit market lead to the recession, the industry must certainly face a macabre future.
Take care of the dorsal nagears..
The British bankers claim to be guilty for Enron's case.
The three British bankers that were going to show their roles in a fraud made by the former financial director of Enron, Mr. Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, condemning mercredious faults.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew first declared innocent seven accusions for collusory prejudiciary in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial shock in order to enrich their employees.
They should be submitted to the court in January.
But during a hearing chaired by the American judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they all declared guilty to have made a fraud.
The three former lines of Greenwich NatWest, one of the PLC Royale Bank's Royale Group, have become famous all around Britain because of extraditions procedures that have been two years old.
In the United States, their case remains still a suspensive question for this investigation started after Enron's fall in 2001.
The accused infringements in 2002 understood Fastow that it was the subject of the government's investigation in Enron's debate.
The accused of the banking bankers, "Thirs of Natwest", declared to Houston in 2000 to organize a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his former right arm, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in an Enron's partner in controlled by Fastow, who was the publisher of many fraudul scenarios, which helped him to switch the bankway procedures.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated its interest in the subsidiary as no one, but in fact the three British people already knew their value.
A company controlled by Kopper purchased the interest of the subsidiary bank for 1 million £.
Bankers paid $250,000 in Kopper as interest in this company.
According to the accused, Fastow had falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was ready to pay $20 million in Greenwich NatWest for its activities in the branch.
But indeed, these $20 million went into the pockets of the British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the accused, bankers would get $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the other would win $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow was accused of his active role in two conspirations in Enron's slaughter.
The British triumph was arrested three months later.
Fastow ends a six-year-old prison in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is incarcered for 3 years and one month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British people were released after payment of $1 billion, which obliges them to live in the United States during the process.
Enron, previously the seventh larger national society, in banking road in December 2001 after years of accounting trucks, could no longer hide his billions of detention or even propose its bidon speculations as rewardable.
The expense has caused thousands of licensements, more than $60 billion of market value loss and more than $2 billion of loss for retrait plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and the former President Jeffrey Skills were sentenced last year for their implication in the eradication of the society.
Skilling was sentenced for more than 24 years of prison.
The accused of the Lay for conspiration, fraud and other crimes have been punished because of his death due to a heart attack last year.
Not under, nor out of Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and has a sufficient fuel autonomie to fly without shoot from Moscow in Los Angeles, part of $54 million.
But this is just a small change for some Russians.
“He can transport until 18 passengers” said Dan Firero, a representative of Gulfstream.
"If nobody really needs so much seats as it is more than a family use aircraft or the president of a society."
Mr. Fireer was present at the state of Gulfstream, last Friday, at the Military Hall, a consumption incentive orgic for four days, which is in a huge capital exposure centre.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibits were presented with their stands, expecting to highlight the interest of the new Russian riches for their varied products, going to the diamond cars like those of 50 Cents.
Mr. Firer tried a brilliant Porsche Orange, exposed to his stand.
“It's a beautiful car, but nothing comparable to our product” he said.
“ After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market.”
"The Russian capital seems to steal in black gold, such as Dallas"
“We lived the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and disabled in Europe where they would be considered materialists,” said Marshall Goldman, a senior Davids Department of Russian and Yugoslavian students at the Harvard University.
Like the Saudites in the 1970s, Japanese in the 1990s, Russians emerge as the largest worldwide expenditure.
The largest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another place in Moscow, a Luxe industry conference allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to follow the sale of luxury goods to markets such as Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which belongs to the New York Times Society.)
Russia has 53 billion dollars valuable to $282 billion, according to the Forbes list.
Moreover, two thirds of the riches are composed of $670 billion, according to a study on the development of personal riches in the former Soviet Union, which is carried out by economics of the Economic and Financial Research Centre.
(World Bank stated that in 2005, 15.8 per cent of Russia lived under poverty).
“There are hundreds of millions in Moscow, so why we are all there,” said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davids Morris, London Dutch.
She participated in the room for the first time in the company of the Russian distributor, the Soho Dutch Group.
“ Women are all well prepared, and men are valuable.”
The two real estate agents set on their 31th, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 declare that they are as their clients, millions of people.
"I looked at the cars and tried to choose between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche" said Mele Yumatova, who knew his high-cook rob, such as a veteran of the red mass like Joan Rivers.
The room seems to be able to fix new riches, the type of Russian brand buyers that are disposed to make the cheese in the mouth to come to an extensive entertainment where Cadillac Scalades are exposed to the Cadillac Scalades, Platinum channels, Mövenpick glass, personalized billard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund shoes.
The public could buy the tickets for 30 euros ($44,57).
“The Russians are interesting to define the most cherish and the best brands” said Mr. Gijrath, a component who is proudly sit at the Royal manufacturing Royal of Hollandese Porcelone Delf, in front of a Raimbrant's wall table on blue carreaux, hands.
"It's sure Russians are more interested in bling bling"
Indeed, the salers said that Russians with old capital (10 to 15 years are too in accordance with Russian standards) have already been expelled with a kind of limited edition mark that could not be sold in the room.
Despite this, thousands of people, or millions, millions or tourist employees, arisen the exposure every day.
And some even buy.
During the first night of the exhibition, on Thursday last night, Roman Ershow, the PDG of King Koil beds, declared having sold two sets of swimming masses, cahmer, and golden cotons.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumom, the director of A1 motor sale, a company who teams cars with recent alarm systems, also declared that he sold a Russian million, Porsche Orange, for $170,000.
From Thursday after midday, André Karapedan, President of L.A. Connection, a company who personalizes the luxury cars, said he would sell three cars like bracelets, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, to $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the route of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be covered by Swarovski cristales to look like a routine routine.
The four cost set of $22,000.
"The millions of Russians who want to swimming snakes, or a photo of his wife, made of cubic zirconium, will not swim with such pneumatics," said Mr. Karapetian.
It will certainly keep it in his garage containing already 30 or 40 vehicles »
Although many of its Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the expression “milkyan” is not at the agenda, given the increase in the prices of the immobilier here.
“If you had purchased a apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would be a million, at least on the paper, if it's not in a species” he said.
"There is more than you could think"
Those who aren't millions may at least feel that emotion when they go to the Continental Alliance, a Russian heritage management company.
The company has established four stands representing the British phone chains, filled with a mass of counterface.
Azad Karryev, company marketing director, said that his team had printed 500,000 false tickets for the Millennium Salon.
Passengers arrested to launch massas of tickets, request their friends from their photographer on their mobile, in a beautiful medium of this rich or well put some millions.
"You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel a million." Mr. Karyev said.
Unacceptable surgery murder in New Jersey
It was thanksgiving as Ronald Livingston looked at the winter bath of the restaurant Just a little Healthier and observed a ambulance that came to stop the white Cape Cod doors on West Scott Avenue.
Then the police's patrol comes.
And then another.
"The next time I saw the medical vehicle stopping." Mr. Livingston, a director of the restaurant, said mercredi.
That's where I realized that somebody was deceased.
The authorities later learned that the deceased person was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant director of the Police Department of Newark.
The investigators now try to determine whether the cause of their death is due to a gest executed by an unacceptable cosmic surgery, that the police has not yet identified, resident in 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of the death of Mele Arroyo, but they are expecting to be confident, the results of the toxicological tests that, helas, will take time, but should allow to solve this mysterious death that attracted the high parts of the Newark police.
Mere Arroyo was the assistant of the police director, Garry F. Mc Carthy, since September 2006, and his voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, great worker and tense,” Mr. McCarthy said about Melle Arroyo in a telephone interview, mercredi. ”
" she was like a pit bull"
" she would have done everything to protect me"
Mr. McCarthy said that Mele Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, an ex-agent of the Newark police who worked for the Alcohol Boss Control Commission, and that she leaves two sons of 14 and 11 years, as well as a beautiful boy.
Eileen Walsj, the word of the Union Council Park, Theodore J. Romankow, said that detectives were trying to determine whether Melle Arroyo was deceived because of an unlawful surgery operation.
“It is a possibility to consider.”
“The investigation continues.”
The authorities declared to be attended at 15.00 p.m.
and have found Melle arroyo on the sofa.
She was declared deceased.
A few more than one week ago, and the authorities did not say great-chose about the investigation or even on the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Mele Walsh couldn't confirm whether Mele Castro was interrogated by the authorities.
The investigators try to understand whether a part of the house was used as a medical office.
Mercredi, no one opened the door from Melle Castro where a fascinated roseer was located in the cemetery front, and a darmad abodied back.
A blue bidon called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute of the coffee vessel and for parfums, walked in a hamgar, along with a door that leads to the ground.
Two wheels of all the terrain raised on the coasts.
McCarthy said that since his arrival in Newark 25 years ago, the police Department of New York Melle Arroyo was extremely precious, helping him to navigate in the new city and to abandon its framework political culture.
“ she said, 'You must take care of this to this',” he said.
“I was there when I arrived, and still there when I went.
'It was angry'
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will reduce the rates related to global bourse.
The actions are exposed from the two sides of the Atlantic last, after the market hoped that the Federal Reserve would try to calm the credit conditions and then reduce the rates of interests promoted by the disadvantaged statements of the Vice-President of the United States Central Bank.
Busirian markets are explosed in London, New York and all in Europe after Donald Kohn, 2 after Ben Bernanke, President of the Federal Reserve, stated that those who decide, must be "flexibility and pragmatic" in their actions in the financial markets.
In a obvious effort to re-establish markets since these new pressures related to credit, Mr. Kohn stated that the recent turbulence was partly “inversed some improvements in the market functioning at the end of September and October.
In the case of this hard turbulence to continue, it would increase the probability of a strict future of the financial conditions for owners and businesses, it was said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear sign that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capitals in the United States markets, and that later reducing interest rates could establish credit conditions.
These reviews also allowed to calm Wall Street with even worse news on the American economy, as the largest decrease of real estate sales for October month.
The impact of this financial tuult has been highlighted following the Declaration of Bear Stearns, the Investment Bank, announcing that it will grant 650 people, i.e. 4% of its staff, to reduce costs to compensate the losses caused by loss of real estate loans.
Only 20 posts are planned in London where the bank is employed by 1500 people.
In New York, Dow Jones' average industry increased 331 points, about 2.55% concluded at 13.289.40 while the largest index, S&P 500, took 2,65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 was 2.1.5 points of 2.5% ending 6306.2 to the value of British companies.
The German Dax index increased by 2.6%, and the French CAC40 has taken 2.3%.
Previously, the reapparition of credit difficulties in the market was reliefd following the strong demand of sales for three monthly funds issued by the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European trade banks at a large rate of 4,7 per cent, which was the highest since April 2001.
The pressures on the Bank of England to monitor the ECB and the ECB and inject funds in London's financial markets that cause credit tensions, have resulted in the three-month " Libor" banks of British banks from September last, at 6,59 per cent of their strong reset since 12 November.
England is faced with an appeal to the judgment in relation to the critics of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are faced with two dilemes, the one as hard as the other.
Who will be the browser n°6 for the UK to Candy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a so large context than the first test against the Sri Lanka, who will take the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the selectioners, which was here exceptionally to help Peter Moores, a trainer, and Michael Vaughan, the Captain, to make his decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, President-General of England, began to fill the candidature forms to become a national elector at least part of time.
Whoever will not get back to the dossard No.6 will be missing, but life is often injust and the sport is also.
It is never easy to anticipate what a man allows to arrive at the top of his profession while another will never happen beyond the lower level, sometimes by lack of chance than by lack of ability.
It is not only the cricket that the selection is difficult, as at the end, the judgment remains subjective.
Is that the right time to evacuate Bopara?
Is that just about Shah?
The same thing could be proposed in another context, which would be chosen between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubby"?; both new frameworks that have been obtained from good, professional diplomas should be promoted: but there is only one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricket at least one chance?
The figures have their importance in decisions, but also opportunities.
In the inside of a team, a crycler must capture the eye of the captain, at the same time it must take the door and a browser must be lucky to touch the cryker of one day.
But capture the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
Many have done better the last season, for example, James Anderson, who seemed to be sure to play the first test, even though Stephen Harmison was fully declared and continued to lead to serve.
Anderson took 32 first doors on 33 tours to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same average, but both have already lived their moment of glory at the largest level and hopes to offer again.
If it's Shah or Bopara who plays at the Asgiria stage, it's just a question of opinion.
This choice could slow or build the carriage of a man, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each test and successfully successful in the first, with five doors and 40 useful tours, but Paul Collingwood, who also led to explode, who succeeded to become the first test cricket, and this, despite the fact that his double hundred marked against Australia could still be considered.
The probability prescribes that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, after another discussion after the current session at the Asgiriya stage, will certainly follow their conservator instincts and promote Shah's greatest experience against the outcome of the young Bopara.
The two have good arguments.
In favour of Shah, his brilliant and considerable start at the 88th Test in Bombay, 32 cents of first class against six for Bopara, which is seven years older, and its excellent launching classification.
But Shah did only ten tours during his two instances in May against the Caribbeans during the witness to Lord, his Middlesex player city, and that, the immediate rejection of the selectioners when Vaughan again claims his place for the next match, seems to have affected his elders as obvious in Bombay.
In contrast to him, Esex' player is full of joy to live.
There was no fear of him on a cricket field, and he was exagerated when he recently covered on a 4x4 at the presentation of Volkswagen, a sponsor of England.
He noted that slightly wounds, was shocked, even though the first thing he had done was to take his Vodafone (sponsor well above) and call Alastair Cook, his team who looked for him far, to ask him if 'He saw it?'
Bopara is far away from the best browser, his filant ring allows him to make services that goes to him, and to fight with confidence and professionalism.
Choose the just man is one thing, choose the right time in it is another.
Can it be the real art of the selection?
I would like to give his chance to Bopara, which does not mean that Shah must not apply if, like the tea sheets suggest it, he will play this weekend.
Buses bring people to work and fight against Qaeda.
The first bus filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria has arrived in Bagdad yesterday, crossing these exiles without money or renewment of visa, or others who hope that the city has found normality.
Some have been returned to fight against warriors who abandoned them from their home.
In the Mansour bus station, even before Damascus's arrival of 800 people transported into official government bus convoices, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan that were returned by their means.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad” said Sabah al-Qubasi, a doctor Sunni.
"I came back today because I saw the TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and saw that the city is more secure now."
“They say that the Mahdi army do no more crimes” said he, referring to the Milice Shia of the ecclesiastic militant Moqtada al-Sadr, who imposed his men to get away for the moment.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old teacher Shia of the Sunni area, was returned with his two children, because he couldn't renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevents the Iraqi workers.
His neighbors from Shia in Amariyah called him to inform him that the military aided by the United States, allowed to catch Al Qaeda from the west of the capital, and invited him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the chief of a Sunni tribe and Shia who had to leave his home north of Baghdad because of a attack on the Grenade after he urged citizens to rebelle against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to go back to fight.
"2 days ago, some of my friends called me and told me to have set up a mile against Al-Qaeda in Sleikh, and they needed me and my boys."
“This is why I return today” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62 years old.
Many of them say they have been touched by the growing capital acalmy since the United States armies have arrived, and in view of continuing training of “grupes of engaged citizens” well-armed and cooperating with the United States military to defend their neighborhood.
However, others say that they had been obliged to return because of the problem of visa and the decade of the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqi were fled over the past years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51 years old, was the father of three children, expressed the suspicion of all of the visa for exilations that Nouri al-Maliki, Prime Minister Shia, had requested the Syrian government to restrict people to return to the country.
More than two million people had fled from the country because of the secondary death scans.
“We have no problem until Al-Maliki came to Syria and encourages the Government to give them visa to Iraq, to force them to return to Iraq” said Sunni.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house when I'm gone."
The decline of violence may in part be explained by the fact that Sunnis has been discovered from Shia's areas and seeks to create places where the tensions are less.
It is feared that a sudden flow of refugees does not again increase the sectary tension and bring struggles.
Petite Sarre, good training.
The smallest federal State is in the field of professional training, and it is even slight by the international orientation of its higher schools.
It's only in a area that is a deficit on the Sarrus, like the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Sarrois that we are not French," is the slogan that the smallest federalized state, by self-derition, shows for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg played a major role in the Sarre training system, which is placed on the fifth monitoring of the German Economy Institute.
Thus, the higher schools already work closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Sarrebrock in 1948 by the Frenchs.
To this day, students have the possibility to complete their studies by a double, or a third diploma.
The high rate of 15.6 per cent of foreign students is witnessed.
The Sarre also leads children from the country to higher schools in higher numbers than the average - many of them without a Gymnasium diploma.
"In Sarre, you benefit from the professional training system," says Axel Plünnecke, experts and training at IW.
More than a youth over five obtains its title of study in a professional school, so Sarre is located over seven points above the national average.
So the combination of a professional and academic training is relatively well developed.
In view of the number of people, the double cursus panel is the second best in Germany.
In spite of a practical training and a growing demand, however, the number of technician diplomates have lowed a third in the past few years.
This is why the Ministry of Sarrus Education obliged the higher schools to a marketing campaign in engineering sciences.
"Besides the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools," said a speaker door from the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the Government introduced comparison tests in the entire federal state.
In order to begin early to learn, the last year of cricket is exempted from law - a model that also copies other federal states.
Only future comparison studies can show whether the performance of students is sustainablely improved.
In PISA studies in 2003, risk student rates reduced from 29 to 20 per cent.
However, Sarre has not improved as well as other federal states.
The bavaroes get better out of here.
And in spite of sarrois, knowledge in foreign languages is not measured by PISA studies - it could be possible to win points in this area.
Because the language of the neighbor is binding in the schools - even if Sarrus isn't French.
Chávez Rules the watches
In Venezia, the watch will soon be tic-tac different than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chavez will resign the cronograph of a half hours in South America.
Keys become a load in Spain between time and time.
As the Official Journal of Venicela communicated, by a new law, the samples will be regulated at least four hours and half of the universal time.
Thus, South America has obtained an temporary shock that is not in any other state of the world.
The anti-American Anti-American Chavez justified his position among others by the fact that the United States would have imposed the separation of Time guns in full hours to the world.
Furthermore, Chavez announced merger (local time) the end of relationships with the neighbouring country, Colombia, because of a case of opposition.
The left nationalist announced that as long as the conservator Alvaro Uribe would remain President of Colombia, he would not have a relationship with the Head of State, nor with the Colombian government.
"I can't, already because of my dignity," said Chavez, who has a constitutional reform on which the oil citizens of the country will have to vote on by the way of referendum tonight.
With this reform, he would enhance his power in the country.
The delayer of this conflict was the decision of Urib to retire the negotiations mandate on the release of oppositions with the marchist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe would have "classed to the face" of Venezia with this decision, who had criticized Sunday Chavez.
In Spain also Chavez is in all mouths.
A new portable phone sound is funny in the country: "Why don't call you" (for you don't think it) is the phrase that more than a half million people have downloaded on the Internet.
She was pronounced by the king of Spain Juan Carlos, who, most recently Ibero-American Summit, was encouraging by the continuing interpellations of the left-to-left popularists and said to be able to stay.
A decline in the wages threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong conjunction, according to a pronotic, a real less value of the wage threatens German employees this year.
Experts found all kinds of reasons for explanation of their pronomatic pessimist.
According to Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees should wait for a real reduction in their payment card in 2007 compared to the previous year.
"The fault returns to low wages development, the increase of the tax on the added value and the mount of the prices of food and energy products", said Gustav Horn from the Institute for macroeconomic and Conjunction Research, in the "Image".
New charges could also be taken in the field of unemployment insurance for employee.
The Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück said in the newspaper "Neue Osnabpresser Journal" that the decreased decline of the job insurance of 3,3 per cent for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency has no right to enter into the embarrassment to request the Federation of Financial Accounts or Financial Agency, according to the words of the SPD politician.
It was noted that the exploitation of the prices of food and hydrocarbons had been covered in its highest level for 13 years.
In total, prices increased by 3.0 per cent of one year to another.
Venus is the helmet of the earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere to life, Venus seems to be more like the Earth than it was believed until now: the European space son of "Venus Express" has discovered lights in the atmosphere and pool wind tours, like those appearing in winter on the Earth.
Since almost three decades, scientists believe that there are lights on Venus.
The European "Venus Express" son today has proved - she has detected electrical waves at the limit of the atmosphere: the lights on Venus shut up to a height of approximately 56 miles cloud cloud, reporting Christopher Russel of the University of California at Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Natura".
According to the famous Cyprin theory, the eclairs would have shown the life on Earth: the gold would stimulate reactions in the oceans that leaded to the training of amino acids, a stone of angle of life.
This is not the case on Venus: "If life has been, this must have been at a very old date of history," Sean Solomon explains the "Carnegie Institute" in Washington.
There should be no good thing living on the surface of Venus today: the atmosphere is about hundred times deep than on Earth, sometimes there are temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus may be the helmet of the Earth, but she remains a jumelle," said Russel.
Why Venus, who is so like the Earth in mass and dimensions, has been affected by such a different development, is the fundamental issue of the ASE mission.
The start of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in Venusian research, as no sound was on the road for the exploitation of this planet since the twenty-third years.
According to researchers, the most recent research results now presented in several "Natura" articles are not only highlighted by Venus's uniqueness within the sun system.
They also show that the common points with the Earth of our neighbor planet are more than first.
Thus the researchers have found, in addition to the wind tours already known at the northern pool, a torch of swimming clouds in the south pool, which turns even more faster.
The phenomenon recalls the air courses in the winter hemispheres, writes a team of researchers around Joseph Piccioni of the Astrophysica Space Institute and Cosmic Physics Italian.
The second planet of the sun system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12.100 km, almost too large.
The qualified planet of stars of night or morning turns around the sun in just 225 days.
However, she turns slowly on herself: a day of 243 Territory Days.
While Venus, with 460 degrees of surface temperatures of Celsius and 92 bar pressure, does not remember the Earth, scientists suggest that the two planets have been formed in similar conditions.
On both sides, the water was accumulated and remained on the Earth in the form of oceans, but it was lost in the Venus space.
And while carbon dioxide has been fixed on Earth as carbonate, it consists of the most largest part of the atmosphere.
Pohler defends Merkel's meeting with Dalaï Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Kohler requires the end of the desire of the parties on the welcome of Dalai Lama to the Championship.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPDs because of the attacks against the chances after the meeting in September.
The Federal President Horst Kohler is concerned about the appearance of Germany and summarises the great coalition of closing the coalition about the welcome of Dalai Lama.
"We don't have to present a divided nation on this issue to the outside world", said Kohler to the Commerce.
Parallelly, Kohler shows the understanding for Dalaï Lama's arrival by the luckyer Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity, although I have respect for the differences between cultures" said Kohler.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensible balance in the field of foreign policy, urged the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against the reproachs that it would organize a new Chinese policy.
The German lucky has not taken its distances with the traditional policy of one of China.
"The Chinese also knows it," Kohler said.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly known its inconsistence with regard to the recovery of Dalai Lama and was attacked outside the CDU.
Steinmeier was complained, in particular, of the "prevention policy" of the DDC in the field of foreign policy.
After receiving Dalai Lama to the Chancellery, virulent irritations felt in the German-China reports.
Thus, the Chinese Government has not only recommended the Minister for Finance Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also, according to Spiegel's information, the dialogue has also been completed with the wording dialogue of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the two countries.
The Chief of the Chinese Wen Jiabao government now requires the German chancesman Angela Merkel to recognise that Dalai-Lama was a mistake.
China refused that European political men receive the Chief of Tibet in their official functions, supporting Wen Jiabao thus the Chinese position.
The words and acts of Dalai Lama would show that it would try to separate China the Tibet and other Tibetian regions, including other current provinces.
Schauble guards emblems like those of France.
Street battles with the police, tisss, fire cars: Wolfgang Schauble keeps guarding shoes like those of France.
Everything should be implemented to ensure that social inatisfacy in Germany does not disappear in the streets by violence, the Minister of Germany requested.
Barricads that burn, shooters shooting on the police with chase shooting shooting shooting shootings: after the serious young employees in France, the German Deputy Wolfgang Schauble (CDU) minister fears a similar development in Germany.
We need to ensure that a social explosive does not also exist in our homes and disappoint violence.
We must take this seriously," he said to "Neuest Presse" in Hanovre.
All young people would not be able to get out with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the Federal States and the Commons had already worked closely to reduce the problems, said Schauble.
This would not only touch immigrants' integration.
"For the sums of integration in the Islamic conferences, this already shows its first success."
But it would be too early for a warning end.
Schauble notes at the same time as in German banlies, there are no social problems or urbanism views as in France.
In the northern Paris agglomerations, young people were delivered to serious street battles with the police during the last nights.
To the same time, public cars and buildings burned.
More efforts to integrate the German Government, this was what the President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
With regard to employees in France, Kolat was guarded against the "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
But it would remain a need for action.
Kolat emphasizes that the rate of unemployment in young people under 25 years of immigration would be higher than the average.
There should be more places for training.
Kolat stressed: "We must give young people a perspective."
However, the President of the Turkish communities added that a social control in families was more than in France.
Many young people from immigration do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat was urged, "But we must even be careful."
Youths should be "wise given the opportunity to participate in the work and training."
By waiting, in the Paris Faubourg of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very calm during the night.
Police units were established, a helicopter overcome the area with projectors.
The poster authorities took part of three arrests and a few burned cars and powders.
Since the conference, a deployment of about 1,000 security forces ensures peace.
The police will take as long as necessary, announced the Minister of Internal Affairs Michelle Alliot-Marie, after visiting the Faubourg.
On Tuesday night, about 80 police officers were blessed during employees in Villiers-le-Bel.
The next night, the problems were cut into Cœdès.
The emigrants shouted after a movement accident in which two young people lost their daily life.
According to the first elements of the Parket, the police is not responsible for young people's death.
In the Empire of Angela Merkel.
The Utopical Scene entry of the chances shows that coalition ended with the background - and that there is no more to wait for it.
In what country lives this happiness in righteousness?
After its delusive intervention in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor content, it must be said: not here - in the country that finally should be registered by it.
The opposition of too much focus on the policy was repressed by Angela Merkel by a hard and presumable phrase.
It is provincial, has she said and only showed that she did not want to understand what the critics want.
In Parliament, she made it clear to how exact this reproach was.
There was no concrete interest or no feelings for the problems of the country to feel.
On the other hand, Angela was present as a cloud: a spectacular politicalman who flew into foreign policy and still remains there.
For example, climate protection: In this regard, it still welcomes Heiligendam's agreements, but does not say how climate goals will be achieved in our country.
Indeed, self-related - having too little modesty, the head of the DDC would have rejected it two years ago.
Now, she is shocking all the facts that growth would affect people.
Thus it destroys its image of pragmatist, which resolves the problems instead of embarrassing the world.
But in the empire of Angela cloud, internal policy problems are a marginal phenomenon.
The poverty in children and the concerns of workers at low salary?
It remains a few accessive phrases for this.
In this matter it is revealing the number of times where it makes children when it is family allocation.
Here, Merkel needs three starts to express a specific half-specific phrase.
She is in unknown terrain, from the moment where it becomes concrete.
The Attaque branch
In the debate of Youtube of the Republican candidates to the President, the two favorite Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are a hard offensive battle - and they must now be afraid of a foreign candidate.
The tension of candidates is already the first subject.
He would have made New York a "refuge for citizens" reproached Mitt Romney to his adversary Rudy Giuliani.
This is against his side by pleasantly reproaching: "I would say that her own house was a dinner for clandestinis."Juliani answered and reproved the former Governor of the Massachusetts to have employed immigrants without paper.
The candidates have been attacked: as the Republican base has no official favorites, the eight candidates to the President are the debates on CNN before all to discredit their opposites.
The amazing films of 30 seconds that the Internet users sent through Youtube are more than soufflers.
"It's with that kind of isolation we left Hitler to come to power," John McCain launched to his candidate Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to claim an immediate retirement of Iraq.
Romney also has been strictly taught by Vietnam's veterans when he refused to condemn as a torture what is called "Waterboarding", a questionnaire method where the noyade is simulated.
However, the fact that the important topics of the campaign are over time beyond the war in Iraq and torture debates are seen in the reactions of the St. Petersburg Joint Room in Florida.
If the conservatory values are loaned or future tax hairs are rejected, applaudements are deferred in the audit.
There is again one of the weaknesses of the two favorites.
"I've made a mistake at this time," Romney contrôled and expressed forgiveness at the base and television public for having yet been an abortion party in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, passes in a cooked ned when he is asked for his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf ruled for the first time in civilians.
One day after his retreat as a chief of army, the Pakistani Power Man Musharraf was invested as President.
So eight years of domination by the army ends.
The President of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf was invested on Thursday for a new five-year term.
The Pakistani television has directed the ceremony to the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf pleaded to respect the Constitution and act for the well-being of the United Nations.
Mercredi had transmitted his army chief to his confidence Ashfaq Kiyani, and was thus increased to international pressure, including the United States.
Eight years after his power to be taken by a pocket without blood flow, the former general now ruled as a civil status leader for the first time.
With this retreat of the headquarters of the army forces, Musharraf complied with the main requirement of opposition and Western.
Another central requirement is the end of the emergency state that Musharraf was decreed on November 3th.
Soon after his investment, Musharraf will suspend the emergency state, according to the advocate-General Malik Muhammad Qayum, and so will meet another requirement from the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied after the establishment of the emergency status with the lawyers of his ranks, rejected the last week all the remedies against the controversial solution of the Head of State on 6 October.
Among the time, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region in North Waziristan in an attack against a military convoi, and four other wounds.
According to the statements of the army's talking port, a bomb was explosed in a street near the Afghan border.
The fathers of Krautrock make them back.
The German supergroups of the seventy-year-old years welcome: the three members of the Harmonia Group have again taken their console in a concert in Berlin.
For their return, records of their great success "Leve 1974".
By that time, they were well known in the foreign.
The planned sense is then produced in the form of three masters announced at the night show.
Everyone has his little bottle before him, his cable and before all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, a 63-year-old throne in a white chemistry as black.
It is flanked on the left of Michael Rother, a 57-year-old boy and a portable computer and a guitar.
Right, observed by the whole audit, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73 years old, runs on its console.
Everyone contributes to the sound, among others, a Beat.
And sometimes this joys in an inadvertence to a traditional music piece.
This does not seem to be too depressed by their own masters.
The fact that the Harmonia group again played has assured some emitted among Krautrock's amateurs.
There is the right to declare it here: targeted analysis reveals that the name is certainly reasonable in the collective memory of the pop, but in no case so durablely so that this group lose too deteriorately for 32 years.
But why would the German not have the right to celebrate his live legends in the years 60?
More than what is falsely called "Krautrock" has more in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry declined in 2003 the Echo price to the survivors of the Cologne Can group for their work, the Dutch-in-law faces were seen in the hall.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the Düsseldorf and New! Groups in the panegic lounge, the shock had no more limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother was saved on the scene of the Red Hot Chili Peppers as a old friend.
The problem of ignorance in itself and transfiguration in unknown is the only and unique.
The memory is already taken by Harmonia, because the triumph has been only two years and that during this period, the effect power that has felt was very lower than what was given by others.
Moses and Roedelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
We first played in the caves below the Berlin scene.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a church-subsidy label, for financial reasons.
Rother had writtenly deployed in power work and finally was a name as a guitarist with New!, which may have been at the time the German most radical group.
In 1973, however, Rother followed Cluster's musicians in exile in the Weserbergland forests.
There, in a firm old man of the Weser, a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as a member of the communities flying the city.
Not ideal than in "Commune I" community where Roedelius had the right to turn into as a nursing.
Soon an artistic existence in Spitzweg.
It was found in the powder a fanon of the Harmonia Ottenstein chorale and also a name for the art.
Many residents Harmonia are far away from this.
The first album is called "Music of Harmonia", and the following "De Luxe".
Because also severe and modec that played music, the group suffered from material poor.
The colleague of the dead wood would not be for him alone to search for himself.
The "Live 1974" CD was registered at a concert in Greece before a public record about 50 heads, as well as someone believed to remember.
Rother was employed to force Harmonia at time.
This was an immoral requirement for Roedelius and Moses.
The group announces its separation in 1975.
Rother atterit in the shoes of the shoes of the shoes and guards its existence with albums such as "Flammed Herzen" (Flames clouds).
Cluster reanimated in the twenty-twenty years and has been more successful than Harmonia ever had.
We need the Greek Live Album to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His label Grönland was set to enter the Krautrock as a German contribution inherent to the modern music.
New! had already been deterred to this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia took place at the World Cultures House in Berlin.
Publicly subsidied in the framework of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, the old pocket and author of the "Krautrock Sampler".
There's also the loveparade inventor, Dr. Motte.
By which the whole fluctuation margin of the influence of the Krautrock would be covered to the future pop music.
The left place by the group will be compiled by Harmonia.
The phrase of Brian Eno plans in the room at the middle of the unique sounds: "The only real music, you listen to the future."
There are photos showing producers with Harmonia in the close room.
The projections of other black and white photos of cable-based tools serve the legend training.
Before, the three veterinaries are again occupied to improving.
But more in collecting microphones to the orphan and the battery, to drive the sound instruments through the instruments for self-building effects.
Today, electronic music is similar to electronic music.
The three in great technical figurers.
So even the house's shore will not change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morningster, we are shooted and shocked under the sound cloud, and we sing at a beautiful moment "Ayaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
He never worked rock.
The roots were less seen in the blue than in music conservatorys (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the escape of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever cries "68" has not completely badly, and Harmonia is also now not going to be irritating by this now.
But what's going on, it's gonna be covered in a minute on the scene.
Where's music starting and where does it end?
This can be touched on the nerves of someone (?) or give swimming moments of great joy.
Richard Gere isn't just a cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "The Mortier Peix", two films retrace the Balkan war.
But they're not convinced.
Each projects are too expensive about the action and the exchange of insensitive tissues, or on the other hand they are too slowly.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news first: certainly the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but it's just there, in the back-counter of Bosnian war, that the actor Richard Gere is then found.
We had recently lost the most beautiful man in the twenty-twenty-five years, because too much of pleasant and humble roles in films with feelings for women and too many press conferences on the topic of buddhism had the desire to show herself.
Today Richard Gere is the most important argument to look at even "The Hunting Party" - when the chasseur becomes chasing (for what today's films must they be so long and confusion as collective conventions of locomotive drivers?)
He books a beautiful representation of eye clinds: on the ground, his personality of war reporter Simon Hunt was what Gerre could become, if the destination and the film industry weren't so good: a man who had his best moments for a long time behind him, but who, even as a monument in ruin in his decline, maintained the visible remains of his old charm.
However, despite this outcome, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production of "Slaughter Pax", which also produces this week, the unfinished follow-up of the Balkan war.
The film speaks of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb of the Kosovar's drivers, one of which is still slowly loved.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs are not once presented as the only causes of all laughs, this film as soon as a telefilm lost too fast in the action and exchange of insensitive tissue.
This remains a kind of "Alarme for Cobra 11" without authorisation but with a war at the place.
On the other hand, the perfect example of The Hunting Party can be examined why there was never a real film on the Balkan War.
The story of the three American war reporters, who are condemned to raise the high war criminal "the return", may have become, with another realist and another scenarist (all two times Richard Shepard), at another time, a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories are likely shocking: two young men go in a small team in the forest, to achieve something that the military can't do and for the two men, this becomes a trip in the fool.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that we simply do not let Simon Hunt be the cynician deseared with a heart, as it is present at the beginning.
No, the script must be attributed to overwhelm a romantic aventure with a Bosniac killed later.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitively bad, when reporter, in the space of the last five minutes, by a accelerated process, leads to the NATO, the CIA and all world's prize chashers have not succeeded in five years: to take the war crime and let it be for a fair vengeance to the Muslim Bosnians.
It is so bad that the International Court of Crime against cinematographic logic should be introduced.
In this case, the film has too deep concern for human concern.
He wants to argue that Karadzic and Mladic are still free, and he sustains Americans and French (especially agreed) that they do not lead sufficiently intensively because of secret political agreements.
But the intentional and wicked are so like this time as a famous poem of Brecht comes to the idea.
This speaks of a wood mask of a Asian demon on the poet's work table: "Compatible, I see the vines of the glove front, clearly: how it's fair to be bad."
The films like "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tiny heads, but they are instructing the way it is fascinating to be good.
The problem is not limited to the type of films on the Balkan war.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood films on Iraq were great flops.
We can add: there have never been good films on South Africa.
What's going on every time: when a star goes on a crisis home or on a mine field, there's something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Ireside go borderen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still too close in time.
Whatever it is, decades have always been before Hollywood could turn a good film on the holocaust with "The List of Schindler".
Some films must still be matured - those who today value classic works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Fulll Metal Jackett" have not been celebrated in any case as heads of work.
But maybe we also know today too much about the world's conflicts, where each hecatombe is directly on two screens at the same time at home,
And this welcomes the scenarists the lack of scrolls they need to tell beautiful stories.
"Indeed, being or not being" or "The Dictator" have become so good as Lubtisch and Chaplin had not yet known as the nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe we don't want to be good when we want to do good movies.
It may have to have the sarcastic and distance artist Lawrence Norfolk.
When it was asked about the parallel between his historical "Dictionary of Lemprière" and the Balkan war, he said, "If some things never changed."
"The great cities will always be terriblely dangerous, men will always be killed in a terrible manner and the war will always rule in Yugoslavia."
By Beust collects the criticism for the cancellation of the Olympics.
The recruitment of the master with Hamburg's candidate for the summer Olympic Games was in the policy and economy with critical virulents.
Many want to continue to fight for the Games at the edge of the water.
But Van Beust calls for reality in appreciation of chances.
The main director of the Humbourg Trade Chamber, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described a leave as "mawn for the local economy".
In recent times, no other project had been deployed as many motivation forces in the city as well as the idea of the Olympics.
"On this objective, the political and sporting shell could not be maintained in the same measures."
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senate to not enter the project, but to find him a new long-term start point, "what takes as a start point another agenda changed."
Master Ole van Beust remained merry to his previous statements, according to that the Olympic ambitions of Hambourg were irrealistic at least until 2028.
"This is not Hamburg that decides to take a candidate to the Olympics, but the German Federation of Olympic Sports" said from Beust to WELT ONLINE.
He returns to the expected decision of the Sports Federation at the beginning of December, on the candidate of Munich for winter games in 2018.
This preference means for us, that in the time laps that we had planned up to 2028 until there, we have no chance."
However, the dream is not definitely in the past, said Von Beust.
The Hamburg Sport Federation (HSB) regretted Beust's statements.
This would be the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to make his candidate for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to close an opportunity by entering projects already", said the President of HSB Beneter Ploß.
An abandon of the candidate would be more contradictory with the statements of the Head of the Senate at the time of the plenary assembly of the German Federation of High Schools.
There, Van Beust had qualified Hamburg's candidate at the University of 2015 as not "not a substitute" at the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Sport High School Federation was first in the last weeks named Hamburg as a candidate city.
The SPD SPD fraction encouraged Senate to have not used this valuable time in the construction of housing in Hamburg.
"The development of Petit Grasbrook was rejected by the Senate for years because he has played the map of the Olympias and excluded the construction of housing," said the delegates of SPD Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always called for Petit Grasbrook an integrated plan in the Olympics and post-use of housing, the DDC would have made it only on the "factor".
The candidate for the Sommer Olympic Games in 2012 would be a great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
However, Hamburg was struck against Leipzig.
It's not warhols boxes.
Those who connects Sweden's concepts and casts wood, thinks to Ikea, but not to Andy Warhol.
Or so?
At this time, wood wood boxes made in Sweden have shadows on the list of Warhol works.
A large part of the twenty-third Brillo Boxes listed there are contrasts.
After the Swedish "Expressen" journal some months ago the authenticity of the Brillo-Boxs of Andy Warhol in 1968, the internal research of the modern museum of Stockholm reached a designer today: the six "Brillo-Boxes" whose former Museo Pontus Hulten gave a gift in the modern Museum in 1995, are copies - as well as a large part of the other hundreds of Brillo-Boxen of "Type Stockholm", which circled on the international market.
The ancient history is completed, a deceived conquest of artistic and curative productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, the wood boxes, which are based on the red-bleu-blank design of saving cards in powder "Brillo".
A exhibition of his work at the Modern Museum was presented in 1968 - with the Warhol Agreement - hundreds of Brillo cards made by warhol, which did not come (for financial reasons) but were directly delivered from the Brillo Carton manufacture.
It was not here with art works, but instead of their models, exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had granted authorisation in 1968 to produce a number of Brillo wood wood boxes in Sweden, which were not exposed to the Modern Museum.
The witnesses of the time speak today of about 15 wood boxes that would be right entry into the history of art and shops, as the original Brillo Boxes of Andy Warhol, with the call "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have been reached in the sales for more than $1000,000.
The problem now is that the Legendary Leader of the Museo Pontus Hultén, who was depressed, had been produced and exposed in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol had then ceased.
Indeed, the 105 Hultén castles were produced in Malmö in 1990 only for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that date, Warhol was already dead for three years.
Lars Byström, Chief of Modern Museum, examined, along with the six Brillo Boxs of the Museum, three other Sweden private collections, between which two were confected in Stockholm in 1968: their strategic panels were printed and pushed, then were applied with a white oil painting.
The texture of copies that from 1990 depends on the contrary that the painting has been applied directly without the underlying corner on the strategic paintings, using a round of painting - moreover it is not a painting on oil, but a acrylic.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be taken from the official list of Andy Warhol Brillo Boxes," lets the director of the modern Museum Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come another decision, the modern Museum will class the six cases in its collection as an exhibition copy".
By July the Board's hearing, the Authority announced that he would investigate the "their charges" which will be understood in the case of powder slaughter boxes.
But since we're over there with an inexorable silence.

In the Philippians, rebellious soldiers leave, the same as they were launched in a hotel in Manilla, and who requested the retirement of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
