What indicates that Russia comes from the crisis?
Economists saw the signs of Russia's exit from the most permanent recession in the last twenty-first years.
As noted by the requested Bloomberg Analytic Agency, the RFB demonstrates a positive dynamic - in the second quarter of GDP slowed to 0.8 per cent in the annual expression.
This indicator is minimum since the beginning of 2015.
According to the last data, Russian economy in the second quarter was decreased to 0.6 per cent.
The stabilisation of the situation has also recently been declared by the Centre and the Middle Eastern Development.
Previous growth.
According to the CIA experts, the recession in the Russian economy remained in the past.
"The Russian Index evaluation states that recession remains behind, and the advanced growth of the economy," says the Russian Bank Bulletin "What is talking about trends".
The module assessment of GDP for the current quarter of regulators has increased by 0.4 per cent, the fourth quarter is 0.5 per cent.
As noted by the representative of the Minoon Development, during the second quarter of GDP RF was stopped in the second quarter, 0.2 per cent.
In the second quarter, the purified period of GDP was 0.2 per cent to the previous quarter.
However, during the quarter decline, it was 0.2 per cent in April, and in May and June the GDP change was 0-0.15," quoted the representative of MED RIA.
The delay of the Russian economy during the last five quarters shows that "we have been long."
Among other marketmarks that indicate national economy live, Bloomberg calls for an increase in electricity demand and iron transportation in business.
If adjustment to that year is high, it is understanding that the dynamic can be more than 1 per cent of electricity consumption in a further working day.
Add to this lower average year temperature in the first quarter.
The following argument is the growth of load transport, but it is difficult to get exact data and 0.5 per cent of the half-year amount can also be explained,” explains Kirill Jacobonko from AROR BROCER.
Others, however, are more obvious signs of the stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, a reduction of value pressure.
The consumer price index was 7.2 per cent compared to 15.6 per cent in the same month.
Moreover, the last two weeks of Rosestat fixes the deflation.
The prices in Russia have been decreased in the first five years.
If you look at the dynasm of the rubber, which has shown the strong collapses at the beginning of the year, the results of August have been increased to 12 per cent since the beginning of the year.
This is also one of the signs of recovery for which indicators should be taken from the real economic sector,” emphasized Jacob.
In addition, from April to April, industrial production is increased.
In June the rate increased by 1.7 per cent.
In January 2016, the decrease of the decline of trafficking was from -32.8 per cent in May 2016 to -20.7 per cent in May.
The positive dynamic also demonstrates the situation in the labour market, where unemployment levels reduced to 5,4 per cent.
He was only in September 2015 (5.2%).
Despite the well-being situation in the labour market, the issue of the real income of the population is to remain better.
In the annual expression, the indicator is decreased to 4.8 per cent.
This factor may cause economic recovery, since household costs have a small contribution to GDP.
Normally, their share is 50 per cent in the economy structure.
In addition to a low consumer activity, the Russian Bank's huge policy can also be called as a risk factor for economic growth.
The regulator keeps the rate of 10.5 per cent, which is not the most real sector.
It is also an inevitably high level of investment that maintains industrial capacity development.
However, in general, it is possible to suggest that the RF economy decline to -0.5 per cent against -3.7 per cent in 2015,” says the GC Forex Club Irina Rhova.
The naturalization process of sports launched recently in Russian football and excellently living in winter species in Olimpía in Sochie until it is actively developed in summer sports.
If the Olympic Games in Rio for Russia are speaking for former foreigners, most of these are the born countries of the former Soviet Union.
In Rio de Janeiro, we can observe a relative process - a sufficient number of Russians speak under the flags of other States.
In each case, the change of citizenship is different.
Some parents have brought them to another country in childhood without left their choice.
Someone did not pursue competition for a Russian collection.

"AiF.ru" was at least 16 sportsmen who decided to change their Russian citizenship.
In German passport, a 27-year-old girl wrote that she was Liza Rhini.

The girl had no choice.
There she decided to go on the stomach of her old sister -- to take a easy atletic.
Lisa has chosen six pieces with her sister.
Don't stop her in Russia, if she couldn't be able to shoot with the trone, Elena Isnbaev.
Unfortunately, in the Olympicade, Rio Liza will be our only terrace, e.g., in the sixth sector.
Her best achievement is the 2010 champion bronze of the Championship of Europe and the arm of the continent in 2016, which she once again in the absence of Elena Ismbaev.
29-year-old Elena Pirozki was born in New Coast in 1986.
Her parents are religious promotors of evangelism.
A little because of their faith, they went to the United States when the girl was only three years old.
Besides Elena, still eight children were grown in the family.
All of them live in a small town of Greenfield in Massachusetts.
Lena started fighting in school.
As a result, she moved to the city of Colorado-Sprengs, where the United States Institute has continued to work under the leadership of another former Russian Vladimidala of the Wildlife.
On Olimpiade 2012, Elena played in its first appeal.

After that, they were bronze of 2013 and silver 2014.
Mary's 26-year-old age was born in Yaroslave, where she first met synchronized.
But she says that our trains in Russia would be wrong.
Shortly, the family of girls decided to immigrate to the United States and to reside in the city of Colorado.

Yanna was born in Tollite.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany, where the girl had more perspective to get into a national collection.
She had soon represented her country at the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
There, in fact, Yana could only take 17 places that was inadequate for the invasion of the financial conspiration in the priest.
After two years ago, she decided to win the blonde meal of the Olympic Games.
Another gymnastic, only this time sportive, is Irina Sazona.
If the way of immigration mentioned previous sports can be deemed standards, the choice of the family of Irina is very unnecessary, Iceland.
Ira is a student of the Wogograd Sport School.

A 31-year-old volunteer Adam Batiros was almost all his carriage under the Russian flag.
At that time, Hasausurt was able to become a three-language machine of European championers, Russian sportmaster of Russian international class.
When he stopped in our national collection, it was time to think about the change of citizenship.
For a few years, a talented shipper disappeared from sports.
The triumphal return was held to the Asia Championship in 2016 - Batiros was already represented by Baharine, who won a gold meal and received a trip to the Olympiadu to Rio.
Another Russian exhibition, Mikhail Kudinus, is known for the family more than even the Swiss swimming Maria Hungary.
The case is that his parents were emigrated from Vladimir-East to New Zealand when the boy was very small.
That's Michael and began to take a sportive genius.

Can Erdogan reject friendship with the EU and the United States?
The President of Turkey, Rejep Tyip Erdogan, issued the U.S. 67, proposed to make a choice between Turkey and Fethullah Gulen, Islamic preacher accused of the government transfer organization.
In this regard, he declared before his partners in Ankara.
Erdogan called for the Americans to reject the support of the “terrorism organization of the phytopolists”.
This is not the first statement from Turkey in which the United States call for a change of their position.
Experts believe that Turkey's relations with the West continues to grow and could try to change the authority in the country.
"The years or later, America will choose between Turkey and the FETO " , a terrorist organization of fethurulists."
Like the organizing FETO changing, or the democratic Turkey.
She must do this choice," quotes the Anatolian Task Force of Training Erdogoan, who was in the midday night in Ankara.
The President of Turkey was typically, but he had already needed the United States to comply with the requirement that they were sent to them first immediately after the murder.
Remember, on 16 July, that the Turkish Army's high-employed representatives in Turkey had been tried to pursue the legitimate authority in the country, as well as to pursue the head of the State.
However, after the treatment of the population, the murder was sentenced, and his organizations and participants were arrested.
A total of 80,000 people were shocked under suspicious suspicious suspicious suspicion, in a series of other military teachers and scientists.
According to Rjepe Erdogan, their employer Fethulls Gulen, who lives in the United States.
The Erdogans also allowed the interference and directly americans to be interfered.
The United States checked all the complaints in his address, refused to deliver Gulena and recommended to change the ton.
The last statement of the representatives of Gossip to this account was held at the time of Erdogan’s visit in San Petersburg at the last Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the President of Turkey - which is opposed to him and also submits the requirements to others to their western partners.
"Ankara stops to comply with its commitments under the migration agreement with Europe if Brussels did not require the date of cancellation of visa limits for Turkish citizens," said the Minister of Turkey on the affairs of the EU Omer Chelico, on 9 August.
In his words, the change of Ankara in the anti-terrorism law, as the EU requires, will threaten Europe's own security.
Note that 1 August, Vice-Chairperson Germany Zigmar Gabriel needed to stop the load of Europe's promises to open the border for migrants to facilitate the visa regime from the EU.
His words were answered to the corresponding statement of the head of the MID Turchia Mevolta Chauschhol.
Another promulgation statement of Chauschlol made in the past, allowing Turkey to go out of NATO.
The Turkish MID head did not exclude that the country would consider the possibility of retirement from the alien if it was not expected to meet it.
The decision to enhance cooperation with Russia in the defence field is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries who cooperate with foreign States in the defence area - they import missiles," said Chauschhol to the Anadolu Agency.
In his words, Turkey must now establish its own defence system based on its technologies and cooperate with other countries.
"Turkey has still tried to cooperate with NATO member countries, but the results of us were not satisfied, and we were looking for others," said the Minister.
Experts believe that this is all about the serious differences in Turkey with the West and the transition of the country to the East.
The Chief of the International Political Expert Institute of Eugenia Minchenko believes that Reaga Erdogan is now leading to its game and cannot go to a huge conflict with the West.
He has very much linked to the West and to the point of business, and with the view of the military (Turchia is an NATO member), so I think that Erdogan will try to balance by maintaining rational relations with the West.
Although, of course, the Americans would be better to see the full obedience of this post," Iaf.ru expert explained.
In his words, it is not excluded that after the statements of the Turkish leader (and the unpaymented compensation of the EU, on the demands of non-visual space with Europe and the extradition of Guinea from the United States) will be granted to it.
"The Regiment of Erdogan is confronted with the deterioration of relations and with the Americas, and with the European Union, which they will give it just on humanitarian matters, on the dictators of the country's management methods, and so further", believes Minchenko.
Head of the Centre for Political Information, Alexy Muhin, allows the President of Turkey to change its views in Russia as it would be possible.
Eight months ago, Erdogan had made a very serious position towards Russia, and all of the ways he searched for the well-being in the West.
At least a small time, the situation was changed to the contradiction.
Garanties that after some time the President of Turkey did not change its priorities again.
I think Erdogan's in the period of brilliant diplomacy.
He will try to get the maximum benefit for himself,” believes Mohammed.
He believed that the main task for the President of Turkey is to maintain the political authority in the country today, and that it is the need for Russia and the partnerships with the Putín Volunteer to stop supporting the United States.
Turkey and the United States need to control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
The agreement with Turkey will therefore be achieved," is the expert.
Another point of view is the head of the Asian Centre and the Middle East Anna Glasov.
Now the relations between Turkey and the EU and the United States are sufficiently pressed, and it is in the first way related to the internal policy carried out by Erdogan.
I think that this crisis will be decreased, and in the context of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to reload policies as well as in the Middle East and in Russia.
Nevertheless, the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, states that they are ready to change their position on the whole issue of Syria, resolved with Israel, is an active political partnership with Iran,” explained AiF.ru Glozavu, which allows that the next step of Argentin would be normalized with the Egyptians.
According to her, the policy now carried out by Erdogan is the return to the course of an external policy concept which follows Turkey before the Arab Revolutions.
"The same time in the positions " no problem with neighbouring " Turkey began to develop its relationship with the Middle East and Asian region very actively.
There have now been very lucky visits from President of Turkey in Russia and Africa.
Therefore, this external policy vector will develop and contribute to the strengthening of Turkey ' s positions in both regional and international airlines," is an expert.
The Global Committee believes that Turkey will be incredibly difficult to return to the previous relationship with the EU, and now the question is whether the EU will begin to respond evilly to Turkey, which may be to the opening of borders for migrants and to create the same serious problems for Europe.
Advertising the youngest doctors: Inviting to new collective protests
The representatives of the youngest doctors requested the profession to authorize new collective protests in their discussion on the new working treaty.
The Committee of the British Medical Association (JDC) will be requested to request its full advisory to support more collective protests since the beginning of September.
JDC said that the Ministers could not respond to the labour treaty.
The young doctors and medical students in July have voted for the cancellation of the work contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58 per cent of its members who participated in the secret vote.
In a letter to the members published in Twitter on Friday night, President JDC Ellen McKort said that the Government continued to “beat” about the problems that she said to have brought to the rejection of the working treaty.
She said: "Bearing in mind the situation, the leader of JDC proclaimed for rejecting the proposed new working treaty in full, and called for official negotiations on all your matters."
In response to the silence of the Government of JDC, he has requested the external meeting of the BMA Council today to adopt an unexpected programme for collective protests, starting from September early.
The controversial resulted that young doctors had participated in six incentives in this year, including the first general premiums in the history of the State Health Service.
The leader of the young doctors of BMA, Dr. Joan Malavan, left after voted on the cancellation of agreed conditions of the working treaty, recommended by the BMA.
He said to BMA members that the treatment should be good to take during the meetings in the prevention of the vote of 54.000 young doctors and medical students.
After the vote by the Minister of Health, Jeremy Hunt said that this working treaty would be used for medical workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: "Aliens wicked"?
It was a jacket that finished the crisis.
The Russian leaders and Turkey met on Tuesday to make their hands and proclaim the official end of the eighth-year-old war and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomed his Turkish colleague in the shipping hall of St. Petersburg, I have a sustained impression that Ankara wants to be more reconciliated.
It was the leadership, yeah.
But Mr. Putin's smile looked awkward, and if he had removed warmly even under his own detention standards.
Reaper Tyip Erdogan, in contrast to this, has often spoken about his "good Second" five times, according to one report.
I lost my account.
He also promised that the relationship with Russia would return not only to their precrisis level, but even above.
On the next day, one newspaper described the action of Mr. Erdogoan as if nothing wrong would never happen.
I think his enthusiasm would be back.
But the shock of Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader did not forget anything.
In fact, it was the first reason for the crisis that he mentioned in the entry comments: Turkey has destroyed the Russian destroyer on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction at this time was an instinct.
Mr. Putin was disappointed by a angry tired by accusing Ankara to shoot Moscow.
The tribulation was even more stronger than the predicted friend.
Resurrection of real trust will be difficult, probably not possible.
The Russian public view has also changed since November.
During the months, the controlled media States have conducted an overwhelming, accurate invasion against Ankara.
It was immediately shown that the Turk must be considered guilty in all.
The most serious accused of the representatives of the Supreme Leader was that the family of Mr. Ergogan had been engaged in the illicit trade of oil from the Syrian region controlled by the Islamic State.
He denied this decisively.
But in San Petersburgh, it was an official signal that was time to move forward.
At the end, the meeting was only because Mr. Putin received an apologic for President Adgogane.
Russia could pretend to win her kind.
For Ankara, the declaration of transgression is clear.
First, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get, after he was almost declined from his post in the last month when he tried to turn.
The terror attacks against Turkey were clearly shocked too.
There is also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions shocked strongly — especially the ban on shooter flights, which generally brings millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number was almost 90 per cent.
With regard to Russia, the tourists and the chair company here, of course, feel comfortable when the fleet will end up.
They are put on the end of the season on the Mediterranean.
And even this week, the public television predicted more decreased fruit and fruit than the Turkish imports of agricultural products will be allowed again.
"Turists there, fellow guests back here", as stated in the Wednesday newspaper.
But the visit also had a further political value for Moscow.
Ankara's badness in the West because it is considered a weak answer to the attempt to turn.
Add to this the long-term injury of Mr. Putin, which is trying to use the smooth and to gradually destroy Turkey's relations with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, wins bonus balls with Ankara for calling for support of the elected authorities after the attempt of public transfer.
You mean, this is the date for Moscow, which has its own deeply depressed fear of the change of the regime.
So, the summit in this swimming park on the sea coast allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine that one analysis describes me as "the wicked": two countries who feel themselves rejected and degraded by the West united forces.
However, despite public reconciliation, these two remains significant.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently been a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite parties.
It may be said that after almost three hours of the initial negotiations, while two Presidents gave the press conference, they did not even touch the subject.
The President of Turkey was incredibly avoided the answer to the question of their differences while Mr. Putin intended to focus on them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find a general language on Syria.
But after months of open enemy, and taking into account the full possibility of the disaster when the NATO member of Turkey has slaughtered the Russian reactor, it is clearly better that two leaders speak at least again.
The Kingdom Bank of Skotland will disappear for customers in the borders of Skotland
Brad RBS must be recorded to the role of the bank office, according to the executive director of the bank.
The Kingdom Bank will disappear for customers outside the Skotlands.
Ross MacEvan told BBC that the RBS Brad was linked to global bank ammunitions.
Bank left them since he almost moved eight years ago and had to save him.
In that period, the burden strategy used RBS to protect other consumer credit burdens.
He was supported by millions of funds of Pansor International Assistance, from the Cub of six nations to the Champion of Wilbldon Andy Murrey.
But now it was decided that it would be proper to allow more national burdens to go to the first plan.
The Kingdom Bank will be used with the Skotlands customers, but it will not be implemented.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the main office and the fund, will be changed to NatWest.
Brand Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller shippings for private persons who have more influence — Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. MacEvan was interviewed during the tour of customers and staff in Invernessshire.
He said BBC Skotland: "Brand RBS will finally become our investment burden and our staff, because we are now more to be the bank of burden."
As the bank itself became a global burden, RBS became a global burden.
I now say that we don't have global efforts, we have local efforts.
Each of these burdens will present something different in its population groups, and our staff will work with customers under these burdens.
RBS has already stated that it would not be to continue its puzzle support of the six nations ' s Cube, and he promotes profiles of different burdens in the launch of sports.
"This is a suitable time for us to move the burned bank, as (we asked us) as we focus on the improvement of the customer bank?" said the Executive Director.
It would be very cynician three years ago if we would say that we're going to be a wonderful bank for customers and close all these burdens.
But with the work we've done, focusing on the needs of customers, not on our own, I think you're seeing a lot of changes.
We can return these burns, so I think it's the right time.
Frankie Dectors reached up to 3000 winners in New Market to Prist
Doctors shock the champagne after the double in Newmarket brings it to 3,000 wins
The Jacques Frankie Dettory won its 3000-year British winner in Newmark at Tuesday.
He came to this extraordinary note using his second winner night on his home road - to the Prisсть, trained by John Gosdan.
The 45-year-old Italian is a six-year-old shock, which reached this extraordinary note in the shoes.
He should be following Sir Gordon Richards, Dougom Smith, Lester Piggot, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-class champion of the heavy doctory, who previously wins to Ghayyar, said, "This is something special."
I'm very excited because my family's here too.
I'm so glad that this happened in New York, so I've been here 30 years ago.
This isn't a great light event, not Royal Ascot, it's a normal Tuesday night of 200,000 people.
I'm free of business, and I'm very unprecedented.
The doctors accept approximation when they bring the Proposal after the victory
Two yarns reached such a note in boxes with obstacles: the champion of Richard Johnson and the top of the pension of 20-fold champion Sir Antony McKy, who had more than 4300 wins for the record carriage.
Lester Piggott, Nine Dedby winner, 4493 winners in the carriage
Franky is one of the best jokes in modern times and is unexpectedly that he reached the note that so few had reached.
He's a style and strong, but it's his tactical smell that differentes him from others in the wedding room.
He was a magnificent representative for scacks, his enthusiasm and charism in the sports year.
I told Franky a few weeks ago to Eps, he would have brought 6000 winners if it wasn't just a shock of weekends and big shocks!
And if serious, Franky has brought winners in Britain a large part of the 30 years, which is good to see.
He's a powerful person that's good for the British shoes, but moreover, he's an incredible shock.
Frankie Dectory replied this extraordinary note of the company's voluntary cocktails with the horse
From the finishing finish to the strike shock, Frankie Dettore is a symbol of British shoes for two decades.
It was fleet and fall.
Many winners, including his famous "Bliccoly Seed" in Ascot in 1996, also survived aviation catastrophus and lost disabled because of the end.
Three years ago, he first faced difficulties when he returned after the six-month dismission, but showed the great will to leave the skeptic calls and return to the form.
And maybe he did not end up at any time — the doctors before said that he would like to continue to participate in the relief at least until 50 years of age.
Putin is a head of the Sergey Ivan
The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, unexpectedly released his head of the Sergey Ivana Administration.
Ivan was part of the confidence neighborhood of Putin for many years.
This 63-year-old was now appointed by the representative of the Environment and Transport matter.
The Declaration from Kremela claims that Putin " had decided to release the Ivan from his duties of the head of the Russian president " but did not call the reason.
The Vice-President Ivanwa since 2012, Anton Wayno, was appointed to his prior.
Mr. Vino, 44, former diplomat.
He finished the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (IMO) in Estonia Tallinn in 1972, and served in the U.S. Embassy.
He later was the head of the President's protocol of the Government and the Government's machine, reports on the Web site of Kremell (Russian).
In the appointment, he said, "Thank you for your trust."
I think the most important task of the Administration is to support your activities as heads of States in order to develop legislation and control on how your instructions are implemented.
Putin reported a Russian telechannel on Thursday that Ivan asked him to release it from this post and recommend Vino to replace it.
Does the Sounds Remember?
It's the step that turned Moscow back.
Sergey Ivana was one of the closest partners of Wormira Putin and served as well as the Council Security Service, the CB.
He was a head of the Administration one of the most powerful people in the country.
At the meeting with President Pututius, who had shown on public television, both men said that the head of the Administration had gone on their own desire.
However, despite the smiles of the camera, it was little who convinced it — especially now, directly before the parliamentary elections.
So that's the unexpected consequences of any struggle for authority?
Not until anyone knows it.
However, the official statement is that a person for whom ever acted as a potential President immediately wanted to manage the Russian environmental policy was met with a great skepticism.
In the comments of Pauline, quoted on the website of Kremella, I said: "This is the truth, in the beginning of 2012, I requested you to trust me in this very complicated position, even the problem post for four years.
Well, I was the head of the President's 4 years and eight months.
Ivan entered the post in December 2011.
Before he worked as Vice-Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and the former members of the State Security Service of the CBB, as well as Mr. Putin.
At the end of the 1990s, when Putin was the head of the Federal Security Service (FBI), which had been changed by the CBB, Ivan was appointed by its Vice-Chairman.
When Putin arrived to the authority, he called Ivan, including five people whom he had more confidence.
Sometimes Ivan was considered to be the President of Russia after the second time of Putin, as the third time for Putin would oppose the Constitution.
However, this post took another close partner of Putin, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became the Prime Minister before returning to the presidency only three and half years later.
The star's "Send as a criminal" series Thomas Gibson is released after the dragon with the producer.
Gibson was part of the show breakfast in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce series, have announced its release in a joint declaration.
Gibson, who played the Special Agent Aaron Hotcher, was sorry on Thursday before he was declared that he was dismissed.
There was a creative difference in food and divorce in views.
I'm sorry that it happened," he said in his statement.
Detailed information about how Gibson's personal will be extracted from the show which is expected to follow the FBI agents' teams later, according to the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios statements.
The 54-year-old actor, who had played the main role in the Darma and Greece network, was in the show of the first season in 2005.
"I love "I'm as a criminal," and I contributed to my heart and soul for the last twelve years," said Gibson in his statement published on Friday.
I hoped to be present before the end, but that's not possible now.
I would just like to thank the scenariors, producers, actors, our great team, and, the most important, the best worshipers that show could just dream.
It is noted that the show returns to its 12th session on 28 September.
Note: Fishes were landed in the Banfa garden
A man from Banfa was helped to identify the fish that appeared in his garden in Banfe.
Kevin Bayn believes that 75 fish could be skins left by water mortality.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the sea, has put the shooting of this snake in Perskop in hope that someone could shut light on the appearance of twelve fish.
Quinsferry Crossing: The Bridge is now connected to Fif
Draft at 1.35 billion feet must now be completed until 2017
Engineers have connected the northern snake and the Kinsferry Crossing Viraid, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fif.
This is the first of the four mixtures between the vents, which now goes to the end of all three pilots of the bridge.
The Fif's Bridge Section is now 600 meters long and weighs 300,000 tonnes.
There were 10,000 tonnes and 20,000 tons of beetons and 46 cm.
The project for 1,35 billion feet must now be completed until 2017.
The Minister of Economy of China Brown has visited the area today and was including the first ones who walked from the earth to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of Quinsferry Crossing.
We've all witnessed in engineering art in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of beetons were used only to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the shift between the vial and the bridge, it is a virtual operation using extremely accurate permissions for the collection.
In the total complexity of about 79 per cent of the whole bridge at the place now, for the last section, the beton shoes are reflected in Russia today, which means that it is totally ready to switch up on the bridge.
Michael Martin, director of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said, "The first smile for each bridge project is always a significant season.
This exciting project represents the modern building art.
After installing the last section of the road floor and connecting it to the extensive Northern Pilotus, we remained closed to the northern, or treated to the beach.
This was made by the shift of the northern approach to 700 miles south.
It was wide, and at the same time a very fine operation.
The massive because the visa of 222 meters long, weighs about 6000 tonnes and must be slowed up to a 3 per cent of the cycle.
It was popular because the permissions over which the team worked were small — just a few miles [2 millimeters] in each direction.
Happily, it's been very good.
Safety in Salive Molephre: The three men have been able to stay in the lives.
Twelve men were "to have been alive" after they were cast out from a fishing vessel in England.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station was at 13:20 to the British summer in Friday, after the team saw the occurrence in Salive Moelfra.
Three men from all the forces tried to reach the safe place while their ship continued to walk.
"We've seen their ships close to them and predicted worse," said the rule of Moelfre Vince Jones' savings.
"Freely, when we went down to the water, a strong wind took him into the side of them," he added.
Two men were saved by a local fishing vessel, and the third man of 60 years of age was found a disabled and invaded in the boat without a rescue.
All of them were taken up on the board of the beach rescue and put to the rescue station
Johns said, "The three men elected in the water was glad that they lived and were completely harmful.
The ship engine had an accidental switch, but somewhat he defeated from a man who managed the ship when she was shocked.
Somebody cares of these guys today.
Pokemon Go, a decent holiday for health and happiness
To observe how the world changes.
The fact that adolescents and children do not go on the street to play, pretend to play their free time in the screen, was a complaint of many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go rejects people from wonderfulness and engages in some physical activity.
The time in the screen was markedly limited by television, then video grams and recently smartphones.
It is so glad to see that technologies and activities on the street are not inter-excepting.
I, of course, mean the full involvement of Pokemon Go, an annexe based on the originally created video games in the 1990s (as a result of the generated series of multifilms, game cards and other replies).
As well as many other cultures, this has lost the relevance of a few years before the new game was available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
The start in other countries was then detained in connection with the mass reloading of the servers.
In the following days, Pokemon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In two words, Smartphone games are going to search for Pokemons that follow GPS and, being discovered, may be 'food' (focused on your phone) or 'Poymans'.
A generation played in the game, being younger, joined the full involvement, cutting out the looks for.
In the United States, the game has increased significantly the number of steps passed by a normal person daily.
Cardiograms, annex for Apple Watch, which follows 35,000 users, recently reported that, within two days since the start of the game, the number of people, who were attended every day, increased from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company doesn't know who plays at Pokemon Go, it's just seeing the primary data on the past level.
Many health campaigns that convinced people “in 30 minutes”, “shoot from wonder” and“speaking every day” have not found a call, because most of the health messages are disappointed and expressed to people who seem unfortunate.
Nevertheless, the importance of physical training cannot be underestimated.
Those who are regularly trained are decreasing the opportunities of development in cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps adjusting weight, high arterial pressure, diabetes and long list of advantages, too long to bring here.
But Pokemon Go's worthy is that she puts people on the street to do what they love.
Thus, there are three basis for health: movement, fresh air and sunlight and joy.
Some people even bring new friends to their guests.
Normally, there are smells that are looking for what to be grateful.
Yeah, someone can shoot on the door.
Well, what?
There's a break.
Despite the applications for smartphones, such as Fitbit could and before follow our physical activity, they did not give us a matter of employment as this game was given.
The news will come, and the use will be decreased with time.
However, the success of Pokemon will be more games that will combine applications and virtual reality with physical activity in a real world by helping many people to be more active, better and healthy.

Simon Bailz wins the gold of the absolute primary in the women ' s genius
Forget the pressure.
Forget the shooting.
Simone Bails is unlawful for all this.
Dinamic on the opposite shock.
It's a lie.
He's swimming on the ground.
It's a great world.
And now, finally, the Olympic Champion.
The 19-year-old American hymnist attracted the title of the Champion on the absolute primary date in the Tuesday, placed to pass between himself and the rest of the world to a convincing demonstration under the adjusted Olympic attention.
Her general ball 62.198 was sufficiently removed from the silver meal and friendship of the Final Petterka team, Eli Raisman and the Russian Brons Melliha of Ali Mustafin.
Bylez from the United States speaks on a hymnistical blue during the finance of a woman ' s absolute initiality for the art geninatics in the 2016 Latvia Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Bylese became the fourth part of the American woman who wins the champion of the absolute primary and the fifth, strengthening its reputation as the best of his generation and, perhaps, if there was.
She shocked when she showed her the final ball and her long trip to that moment.
The achievement of this results in the same leverage that is exclusively rare, such as Michael Felps, who highlighted their types of sports to new heights:
Byleth has been the last three years, housed in his form of sport, winning 15 measles of the world champion - including 10 gold - with such an outstanding programs in their grace of labour and accuracy that Mary Lu Retton was the largest genius that I ever saw.
One last test was expected in Brazil, not so much between the Bailz and the rest of the area, as it was with the load of higher expectations.
Any less than returning to the house of your family in Spring, Texas, with the holiness of gold meal, would be considered as an unjust expectation.
Simon Bailz from the United States, the left and the left, and Eli Raisman, after winning gold and silver, respectively in the finish of the identity woman ' s absolute premium on art monastery in the Latvia Olympic Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, fourth, August.
Bylese paid the first gold in Monday, which became a beautiful final scope for the private celebration of the National College Coordinator of Marta Caroli.
While Birds insisted that she had never observed in the future during his long path toward the top, it wasn't exactly true.
part of her voluntary training program — including her company — was established on the Latin American music, which would go directly as a house on the street outside the Olympic Arren Rio.
It's not a match.
The girl who was daughter of her grandmother and grandmother, starting to walk with a child and opening the mother of Amy Burman’s train during the visit to the hall where Burman was a trainer, became forced.
She did not play any absolute initialization since the summer of 2013, a swimming pool, which should continue as long as the Bayles wants.
Despite the small advantages received by Mustafin by two turns, it was a world.
The giant and voluntary training, where Bailz protects the calling of the Champion of the world, is located in the garden.
She returned from 15.433 to January and ended from 15.933 to field.
Raisman slowly shocked her until they were waiting for a financial account — a clean formality — and the lips appeared around a white and blue white snake for the Bayles’ eyes, when the idea that she had ever recorded in the album for extraction was carried out.
Raisman's statement was a small place for the four years ago when she shared the third place, but lost the Mustafian burn on the Tay-Break.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, which the Americans called a grandchildre, was a great advance.
She sent pools after her voluntary training back, which sometimes seemed to be in question.
With regard to Bayles, the 19-year-old twin has now been completely new:
Police: 3 victims of a series of murderers were shot during the hearing of music in the car
Two women and the 12-year-old girl who died during the most deceased attack in the first series of murderers of Phynicos during the last decade sit in the machine, talked and heard music when they shot them, according to the police reports published on Thursday.
Angela Roshel Layner, Stefani R. Elis and the daughter of Elise, Malia, were shot on 12 June when their car was packed on the past.
The crimer has made about eight shots from the gun, standing with the passenger car, after which on another vehicle, is reported in the report.
The police claims that the three murder is not the result of the rape, since the drought has not received $2,900 that were expensive in a adult victim.
The representative of the police of Finicas, Sersan Jonathan Howard, said that the shooting was struck by investigators to check whether he had not been related to four previous attacks.
The total of seven people were killed and two other were arrested because of nine attacks in two most importantly Latin American regions within four months.
“ This happens in the lives of the house,” said Howard KPHO, the CBS branch, in the beginning of this month.
The suspected, as they believe, has been used by several vehicles, including the slow Nissan end of the 1990s, the black BMW and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The followers refused to reveal evidence that the attacks were linked to one of the same murderers.
Elise, 33, was hospitalized with wounds and later ended.
Lyner, 31 years old, and her daughter, Elis, Malia, died at the place.
The Witnesses told the police that there was nothing uncomfortable that they sat in a parking car listening to music.
The authorities also issued a police report on a gun which was intended to be empty for half an hour before the third murder and which, as they believe, was the case of a serious murderer.
The followers found a smooth and shooted a snake from the sit and the shooting shooting fractions.
Mother of a six-year-old child with microcephaly: "It's better."
As most of the children of six, Edmund Pixivat loves drinks, games, and of course her mother.
But notwithstanding the majority of his overseers, Edmud's microcephary is the result of a genetic violation that his mother Elizabeth Pixvito had not known during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was: I couldn’t do that.
I can't do that.
I didn't sign it.
That is not true, surely you are signing it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent said that Edmund may never know them and that he couldn't even survive.
Some doctors even invited him to place it in a specialized treatment institution.
"My first answer was, "I didn't think people do this yet," explained Pixvito.
Edmund's walking through the shooting.
Edmund wasn't sit and drunk until he did three, and he's still not saying.
But he's slowly walking some stages.
He's walking with multilateral help and shooting on the bicycle.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and drinks.
Elizabeth shows the jacket that Edmund's planned for "Good, get me.
"We're teaching him to the whisper language," said Pixivato CBS News.
But not just a common language of wheat — she says that Edmund has developed its own legs.
Microcephary may result in a number of different circumstances: genetics, such as Edmud, infections during pregnancy of virus such as core and Zica.
Symptoms and prognosis may be significantly different.
It's too early to talk about how it will be said about those who have been infiltrated by the Virus.
Pixically remembers the emotional losses because of the undetermined future.
I've always said what's going on?
What's going on?
And she doesn't know yet.
I really didn't ask for a prediction for the whole life, because I'm not waiting for someone really can tell me.
But Pixvito has a pleasant advice for mothers of children with infant deficiencies because of Zeca.
It's better.
You know that everything will be better for you.
You'll love your child, and your child will love you.

This is on the way to become a similar event.
In the Mississippi district of Harrison, the Chief of the Emergency Service Rupert Laysi reported that the rainy was continuing to go to the Mexican Valley.
In his words, a number of houses were registered as buried on Thursday, but no one was registered on Friday.

Mahaja Brown, 6, "Deceased Boats" remains in the lives after the bomb in Filadelphia
The police reports that a 6-year-old boy was shot in the Filadelphia, registering the second shooting in the city that week.
Grandma and her grandmother identified him for the CBS Filadelphia as Mahage Brown.
Grandma said that Brown received a number of firearms, including his legs, feet, hands and animals, but it was aware of him when they moved to the hospital.
"He was very enough, his little body was deleted by guns," said his grandfather Delors Melendez station.

Many houses and machines in this area were also entered.

Another six-year-old child, a girl, was inflicted in the hands of the Sunday, playing before her house in the West Oak Lane area.
She's resurrected, and the police's still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simon, Gabby and Larry?
That's what I call a woman's Olimpine Collection for the Gymnastics of this year and a number of reasons.
First, I was on every Latin Olympic since 1984, and the United States never were so homely.
And second: In this collective role, three giants play: Simon Bailz, Gaby Duoking, and Larren Ernandes, who have already inspired so many white girls.
The collection, added by Eli Raisman, is a Jewish, and Madison Coshan, who is Catholic, makes all pride.
This collection seems finally like America.
This also strengthened the black and Latin American women’s presence on the top of the sport.
For the past four years, a women's giant number one was African.
In the past year, Simon and Gaby were No.1 and No.2.
It's powerful.
At the past, the Olympic Gabi Duggol was unexpectedly expected by the Olympic Champion, and the United States welcomed.
The world could now be an unbelievable witness of the three-class Championship of the World Simone Bailz, Dukkou, and Larry Ernandes, who are unexpected, but yet virtual hymnists.
Simon became the fourth American park winning gold in a woman’s absolute initiality.
And a colleague on the assembly, Eli Ryan, paid gold.
We become a Witness of this kind of sport, but it doesn't look like this in hymnastic sections throughout the country.
Simon, Gabe and Larry have all chosen the same way as Eli and Madison to form the Olimpiade Collection.
They're the "final fifth" because the next Olimpy Collection on the Gymnastics will have only four gymnastics in the team, and this is the last year of Marta Caroli's training.
But, in fact, the geninastic is a road sport, and the gymnastics are trained first in private gymnastic clubs supporting parents who pay the value of education, raising, traveling, forms, contributions to the rebuilding, guest payment of services (for trainers and their families) and the list continues.
Most of these gymnastic clubs are located in rich reward areas which can support this business.
These clubs are where the hymnists receive everything from their training, and this is a precious and long-term responsibility for the jinnist families.
Hey, Burman, trainer Simone Bails, and Maggie Hannie, trainer Lory Ernandes, both trained their sports from the time they adopted for hymnastics.
We need to create more availability on price and access to the communitys of the unexpected number of young girls inspired by Simon, Gabe and Larry.
I found my genius fund 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and disappointment of hymnology in Harlem for more than 15,000 city youths (in the main, black and Latin Americans) and have studied national and international champions.
In September, we will extend to Detroit (my family city) to provide a high-quality young people's genius that has the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
The genius has developed strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as the sustainability of extraordinary work, disciplinary and sustainability for mind.
This is a positive impact on good health, success in school and work throughout the life.
That is the inspiration of this collection to send thousands of girls to have a gymnastic, and that's beautiful.
Sporting is so important, especially for girls.
That's a great time now.
Thank you, Simona, Eli, Larry, Gabby and Madison for this serious demonstration of the Genetic Force in the winning of the command oil and that you're motivating so many different girls to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
The young doctors received a declaration of further profits after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The Ministers hoped to conclude the changes agreed to the amended treaty with the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of 37,000 young doctors who participated in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt launched plans to introduce this treaty, said that NHS was a "near land" and that any delay of the delay would damage staff and patients.
The first young doctors are transferred to a new treaty, which includes changes in work at night and weekly work for improving emergency services.
Dr. Elen McCott, Chairman of the Committee of Youth Dr. BMA, said last night in the statement: "The young doctors still have severe concerns on the proposed treaty, in particular that he asks for the crisis of workforce and that it cannot apply to all doctors fairly."
Only eight weeks before the first physician group was transferred to the new contract, we need progress and time.
The attempt to authorize the negotiations was to take action and sometimes a full peace by the Government.
And in spite of the promise of Jeremy Hunt in the last month that his door is always open.
" The Jords of Hunt must act now, encouraging the introduction and react to the fears of the youngest doctors.
If he does not, the young doctors are inevitable that they are ready to organize afterwards.
The last article at the end of April led to a delay of about 13,000 planned operations and 100,000 nurses received, while nurses and advisers were subjected to the replacement of doctors in the pickage line.
The Ministers hoped to conclude the changes agreed to a amended treaty with the leaders of the British Medical Association.
The WMA wants to make a better payment for 54.000 young doctors under the treaty.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General NHS Employers, called the youngest doctors not to continue to be skilled.
Mortimer said: "Ambassadors have reached little or nothing, but are pressured to work at the front of the teams and services, and cause concerns, physical pain and disorders to patients, seeds and their families."
Over the past two months, we talked to the Committee of Teenagers and together with the Department of Health and others, positively responding to their fears relating to the role of hospitals and corporate information policy.
Workers hoped that the continuing support for other important topics, such as staff distribution, flexibility, additional education for those returning to the carriage, the value of education, mutual recognition of the training plan, academic departure and gender differences in medical payment, was aware of how serious workers, the Health of England and the Department of Health were to meet the conditions achieved in the WMA in November, February and May.
Preparation for 2 pounds a day may reduce the threat of heart attack
Thousands of patients with heart attack will be used by 2 pounds per day after the authorities recommended to give it more and more than a long time.
The anti-reverse preparatory of ticgrer reduces the risk of recurrence for persons with heart diseases.
The preparation has already been designated for 12 months after a heart attack, a reduction in the risk of an insult or a new invasion.
The NICE National Health Service recommended that people give it for four years to continue to eliminate the risk of heart-related problems.
However, now the NICE National Health Service recommended that people give it for four years to continue to eliminate the risk of heart-related problems.
A heart attack occurs with about 140,000 people in England annually, and four of them have another attack or insult.
The heart attacks and insults have resulted in the capture of grain materials on the shoes and the preparation of the shoes.
If the smell is cut into part, it may be a cause of the torment that blocks the access of blood to the heart and a heart attack.
And if the tube moves, he can move to the blood flow and lock the blood to the brain, calling insults.
Persons who have already occurred are more risked to obtain another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold by Brilica, reduces the risk that makes the transit less credible.
The NICE instruction project, published today, recommends that people give 90 mg of ticgrer for 12 months, then 60 mg with aspirin two times a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, Head of the Nice Medical Technology Assessment Centre, said: “In spite of the effective methods of second-proliferation, about the fourth persons that have already been a heart attack, a further heart attack or anxiety, often with devastating consequences.”
The fear of repeating may have a significant negative impact on the quality of human life.
There is evidence that a ticroller in combination with aspirin effects under the risk of follow-up of heart attacks and insults to people who have already been overcoming a heart attack.
We are glad to have the opportunity to increase the treatment options available to many thousands of people who are ready to use it.
As information on the effectiveness and safety of ticgrellars — especially the risk of blood — has been limited for three years, the instruction project does not recommend treatment over this period.
The CPC ownership culture allows to promote the performance of the vote accounts in the Islamic regions
Ms. Tauer-Hamlets Luthfur Rahman was dismissed from posts in the past year because of corruption, with a complete report of the Government
Political adjustment culture has been closed to the eye of a general formulation of the votes in the Islamic communities, on information about the devastating report of the Government, which has been born today.
The former member of the Office of Ministers, Sir Eric Piklas, is inflicted with the criticism of the police, the election observers and the administration of the cities for ignoring the evidence of violations of the elections because of " extreme feeling about racial and religion".
The former secretariat of local communities, now the anti-corruption king, reported that the fear of elections in religious snake was so strong that the police had to be allowed to put borders beyond the borders of the election places to protect the feared electioners.
He proposes that the electioners take the personality certification to prove who they are when they vote.
At this time, the electors should only specify their name and address.
The report is even proposed to put the smells on the fingers of people when they give their boxes to eliminate a person to two times.
The best protection should be provided to observers, said Sir Eric.
He calls for a major access to the documents of the local council and decisions adopted by informal committees or working groups.
“It is not only to protect the electoral fashion, but also to protect the local government from the more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes with her,” he said.
The report was assigned to Dauning Strategy, due to the vote in Tauer Hamlets in East London.
In the past year, the Special Court, which considers election issues, decided that Mr. Luftur Rahman had to be dismissed from posts regarding the long list of corrupt and illicit activities.
The Court found that Rahman had “ciniciously expressed” the religious feelings of his Muslim community and urged them to silence their critics by accusing them in racism and Islamics.
Rahman said, "He said his campaign, based on the obligation of the believers to vote for him."
To 300 votes were declared or were the results of the personality when a person voted, representing someone else.
Sir Eric said that they were a witness of torment throughout the country.
He expressed special concerns about the motiveness with the e-mail vote, in which senior members of the Muslim community, as they reported, had pressure on people to vote for their elected candidate.
Mr. Eric, on the photo, made several recommendations on the cleaning of the vote system, including the requirement to provide personality certification to prove who you are.
The report states: "A number of ethnic minorities, in particular women and youths, have presented evidence of pressure to vulnerable members, in particular for women and youths to vote for the volunteer, especially in the communities of Pakistan and Bangladesh.
"By fear that... public institutions closed their eyes to such a behavior because of the excessive feeling of "political adjustment" regarding ethnic property and religion."
Eric gave 50 recommendations for the cleaning of the system, including the elimination of political activists from the work of posting officers for vote to stop the “collection of votes”.
The report also calls on the post-registered checks at the registration to prevent the use of the election list for immigration and privacy.
The option is considered to require the voters to proclaim the personality before the vote.
Use deceased smells on people's fingers when they leave their burns to prevent anyone to vote two times.
Systemic checks of nationality to ensure that they have the right to vote.
Introduction of a three-year-old vote on applications.
Delete the political participants and activists from work with full-time votes and convergences with e-mail votes.
Make the police authority to establish borders around the election places.
Amend the law to facilitate the proclamation of the accused of persons in fear in accordance with the Act of 1983.
Delete illicit photos on the elections.
Make the requirement to be used only in English for elections (except Wells).
Strengthening education to ensure that the staff allows voters to go to the building.
Mr. Eric is a brutal attack against the city police, claiming that it was "repectually" that no criminal accusions were made after the Tauer Hamlets case.
"The Sud that considers the elections has dismissed Luthfuur Rahman and his long list of corruptions and illicit action," he reported.
He was acknowledged for the lack of reasonable doubt — a criminal standard of evidence — on a number of basis.
He also criticizes the unresolved " check-up for balls " of the electoral registration of the city Administrations.
Sir Eric said: "The first sentence of the court in Tauer-Hamlets was a sign of trial.
Our nation has the honourable inheritance as the mother of the parliamentary elections, and however, the proliferation of electoral fraud and the decline of certain bodies are threatening this good reputation.
Cate's bicycle analysis and other twice advisors of the Olimpiade in Rio
The Olympics of 2016 in Rio in the past week, with the mood of the French bicycle Paullin Franco-Prévo, which, as it occurred, seemed to be like a gergogy of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old member of the Olympic Games is not the only sporting channel that struggle for gold this year, which may be honored by its own famous double-double, at least, according to the social communications.
So, in the honour of Jegre Rio and all the famous people present on our screens, the FEMAIL had a list of olimpins with more than the surface of the Hollywood stars.
Chairman and ship: Member of the United States Travel team Brady Allison, the left, compared with Leonardo DiCaproo since he was a child
In addition to the bicycle of Kate, many online people tried to show how a tract could be the closest of Leonardo DiCaporo’s superstar.
The member of the U.S. Training team Brady Allison became a uragan in Twitter, after his images appeared to be scared like the Wall Street star from Wall Street.
And in fact, the channel learned about the société and recognized that he heard that he was like Leo since he was a child.
"I'm not personally seeing a great part, may be exceptional to the race on the face," said Brady Huffington Post.
"He's an appreciative guy, so I think it's a compromise."
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 will, indefinitely, indicate more in this year: a similarity between the British player of Greeme Deserford and the popular actor Nila Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnastic Alia Mustafin, with its great expressive eyes, is the exact copy of the Cuban and American Pearl Gloria Estefan.
And in the South African Pool Cameron Van der Burga, Hora Matthew Morrison was compared to the star for many years.
Returning to an unexpected: this user believes Nathan is a "sporting version" of the "Nachala" actor.
Another long-term comparison was between the tennisist Rafael Nadar and Jochem Harnet, actor who could be able to swear like a heavy brown and smells.
The silver mealist from Russia, Eury Ethimous, can not only be shocked with sweet hair and light hair as the actor Annalin McCord, as Nathan Adrian from the United States team, like a sporting version of Joseph Gorgon Lewit.
Dark Women: The star of the football Hoop Solo, left, and actor Jennifer Carter from Dexter, on the right hand, have the same forms of face and eye
Not only: one of the Twitter users was very pleased that others also had seen
Created theory: According to this user, there may be a reason to be found on the basis of the external nature of this pair
One Twitter user recently called on a website to generate its relief that "the island's Internet thinks that Hoppe Solo and Jennifer Carter are actually identical".
In fact, the star of the U.S. football and the actor Dexter have incredibly similar forms of face and eye.
Other popular comparisons included Kerry Walsh Jennings and her smile, close to the identical smile of Lora Liny, and the winned gold meal of Gabe Duggog, which can be able to swear a beautiful wide smell that seems to be like a smile of the "Good Success" star Gabriel Yunion.
The commenter for the CBC is sorry for the Chinese pool "death as a pornography"
Analysis of Bayron McDonald's fourth place at the end of 14-year-old Iy Yanjahn on the Women ' s free style 4h200m in the medium of the CBC to the direct transmission of the Olimpiade
The Canadian Edition Company was condemned to apologize after one of its comments said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimming powder was slaughtered as a war and "death as a sweet" during the smile.
The commenter Bairon McDonald thought that his microphone was disabled when he began to express his own view at the end of the financial woman's east of 4 to 200 meters of free style.
It could be heard as McDonald, who joined the CBC's comments to "speak it with a color," said, "China's 14-year-old sleeve, baby."
A lot of sweet, old as a shock, died as a sweet.
Thank you for it.
The Chinese powder of Ai Yanhan, 14 years old, slowed the second stage of the staff at 1:57.79 to 1.61 seconds slower than the Canadian Taylor Rack, allowed Canadians to remove the displacement from China.
The Canadian switch reacted rapidly on the network after the tone and the use of expressions were shocked
Emmet McFarleyn tweeted: "Does the CBC Dictator just just said that 14-year-old sweeter from China was dead as a sweet?"
This idiot didn't understand that they were still in the eternal."
About Ai Younghan from China in the end of a woman's eastfeat, 4h200 m to a free style, said, "Thet is a small 14-year-old Chinese kid, was a meat, baby."
The criticism of Twitter immediately disrupted Bayron McDonald, which many called him to let it.
Twitter users did not stop when they heard how uncomfortable Bairon McDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradiz wrote: #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and do it like a racist cup. #disgusted.
Shortly after that, Scott Russel, who gave the CBC transfer, declared directly for the comments of McDonald, said: "We have requested for forgiveness that the comments on the swimming explanation were slaughtered."
That was an unexpected word. We're sorry that it happened.
The UNHCR concluded that there were more than 90 persons who were twittered in response to this statement.
The commenter Scott Russell had to apologize the person of McDonald
CBC then copied and sent an excuse to more than 90 other Twitter users who wanted to comment on McDonald
The televisory was also urged to apologize and publish the statement.
We are sincerely sorry that these statements were made and that they were allowed to leave the eternal.
Tonight, we were operating to apologize for our slaughter in direct ethire and our signators in the société.
By clarity, the comments of the Bayron refered to the explanation of the powder, not to it as to the personality.
And yet it was an inadequate and unexpected choice, and Bairon regrets what he said.
On Thursday, McDonald accused of direct eternity and tried to clarify his comments, claiming that he did not think that his words were terroristized as an attack on personality.
"I would like to use the moment to apologize for the comments I made last night after the woman's stage," he said, "the Olympic Games on CBC."
'I've spoken about the shooting, not about it personally.'
"I think there was no respect for us, and I'm very sorry."
The purchaser Primark stripped a woman who had uncertainly illustrated the lower whites through the shop
The buyers didn't know where to look when a woman was trained to illustrate the tragics in this way with the purchases through Primark.
Anything worse, she illustrated how she looked at them, put them up and put it back to the field.
She continued to search and finally died four couples of lower whites in the Bowerie Place Trade Center in Fallston.
The Primark Trade Center of Boubery Place in Falkstone, where women were examples of tricotative triangles, before they return to the field
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was at the time in the shop, said that after the example of the underlying white, the woman "covered and out of the shop, not buying anything."
She said, "They couldn't believe in what they saw."
Between the trade hall, she took a couple of torchs with the shooting, removed their own shoes and shoes, and made it.
"He wasn't trying to find some hot place to do that -- she was just standing there, unfortunately."
"It's been all up when she took a strike again, and they're apparently not liked to her because she put them back to the field."
She did the same with three other couples before finally decided that there was nothing that she liked, again and out.
"It doesn't seem to be careful for her who looked for her, or that she thought about a man who would, finally, purchase those bodies she illustrated."
A 33-year-old Jenny Davidson said, "It is the contrary to think that someone would take home the body that someone else had nodding, and they weren't slaughtered."
The event occurred on Thursday.
Davidson adds, "I'm going to conclude that the staff, in the entire visibility, tried to remove these objects from the sale, after she went out, and so better."
"I wouldn't want to come home with a new couple of women's bodys and find out that the other woman's jobs and cut them out, and they weren't disappointed."
Primar reported: "Primark knows what happened in our shop in Falloston on Tuesday 9 August."
All items on which it is said were extracted from the sales.
How to protect yourself from a gun by using magic claws
The surrounding world is dangerous, but it's a video from Dailymail.com, perhaps helping it make a little more safe for you.
We talked to Ron Mizrachi, a master of the Crown-Magic Federation in New York, to find out how to address armed players in close distance.
If you go to your front or behind, this video will show you how to fight his player with his weapons.
If you go back, according to Mizrachi, the first thing you need to do is turn back so that you have seen the attacker and 'free the fire line'.
Then you smell a weapon between your shoe and your shoe, before shooting them into the face of a free ball.
Then it should be rolled into the shooting, and until the shooting died from pain, you throw the gun out of his hand, shoot it into the face of the skin and go back, keep the weapon put on it.
For a weapon that is approached before, the way to do it is like - take your body from the fire line, quickly shoot your guns and shoot it so that the wicked one could not shoot.
At the same time, move the weight to the gun and shoot the shooting ball into the shooting, then turn out the gun out of his cup, before you get back and shoot it.
Sounds complicated?
Look at the video to see what the Mizrachi is doing.
But remember that the most safe out of any robbery - if you don't have a magic magic is to give your own.
For the traveller, Jan Ritt conducts his language on the most sweet place of Europe
The British traveller took its immune system and a routine reflexe of serious testing, shocking some of the most sluggling and refreshing places in Europe.
The remarkable and author of the Yan Rait, 51 of Saphholk, conducted a euro banknote language, the Chirca Pickadili, the button for the train and the Russian public phone to prove the power of its immunity system.
Before shooting each object, he used ulminometers to show us and what he uses.
However, the experiment, which should be a film called "The Training of the Lisbourg of the Internal Shile", gave some wonderful results.
The mouse is to remove the train button using thousands of others, but actually there are worse bacteria in coconut cancer.
During the whole journey in Europe, Ryan talked to doctors and physicians about increased bacteria and his own health.
Happily, nothing of the shooting has brought him more than a bad shooting in the roof.
Reyt was known by testing his cup, traveling to peace and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public wings to the kitchen button, this task was uncertainly tested by the immune system.
In the movie that he was cut, he said, "I was perfectly uncertain about my health, and I sweared a lot of different things in the mouth of the earth, eating wheat and clean water."
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only one that he refused is a russian public toilet.
His test mask showed the meaning of a luminemeter that exceeds 4000 units.
For comparison, only the measuring hands must be within 60.
But it was a Russian public toilet that he refused to shoot, after his люminometer's significance was more than 4000 units, while the extinct hands showed less than 60.
The Valio and the Finnish Manufacturer of Milk Products have deleted the film on a traveller named " Legendation of the Lisune Internal Shile " which demonstrates the number of bacteria in different places, such as in the toilet
In the film, he said, "It's close to one of the worst things I've kicked in the toilet."
There's nothing more damn than that!
I'm not going to smell anything, because it's awesome.
The "Reducing of the Lissunian Internal Shile" was cut together with the Finnish Milk Manufacturer Valio.
The company provided Rait Valio Gefilus, which contains oxygen bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, to help accelerate the growth of human bacteria and develop immune systems.
The Old Vice-President Valio on Buy, Soup and New Categories said: 'We really wanted to propose a new consumer.
What would be interesting to see, and at the same time it could explain the benefit of the biotechnicians.
We had a brain shop that finished the idea "It's called Yanu."
They claim that the interests in the guest are a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to place them in large context: good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of the pocket health and how it related to the immune system.
The increased interest in the health of the pocket is a global revelation, and through this documental film, we have been able to provide consumers more information about this in an interesting form.
I think also that the film shows that we have a good feeling of humor!
Tom Hakalla, who was a film register, added: "I would say that I would have lost respect for Yan, if he had cut some things I asked, for example, a russian kitchen shown in the film."
Of course, some things were easier and some were very cruel.
I'm glad that some of these pieces have been able to slept on the floor.
During the 2015 survey of Valio, 84 per cent of the respondents had linked oxygen bacteria exclusively with the good condition of iron and washing, and 58 per cent said that they used at least sometimes, products containing supplemented oxygen bacteria.
The family of the Huligans destroyed Saltash, the municipal house of Cornool, a landmarked exile
The families of the Huligan left their municipal house with loss of $50,000, after they were displaced for the fear of their neighbouring neighbors.
Tana Skelldon and her partner, Shana Trebilkock, have been released from their object of unmovableness in Saltash, Cornusol, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were obliged to be displaced from an unmovable object, shocked housing and building cooperation officials have found this object of inmobility in the condition required to repair.
The walls were left with snakes, the powders were hidden, the sleeves were shocked on the ground and the walls were spaned.
The family is now overlooked and, as a result, lives in the private apartment
Donna McEva, a population in Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid not to save him.
She said, 'It was an absolute cosmart for people here, and I don't think that people should live like that.
There are many things that need to be shocked, because this object of immobility may probably be known as a very good aspect of Cornell.
The family uses a stupid glory, and their name is used by a stupid glory.
A couple of three sons who lived in an unmovable system from time, and the police reports that the rule of the family has included dragons on the street with bathsbol baths, the pollution of neighbouring areas, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive crys, conflict and ruin.
Sceldon, 47, whose name was at the Arendi Agreement, received the order for the anti-social behavior in June.
In several house rooms, which could be covered, there was an old shooting
To date, gender in the house in which drugs were sold in the past
Neighbors say they saw a dragon on the street and called the police regularly.
Cornwall Housing was able to get out of her home and her partner on this week after they were granted a extended period of 11 weeks for voluntary departure.
The isolation was welcomed by neighbors who said that their lives were converted to the top of hell.
One reported, "He didn't worry anybody."
We lived next to them 20 years, and that was always bad.
Number of times when we saw the police here, it's unbelievable.
"Thet morning we couldn't sleep."
We've been up because there was so calm - we didn't have to do this!
Now when they're finally gone, it's gonna be beautiful.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Headquarter of Cornwall Housing, said that the family had not been able to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house of 20 years with the police and regularly called the police
Muser and old games were displaced below the growing part of the municipal house
He added: " This is the insurance that the arbitrator could not take any responsibility for her and her family, as the expulsion is always the last method of action that Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very complicated case, since the behavior was limited, and their actions should have been terrible for her observing neighbors.
I appreciate all my team, police and members of the community of Devona and Cornell, who have spent the slaughter to give us information.
I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbors and send a signal that the associational behavior will not be allowed.
Physpatrick reported that all three sons lived in the house in a different time, but he said that all of them had a little more than 20.
Gray matrix remained on the floor in one of the houses after the exile
Division workers will now be cut off the shoes of the house.
In 2014, the police has established a house search and has found more than 70 g concords, as well as the weight of relevant property and $1700.
Sceldon was extraordinated after she was recognized guilty in the ownership of class B for delivery.
She declared that the money passed for her son, Lee Scheldon, who died in a car disaster in 2013.
After their homeless people, there are evidence that Tanya and her partner are now living in Plymouth.
Many of the house rooms were spanified in graphics on the entire surface.
The police says they're gonna try to shoot ardenators that are not subject to the location rules
Angela Crow, from the police of Devona and Cornell, stated that this issue had sent clear warning to other ardenators that continue to violate the rules.
'This is a message for those who feel that they may be able to take themselves without a accused accused, and for those who do so,' she said.
Crime and anti-social behavior will never permit the police of Devon and Cornell, which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal came to fear when a low-level military aircraft was not shocked in the beach
In the city of Abea, in Portugal, the tourists who loved to swim on the sun, feared their lives
A vehicle P-3C Orion of the military forces of Portugal was incredibly low
Military forces reported that he had performed a train flight but stressed the lack of risks for security.
This is the moment when the fearful tourists start to be packed, while the low age aircraft was shocked over the overall beach.
A military aircraft is seen in dramatic cars, which is not at the distance of swimming pools in Aviro, northern Portugal.
The smells shocked on the feet when they became understood by the smile of a flight motors, but they were not able to see what moves to their side through the shock.
The Inspector occurred last night near the city of Avyer in Costa New.
Daniel Fernandish, one of the restrainers who published a video of shocking shoot in social networks, said, "He passed lowly twice, and it was a moment when he showed that he was shocking."
Noah Arroja added, "I've been serving and swearing, it was a feeling that the aircraft was going to fall on me."
Tourists on the Avenue beach were terriblely scared when the aircraft was shown from the tsunami and flyed at an extremely low height
Portugal's military and aircraft today stated that the pilot of P-3C Orion had performed a train flight in order to discover fishing courts in the beach, and was required to be low because it was the only way to check them.
Pilot said that the aircraft was a little lower than normally because of the inadequate visibility of the fire from the nearby horrible forests, but the military forces insisted that no one was undermined to be dangerous.
In these years, forest fires have damaged the material part of Portugal, and four people lived on the Madeira Island.
Portugal's military and aircraft statement today stated that the pilot had to fly so low in the circumstances — a slight thunder and help from forest fires that deteriorate the visibility of the vision
A train flight was carried out, and a pilot was mandated to find fish ships within the task
The HASSP system has been required for more years, but most of the coffees and restaurants of Petersburg have not yet been entered.
The tests are increasingly active and the business threatens to 1 million rules.
The Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points System (HACCP, Russian HASP option) has been more than a year - risk analysis and critical control points - the application of producers and transporters, as well as the company in Russia as a member of the Taliban Union.
In February 2015, Russia's business overseeing the standards in Petersburg started.
But until the responsibilities are sent down the trap only for individual violations of the regulation (see " Documents Preferences " .).
The incompletion of the regulations is generally in the company of 600 thousand rule for the first violation and 1 million rules for the second.
AASS as a system that takes into account the risks of food and preventing products in the 1960s has been planned in the United States.
Then it's the shock of food security for astronoms.
Now the system is used for all food companies, not only in the United States but also in Canada and Europe.
Since February 2015, HASP operates on the Territory of the TS.
4 years of the development and introduction of the business system (HASSP testing occurred in 2011).
However, the company itself and the employees recognize that most companies have not even heard of this standard.
We, unfortunately, had long been sure that the standards relate only to food products, not to restaurants, have explained the head of the Elena Ceretarian Joint Council.
Now, they're all trying to turn back.
The expected time for the renewal of the carters in Turkey, the end of August, began in September.
However, they will not call for an appeal, as their target auditor - the family with children - is already ready to school - notes experts.
The Alliance of the Tourist Agency last night sent a letter to the Government, with the request to authorize cards.
" For many Russian tourists, the collection of quality and access to marine distance is unreasonable, since the Crossland and the Greatest Republic of Location objects have already been covered until the end of September," notes the authors and stress that the opening of clater transports in August is not significantly affected by Russian marine products.
As noted in the Northwest Regional Office of the Russian Tourism Union (RST), if aviation state of Russia and Turkey is soon agreed, the renewing of cards in Turkey can be expected for a month.
A certain understanding when the chairs are renewed until no, this depends mainly on the aircraft authorities.
Technically, aircrafts can fly in September, even August, if tourists operate with the aircraft competences on the need for boards,” said Paul Romans, Vice-President of Communications and International Projects of the North-West Regional Office.
In his words, the possible renewment of the carders is a good news, but is not too affected by market power, because the main purchasers of the card towers - the family with children - have already returned from a distance and are ready to go to school or to carry out a vacation in other countries.
In the bark season, travellers and pairs are mainly purchasing tourists.
Charles programs can be counted on those who have the opportunity to relax", says Paul the Romans.
"Turkey has the opportunity to join many tourists, if she now gives very budgetary proposals - 50 to 60 miles, because there are people who are targeted to wait very low towers," says Valeria Central, Director-General of the Optio-Travel.
In other cases, it should not be precisely planned to calculate on the heating, the main mass of travels has already been planned.
Paul also believes that, since there is a regular demand in Turkey, the carders will also be displaced, but the glass would not be expected.
"For Turkey the launch of cards now is the replication of the next season", says Paul the Romanians.
"Clarifying cards in Turkey is a positive news for the next season," says Valerie Rubzhu.

Moscow Gastroybank remained without the CIA license.
On Thursday, 12 August 2016, the Russian Central Bank resigned the licence for banking operations in the International Communities Bank registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, the AAC HASSTREBANK has conducted a high-level credit policy related to the allocation of money in low-quality assets.

According to the reports, the AAC has been 335 places in the banking system of RF on 1 August 2016.
A London school, joined to IGIL, died in Syria
Cadez Sultan, one of the three British schools who left London last year to join the IHIL, reportedly, died in Syria.
The lawyer Tasnim Acunday stated that her family had learned about her death in Rack, Syria, just a few weeks ago.
It was supposed to have died from a Russian aircraft in Rakqa, a grouping in the country, as reported by ITV News on Thursday.
Susan was 17 years old, and, according to her family, she died as time when he planned to leave a divorced country of war and return to England.
"It may only be hoped that the only advantage of this is of the overwhelming and meeting of others, that is the risks of traveling to the military zone of action to kill people ever the same choice," said Acunday.
In February 2015, Sultan and two other schools from East London were a village in Turkey and then on bus to Syrian border.
The family of Susana said that she married the IHL fighter in Syria and became widowed for a few months.

The leader of the Democratics in Senate Harry Rid says he is convinced that the democratic candidate to President Hillary Clinton would be appointed to judge Mercy Harland in the Supreme Court if it is elected as President.
The Senate Republicans blocked the approval of Harland, and as President Barrak Obama appointed it in March.
The Director of the Group of the majority in the Senate, Mitch McConnel, states that the next President will choose the person who can replace the last court of the Supreme Court of Antonina Scale.
Rid declared at the level conference on Thursday that he predicted that Clinton would choose "in some way of confidence".
The representative Rid later said he didn't talk to Clinton about whether she would move Harry, and just built proposals.
He honored Harland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to "have a ship" with a new choice.
Harland is the principal court of the Appeal Court of the United States on the district of Colombia.
Rid stated that the Republicans, who blocked the name of Harland, were "residents" and "persons" of the Republic of Candidate to the President of Donald Trump.
He said that Tramp wasn't coming to the office.
Treats states that the erotic calendar for women as well as for men
The Journal of Treats cooperates with the photo of David Balmer to issue in the calendar for 2017, inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
But instead, they are intended to find the next generation of fuel models for their calendar for 2017 with the museums covered.
The President of Treats Steve Shaw told us this year that his magazine with a large number of research models is different from the old Playboy, because "Playboy is for men".
I'm doing it for women.
Obviously, he thinks that the calendar is also.
"We need to return to the demonstration of an eternal and classical spectacle where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the woman's body," said Shaw in the calendar press.
Women want to be part of this project because it is a beautiful art.
Models can provide online photos or personally on open casts in Los Angeles and New York.
Moscows will spend the memory of the unexpected internet magics.
In Moscow, there is a plan to make a memory that tells us not to be a victim of the Internet magic.
This was reported in the Russian U.S.A., writes M24.

These will be general information and the legislative framework, the rules of delivery of goods, the protection of their legal rights.
The Annex will be given recommendations on the correctness of the claim and so further", stated in Russian supervision.
The memory is being done at the present moment.
Then it will be placed on the Moscow Rosk Surveillance website, and it is also planned to release the print version and delete the mocks.

The final consumer was guilty: Who really purchases the placings?
The only men in the middle of the mid-year love the guilt.
And until you have dismissed the section of comments by cruel distortions under the non-Mediter of the Middle East, the approval is out of the actual data.
YouGov said that so many discussions on the rebuilding of the plastics are not a bleeding among the generation of two and a half-year generation that wants to come up with a new material object, but notes at medium-year-old years.
Those who have recently purchased a virtue album (c) are likely at a age of 45 to 54, according to the data.
Moreover, those belonging to the age group of 18-24 are less perceived.
This is also not just a act of collection of favorites - it has an emotional importance: more purchasers have made a number of more likelihoods to keep their feelings in themselves (56 per cent against 53 per cent) and enjoy the unity (69 per cent against 66 per cent).
But is the results of youGov faithful?
If this blog was a television news report, the camera would follow me until I was going to the center of the Soho Street, in the modest heart of the cow and a bunch of sweet before the stop, composing the hands, and say something nervous, "Yes, let's see."
Yeah, let's see.
While the heart of Soho is slowly disappointed, the hotels, the coffee, the paperchase shops have now been designed to build buildings when independent salers have been employed — several musical shops with fantastical specialists have remained.
I would like to ask the camera to stop the next scene in which I am close to different people in some of these shops and try to evaluate their age and the emotion by monitoring.
Grazgo Stuart, 55 years old, I went from Sister Ray, two young women, three men in the mid-year-old years, to Reckless Records, eight men, a woman likely a 20-year-old age, in London, to take a meeting, and walk on shops to take a few hours.
He's a collectioner, can I ask?
"I think I do," he says.
I have about 3000 or 4000 platforms.
These plates above (he sent me by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), they go into lines on the walls of his guest.
His reason for buying such a huge number of albums and symptoms should be paid from his dischargeed income: He can now purchase plastics that he couldn't allow himself when they were only out and purchase objects he had sold when he was young and mele.
"My more of the things I'm buying is the end of the 60s, the beginning of the 70s, the things that came when I was 11 or 12 things that I probably was too young to buy," he said.
He agrees that those who purchase the plastics are most likely, the introvers who love their own company, adding: "I'm not smoking, I don't drink very much.
It's my lack.
Wees, 25 years working at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers whom he meets are corresponding to the YouGov profile.
However, he noted the new concern of people who had been under the influence of the media, those who heard back and felt the responsibility of purchase their old plasts.
Judging on the discussions I had, people were released from their collection, usually in 1998 or 1999.
The customers who have ever sold their fault to purchase dishes, they are now sell their dish compacts to purchase their platforms," he says.
This may explain the blue among the persons of recovery of a certain age.
What about the emotional importance of placing?
A few seconds in the shop, such as Phonica, are sufficient to understand that the placing shops offer a comfortable society of people with similar views.
According to Weather, some of the senior customers, in particular, are disrupted by the unfair payment system.
Some guilty favorites may feel shocking from the digital world and prefer to be removed in the constant convergences for plastics, objects that have the memories of immature youth.
"I think it may sometimes be filled with whiteness or material things as her kind of calm," says Weather.
Because I'm the collector, I have it, and I think there's a lot of people too.
It's a simple way to take your head.
"We are as their social employees!" said a colleague from the platinum wall.
The ICM survey showed that almost 50 per cent of those who purchased a virtue album in the last month did not listen to it.
The survey also found that 41 per cent of the player they have never used, while 7 per cent of those who purchase a guilty, no placing player.
At this stage of the news report, I probably would have seen a very delicate, striking the board with the assemblies of Boshanova.
"Trofe" aspect of recovery is what Johnny noted 42 years of age working in Sounds of the universe (counting: three men in the mid-19).
"Another one came recently and said, "I don't have a platform player, but I want to buy a radiohead plate so we can put it to our own place," he said.
It's not a big percentage, but it's certainly happening.
It's more likely, less music.
We've got people who say, "I don't have a platinum player."
It's more young people older than twenty years of age that are just aware of it.
Fopp, who has now launched almost all the stage of sine, is much more diversity when I'm coming.
There are couples for 70, tourists that are photographed, adolescents and women of medium-year-old years.
Although the atmosphere is less innocent than in the above shops, the last Sint and Sexy Pop Wild Beast, and not a jazzle inauguration, is sweet to see the difference in its customers.
Nobody looks particularly unique, but the painful psychological trauma is difficult to establish 30 seconds close to someone.
Eleanor, 27 years old, went to Fopp for a few minutes, considering different placings that have been sold.
She looks like goods, not money.
It does not pay a lot, as she says, so it is not a very suitable option.
That's pretty good.
Listen to music on a computer or another device -- simply, but the beauty was-- -- it's loading into a dream with a smile that is overcome love.
I don't know how to explain it is really uncomfortable.
My last stopping is the shop that, as he says, helped the emergence of the new generation of lovers, was guilty of the people's models.
As I create the illusion that I'm looking at the gymnastic shocks, I'm looking at a group of young girls, every minute assembling around the Polaroid camera, before my father and his daughter start to discuss the purchase of Crosley player.
The left is the wall of the plasts set by Adele, Jephth Bacli, Amy Wynhus and Flittod Meek: the modern style and classics required platforms for any medium collection.
Nobody looks — perhaps because they are just a shooting, some places are so high on the wall, that wouldn’t be able to touch them.
It's a real artistic guilt.
However, given that any attention to these objects may mean more money for the industry and send several other customers to the Soho deep at any time, almost not to be complained.
It's not surprising that the skin of people who have more likely than most of them have more time and money than most of them is a skin that loses most of the money of the raw materials, such as the guilt.
But until my conclusions show that the results of YouGov are accurate, at least in Soho platforms, they do not exclude the existence of a large number of collective women and wives who are in reality, in plastic shops and online forums.
These people probably work in school or offices.
But they clearly don't lead to the morning, walking on the shopping in Bervick-Stritt, switching the plastics and avoiding the views of an unpleasant 30-year false leader, which depends on the shoes of non-sustaining men over the mid-year years of age.

The French Court rejects the proposal to sell the shops in the Jungly refugees camp
The French Court rejected the proposal of the Kyle’s authorities to put ten single shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees lived.
In the court hearing this week, the authorities of Cale expressed that the State should be able to make a total complexity of 72 single shops where people are sell goods, from cigarette to energy drinks, propose to switch or sell a tea for 50 cents (40r) or a few euros in an independent restaurant.
The Prefecturer Cale expressed that these places should be made because they are a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they have a fire and sanitary risk.
The civilian groups told the court that the purchase and the restaurants are vitally necessary, claiming that the free observations proposed for the government association and other groups have not provided sufficient amount of food for growing numbers in the camp.
They expressed that single shops and restaurants often provide blood and free food for those who need it.
The Court of Leil decided that it was not a legal basis to evacuate people who managed 72 single shops but claimed that the problem of Kale's prevention was completely understood.
Judge Jean-Francois Mollah said that bacalyes, cafe and restaurants had played a great role than just the use of people who " live in extreme shock conditions".
He said that spaces have provided peaceful meetings of refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that were threatened by the report was a child coffee book of Junglee at the camp which does not work for benefits and offer 200 dinners a day, in English and French, and in consultations on rescue for hundreds of vulnerable adolescents without contacting in the camp.
More than 170.000 people were signed by petition to protect the coffee of children.
The letter sent to Guardian stated that it would be "a disaster for those children, some of whom were not older than eight years".
Two welfare institutions, the assistance to the Beyonds and L’Auberge des Migrants in Friday, estimated that the number of Jungly camps growed and increased 90,000 people — the most higher than the whole history — after the slight increase in new arrives during the summer.

Britain is stopped in the Regib-7, after the master-class Fiji allows them to take gold.
The impressive series of Britain in Regby-7 was devastatedly stopped for the financial obstacle to the Fiji team in the finish on Friday night when they were fully disrolled 43-7 in the Deodor Stadium in Rio.
Fiji gave the master-class for the ownership of the mud, the skip, the support of the game, the fleet of lines and the cruel force to win gold — their first olimpholic meal of any color.
The vision was not too poor in the form of silver, the third in Britain, and they could be proud of their efforts in the first Olympic tourist in Regby-7, which tried to win New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
Boks, 7-5 in half-five in the same day, could be returned to the end.
But no matter what, Fiji has winned as far as it couldn't be a team of 15 persons.
This may be some comfort for the United Kingdom — but it is probably not — that at least one British man will spend tomorrow on a gold meal: the main trainer Fiji - Ben Ryan, an ex-English chief of Williams.
It was a few trips to Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost each game at Adelaide Sevens.
They've lost the whole one here.
These shocks will cause pain, but it's a positive progress.
Fiji began greatly, because of the pursuit, the attempt to shoot the Great Britain to shoot the meat.
It was like to press the colony of the cars for the Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and the Championship of the World Section went up from 5 to 0 when Ocea Coleissa was born in the edge.
There were four minutes at the time of Jerry Tuvai adds another tachun on the right floor, which was implemented.
12-0 and Greece is on the floor.
The magnificent trial of Mitchell's overwhelming man, Leon Nakarabrah, was to forget the third, but that's just Fiji.
At the seventh minute, Jas Veremálua made Tachdaun in the right edge, and Britain played 17-0.
Nakarabaya added another after renewing, and in the hour there were still more minutes... in the first half.
Ravo was then interrupted through some other great attempts to overcome the Great Britain and the storm to obtain a sight.
Implementation led to 29-0 in the interruption.
It looked like Fiji had been born for the game in the Regib-7, while Greece still has a resin.
What's there likely to be.
The Great Britain made massive replacements in half of the game, and they sweared a physician... at all four minutes, that the standards of the first half were good until Joshua Tuiswa passed after a few sluggling physic interactions.
Dan Norton accepted the attempt for the United Kingdom, making a tank in the left edge to make a count of 36-7, but a long walk on the road of the islands of South Sea, whose skin fans were swinging fleets and danced on the courts.
It was impossible to rejoice the full joy of the Fiji approach.
Mother Willem has shooted a physician tower that did not need to be adjusted, another attempt in the last seconds.
As a result, the physicians were shocked, and the Great Britain slaughtered into gas, completely convinced.
On the same day, Fiji winned Japan 20 to 5 in its half-five, and the United Kingdom was a little in South Africa in the tensions of one attempt — the difference of the British realisation.
Kyle Brown puts Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton helped some great work of his feet to shoot the line and shoot the balls in the second half.
The last attempt to overcome from Marcus Watson, the 15th part of the team of England, Entony, was safeguarded by the victory — and, finally, the silver meal.
Helen Glover and Hiser Stanning are inspired to win in the Greece combating cancer train
There's no worry gold on these games, and that's something about it.
From the first move to the last, 220 heavy incentives in history, Helen Glover and Hizer Stanning found that their gold moment at the Lagoa Station was more important.
Though they were the themes of two weights, there were three voices in this ship, but the trainer Robin Williams had always been until they tried to the second subparty of the Olympic gold in women, the first woman in the British sport analysis that arrived to that height.
Their overcome was absolute, the 39th unbelievable statement, again unprecedented.
What we're seeing, two sweet sports that are covered on the surface of the lebedies are not fully reflecting the nature of the triumph.
On every gold of the Greek batalon, prepared hands that contribute to slowly generating winnings that are important, and no hands that were more important than the trainer, which 30 months ago, when he had placed a cancer diagnosm, did not know whether he lives before seeing that day.
As he said, it was a dangerous case.
I've got a smooth puzzler cancer, which is one of the things they can operate, and they've done it.
If they're not doing this, he's going all over there.
This could be a very bad situation.
She's a little changed your species in the future.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
It was glad that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 in the inter-session by maintaining a minimum graphic fraction if it could be a correct expression in such circumstances.
I needed payment, so I had to correct quickly.
It was smiling.
I was in the hospital and driving at the office — 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet per hour, although they were talking about a few steps.
That's how it starts.
The beach itself is a trip, but it makes it a little more.
The next mom after the winning of their first thoughts were Williams, who held the nervous morning, speaking more than normally in trying to overcome their own concerns.
Stanning, captain of the Artillerian Service in Afghanistan, said, "I've been an emotional disappearing this week, maybe it's a little sweet, but that's so important."
It only confirms how much this means for me, how much Helen and I worked, and Robin also.
These were fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we would be no one, so thank him very much, he's the best trainer in the world.
I couldn't ask for a best partner to train or a better trainer.
Helen Glover and Hiser Stanning haven't lost any hole for five years.
This couple has a pressing rhythm that their competitors never could match.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the New Zealand and Denmark teams began approaching, Stanning and Glover had too much in stock.
We were strong in the phase.
Helen said, "Let in the process, stay in the process."
It's very important now not to smell.
We had a good time, and at the same time we didn't try to do something awesome.
We weren't waiting for the fever today, we just waited for a good grit and go and win this gorge that we did.
A couple needs a year to decide on their future.
The Globe must be married in the next month, in her own television scanner, by Steve Beckholl.
Now she just wants to enjoy a moment.
I didn't want to say that it's my last hole.
That would mean too much pressure.
I needed about six months in London to realize that I became the Olympic Champion.
It was so new, and I was so pressed.
I need four minutes here.
I wonder myself so better," she said.

The Government of Thailand, a head-in-law of Yinglak Chinavat in January 2014, announced the establishment of an emergency situation in Bangkok and the capital of provinces.
The special regime has been extended 60 days.
Like two explosions in Bangkok.
In January 2014, in the Bangkok Center, in the Pobeda monument, where one of the main protesters has been conducted, two explosions resulting from 28 people suffered, five of them were critical.

The authorities have strengthened the security measures in the capital and engaged in military forces to protect demonstrators.
In Sohma Logue, there was an development of conditions.
As it was known, the Government proposed to agree on the draft conditions for the counterparty of the Suha Log with the maintenance of two key limits.
It is proposed to not allow the company where 25 per cent is and more foreigners, and the claims in which the capital is not at least 25 per cent of the guest participation.

The project was introduced in midnight, specifying one of them.

" The audience may already be declared in August, immediately after the Government's discharge, and, taking into account the deadline for the collection of applications for potential participants (not less than 45 days), the tender may be held in October,” says in Minorado.
According to the project, two key requirements were maintained to potential participants, which had been sent to the Ministers and FIWs in July (e.g. " у").
The first is the capital of candidates, however, 25 per cent of the guest participation.
Second is the refusal of access to businesses under the control of foreign investors, resulting from the understanding of the FD-57 on foreign investment in strategic society.
According to two of the FZ draft articles, as already written in "augmentation " 2 August, the company whose beneficiary (25 per cent of the amounts and above) is not tax residents or have a double citizenship.
The Government is able to introduce such limitations, since the Suhao Log relates to the emergency of the federal value (more than 50 tons of gold).
In the Minoprofessors, the project was reaffirmed that the "consistence of restrictions for foreign companies" but refused to comment on the details to the Government's allocation.
In December 2015, the officer of the shopping capital issued the Iraqi area, said in Minorred, and later reaffirmed the Governor of the Sergey Lewchenko region, noting that it was addressed to his former Sergeem Eroceanko, the "ancient investor contract with the "Rustek".
Those who met the restrictions for foreigners have not been identified.

"But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be adopted after the declaration of the conditions, " added to the Police.
It may participate in ALRA, but a decision by the RF Government, the sources were said ".
The possibility for the development of Suhgo Loga was declared the Russian Gold and the Canadian Kinross, which develops as Polymetal and Northgold, is not interested in the " data.
Head of the Golden Industry RF Sergey Kashuba in December 2015 estimated "investment in Shua Log in $2.5-4 billion.
The majority of potential candidates is not only the number of investments but also the complexity of the project: there is a need for serious training of resources and technologies with complex machines, the "co-sponsor" in the sector.
At the pension market, the UK Finance Pension Administrator launched the process of association of four sub-controlled NGOs.
As a result, "Gazfond Pension Coppers" will be created by a number of NFF collected by about 373 billion rubs.
On the launch of a combination procedure of four pension funds, "KIT Finance", "Promford", "Search" and "Gazfond Pension Collections" last night, reported the owner of the CHIT Finance Administrator of Pension.
"The reorganization is implemented in accordance with the CBI, in compliance with the requirements of non-profit conditions of existing treaties", states the company.
The combination is based on the Gazfond Pennsioon Coppers.
As notes the generator of the NFF Oлег Bylishsky, the combination of funds allows a number of tasks: the enhancement of geographic presence, the concentration of development resources, the reduction of costs, the trend of the best practices of each of the funds and the optimalization of corporate management.
In his words, the oriental term of the consolidation is the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the combination of NGOs of Gazfond Pennsioon captures, it will become the larger player on the POP market.
According to the data on 31 March, the payment of unit funds exceeded 373 billion rubbers.
As reported on the funds, the beneficiaries of their owners - " ICT Finance of the Pension Administrator " are currently Anatole Gavrienco (65 per cent of subcontrolled OOs) and Gazfond (35 per cent).
However, the association of the group has launched a lot of competitors later.
Yes, the under-controlled O1-NFN-Body-Downed-Government Scalfond was still in the beginning of the current year.
This Joint NGO is currently joining the Uralssib Funds and the Russian Standard.
"Introduction in a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary to solve structural tasks", notes the NFP 'Body' Nicola Sydors.
The active work on the consolidation of funds from April is also in the Safmar Pension Group, the "European", "Reformation and Scientific" and the "Regionfund" must be included in the Safmar NGO until the end of this year.
In 2017, the GNF is joined to them.
"Inclusion of funds will effectively enhance risk control, operational processes and expenditure", noted in the Safmar Pension Group.
The CIT Finance Administrator of Pension may be paid by a number of reasons for the experts.
Until recently, NGOs could not purchase more than 40 per cent of the infrastructure expenditure in which the group was actively located.
After adjustment to the CB in March this year on a number of employees, relevant requirements of the regulator, there are no more restrictions.
The director of the Financial Institutes ACRA Jury Nogin's rating group, if necessary, can purchase one large player.
A number of NFF leaders from AT-15 as a result of another pause-related reason and, as a result, carriage allocations in a single fund, which should agree to the owners of the group.
Last night Anatolius Gavrilenko was not allowed to comment.
The request for "Hassfond" was not answered.
Although the consolidation of the funds is a job and unexpected event, this decision will be justified at a long distance.
As notes the director of the Consulting Company Sergey Okololesno, the Pension Collections Gazphones are less declined, the union allows to stabilize the basis of other group funds.
In this way, there will be a more successful experience in the ICF's Finance and Promotor Fund in the construction of OPS-based sales, as well as in the use of more modern PP.
The requirements of the CBC to processes and CAPs are continuously growing, so to duplicate the infrastructure for four funds in the single investment policy are not targeted, as the director of the expert RA expert, Paul Mitrofan.
" The effects of duplicating functions in a uniform resolve the possible unit costs", notes Mr. Mitrofan.
The costs for the combination of the four funds of Sergey Okolesne are estimated by 30-50 million rubbers.
" The results of the four funds of such size are about 400 million rubbers per year, when a medium-term budget is really reduced, ", says Mr. Osolsino.
In the Russian procate, Pete and his Dragon were the best dynamic film.
Great species of New Zealand, a slight dragon, a mental history and a canter style are sufficient to believe again in ancient magic, says Elena CRAVcinon.
The scared little was a dragon that became a human child and a swimming boy and a loyal friend.
Pete calls his friend Elliot, who is honoured by a snake of the book, plays with him in a box and slept in a film.
Six years later, his growing and preserved connection is not more different from the other industrial forest stores of Maurice.
In this way, Pita finds a blossom hero Grace (Blace Dallas Howard), while the Brigade of Gavin (Carl Urban), her husband, agressively fled the forest.
Now she must not only believe in the existence of the Dragon but also help him saving him.
Pete is a rapid course to "be a man" in the environment of the ideal Americans who have cowboys, the moral code in the heart, and smiling more brilliant than any advertising.
No person looks out and does not work too terrible that the slaughter actually begins to hate or fear him.
Even Gavin, who was locked by an untypical village of his forests, is far away from an injustified malnutrition.
The shocked dragon was also unfair, with a good bouldog, aviation shock and ability to become invisible.
Dragon is awesome, smiling, even smiling, and, happily, he does not always want to smile, so it is usefully different from all known cinematographic dragons.
The visual image of Elliot and his manner maintain such a high stage of emotional involvement that at the most pressing moments, not only smaller, but also adults begin to smile in three hands.
Awesome good and young Oux Figur in the role of Pete, who disappears between the family and the real friend.
And Robert Reedford urges a canonic grandmother who would like to have literally every child.
How did the register David Lauri has been able to remove the fantasticly unusual rhythm of the Drakon Pita film in 1977, which was mediated from the noise to the end of the hospital and mentioned only by a mix of animation and game movie, and to make it the most soulful movie of this summer?
Not as a miracle helped.
In his picture of Laurie from the original, in fact, only two things were taken: the slaughter of Pita and the dragon.
The music numbers and the majority of strange shocks have remained on the board.
In this good statement, people of the Bambie, the Indonesians, and many other beautiful children's hearts are read.
The Disney study continues to expand the galerie of high quality rings in the 21st century.
Of course, "Pit and Dragon" is not so depressed as "the book of Jungley" and there's no artistic abuse in which Kate Blanchet was in the new "Golusk".
But this movie, however, has successfully helped to believe in wonder and good in the best dynamic traditions.
On the other hand, the keys from the magnificent store of Dyskin's register Louri will be obtained for the artistic film adaptation of Peter Pane's history.
David Lawre and the scenar of Toby Haelbrooks have entered a new ambitious project on an unbeduled boy on the James Barry's single speech.
The journalist of RBK Alexandra Sokoloa shall proclame a new accused
The journalists of RBK Alexander Sokolov, who was accused of organizing an extremist structure, declared that the prosecution had not been counted in the case of their subsidiary.
We learned from the investigators last night that the prosecutor had presented such a presentation.
We were planned to participate in the judiciary on the limitation of knowledge with criminal matters, but the meeting was not held, and the investigators reported us about the prosecutor's prosecution.”
She told the prosecutor that the investigator had indicated that the qualification of cases and assembled materials was inadequate.
The investigators now have to eliminate the spaces in the evidence basis and pronounce the new accused of Alexandra Sokolo.
The other article of the Criminal Code (OHCH) is the same, but with other evidence and new evidence, Mrs Dynz declares.
As he reported, Alexander Sokolo was arrested on 29 July 2015.
In June of the current year, the result was excluded from the accused of the RBK journalist on the "Review of the political situation on the side of instability" and "respect of the authority in a illegal way".
Aleksandr Zilbert, a counterparty in the Olympic village, investigated the Russian College, eated in the local table and even tested the WADA test.
It seems that life isn't going to die in seconds.
Even night.
The last older times have been completed, after which the sports require a half-twelve hours to return to the Olympic village.
Furthermore, there are seats and displaces from the village, because some attracts have completed their statements and leave Brazil, and some of them are only coming here.
Well, at 7:30 morning one of the temporary tests has been taken by all the Olympic delegations.
In these congregations, we generally discuss some operational matters, reports the leader of the Sports Delegation of Russian Jord Casics team. - Despite the fact that our houses, considering the sculpture, have taken it in the exploitation of one of the first and have demonstrated all the checkers, even some of the cases.
That's with a heavy water problem, so I'm sorry, with cyclings.
We've been fighting for cleanness for a long time.
First, nobody had to get away.
Then the clinics arrived, but they're just swearing some substance on the ground, yes.
They've got, see if some innovations are innovative.
Mole, you can't touch them humanly.
We know these fields are the clamps!
In general, changes of the clining company have been made and now all of this has been done.
The Olympic village is the South Buto, a bed area that is covered by one side of the mountains, and the other inherent snake, the places of the water.
Well, for the reliability, there's still a two-milling helmet board on which the machines are walking.
All in the village can be placed to 17.000 persons in 3604 apartments located at 31 houses.
One of the 18 stages has a large Russian flag -- this house is completely dedicated to our collection.
In view of a small income, you can immediately determine what problems are to be for the most vulnerable team.
Two statements are declared on the slow registration: "Priminist, don't leave the paper in the toilet!" and from the hand of the "Prime in the icon gift.
It's the same snake in the browsers.
Their funeral race is contrasting with the brochure: "Remember of Infectional Diseases to Rio de Janeiro", "Help in the shock, the fall of the foreign body in a respiratory way, the loss of conscience is a stage of heart-leading reaction", "Health, warm shock, shock and blood".
The text is in a generally pleasant.
For instance, “inspection is associated with a heavy and post-related disorder.
Nevertheless, the good outcome is not all.
It is certain that Russia's position is a nursing who is ready to provide a qualified assistance to the inhabitants of the home, including a delicate and sportive mass.
Instead of the nursing, our delegation's own headquarters.
The door is inspiring crystal "If we will win!".
Well, of course, the verses:
All arguments are absolute burden!
They believe only those who fear.
Let us be less sweet, so Russia won't turn away, and it's not broken!
In order to increase the submission of the spirit, the statement states: "Awesome brothers and sisters!
By the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and all the Russians, the spiritual care of the sports of the Olympic College of Russia performs the protoyer Andrey Wormimrovic Alexandrev.
Put your silence and other requirements on the phone...
Indeed, it is the Meditation Centre and Religious Training for the representatives of all conventions.
Well, the Russian is obtained in the privileged situation, they have their own hour.
With regard to the burning of the nineth stage to the fourth stage, I decided to spend on the leaflet recommended to use during the fire.
And in the darkness, the body was shocked on her.
It was, in all, the workshops of the new clining company.
I believe, at any time, they decided to set up a quiet time directly on cold steps.
At the fourth stage, I was waiting for a meeting with a long - known Vitalia Fedrodwick Dudko, a trainer of our baths, bringing them to the olimphian gold 16 years ago to Sidney.
He and his student, the Champion of Europe of Yan Paul, agreed to show his rooms.
- We live on two, of course, sleeping is almost swimming, but it's not critical.
One of the four, but it's very spacious.
The shock, of course, isn't the shock of confidence, but something can be put.
"No, you're shooting, the tea have finished!" - he develops the tennisist of Svetlan Kuisco, who has met me in the main table.
It is called, though, because it represents a space of 2,7 thousand km and is ready to take 50,000 visitors at the same time.
This is about 600,000 portions in the coast completely free.
The options of the menu are: "Luke from Brazil", "Cuchney of the World", "Asiatic Observers" and "Pickeys, Macronics".
The last option, as I looked, uses a great popularity in our volunteers.
That's what we say, I haven't found any of the gigant restaurant units.
What's the girls?
It's good that I've got a Chinese shooting, sweet.
And the cheese.
But if you understand, we're still worse at the cortex.
There's something you can choose, despite an unexpected unity.
I personally chose a pair of pieces and sweet shoes in tomate soß.
Each wheel has a table with its name in three languages, English, French and Portuguese, as well as the indication of the food value of the product and the existence of allergens in it.
Well, it's all right. It's all right.
I don't even know why this is always in the McDonald's local.
The networks that are disabled can be said the "thopletic" sports from the restaurant are expecting our best friends, the representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
They are submitted to a victorial winner whose football is obtained.
Let's go, you can say!
To obtain a gift, it is necessary to respond correctly, even if eight questions from ten.
There are questions on Russians!
But it didn't.
I mean, I'm in the patriotic explosion, naturally.
The second question has already been discussed: "If I received a notification of the past control, should I immediately go to the end-control point?"
I stopped by the B option, "No, I have one hour."
I've lost, so I've been careful.
I forgot the WDA weakness not to wait.
Indeed, you must be immediately.
Well, at the seventh stage, my situation was very critical.
I thought that if I'd be difficult to observe the balanced dial because of my flesh graphic (and me, it's difficult, too!), I can use biodomes to get "complemented food substances to improve my productivity."
No, they're not allowed!
Exactly, the answer is formulated so that categoryally do not prohibite, but, in several proposals, they refuse.
This WADA plays injuryly!
What's the matter, Russia?
Get away somewhere behind Ethimous, Isnbaev and our whole team.
So I focused on the last force, and I wind an unfortunate football.
You know what you're saying, ours!
In the victory, I entered the Fitzing Center.
The trainer's count.
It's 250.
It was surprising that no Russian sportor was found in this threat.
But maybe it's right?
Don't be training the one who doesn't play!
And here's one of our guy's sit down there.
In the way to the ocult.
Don't worry, not a shot.
In the polycline, as well as in all the villages where the pool is, the device is to extract the preserveers.
He is on the night of the enthusiasming call: "Remember with the end of the house."
Moreover, it is only to switch a iron that remembers the hand of the door store, and the conservation made from the Natural Latex of Amazon is prepared to get out of the device.
I took myself one in the memory.
It's not going to make the sports -- they've brought them 450 thousand.
As a time for celebration and celebration in the Olympic village, there is a total dilution centre.
In any case, it should be identified by the International Olympic Committee in different ways to cost sports $3.25 million per day.
The center of the video graphics, the bill and the tennis tables, the solid football and the cookies, and some strange devices like video repository.
- I'm interesting in the company in the form of a Ukrainian collection that actively uses dicovine games.
Of course, it could just say that you don't want to talk to someone in the form of a Russian collection, yes, all.
Here, in some strange path of circumstances in the eyes, they're saving from the men in the western blue.
It's the most playing kitchen.
In order to spend the whole village, looking at each corner, it needs not less than three hours.
But if you go, not traveling on electronic cars, you're opened and the house of the Canadian shop with income and chamber with rebuilding bathroom, and bicycle office, and work, and chemistry, and parking, and color shops, and shopping with products of daily consumption, and e-mail with unique markets (that you can't even survive from Chinese fleeters), banks and offices, shops, and photos.
And later night, when you asked, you're coming to the air of the olive tree, a variety of lenses in the memory of the abandoned world of friends and parents of the atlets.
And you'll be under the company of the machines that are uncomfortablely smoking for the death of the insects to think forever.
I mean, Olimpiade movement.
There's no end in this village for a minute.
As long as the rest of the Russian world was breathing, Australians were not ordered to have been sentenced to the American Dream Team that the real illnessers had gone into the network.
A little person knows, the news that Inna Delegois wins gold in the XXXI Olympic Games, I received the first.
Maybe I'm even the only mosaic who saw this happening - not to be considered to those who looked at the slaughter in Carioca that night.
This can be aware of only the real slaughter.
Imagine: The deep night of Moscow.
The neighbors down, as always to the night, are slept and starting unfortunately, but very much to smile each other.
And it's threatening to move the kitchen.
On the kitchen, cran has no time to go to the market and buy how he asked a new sandwich.
There was nothing understood in the television schedule, so it was just the control of the Match channel, the "First" and in any case of Russia, although it was almost unreasonable.
Russia is a family of repeats, all the sports there's some reason to write.
There are serials in direct ether translating.
Hope, of course, to Matt's whole night, a young man cryed in newspapers first about the great half-fill of Delivela, Shanaev, then the striking battle for gold.
It would be logical to show it.
But instead of this, the United States, Australia.
I can't say anything bad about this.
Australians were equivalent, the first half of their gains.
They were placed on the place of the guards from their own large Americans.
As a result, we have been lost, but, as we are now expressed, the Basketbol Olympic Turin will not be previous.
It's all right, but it's close to the battle with De France and on the screen without changes.
In a easy panel, I'm starting to post the channels.
That's a feeling, the second time it's crazy.
All right, let's go back to the cable.
There's no thematic "Matchy" phenomenon.
Oh, my feelings, the battle will start.
Some sporting websites do not affect me.
The court Cerfing provides an unexpected but unexpected result.
The Perv.'s website provides a direct technical transmission of all condenses that are in this time.
I click on the phenomenon, I get gold units.
The degree is very contractual, goes forward to the eye - and it is obviously starting a long time.
Italians are almost totally reacting.
We're at one point, until the end will hear more than two seconds.
De Franciska is shocked to Derigrezov, and it declines, the time ends, the Italian sleeves.
Getting!
After a few seconds, the Olympic messenger reports about the fourth gold meal.
I'm the first one who saw it with my eyes.
Insensitive, faithful, affiliate.
The Muslim Musulman (DM) Tataristan ' s spirit is rejected from using Russian language in the swords.
Last night, the DOM bonded his masters to take five-year preaching only to Tatarese to put young tatars “to study their own language”.
The government claims that it does not harm the Muslim's right to other nationalities.
In some dreams, the Tatarian language does not understand to 60 per cent, among whose foreign students, migrants and its taxi.
The people are afraid that their preaching in the Tatarian "no goes to the whole hearing."
Last night, the DOM Tataristan decided to carry out fifth preaching in the dreams of the Republic only in the Tatarian language.
As the muffin of the Tataristan Camille Samoullyn stated, this should be a stimulate for young tatars "to study their family language".
"To those who say it's hard, we're trying to organize the tatarian lessons completely free", promised Mr. Samuellin.
He added that “decision has already entered into force” and today in all the dreams of preaching“ must be already in the Tatarian language. ”
He recalled that D.M. Tataristan published the school magazine with the standard preaching in the Tatar language.
The name that's not enough to say in Tatark, "that may prepare for it."
DOM Tataristan combines more than thousands of income in all the municipalities of the Republic.
According to the Muffatian, the five - year - old preaching areas are exclusively carried out in Tatar language.
At the same time, in Kazania a number of swords were previously used as Russian.
In particular, as the Muffie stated, this was practiced in Burnav's Sword, Zacabana and Eniler.
However, Mr. Mohammedsin stressed that the leadership was the task of all students to possess both public languages of the Republic, independently of nationality.
"Don't matter what disorder the Muslim-Netator can't be", emphasized Mr. Mohammed, explaining that the preaching itself "is not a binding part of the nams."
In this way, the namosis will continue to read on the Arab, the swords keep lessons and lessons in Russian language.
At the same time Raphik Mohammedskin said that there was no serious threat to extinction of Tatarian language from the sword.
In addition to Russian and Tatarian other languages, for example, Zabec or Tajik, there are no use in the preaching in the Republic.
The decision of the DOM was actively supported in the Tatar World Congress Committee.
The executive head of the VCT Rinat Zakiro said, "The men are the important part of our national life."
It would be painful if the Tatarian language was gone.
He noted that the preaching was only “the desire of the same names” in the Tatar language but in the executive ICT, "that is right".
The names of the Russian preaching are ready to make the decision of DM, but they believe that the desire to find difficulties with the understanding of the priests.
The sword goes and the tatars, and the Russians.
Many do not understand language.
They will, of course, be disappointed.
"It's supposed to be overlooked," says the Burnav's sword Farhat Mawletdin.
He said, preach in Russian language even many tatarams because "Russian and schools, and in children, at radio is an idea."
However, he believes that the sword will continue to learn and learn in Russian languages that are conducted in other days.
We trust in God.
Allah will show out of this situation."
But about 60% of us don't know Tatarian language.
It's too sweethearts, taxi, and azerbaijans.
Many goes to us foreign students: Africans, Arabs.
"We have four years as we went to Russian language," said they.
He believes that in the Tatar language the preaching will "towards a closer circle and will not go to the whole hearing."
But we will submit to the full decision.
Only the results of the preaching work will be different.
But it's time to show.
"My, for example, will be easier because the Tatarian is my family," said Gabulla Galilein.

The "Anape" effect criticizes as a career in Asia
Snapchat claims that the filter is inspired, but some suspects say that it is racially free.
The Snapchat tool allows approximately 150 million users a day to change the reality and to play personality with ways that are limited to the absorption.
You can turn yourself into ananas, dogs, or persons to make up the image of Roy Liechtenstein.
Lines are the instruments that cover more than 30 million rejusted villages a day.
All mistakes are soon known.
The Snapchat Lines were sent to criticize in the past when they were accused of the application of the dark skin of the person or encouraged the elected persons as the ideal of the beauty.
So when some users proposed a lympe that had given them out of space, dentists and smells, some critics found that racist cards on Asians were "hellolits".
They questioned whether these recurrences are towards a more serious issue of the company related to diversity.
In the midst, communications and consequences of the reports in The Verge and Motherboard were distributed, and on the next day after Snapchat claimed that the function was deleted.
The company proposed: Linse was designed as an anam, not as a career in Asians.
But experts who know racism not listened, Linz recalled the distressing stereotypes in action.
Others fully rejected the comparison with anae.
In the electronic letter Grace Sparapani, a Korean art student who was actively shared on the photos, said that the lince was "awesome and at least smooth".
She added that " was hard to face with the comparison of the side of the Asian career and the effects of the filter.
This shows that the filter is not just ironic, but in the upper stage of degrading iron.
Snapchat is not the only company through these cultural bridges.
The American culture seems to be involved in a struggle for diversity and inclusiveness, starting from corporate meetings to the Hollywood and the girls, which we all have.
And the great hearing of young people in Snapchat, who are raised more than their old generation, may mean that they are more likely to expect understanding.
When one of Snapchat's rings creates a painful image for the user, he said in the 25th-year-old Catty Jo, "the events are much more difficult to remain unremarked as it was before."
On Friday, Ju, the product manager and engineer working at Medium decided to remove the accounting record in Snaapchat and called others to do the same.
In the Medium article and in the phone interview, she said that racial oppositions were a cause of inadequate diversity in Sneephite.
Jhu was predominantly discovered by a white company that was only a man and ended her article by the hashtego: #DeleteSnapchat.
Juu, who is the American origin of China, wrote: "If they have no sufficient number of non-white people in the State who could take such decisions, or work unleavened people, they do not work as a position that can be safe and openly expressed."
Other investigators share their view, expressing unpleasantness that Snapchat did not respond to the majority of its questions.
The company does not publish information on the presentation of national minorities in its State, emphasising its status of the private company.
The fourth Snapchat refused to discuss the racial origin of his personnel, but, as a reliable person said, the company recently started a publisher in order to concentrate in inadequate population areas and active efforts to integrate internal resources.
From his side, John said she will keep its accounting record in Snapchat closed, adding: "I'm interesting if they really need more users like us, so they can say that that's not going."
The Military Guidelines reported on ICIL, reports the Committee of the Congress
The officials of the Central Force Commander of the United States have changed the information reports to submit a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the basis of the event on the place, reported the Committee of the Congress in the report issued on Thursday.
The interim report of the operational group established by the Presidency of the Palestinian Committee on Affairs of the VS, the Research Committee and the Subcommittee on Military Contributions has discovered "widely distributed involuntary" between the analysis of the Central Commanding Service, which claims that the leaders have sent their evaluation of American Actions to win against the Islamic State.
The Central Control, known as Center, is the main military management in the city of Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
" The documents made by the Centre's High Command has generally given a more optimistic picture of the United States anti-terrorism action as confirmed by real data on the place of events and were stablely more optimistic than the analysis provided by other special servants, " said in the reporting news.
“What happened in the Century is unacceptable: When the higher leadership represents an invalid analysis, our military sufferings,” said the representative of the Party of Ken Calvert, the Republic of California.
The leadership problems in the Centre are reached by the most higher organization.
Decimal reports have been discussed in detail the deficiencies that continued in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of American Actions aimed at training armed Iraq ' s armed forces provided by the Headquarter.
Although it does not contain the final evidence that the Ombudsman Administration members have ordered to fail the reports, he claims that analyticals felt that the Headquarter had to make them more optimistic towards the threat of the Islamic State, also known as IHIL or ISIL.
"In the first half of 2015, many presss, statements and witnesses of the Center Command in the Congress were significantly optimistic than real events,” reported.
For example, the official of the Centre announced publicly that the large military attack aimed at returning Mosul could be started in April or May 2015.
Mosul, second on the largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
“After the investigation, it is known for a month,” said the Party ' s Deputy Representative Mike Pompeo, the Republic of Canasas.
From mid-2020 to mid-2015, the United States Headquarter Headquarters has detailed commanding information to reduce the threat of IHL in Iraq.
The Republicans had established a operational group when they learned that analysis expressed concern that the Islamic State reported had been phalised.
During the progress of the investigation, by the report published on Thursday, the more developed data will be followed.
The main inspector of the Ministry of Defence is the main inspector of the Centre of Inquiry, which is not completed at the time of the investigation.
The representatives of the Democratic Party in the Palestinian Representatives of the United States Congress have published their own data, agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republic of Operational Group.
"In 2014 and 2015, the Centre has established a excessive evaluation procedure for the evaluation of the information regarding IHL and Iraq ' s troops, " said in the statement of the member of the Party of Adam B. Shif, the principal representative of the Democratic Party in the Committee.
This procedure, as Shifth says, "is inherited the outcome of the disclosure documents", harmed the moral status of analysis and "inadequate reflects expenditure".
However, Shif and the Democratics claim that the White House has not found evidence that the Century House had tried to impose analytics to shoot their arrests under a "designed or political interpretation".
The preliminary results of the Congress investigation were submitted on Tuesday The Daily Beast.
The New York Times last August reported that there was an investigation of the main inspector Pentagon, open after the complaints of Centko Analytics.
Commissioner Patrick Evans, representative of Pentagon, said that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the report of the Assembly until the investigation of the main inspector continues.
But he said that “experts sometimes disappear in the views of the comprehensive data process, and the Services and the Ministry of Defence welcome the healthy dialogue on these important issues relating to national security”.
The results of the investigation are a question of whether the purposes of the American Bombering Bomber in Iraq and Syria are achieved (which is now more representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
But last year, the statements have been considered that President Obama may believe that the Central Commandment provides real evaluation of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other critical points.
The criticisms made by the Islamic State are repeating the disputes that were placed over ten years when the investigation analysis of Center Gregory Hucker wrote a research article in which he stated that the Administration of George Walker Bush, because of many protest analysts, had been supported by a small number of armed forces in Iraq and did not think that the invasion of 2003 would be followed.
Hucker also played a key role in the protest launched by the Islamic State.
Last year, according to the officers, the Hucker team concluded that, despite the public reports on return, the aircrafts on the oil firms belonging to the Islamic State did not have a significant deterioration of the financial status of the terrorism group because it had built temporary oil to sell in the black market.
However, opening was not distributed beyond the Central Command, as reported in the Times September.
The first commander of Century, General Lloyd J. Ostin III, was criticized last year after the witnesses in Senate, which many deputy had regarded the extreme optimistic evaluation of war.
General Ostin went to the departure in April and was registered in the Hen Joseph L. there.

She lost Olympiadu 2008 when she did not pass the finance tower.
Then, 2012, when it wasn't over her and her team partner.
The next year, Coig Parnham, was appointed to the trainer, and it started to change.
"Cultural change, psychological change, change in physical training," said Bam.
We did not have such productivity in London now.
We have completely changed our views.
On Thursday night, Bam opened a count in the first half of the flight game with a short distance.
India went to the game without a single victory in the tourist, but the team showed himself to the surprise of the wheel and maintained the amount of 1-0 to the end of the third period when Baham took the initiative in his hands.
She made a long passenger with a layer down the left side of the field, then split into the middle and sent a smooth to the door, so the Americans had the advantage of 2-0.
Melissa Gonzales added a final hole in the midst of the fourth period.
The winning was the first in the tournament for the United States flights by Hanky Briggs, who passed on one hole in each of the first three winners.
She's in the shooting.
Like Bam.
"We are in good situation right now," said Parnham, "but it depends better on the outcome of Saturday Game.
Without the Olympic Game, "Zen" basket games
Whereever you were, it's Olimpiade.
The events in Rio de Janeiro are inevitably and inevitable, this is a worse combination of conspiration and efforts.
It's like the olympic fire and there's the horrible fake that is transferred from the cheese to the giant to the three-atlonist.
You can't enable television, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the cafe and don't listen to Simone Bails, Kate Ledecks, or a shock between Michael Feliples and Chad de Chloe.
There's another Logan Duley.
Duley, who is the first part of the Olympic Games, could be among the famousitys shown in the plot-times of the sponsor and the reliable public roles, if it is a plumb, ginost, or even a fectalist.
But a 28-year-old Duley from the town of Lake Force in California is struggling for gold in the olympic coasts.
The Olympic fire does not see all the events similarly.
Besides the center, partly in the dark, there are the species of sports that are not generally recognized: a fire from a plumatic gun, a shooting, a badminton, a thockwadon.
Brass will always be with us as long as his kingdom is.
But if I'm allowed to be able to protect your personal appreciation, let me take your attention to the modest advertising of the bathroom.
Although bathrooms are an olimpy species since 2000, when they were dealing with games in Sidney, they received so little recognition that many of my requested people were not aware that they were really related to the olympic sports.
This may be regional inutility.
The United States wished and sent sports to the slaughter, they never winned meal in the shuttle, and their sports did not go to the end until 2012.
Chinese and Russians are generally shared in the courageous rewards, and Chinese and Canadian women are women.
Dun Dun from China and Rouzi McClenan from Canada will protect their London gold meal this year.
But the bathrooms have an autsyder sharm, in particular because they are rather associated with the circle college than with the Olympic games.
I have to recognize here that I'm not a expert, but just a landed enthusiast.
Indeed, they have a comic potential, which is the carcase of unfinished springs, but also the extraction of hymnastics and water swimming pools, two types of sports that are mainly covered by themselves.
The word "batut" comes from the Spanish word "el trampoline", which means "trumpling for water."
The winning candidates are shocked to a guiant shuttle, flying at about 30 feet [30 feet] air, and the series of acrobatic tricks (turns, slows and salts) must be filled to the final landscape at feet.
They are assessed by the implementation, complexity and " time of flight " in accordance with the official Olympic Games.
Twenty-thirds of 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will be confronted in Rio.
The most distributed Olympic course is first.
The applicants should go forward, faster, above and above in the golden flight, sometimes to the finish, and sometimes back and first, there by the field.
They are not only trying to finish or older stone, but also to switch TV cameras, to another swimming ride: a world or olympic resource.
This is a deep effort to strive, worthy, even fanaticly, and it is enough to make a swimming even the slaughter.
But I think it's a few of the games.
From him, the shooting on the bathroom gives a shock.
Batuist shipping up.
The move forward is not target.
He or she points out that it seems weak as a astronom, fly up, then down, then without efforts again up.
There is no competitive or difficulty in them, but there is no smell of finishing in all the programs, there is no long-term pieces, just a wonderful time disappearance and degradation.
It's the nearest oil type of sport.
Women ' s qualifications, and then the finish will go on Friday, transmission for Eastern European time; husbands in Saturday, also at the time.
NBC will translated the finance within the daily programme starting from 14:00 to both day.
A peaceful, beautiful moment is expected in the shape of Olimpiade.
And if the growth of consciousness can only be achieved by a male sports and objection, as stated in the Wall Street Journal, recently suggested men from the United States, Duly is only waiting for their new excited fans.
Generation protests in Ethiopia, the former United States Union
Year protests in Ethiopia
Demons that require political change in Ethiopia faced a angry opposition from the Government.
The witnesses say that decades of protesters were deadly blessed during the police collections.
Is Ethiopia really on the grain of shock?
In the past decade, it was one of the most stabil African countries, a strong Western Union with the rapid development economy.
But in the past months, the anti-governmental protesters have shocked the country, distributing more its territory.
Only in the last week, thousands of people have been on the street, requireing radical political changes.
The Government ' s response to human rights was cruel.
The witnesses claimed that the police officers had shooted tens of unarmed demonstrators.
Video records from the protests predicted at the end of the last year or at the beginning of this year show that the security officers kill young people with balls when they put their hands on the wall.
The Supreme Officer of the United Nations Human Rights is now calling for a careful investigation.
"It was always difficult to keep this country away and will continue to be more complicated," said Rashid Abdi, head of the African Rog project in the international research group.
Ethiopia is a second African country after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by Western.
American military and disclosure services closely cooperate with ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and almost no country in Africa has received such support from the West.
Ethiopian economy is developing with impressive speed.
Her infrastructure has been significantly improved, and there is even a new reward train to Addis Abbe.
And its streets are normally quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia was a picture of democracy - human rights organizations regularly mention government repressions - the opposition on the territory of the State had been presumed by dissidents actually slowed to silence.
Many of them were slaughtered, sentenced in prison, murdered or disfellowshipped in the remote desert.
But that can change.
“If people are constantly turning up and leaveing other options, except to protest, upset up,” said Seum Teshmae, university student in Central Ethiopia.
All youths protest.
The generation is protesting.
The complaints are many, starting from the earth-use, finished by the government's coalition.
After the widely critical elections in the past year, the Government and its unions fully strengthened the opposition and now controlled 100 per cent of the Parliament.
At the same time, the tension around the border with Eritrea grows; the fighting for this undefinited, controversial border has led to hundreds of lives in June.
Analytics are afraid that separater groups who have been destroyed in the past few years, such as the Liberation Front or the National Liberation Fund of Obama, may try to use concerns and rearme.
A number of factors explain why painful feelings, a few years smiling in the depth of the soul, are now smiling.
First, it seems that it would be completely unfair: smartphones.
Only the number of ethiopians have been able to share in social networks in the past couple of years, since low smartphones have become common and internet services have been better.
Even when the Government closes access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often happens, especially during protests, many people still find the opportunity to share through the server proxy that hide where they are.
Many young ethiopians said that they were organized for protests.
Second, there are more solidarity between Ormo and Amhara, two major ethnic groups.
Ormoo and Amhara are not natural unions.
Over the centuries, Amhara, from the best Christian high-good areas of Ethiopia, has prospered in policies and business, Ormo, which many of them are Muslims and live in lower areas.
But it's also changed.
"We will act with a message under a single start," said Mulata Gemeich, leader of Ormo.
The major protesters went in Amhara and Ormo.
Many of the Amhara and Ormoo feel that Ethiopia is injustly dominating the members of the Ethiopia ethnic group, which represents about 6 per cent of the population and controls military and discretional services, trade and policies.
The third reason for concern is the loss of Merles Zenaway.
Meles, an ex-resident leader, complied with the responsibility of the Prime Minister of Ethiopian in the age of 17 years, to death from unknown disease in 2012.
He was considered tactical, a person who could predict the danger.
Analytics argued that he had particularly identified the first signs of injury and used investigators to obtain data and reduce opposers.
“The current regime is not a good meaning,” said Abdi, analysis of conflict situations.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalney, came here and took place with Melissa.
Unlike Meles, the name of the Tunisia region in the northern Ethiopia, Yalemariam, was the southern.
Analytics say he does not use confidence in the security services controlled by the Youike.
Many are afraid that this would lead to even more bloodprostitution.
The last time, Ethiopia survived such concerns in 2005, after thousands of people protested against what analysis seemed to have been elected by the Government, and then resulted.
Many protesters were killed during the following repressions, although less than the last months were compared, and the concern period was relatively fast.
Development experts expressed appreciation to the leaders of Ethiopia for a dimensive development of infrastructure, such as a new trail trail and significant success in combating poverty.
But it is obvious that it did not stop the growth of internal inhumanity by the Government of Ethiopia.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Honduras, the city of Amhara attacked the companies belonging to the Cuban, and the Anti-Tagular Hasting in social networks became a comprehensive.
Analytics stated that protesters are the United States and other Western Unions in an unfair situation.
The American Government used Ethiopia as a base for unpilot fleet over neighbouring Somalia, although recently announced that the base was closed.
From one part, it is clear that western wants to support democracy, but he does not want to lose his counterparty to a already unstable region.
"And it'll be hard to go through this pressing Canada," said Abigail.
Donald Tramp explains his statement that IHIL was based on Obama, "Sarpam"
Donald J. Tramp tried to forget the last conflict covering his predicted stage on Friday, claiming that he was smiling when a few times in this week said that President Obama and Hilary Clinton were "building" of a terrorist group of the Islamic State.
It explained new questions regarding the opinion of the candidate at the President of the Republic of the Republic of America.
It also set his Vice-Chairpersons who tried to protect him during the concerns, in a delicate situation, as they had to explain the expressions he probably did not mean.
He expressed this proposal for the midnight, Tramp urged his approval on Friday, repeating in the interview that he really wanted to say that President and Clinton founded IHL.
But in the early morning in Twitter, the Tramp wrote that he was just shocking.
This post was a direct contrary to the approval made all day before Tramp claimed in several interviews that he was absolutely serious in his accused.
When the Radio Resident Hue Huitt tried to help Tramp to relieve the statement, he recalled that Obama wanted to destroy the IHIL, the candidate to the President of the Republic of Party had not been used.
The last scandal was discovered when the Tramp tried to redirect its campaign to the economy on the background of the rail reduction.
Tramp and Clinton were discussed with competitive issues about the economy in Michigan this week.
On Thramp again tried to return to this subject.
Once he went to Twitter, he warned that Clinton's plans would lead to increased tax, and said that she was sweet.
Tramp used shrines as a correction.
At the end of July, after he urged the general criticism, he almost expressed the idea that the Russians should cut the electronic mail to Clinton, he later explained his comments, saying, "I'm swear."
This approach allows the Trampou to go beyond the limits of the permitted in the political speech and his brothers to return in the case of need.
"I think that's his way to test the messages that have a response among his worshipers, look at how they work, and then explain them in the same or other part, depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert on the analysis of the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's careful in his statements and knows that they are enough to be able to treat them differently.
Instead of shutting the expressions for a wide electorate, Tramp took more vulnerable ton in the past days, while his rating continues to fall.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Thursday, showed that Tramp enters Clynton with a large overflow in Northern Caroline, Virginia and Colorad and goes with her in Florida.
Although Tramp is generally trying to apologize for producing things that say, he often accuses its critics in wrong interpretation of his words and inconsistent of his humor feelings.
But as Trump was an object of higher attention in the last months of the presidency campaign, his sweet was put to his faithful unions in a bad situation, and it should be publicly supported by what kind of statements it would have been.
Rudolf W. Juliani, former Mr. New York, who is one of the most famous Vice-Presidents of Trampa, has made serious efforts to protect the candidate to the interview given by the CNN on Friday.
"I think he's what he says is a acceptable political comment," said Julian when he asked for the validity of the Trump approval that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
That is true that IGIL was almost an unknown small organisation, and he called it an unprecedented threat, absolutely injustly, and that's why it happened, because he issued the army from Iraq.
The majority of the Mediterranean Republicans believed that the Obama Administration, in which Clinton was employed by the State Secretary, allowed IHL to disappear, since it was not grateful to control the situation in the Middle East.
Before the minute in Pennsylvania, the Tramp continued to attack the media in Twitter for the dismissing of each of his words and forecast.
He was shocking about the "functions" television experts that tried to think about him, and said, "He's weak!"
Some democratics expressed the judgments of Trampa as the most reaffirmed that it would not be paid to the Presidents.
Sometimes the extraordinary coffee returns to Greenpoint
The Verb coffee was a whispering shore that took only places in Williamsberg, where it wasn't Wi-Fi, but gave a good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, it was removed from its place with a vitrine at the Bedford Avenue.
The Soup Sheri Magazine, which took the Varb year 2014, is selling meals in the cases.
Local people cryed to it as the last loss of the updated city.
"New York is always changed, I know, but I can't believe that CBGB's dead, the hotel Chalsey is destroyed, and the Varb is now a shopping."
But some New York is constantly changed, he's up-to-date.
The born coffee "Werb" was opened in November last year in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original place.
The new "Werbe" has a Wi-Fi and takes credit cards, but some of them remained the same staff and a simple atmosphere.
Café is still good.
Simon Rodriguez, an old official of the old coffee, is the owner and the general manager at the new place.
He began working in Verbe in 2001 and was there until the end was.
When one of the customers suggested to give him a new place, he said that it would be joyful.
Rodriguez, 36 years old, left a lot in the previous view.
"Werb" works with the same bagel diploma and buys the same model.
It has even been set for the old Varba.
But Rodriguez said he would also want to experimentate.
He proposed a new observance.
The sandwich is presented in the menu, with becon, eggs and sweet, and is present in the existence of pumps from caps or smells.
There's a guard from the white qualities.
The coffee doesn't get a drink anymore, but now they're preparing sweet sucks.
9 months later, Rodriguez said that he had focused on the unlike flow of old permanent clients.
"A few former customers have also paid prices from Williamsberg," he shared.
Rebecca Olivier was one of the recent resurrections.
Olivier, 34 years old, lived in Williamsberg and often visited Warb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she was still going there.
After the Verba closed, she said she stopped drinking coffee at some time.
"I understood the coffee and the atmosphere put me in the Warbe," she said.
Now she's drinking a coffee again, although in that day she ordered a coffee purchased, another news.
Tom Cental, another old client, was dedicated to visit Verb since 2003.
He was in front of the work and urged the same as the same.
"In the fifth minute, every day, as at hours, I came, and for me prepared my bag with oil and with all the beginnings," he said.
Rodriguez made what he wanted to experiencing and introduce new observances in the menu.
Centeral still makes a common order today, but once he changes something with bicon, eggs or bagels with all starts.
Rodriguez said he wasn't on the dinner that the winter had ever had a old place.
Moreover, the Soup Sheri owners suggested to make a special milk for "Werba" by using coffee coffee prepared as a cold ingringer.
"I think we may agree on their proposal," said Rodriguez.
The permanent inhabitants of Greenpoint of the Poland also loved this coffee.
One of these new clients moved the menu into the Poland language, and Rodriguez said that he plans to find a place for him in the winter so that his new neighbors would feel desirable.
The new place has other benefits.
The local socket point is planned to differ on bottles and to sell coffee prepared in a cold way.
There is a possibility that the coffee joins its neighbor building.
For many customers, the new "Werb" is involved in the menu of their favorite observance.
Joseph Whitt was a permanent customer and told him he was killed by a pain when they closed.
When a coffee was opened to a new place, Whitt said that when I entered and commanded the coffee, he felt like he returned home.
"When long I wanted to feel this aroma," he admitted.
Depressive food of depression in the "Plural Trapease"
In March 1933, after the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt dinner at the Olympic Office.
As a gurman, President Ruizell loved the fifth adventure, for example, the Fifth Avenue and the Mediterranean sweet.
His menu was more modest on that day: sweet eggs in tomate sossue, card-felt powder and desel-pounding.
"This was the act of culinary solidarity with people suffering," said Jane Gigelman.
Her husband Andrew Cow added: "It was also a message to the Americans about how to ask them."
The couples living in Brooklin-Hites are food history specialists.
The last book of the Coua, "The Ragu of China", was dedicated to the Chinese kitchen in America, and Gigerelman told the history of life in the cotton apartment in the lower East Side, through food in his book The 97 House on the French garden.
The new joint work of the "Please Trapey", which will be published in the Sunday of Harper, is the history of American food in the Great Depression.
When they showed their own culinary solidarity, they met a dinner reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small shopping area in the Flatian Quartal, working since 1929, the Birdshaw Bay.
Giggelman, 54, ordered a bleeding skin and a butterbow with oil shoes, and Cou, 57, took a hind, a carttable powder and a vegetable sweet.
When the reporter ordered the milk route, the couple read the appropriate shipping point for the discussion of food at the Depression era.
"The roulets used the biggest question," said Gingerman.
There was a swimming rule, a swimming rule, a bomb route.
They were made from the main ingring and milk products that were enabled to increase the ingredient.
Imagine that you eat so much as you need for dinner.
Cou's been threatened.
"It is sure he was in a stone snake," he said.
In the years before the Depression of the American Table, especially in the rural area, the Swedish table was represented.
Women's groups were prepared for farmers, and the swimming swimming pig was offered at breakfast, dinner and dinner.
The Americans have sent food to the hungers of Europeans during the First World War, and the "Trape" describes how the country has seen soon that it was stopped to be a country of a nation.
"It was time when food became a central and unfair topic for the Americans," said Cou, explaining why he and his wife decided to write it.
The new budget ratio was so simple: remarkable observances, such as routines and safes, became the main food products; the safeguard is " a good way to sweat food", noted Gingerman, because the snake could hide non-competent inheritances under a sweet soup.
The fresh fruit was replaced by a more decreasing sugar.
In many years, the meal has become the economicly distributed vegetable.
People were worried about strange shocks because energy and food values were more important than skin and even culinary.
By studying the book includes receptives, Gigelman prepared the blood of that epoch: a smooth swallowed skin.
"This supplement was not used by success to the dinner table," said Cou.
Gielman added, "This was very strange."
The skin oil is not perfectly in the snake.
This was characterized for many household receipts.
As never before and ever since, household specialists, including Louis Stanley, head of the Federal Office of the Hospital Office, managed food addictions from 1923 to 1943.
The publication of receptives and articles in newspapers and magazines recommended women to become “budgetary representatives”, to take calls and to convert the lost spaghet with a sculpture.
"Pluck Trapese" is the shock of favorite historic facts.
In particular, the reports of the Government ' s responses to the hunger citizens, such as the position of President Gerbert Gubert, in the spirit "the power of pigs".
It was publicly transferred to a simple farmer strike of the State of Ivoir at the time of his childhood, and he was eating as a million of people who had become.
"He liked the continental kitchen, for example, a fish with a sweet soup," said Cou.
He eats almost in a shooting table, smelling.
He was fantastically disfellowshipped from reality.
The Chairman Rubelt could make the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not recommended to give him an example of his own desire.
As says in the book, Eleanor Ruзвellt launched a economy that was not perfectly interested in the shooting, and this resulted in that the White House "not only used the most unique food in Washington, but sometimes and the most reversely prepared".
Many of the culinary receipts of Depression were forgotten when the country was back to the feet.
Their heritage is our continuing focus on calories and food, says Gigelman, and how science has been used in the preparation of food.
The couples say that during the writing of the book, they have better understanded the nutrition of Zegelman’s mother — that she couldn’t eat, for example.
"It was seriously scared of an innocent relationship with food," said Cou.
Gielman recalls: "He's fully seen people."
It was one unfortunate case with profiles.
When the bathrooms in Eisenberg's past, they and Cou had a dezer, who prepared the house: a dezer of the sweet dinner, who was President Ruizellt eated at the dinner.
"This is called a smooth smell," said Gigelman, adding that it was distributed to give modest brood receptions.
It was not only bleeding, but also a little sweet, sophisticated, water and swimming.
Everyone was loaded a lie in a neck, corn, and slipperous substance.
It was amazing.
A couple of times requested additional additions.
He said to her wife, "The name of the Greek orbits would not be hindered here. "

Gilead companies will pay costs for law enforcement services during the controversy of the Hepatite C with the Markk company
The company of Gilead Sciences Inc has the right to repay the costs of law entitled to the case of the Hepatitis C manufacturer of the Merck & Co Inc, decided to the federal surrounding court.
In June the Gilead company was released from $200 million for the violation of the two market patents of the company, which were related to the drugs of Gilead, sales leaders, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the American Court found a number of violations from the Markk company, including the lies of judging and other non-ethics.
In the court in the fourth court of the US Federal Environment Court, Beth Lebson Fryman said that the Gilead company had the right to repay the costs carried out during the sack.
Mark's company is trying to add Gilead, which is the market of new generation of drugs from hepatitis C, which can suffer more than 90 per cent of patients with piracy disease.
In 2013, when the Gilead company and Merck gave each other to the court, they declared their rights to the lab that was based on the confosbuvian, an active ingest of Gilead company.

Clinton paid $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of the federal tax rates
Hillary Clinton has distributed its tax statements for 2015, which showed that the candidates to the President of the Democratic Party and her husband had $10.75 million income and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent in this year.
In 2015, Clinton received $1 million in the form of good-budgetary contributions, mainly, at the Clinton Fund, the former President, Bill Clinton, received about $5,3 million in the form of explanation soldiers, and the former government secretariat declared the revenue of $3 million from Simon & Schuster for its book of residence in the State Department.
The Potential Vice-President, United States Senator Tym Keen of Virginia, together with her wife, Anna Holton, has generated tax statements for 10 years.
In 2015, they paid the effective federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
"Hillery Clinton and Tim Keen continue to establish financial transparency standards," said the advisor of the predicted stage of Clinton Jennifer Palmyer.
In full contradiction, Donald Tramp is hidden by details and violates his past promises to promote its tax declarations.
This is the common case for candidates to the President of the United States to publish their tax statements, although the law of them does not require.
The New York businessman Trump and his lawyers called the inspection of the State Tax Service as a reason for his refusal to generate tax statements.
"Our path," wrote in Twitter, the Advisor of the Clinton Yan Sams pre-selection stage, as a matter of the declaration of the candidate from the Democratic Party.
In the Friday, the Special Adviser Michael Coan said the CNN would not allow Trampo to leave them until the check was completed.
The Critics of Trampa, including the candidate to the President of the Republic of the Republic, in 2012, Mitta Romney and other Republic of the Republic, said that he refused to demand his status, his welfare contributions, his business operations and other links, including Russia.
Clinton was disappointed for this issue, and on Thursday, a online video was issued, where the main place was deleted to the republicans who avoided Trampa to generate tax accountability.
On Thursday, she raised this issue during the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what everyone did without exception of the candidate to the President for decades: to publish its tax statements," she said to be gathered.
The Political Journal reported that Tramp had not paid any or almost no tax in the 1990s, and New York Times' business advisor had quoted many lawyers on cash and boughters who believed that the case may still remain.
The federal tax rates were an object of conflict on the presidential elections.
Clinton supported the rules designated by a milliardar, the investor Warren Baffitta, which would ensure that those receiving more than $1 million would pay tax rate as at least 30 per cent.
The Chairman Barak Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clynton last week in Omaha, in the Nebraska State, Baffett, whose Conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based there, proposed to meet and exchange tax declarations.
Baffittet said he's also under the IRS control, and that Tramp was scared not tax collector, but electors.
The Clinton Previous headquarters has generated tax declarations until 2007.
Clintons who are now living in Chapppau, New York, have paid the average federal tax rate of about 32 per cent from 2007 to 2014 and the effective co-acquire tax rate of about 40.5 per cent.
The Clinton Declaration for 2015 showed that only 100 dollars of their revenue were paid.
Their main investment was an inadequate index fund, and the Clinton stated that the capital was $109,000.

Conservation of cylinders and feverships increases the protection of dance shoes
The fighters in Tanzania use an untraditional way to prevent the slaughter in the pools of the people’s posts — they cast the preserves filled with a sweet chile.
The method was effective, and the organization of Honeyguide Foundation, which was headed over this idea a few years ago, together with the American Nature Protection Committee, has been able to promote it by training volunteers in northern Tanzania to use the non-weapon-weapon-related steps to protect their homes and visits without prejudice to animals.
Many of them used cops to protect themselves.
The World Day of the Sloans, dedicated to the protection of animals, will be Tuesday.
"When we have developed a set of instruments... we look at the change in the relationship within these communities, because they are much more convinced that they will not be able to put shoes on their fields without caused damages," said the executive director Honeyguide David Bell.
The first two steps are in the shift of the fake before the slower border, and the signals with the corn.
If it couldn't be distracted, they're shocked like that.
The sweet chile is shocked with the boy in the reserve, and the end is closed, only the physician remains outside.
When the storm is burned with a snake, a small snake swimming in the air is cut into the shock.

According to the MID of Turkey, 290 people died because of the temptation.
The Jewish recorder closely discovered the Berlin hotel for the removal of the Israeli phone code on the Arabs, reported the RT News channel
The French director of the Jewish origin launched a scandal in the media, discovering that the hotel Kempinski Bristol in Berlin is not in the list of Israeli telephone codes, and the officers are referring to "process" from the Arab clients.
Crow Lanzman, author of a documentary film on Holocaust Shoa, expressed his frustration by Kempinski Bristol in Berlin, wrote an open letter in the German FAZ media.
During his recent residence in the Lanzman hotel, Israel tried to find in the list of phone codes provided by the hotel.
However, the country was not mentioned among States where the room could be called directly.
How could it happen that in 2016, in Berlin, the capital of New Germany, Israel was excluded and eliminated?
Lanceman wrote.
The replacement of Kempinski Bristol provides the possibility of taking Israel through its own phone service centre.
In searching for a statement, the register addressed the question to the housing administration.
The answer he received there, as Lanzman said, "shocked him."
Clark, the hotel, said that this measure was "decided by the Kempinski network leadership".
The result, standing in this stage, called a larger wrath of the register.
“The majority of our Arab guests, and they needed Israel's code to be removed,” said Lanzman, the hotel servant.
Israel's embassy in Germany Jacob Hadas-Handelsman called a case as a "terrory struggle", reports the Suddeutsche Journal.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's actually a terrible shock.
What happened in Germany and that is the maintenance of the hotel network.
I don't need to explain here.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions,” said the official.
The incident called a small resonance in the Internet; the people called it scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski hotel was simply "he went to the matter" in the prescribed Arab clients' requirements.
"It would be shocked," said in the other door where it was indicated that the hotel situated on the glorious Kurfurstendamm Street is close to the synagogue.
The El Spiegel newspaper reported that the hotel itself was fast in place of any accused accused.
“There was no direct order to include Israel in the list of fast collections,” quotes the representative of the Kempinski newspaper of Suddeutsche Journal.
She adds that code is now added.
The police uses smoke gas and rain guns against protesting Brazilian students
The students met with the police in the Brazil city San Paulo, on Thursday, when they gathered to protest against government reforms of public education.
The police used smoke gas and rain guns against protesters.
The insurance began when police officers tried to shoot students, resulting in the use of rain bombs and smoke gas.
A number of hundreds of students participated in the demonstration to express their concerns on plans.
In accordance with the proposals of the Governor of the State of San Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, almost 100 public schools will be closed, and 3000,000 students will be redistributed to seen money.
Some protest participants could be seen in writing on the walls of graphics against the temporary responsibilities of President Michael Theater.
The last protest took place only a few days after the protesters were on the street to support the distracted President, Dymo Ruseph, when Senator of the country proclaimed for its inscription.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71 per cent, reports the RT Business port
The decrease of trade sanctions between Moscow and Teheran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the previous year, as the Russian Ambassador in Iran in Jagaryan.
As international sanctions against Iran have been denied, Russian companies have increased their interest in conducting business in the country, he said the ambassador.
Russian companies are re-linked with Iran, and new companies are ready to get market access.
Of course, the further enlargement of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,” said Jagaryan.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, the trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 and was $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports in Iran increased 91.5 per cent and up to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased 16 per cent, up to $158 million.
The increase in trade has been achieved through machinery, land vehicles and weapons,” said the flight.
Jagara also predicts that Russia visits the record number of Iranian tourists in this year.
In the past year, the diplomatic representative of Russia in Iran issued about 350,000 Visa, mainly to tourists, and citizens of Iran.
Furthermore, Iran first entered the number of tourists visiting Russia to the stream of 20 countries.
It can be said with confidence that the last year's payment of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be killed,” said he.
At the same time, relatively a few Russians visit Iran, which hopes that the ambassador will change.
"I personally recommend to visit the city of Isfahan, Shiris and Iron, in which the memories of ancient Persian civilization are preserved in good condition," he said.
The State continues to shut up the hikes in the Defence and Industrial Complex.
The "Sistematic Incompletion" of the Congress Generator Almaz Antioch, "Allmaz-Anthey" and "the loss of confidence".
In the nearest three years, the NGO manager was appointed by Henry Benders.
The information on the freeze of disadvantage appeared only on Thursday night and did not call a wide resonance in the media.
How to explain such silence in the conditions of the enlargement of the army?
Indeed, the RF leadership does not want to distribute any hearing or negative provisions in the public environment.
This reaffirms the fact that there are numerous problems in the defence-industrial complex, and the State does not want to attach its higher attention to the society.
The elimination of the disadvantages is, of course, the important events in the area.
"Almas" is the main company of the concert, which is specialized for the production of marine and ground-based machines.
Almas is currently working for the establishment of the DRC and Morphere, which are planned to establish new roots, fruits, smilings and recreaters.
The founder of Russian Military, Dmitri Cornev, believes that the liberation of the projects is slowly slow.
This version is the most logical.
For example, the development of Morfea was still started in 2007, and the entry was prescribed in 2013.
The " Road" should be the main system of OMS on the new IMF ships.
For the information I receive, no tests have been done for a few years.
True as I can judge, there's no unique Almaza's fault, said Cornev.
The expert is afraid that the delay of the exploitation input may also occur with the CVC.
Experience-building work on the project has not yet been completed, but in 2016 the first complexs should be in the army.
The Minoboron believes that " the work is planned and all will be completed in the deadlines", although the State has recognized the existing problems with the development of P-500 in 2014.
It is very difficult to assess the professional quality of the Almazuma since 2011.
Cornee stated that project switchs may be both the results of freeship.
It believes that in recent years it has been extremely difficult to achieve information on internal processes in the COP and undertakings plans.
He received long-term orders for tens of billions of rubbers, and large money, as he knows, loves the silence.
Normally, the director of defence companies include posts on their own desire, by the treaty of the parties or for another work.
In that case, the elimination occurred publicly, or not received a resonance.
This emphasizes that Almaza's leader may have been a strict and resisted to the above-based "residents".
As a result, the State is not worthy of peace with such a manner.
It will dismiss those who prefer to combat the Minoboron installations and do not carry out the tasks set.
At the same time, the RF leadership is trying to order for the slaughtered managers (the maquination of the Star).
A higher attention to the sector ' s problem is the President.
Vladimir Putin calls on the Military Industry Commission and regularly held meetings dedicated to the overweapon.
Cleml protects a number of COP management managers, trying to have a loyal composition of directors, which will carry out the above discharge.
This is a far indefinite policy, but the lack of corruption and the absence of normal competitiveness in the COP is not in the State.
The situation in the defence is, of course, not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical situation encourages Kriml as soon as possible in order of armed forces.
In parallel with the "smuggling" of RF managers, RF leadership takes successful steps to enhance the professionalism of Russian forces.
The army's headquarters acquired a new quality with the seat of the Minister of Defence of Sergei Shagua.
It is the impression that the President has taken on the weapons of the famous speaker "Peace is ready to war".
During the cold war, the USSR military forces and the nuclear party reached in the 1970s have brought to the conclusion of the Helsinki Covenant, which strengthened the Moscow influence area on the continent.
In all lacks of bipolar system, she worked fully effectively.
The absence of war on the European continent and about the stability situation in the Middle East.
Tradition of the "conquisitors" in the cold war has resulted in the strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of terrorists in Europe and the United States in the civilized world, I hope there was no peaceful cloud.
Despite the general disaster, the West refuses to speak to Russia at the same level.
In such conditions, the only fleet and the army of our country remain.
Increased military power allows Moscow to remain more effective to the national interests and to enter into new parts of the world policy.
The Skotlandian Calum Skinner spends on the finish line, resulting from the shipping gold of the British
Skotlandian Calum Skinner was a triumph in a husband's shipping team at Rio last night, resulting in which the team triumph was protected from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old borner of Glasgo was the most powerful role of his cousin, Sir Chris Hoy, who had made his own, and the young man was honoured in his history to get the winner of the Favorite team from New Zealand.
Britain declared the right to an unexpected victory four years ago, wining when he declared the right to five of its six Olympic gold meals.
And they repeated the trick, since they were modestly finished at the Mart World Championship in London, despite the end of the carriage since then.
The question between Peking and London was the replacement of the specialist of James Staff.
They did the same time when Hindes came.
The entry of Hoya also created a white, which Kean Emmadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Scinner was a man who was holding the British trains, seeing the capacity in Skotland, which was now implemented.
Hindes, Kenny, a champion from Hoy four years ago, and Scinner set the Olimpiade Resource in Qualification, but the standards were overlooked by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio wins the duel for gold.
Hindes was exactly behind his circle, but Kenny shocked the team forward, and Scinner supported.
The change of the strategy was a major part of the reform where Hindez went to a greater transfer to Kenny and, in particular, to Skinner keep the time.
He looked at his place as an invitated BBC expert and captured the view of Scenner, Kenny and Hindes when they entered the beach.
23-year-old Scinner from Glasgo said, "This is a slight comparison."
I'm here to make everything possible and make my own name.
We set the Olimpiade Record in the Final and win the Championians of the world.
It was incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After the triumph in London in 2012, with Kenny and Hoy, Hindez decreased the triumph after an unexpected age.
He later refused to comment, and there was no way to appeal from the British competitors.
There was no question at this time in the greatest victory.
He said, "I felt like in London, with all the flames of Britain on the court."
We've all met the team in the last three months.
We have played in many of the world's names that the oil was just awesome.
This is one event, one gold medal for the country who wins seven of 10 named hole in Beijing as well as London.
If this is a barometer of progress made in the past five months, the wheel is waiting for five successful days.
The form shown by Kenny is not under the possibility to imagine how he repeats the Hoya ship, wining three oil meals in one game.
It would be possible to see how Kenny, who was just 12 - year - old Hoa, was also born 23 March (this seems to be a sacred date in the British sport, which is also the day of the birth of Steve Redgreev, Mofarkh and Roger Bannister), is to give its account to six gold meal and one silver.
That would be like Hoya.
The next time, Kenny is in the snake that begins today and spends for three days.
28-year-old from Bolton said, "I just like that now.
The teams are always the best.
You're coming to win your friends.
A little one to win one if honestly.
He said, "If he wins two other gold meal, he must get the market."
It was the only day of the meal playing, but it was the following good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clensey, Steven Burke and Own Dull are qualified for the fastest 4-kilometer command of persecution.
They financed at 3:51,943.
The world refund established for the winning of gold in London in 2012 is 3.5.659.
The first round and final (10:42) are held today, on the second day of the event where Wiggins will be exactly in the centre of attention.
He had a debate with the Commissioners last night referred to a qualified train when the officials needed to measure his weight.
The relevant women ' s event, which will be renewed and completed tomorrow, Laura Trettot, Joanna Roysel Shand, Elinor Barker and Kate Archibald, showed at 4:13.260.
The Commander of Britain was relying on the powerful bicycle team to own the average period of the Olympic Games and to make a number of meals.
After the real exceptional demonstrations of full overcome in Beijing and London, the expectations were slowed in a progressive preparation for Rio.
The second plan was the dramas, not the last time of the head of Shane Satton's technical department in April, because of the accused of sexism and detection, and the exits of large figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, on the basis of the first weekend, however, it seems to be the legendary now of the glory of Britain to reach the top at the right time, perhaps again.
Construction of a portal metal firm threatened by the distortion of electrical contracts
A português aluminium in Victoria, as well as the workplaces of hundreds of workers, are threatened by the fact that the electrical company that uses the company, according to one of the owners of the company, will be planned to deal with the contract of delivery: it is planned that all contracts of delivery will be deleted.
This step is the result of the decision adopted by the Government of Vice-Chairman to not extend subsidy granted to support the functioning of the company.
The fixed subsidy for 20 years is expired in November.
To 2.000 workplaces may be threatened by Alcoa company in Portugal.
The total of 2.000 workplaces — directly and indirectly — may be in the risk zone as a result of any closure.
Additional space consequences may also be, as the metalurgy plant requires about 10 per cent of the electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014 Alcoa closed a metal firm in Point Henry, which led to the closure of electricity in Englese last year.
Portugal metal firm Alcoa loss money and risks closing.
These actions have resulted in the consideration of the future industry that has been continued for a few years, as a result of the strong positions of Australian dollar, and later, because of the prices for the production of the company.
The AGL company, who enjoys a large electricity plant with its Loy Yang A electricity station in Latvia Valli, reported that other three owners would also take steps to deal with the treaty.
The control share of the company belongs to a joint short-term company of Alcoa and Alumina, and the Chinese CITIC and the Japanese company Marubini Corp belong to smaller parts.
"The AGL committee expects that the Portland object will continue to work, namely, that the physical electricity demand from the metal firm will not stop," said it.
According to the AGL company, the contracts mentioned are such as the 'hered contracts' which should be entered into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month disappearance period, so they actually ended in 2017.
"In line, the AGL company still expects that these contracts will bring their income in the financial year 2017", said the electricity company.
There was no potential impact on the arrival of the AGL company from 2018 to the financial year, which has now been limited to a strong feed market for optical electricity prices.
The AGL company stated that the amount of contracts had already been reduced in its account of $187 million in terms of “continued distortion”.
According to the company Alcoa, the decision to deal with contracts "not affect Alcoa's ability to manage metallurgical firm or to provide electricity to the metalurgical industry".
The American company stated that, in 2010, Loy Yang's company had an twenty-year contract that had to enter into force in November this year, but she would still explain why it had defeated the contract.
Analytics were concerned about the possible closure of the portal metal industry in Victoria, as well as of the Tomago industry, along with Newcastle, because of an unfortunate economic situation in the area.
According to analysis previously this week, AGL, Steven Mickelsen, AGL, said that Portugal uses about 600 megabats annually and Tomago is about 900 megavates.
If both of these companies go from the market, a significant reduction of market demand [electronics] will be made.
For us, it will be bad for the producer,” he said.
Not only a reality-shale star to Kardashian, Kendal on the box of the September Vogue
Kendal Jenner, 20 years of age, model and fourth daughter, Kardachian-Denner, mother-manager of Chris, appeared at a fellow September of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendal, who was the victim of the Estee Lauder burden, has reported this news in its Instagram in Friday.
"I was in the room together with my favorite people, I looked at this box and smelled," wrote Kendal.
The news about the shop was awesome (or just in the spirit of the Corporation of the Cardashian Society?), prepared by the reality-video, in which the entire family of Kardachian-Janner (deboshiski Rob and Katelin, also joined to him the most loved grandmother of the Show Bisness, producer of the Cardashian Family), forgetted the appearance of the sisters on the area and at the end of the classical tour: they planned the evening of the South Coast.
This is the standard surrounding line nearly all the episodes of children's television shows dedicated to birthday (Skirre expressed: "Do you think we forgot you?", with the honestity of a multiple crystal from the 8th morning, but Chris had to be necessary that this glory could be achieved as well as other girls.
Because with this episode dedicated to the September Vogue, we, indefinitely, entered in the new era of the Cardashian show.
Let the old sister Kendal Kim gets on the board of Vogue before (he came to her with her husband Cannie West in April 2014), but the September magazine box is its own achievement.
The September is the most sales of Vogue for year.
It is likely to be a gift from the model magazine that has a large number of advertisers (as reported by the Fashionista port, 615 pages of the last year of the 832-strategy edition).
The news about a star on his board is expected to be so depressed that in the past two years the pictures of the magazine were covered to an official anonymous.
In the case of the previous women, Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss includes.
In the past few years, it is obviously that there were more "renocentances that work models" than "models that are famous".
The Laurreat of Oscar and the face of Dior Jennifer Laurence was presented in 2013, after year after the honor of Lady Gague.
But even in that little case, if Jenner, whose magazine describes the model of his generation, is in the first category, it is in a bad company.
These are not the parents of famous people, the reality-show stars or modern children who know how to make a good video in Snapchat (while Jenner falls in all these categories).
These are truly talentous women who are in the industry of disappearance.
For Beyonse, the last year's shop, this year, was one of the most lucky carriages in connection with the Lemonade album.
Of course, it's not all happy for the success of Jenner.
The situation of General in the world of mode, as her last star of television reality show, had always been shocked.
In June, one of the first models of Victoria's Secret Stefany Seamor discovered Jenner and her colleague, Jilly Hadd, called them "the moment".
These settings have again been broken after Jener's news on Vogue's box.
But it doesn't mean to strive to pleasantness.
Kendal Janner's headquarters of the Vogue.
She is a supermodal in all senses of this word.
She's defiant for Mark Jacobs.
She's gonna sell you a tonic krom from Estee Lauder.
She, so and all her sisters, sell your photos to you in the same applications available for pay signature.
She sells his own photos of the daughters of Sindy Crowford in the LOVE magazine.
And in a free time, may still be able to see her sister Cortney and her children, she participates in the television reality.
Public legal centres reject 1600,000 persons per year
Each year, more than 1600,000 of the least protected populations refuse to serve in public legal centres, since this sector is prepared to make the effect that further financing for and soon carried out.
In Quinsland, three of the five people, the main, elderly, immigrants, unprotected work, violence victims, persons who have no possibility to combat unfair ownership, and so on, have already been rejected by trying to obtain free legal assistance and representatives.
The public legal services that are already under the possibilities are prepared for further reduction.
Since June next year, these legal centres should lose even 30 per cent of federal funding.
The Director of the General Legal Centres of Queensland James Farrell said that, according to the recent records of the National Laws Association, thousands have already been rejected each year.
Farrell said that if a federal government decision was not cancelled, the situation would only be worried.
" The legal centres of Quinsland are continuously inadequate financing, which means that thousands of people have been rejected in their vital lively important services, " he said.
Persons from violence, persons with uncontrolled and debt debts, families who have divorced unlawful work - all of them have legal problems, and this shows that they cannot receive assistance that they need.
The Federal Government is funding to 30 per cent since June 2017, which means that thousands of defended people in Quinsland will be obliged to address complex legal issues without assistance.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Senator Quinsland George Brandis immediately to reverse these reductions in the financing so that people can receive the necessary assistance when they face legal problems.
In the past year, the Government has fulfiled its commitment to fund free legal assistance to the average country indicator.
It is now time to focus on the needs of public legal centres and communities, their customers, and the Government of Palestinian is time to put on this important work.

Britain should be sent into the necessary ring of the olimpholic spirit and extending Hittro
Heatro will also provide recovery and prosperity not only in our planning populations and in the whole of London, but also in the whole country.
As I think, this was the great advantage of Hitro, as it was with London in 2012, where we made all the efforts to ensure that our peoples and regions benefit from the game.
The Olympic Games benefited greatly for Strategy and Eastern.
And we will do this again, creating the opportunities for local people and the company close to Hittro.
Only for our pools, we will create 10,000 new shops, 40,000 new jobs and put the end of young unemployment around the airport.
As was before London 2012, those who think that Hittro's challenge is too expansive.
They told me that Britain will never be ready to the Olimpiade games and that we are in a difficult situation in the world aren.
Sceptics were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong with Hittro.
There are always obstacles to survive, but Hetro responds to any question raised on it.
Like the Olympic Game of Hitro is a infrastructure project for most, not only for a circle.
Advanced is the possibility to create up to 180.000 new jobs, 211 billion feet of economic growth, leaving the ability and employment of both the airport and the whole United Kingdom.
We have a nice team in Hitro, which introduced a 11 billion infrastructure investment schedule at time and within the budget, from T5, the best terminal chosen for five years of airport, to T2, built in the middle of the two most busy flights in the world.
Now they are ready to ensure the third aircraft field, confirmed by 16 billion feet of private investment.
The Olympic games in London in 2012 have been a great success for Britain, and I am sure that Hittro's expansion will also be.
It was time for us to send the Olympic Spirit into the necessary ring and enhance Hittro, to ensure our commercial future and to create a heritage of qualifications and employment that Britain could be honourable.
Lord Paul Dayton is Chairman of the Hytro Council and the former Trade Atache of the Conference
Adblock Plus, Facebook plays in a "meek" about advertising blocking
For companies who pay money on the Internet Regulations, attempting to purchase programs for public locking is a game in a "cash-cook", as one of the company who creates such a programing assurance.
On Thursday, literally after a couple of days after Facebook announced that the advertising blocks will be blocked on its website, Adblock Plus published a blog record that users could update their filters in the program to lock the advertising into the social network again.
On Thursday, the website has announced that the original version of the website has changed the breakdown around its advertising to make the advertising blockers more difficult to recognize what parts of the page are advertising.
But Adblock now states that he can get a new code.
In its publication, the representative of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "the kind of counter-related struggle between the public blockers community with an open source code and those who try to spend it continues since the discovery of the public blocking" and that Facebook may submit its own decision in the nearby time.
The fact that the largest social network has entered into the world is clearly recognized how great the problem has become the blocking of the advertising for the industry.
About 200 million people have been using advertising blocks in the world, according to the last year study of Pagefair and Adobe, and almost four times more than those used in 2013.
In view of 1.3 billion daily active users that are on the Facebook via mobile devices, the mobile advertising is now 84 per cent of the Facebook income from the advertising.
However, the company is intended for advertising publishers on the current version, as mobile publishers are inefficient in mobile Facebook applications for social network and Instagram, as the representative is.
However, the advertising in this version represents a sufficient article to make Facebook a profitable investment step.
On Thursday, Facebook also announced that its "regulated preference" tool would be updated in order to provide more control on how the advertising has been subjected to them.
On Friday Facebook said that Adblock's new filters were worried, as they will also block some unregulated content on the website.
"This will not be a positive experience for people, and we plan to solve this problem," said the representative of the Facebook in an official letter.
Advertising blocks are a cruel tool, so we focused on the creation of such instruments, such as Declaration preferences to deliver administration to people.

In each case, both of the people who go to the dark street were condemned that the automobilists could not wait for an accidental meeting with a swimming trail in the middle of the night, reports the newspaper.

Climate model NASA: Vienna was ever known
Venezia may have ever been known according to the estimates of the new NASA climate model.
Scientists from the Soviet Space Research Institute have developed a model for the study of Vienna, using tools and algorithms like climateologists.
The model was designed to determine whether Vienna could, with its hot surface and the atmosphere that was transferred by carbon gas, ever existing conditions such as the earth.
The scientists predicted that the small speed of Vienna’s return was explained by its fleshly atmosphere.
But the latest model suggests that Vienna may probably have a decreased atmosphere like the earth, and still slowly turn.
The model also examined the fuel of Vienna's early.
On the planet, it is likely that there were more surprising regions than the Earth, but there was once sufficient water and enough geographical change in order to create conditions for life and to prevent rapid elimination.
Ranna Venece also benefited the sun, which was 30 per cent of the skin.
“ According to the GISS model, the slow return of Venice submits her to the day of the sun almost two months per month” explained the report of an scientist from GISS Anthony Del Henio.
This reduces the surface of the planet and produces rain that creates a soft slee that acts as a zone which protects the surface of the planet from the substantial part of the sunwarming.
The results are the medium climate temperatures that, as a surprisely, at a few degrees more cold than in our day on Earth.
The model shows the history of Vienna, similar to the development that previously predicted planet researchers.
In spite of some years, though Vienna may have been quoted, it has affected too large jaws and ultraviolet removal during a few billion years.
Her oceans have been defeated, and its water pair has been survived by ultraviolet extraction.
When her hydrocarbon flying, it remained only a fleshly atmosphere from carbon gas with the mortal park effect, namely, Vener, which we know today.
Researchers shared the results of their new climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters magazine.
Patrick Roy leaves the train team of Avalanche
Patrick Roy left the train and the vice-President of the Colorado Avalanche on Friday, referring to the lack of influence during the decision-making process.
The Executive Vice-President / Chief Kolorado Commander Joe Sack confirmed the news and noted that the club will start searching for a new train immediately.
"But over the past three years, I have performed my duty to the main train and chairman of the Colarado Avalanche with energy, stress and determination," said Roy in the statement of 50 years.
During the summer, I have long thought about how I could improve the team in order to bring her the necessary depth and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this goal, the vision of the training and the vice-President of the Hooky activities must perfectly correspond to the vision of the organization.
He must also have the right to vote when decisions affecting the work of the teams.
These conditions are not implemented at this time.
Sake, who took Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," said Sack.
We appreciate everything he did for our organization, and we want him to be successful in the future.
Roy became the prize of Jack Adams Award as the best liga trainer during its first season with the Avanche team in 2013-2014.
He brought a club to 112 views and wins in the Central Division, but Colombia was disrupted by Minnesota in the first round of the Offs and lost the stage of Off in the last two years.
The Avanche team announced the evaluation of 39-39-4 at the 2015-2016 session, and at five points from the Wild team in the fighting of the second lounge journey to participate in the Western Conference.
Roy wins four Stanley Cub, two from Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea ocean neighbors restore negotiations and prepare for availability
Workshops on the payment of oilers in the North Sea were suspended, and all the parts of the debate start to the new negotiations, reported to the leading representatives of the parties.
The winners against the oil company Wood Group were cooperatively organized on platforms in the North Sea, which were conducted by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group and Unions and RMT may confirm that we agreed to restore the negotiations to resolve existing disputes,” said the joint statement.
We will hold a few meetings on the full day over the next few weeks, starting from the beginning of the next week to consider a quiet view.
Professionals reported that their recent action, which, as they say, was the first than 25 years of age, was addressed against potential reductions of 30 per cent.
In this year, Wood Group has reduced the rates paid by contract officers working in the North Sea for about 9 per cent because of negative market pressure.
Decreased rates from the company had been reduced in 2014 after 10 per cent of contract staff workers.
According to the company, additional reductions will be given to its space are necessary to overcome the market fall.
She has decreased thousands of people and announced plans to stop oiling in countries to 10 because it rationalizes its activities as a result of the British BG energy company.
Energy companies are under pressure because of the low prices of non-proliferated oil: the economic situation was worried because of the decision to go from the European Union adopted in June by the United Kingdom.
The Skotland Parliament, David Anderson, met with the professional leaders in the past week to discuss one of the largest working conflicts in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea said that it was vitally necessary for regional economy.
"In the North Sea, yeah and throughout the country, we need a economy that would work for most, not only for some," he said in the statement.
Mining $1.4 billion for new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, with the average value of approximately $7 billion for the past five years.
Kepler measures the speed of the slope of the slope of Plyed.
The last mission of the Space Telescope Kepler helped astronoms to collect the most complete directory of the slope of the sleeves in the collection of Praids.
New data helps the astronoms to understand why the stars are turning to different speeds, as well as the return periods are focused on the development of the planet.
"We hope that comparing our results to other star collections, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass, its age and even the history of the sun system," reported in the press of Louis Ribal, a scientist of the Inflation Centre and analysis at the California Technology Institute.
The copy of the Plaid is 445 light years from the Earth.
Many of the stars in the sculpture are now only reached by strokes, which were born about 125 million years ago.
They smile as fast as they will never be.
In their skin speeds, these adult stars select large numbers of star winds.
The winds switch around the magnetic stars, these winds are shocking on the stars.
At the age of the stars, the speed of the shift begins to slow.
Kepler measures the speed of return of each star, over the time between the appearance of the known five stars — such as sunfire.
The new directory of turn speeds suggests that more massive stars are slower than less massive stars.
Ribal compares the stars to the dancers: larger pirates make slower than smaller.
"In the "plaid" we observe that those who are slowly slowly are usually more massive, while those who are slower are usually relative to very slow stars," said Ribal.
Since the copy of the Plyad is close, it serves a perfect space lab to compare the properties of the star with the speed of return.
"Plajada's summer copy provides a shipping point for theoretical models of return of the stars as young and older," said Ribal.
We still want to know how and why the stars slow the speed of their shift and spend on their "thinks" snakes like that.
Ribal and her colleagues have detailed their last analysis of Plyed returning into three new articles that will soon be published in the Astronomy Journal.
A study related to the group of detainees in the Ukrainian divergencies conducts two states, writes the Commersant.
The ECB will collect evidence of the privacy of detainees to prepare diversity in Kruemou.
As previously reported, thankful exhibitions were given to the inhabitants of the Ukrainian city of Energy, Eugeen Panu, who agreed to cooperate with the consequences.
In his words, he considered the Titan's chimsel in Armenia, the oil in Fiodozoia, the Governing Party Translation, the Gas Guide, and one of the military aeroports.
The law enforcement believes that it is not possible to keep away from all diversators.
This was, in particular, a basis for arresting suspected in the Kiev Paradise, notes the publication.
The main training of Russia's football collection was Stanislav Cherchez
At the plenary meeting of the Russian football Union, a decision was taken to appoint the headquarter of the Russian assembled football station at Stanislaw Cherchesus.
The contract will be calculated for two years - before the end of the MC-2018.
On 11 August, the RFS execution was appointed to the headquarter of Russia ' s collective football train at Stannizol Cherchesois.
This is a famous footballist, who had previously played in the Moscow Spartake on the position of the urtar, as well as a trainer with a solid experience of such Russian teams such as Spartack, "Jimjunina-Sochi", "Terek", "Amcar", "Dinamo" and "Legie", which became a winner of national primary and cubits of the country.
It is reported that the contract with Cherchez will be signed in the nearest time and be distributed for two years.
Hence, he was responsibilities to prepare a assembly for the 2018 World Championship.
It is known that in his train head, Miroslav Romanzaco, Hintaras Stauche, Vladimir Parks.
There are information that the total training stage is 2.5 billion euro per year.
According to the media, the RFS leadership provided the Cherchish Goal to test the Russian collection to half-final and purchase the meal.
As the trainer himself stated, he considers the creation of a competitive environment in the team and would give the footballists the opportunity to prove himself.
Also, in the words of Cherchez, he was glad that his choice was on him.
The first shop under the leadership of Cherchez, Russia, will take 31 August in Antarctica, will be a partnership with the Turkey team.
Remember, Leonid Slunchy, who was the main trainer of the Russian football club, was working with him in the CSCK club.
He stated that he was departured with posts after the prosecution of the Russian national team in Euro-2016 in France.
He was responsible for the bad result of the collection.
Namibia was a long-term fight against the Apartheid, with the desire between Angola and South Africa.
However, after the deterioration of South Africa in 1990, the country with populations of 2,4 million has achieved huge success, especially in the past few years.
The main reason for Namibia ' s success is that the Government highlights education.
While people in developing countries recognize the self-employed primary and medium-sized education, many poor and even primary school countries require training.
Furthermore, Governments are often advised to introduce educational payment for costs.
However, there is free education in Namibia for primary schools.
Furthermore, since 2015, the average education has become free.
The authorities of the country also work actively in other important areas.
Malaria ' s destruction efforts have reduced in the past 10 years of annual disease 97 per cent.
In contrast to the international trend of inequality, Namibia is decreased.
In comparison with the 1993 indicator of Ginee, the standard income distribution inequalities, was 15 paragraphs.
Then, 23 years ago, this indicator was one of the highest in the world.
The poverty level has reduced from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (not less than $1.90 per day) has also reduced from almost 53 per cent to less than 23 per cent.
Namibia also has the highest raying of the freedom of words in Africa, according to the "Reporters without Border".
The country has significantly warned the United States and other rich States.
In addition, the country has a favourable raying, one of the highest in Africa, in the Index of Corruption, which is the Transparency International.
Even now, when prices fall on the base, Namibia is able to keep the high level of growth.
At the same time, GDP debt ratio is about 25 per cent, which represents less than 1/3 levels of debt in the United States and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
The unemployed level, at least traditional assessment methods, remains sufficiently high - almost 28 per cent.
And as well as other countries in the region, the high level of HIV/AIDS is in Namibia - almost 17 per cent of the population are incerted.
According to the evaluations of the World Bank, Namibia relates to the number of countries with the income above the average, but the authorities claim that their State is actually a developing country.
Indeed, it is unlikely to face some difficulties that cause low-developed economies.
The State must develop a very large and devastating country with a small population.
In the territory of the wilderness, isolated tribes of countermembers, which should be integrated in the modern society without the loss of their identity.
The integration of people who had been on the peripheral of the world economy for the fourth century has been an unfair challenge for any country.
For Namibia, it is more complicated: as any other country in the world is, it is with the consequences of climate change.
Nevertheless, Namibia did not think to leave the hands, and the country decided to face the problems.
Shortly after the deterioration of the independence, the development of a diversified economy and a collected society was undertaken.
It is notably that competitive political fractions have gathered together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides valuable medical services not only for its own citizens but also for its neighbourhood.
About 15-20 per cent of medical institutions in the northern Namibia citizens.
No one in Namibia speaks of the construction of a wall that would separate the country from the poor and corrupted neighbors.
The Namibiates understood that neighbors did not choose, and therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate with deficit water resources, to participate in regional medical projects, to promote investment and exchange students.
Furthermore, the Government of Namibia had justified that rich natural resources could easily be disfellowshipped by helping poor people.
The authorities understand that the income from Namibia’s natural riches must be contributed to infrastructure and production power.
They also acknowledged that it would be indirectly not to try to obtain the maximum arrival from the sale of countries and to revitalize investment laws and contracts to ensure that it is.
Transparency has a crucial importance for this process, therefore the strong support of the Government ' s freedom of words is so important.
As he noted the head of the Hague Gangeb State, the media often speaks about what he did not like.
But after fighting for freedom from apartment in South Africa, Namibia must protect the freedoms received, says the President.
Not all the key resources of Namibia are exhausted.
Some, such as fishing, are related to renewed, and the Government has made all efforts to maintain and strengthen them.
Another million foreign tourists are visiting the country every year.
The Namibia shows that even those who begin with serious deficiencies — racism, colonial structure, inequality and low development — may be a way to general prosperity.
Its achievement benefits from international recognition and imitation.
Many have heard about the Warna Gold, the ancient gold objects created by humans (4600 to 4200 years before our era).
I believe that this was the most wide archaeological scene of the 1970s: in Bolgaria, when the Varnean Necropole, there was a fantastical number of gold artifacts, more than three thousand over the total weight of 6 kilograms.
Only one detention known as "power No 43" was extracted by 990 gold objects with a general weight of 1,5 kg.
However, the official status of the former world's gold could soon be moved to an unexpected busin found by archaeologists in July this year.
Another time in Bulgaria is a predominant population known as Tel U.N.C.
Unlike Varna, the port city, Tel U.N.C. was displaced from the sea, around the village of the Pazardjik area.
Busina is a golden pool that turns back to the corner.
Yavor Boyajiev, a shooting leader in Tel U.N.C., died 4600 years before our era and said that she was the older of Warna gold at least 200 years.
The Barna's crew, remembering, has been dated about the same period, 4600 - 4200 gg before our era.
Technology that allows the data of metal with unforeseen accuracy is currently not available.
How does it be sure that gold is older?
Obviously, Professor Boyajiv knows more than reported by the Reuters Agency: "I'm absolutely sure that the Gold of the United Nations's older gold is. "
This is an extreme importance: this is a cruel object, but it is enough to take a similar place in history.
In the interview Reuters Boyajiv reported that scientists analyze the composition of metals in the nearest time, as well as a more careful study of the archaeological plastic where gold artifact was found.
This helps to date the browse with the maximum accuracy possible.
There are also many explanations.
You've never heard about it, even though you haven't heard about it.
At present, Tel U.N.C. is considered the former "reward" of Europe.
Tel was founded by the posts of people migrated in Europe from Anatolia (Current Turkey) in the seven thousands of years before our era.
In the following centuries, the region has developed burningly the processing of metals, from the raising of the first metal ability to establish a full-quality industry.
The main history of the archeological community is a particular name: the Balkano-Carpata province.
In the five thousand years before our era, the population of the urban type began to be located around the metal processing centres.
They are now called the ancient cities of Europe.
Of them, maybe the oldest ones of them, because there were 4900 artists found here before our era.
I would call Tel U.N.C. prototype of the modern city, although it is very old, even compared to Mesopotamia.
“ This is the place of the older Summer for thousands of years,” said Boyajie, with a general acceptable view that the urban culture was born in the south of Mesopotamia, the modern Iraq.
There appeared the first city in an accurate understanding of that word.
The scanners of Tel, University, have been carried out since 1976.
At that time, archaeologists have discovered nearly 12 hectares, which is about third of the general population plan.
The remains of a strong wall have been found that has ever reached three meters higher.
From houses and masters, however, archaeologists clearly distinguish streets, public buildings, a rewarded meat building, a business center and a housing area.
There are decades of bird figs found here.
All birds have been pictured in a calm state, so that they were not decorative objects, but an object of local culture.
The "this city" was destroyed about 4100 years before our era, perhaps by the Indonesian tribes coming from the northeastern.
There were no cities, horses and weapons.
The three meters of strong walls have not stopped them.
Archaeologists have found the clear signs of a cruel fight: the remains of older, women and children were found within the houses with the injuries of warfare.
New events and new facts appear to be made annually, changed withdrawals of ancient humanity history.
The Bolgar Archaeologists are often talking about not individual cultures, but on the "persistent" first civilization of Europe in Balkans.
The powerful stimulation for this civilization has become the Varna solid, found as recently in 1972.
It is logically that the Varna's gold blowing should be predicted, something like a crochet gold boss created in Tel Youncite.
In Porsche, the model 911 Targa was artificially covered
Officially stated that the preparation of 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is conducted manually by agency specialists working with series machines.
For example, the "retro-look" is a particular color of Etna Blue, which was developed in 1960 for the Porsche 356B model, which has even been designed in this color.
In addition, Targa received a company white graph on the boards and special RS Spyder 20-hour wheel disks, and some of the details of the white-zole metal formatting.
The retro-third interest is noted less than: it is, in large account, different from the gamma-formation series, new cresses with expanded electrically-regulations diameters and separate black-notified shoes with the logotype of the unit.
Furthermore, when purchasing a special version, each purchaser will receive a gift for the car and a rich distributed album with photos of the production process.
The powerful installation of Porsche Exclusive specialists has not been toughing: the strike of characterists fully corresponds to the series.
It is a six-cylinder engine with a careful amount of 3.0 m, developing 420 ms and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version 911 Targa 4S can be speeded up to 100 km/h per 4 seconds.
Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be issued by a limited quote, but no amount or value of each specific sportor is not reported.
Facebook and advertising blocks have launched the "weapon Go"
The recent introduction of the Facebook technologie that prevented the hiding of advertising on social pages has been proposed by developers of decisions to block the advertising to respond.
In AdBlock Plus, it's a "protection", but Facebook plans to do so soon as it's not useful.
So AdBlock Plus has planned its new technology that may have remained effectively long.
Société representatives noted that, trying to inflict the new "unblood" public, the decision by AdBlock Plus, together with commercial statements, also blocked many common mails from friends or pages.
In Facebook, the AdBlock Plus policy was regretted and promised to solve the problem soon.
As the source of the source among the social developers of TechCrunch, a code that makes AdBlock Plus free on the Facebook decktop will be prepared for the nearest hours.
So, socialists and blocks have divided their kind of " weapon go" by trying to play one another, the other party has become the users who have lost interesting records from friends or the advertising in which they were unacceptable to see it.
The ethical aspects of the public blocking have recently caused a tragic conflict.
In Murmansk, the violencer is before the court of the Murmansk Evening.
His case has already been investigated in the next Committee of the Russian Federation on the Morman area.
The accused of 54-year-old man is a serious effect of sexual violence.
The result is that, at the end of November 2015, Paul’s street area in Murmansk has conducted sexual acts with regard to violence against 20-year-old girls.
The sanction of this article provides maximum punishment for the punishment of freedom for six years.
Dongfeng will bring to Russia Crossvan Fengguang 370 and Picap Rich New websites On page www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a representative of the popularity in China of a car class that constitutes the dignity of mine and crossor.
Another Russian Prime Minister is Rich New.
Many western companies of the Moscow International Autoshop this year have decided to ignore, so the white exhibition halls of Crocus Expo will be filled with the Chinese companies.
In particular, a powerful front will be the Dongfeng Motor Corporation, which has great species of Russian market and intended to propose a number of interesting news to our automotors.
One of them will become a shock Dongfeng Fengguang 370, sold in China at the price of 55.900 yen (or not less than 550.000 rubs on the current course).
The Russian value is unlikely lighting, but the question of the allocations in our country is until it is on the stage of the debate.
In China, on the other hand, Fengguang 370 was intended to reach the 11th place in the list of most sales minerals, although, as a result of a large road education of (175 mm) and a protected platform in the lower perimeter, it can be fully added to crystals.
Crossvan is built on the front-industry platform of the Fangguang 360, at the 370th round base of the same 2725m, but the bones are longer (4565 mm against 4510 mm), the design of more slightly than the richer.
The salon was shocked by tree planning, but the large vertical scenario screen showed on Tesla at the centre console was only on the early slopes of the crown, and the cars were made in the sale with music simply.
Five of the seven floors are easily composed, shaping a low load area of 1650 mm, the maximum amount of a swimming bag to 1500 m.
Fengguang 370 drivers are prescribed to the 1-5-like-like binary power of 115 l.s. from the 5th mechanical transfer box.
The dynamic quality of the machine manufacturer is modestly worthy, so that the owner ' s owner ' s budget is 6.7 m/100 km.
Picap Rich New is a well-known Russian Nissan NP300 Navara for the previous generation, but with a slightly Chinese designer.
In spite of the morally slaughtered construction, this model is still used by a stable demand in the Chinese consumer as a reliable and unreasonable "slaughter cattle".
At the east price, Rich New believes that Russia is interested in, because modern Japanese picaps became incredibly precious.
Rich New is attributed to two machines for choice: binsine 2,4 l (137 ls) or career 2,5 l (116 ls.).
The transmission box is only a mechanic, the driving is behind the rail, but there are modifications, and it's a slightly connected "forward".
The new Flagman Sedan A9 will be at the Stind Dongfeng and his Russian first representative of the Chinese company has been anonymous in June.
The mine-profit skills on the Chinese market are increasing, one of the last news - Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
Today, the Russian dongfeng line is two models: the S30 Sedan and the H30 Cross.
In this year, 696 vehicles were performed by the Chinese company in our country.
Transport tax publications stop posting on the website www.zr.ru
The tax inspection has changed the list of notifications on equipment taxes.
All Russian automobile officials were bound to the unchanged years of schedule: a year and summer they receive as a quote for transport tax payment for the past year.
However, in this year, many of them are not expected.
The case is that tax inspection has changed the order of notification of the citizens.
Those registered in the Public Payment Office on the official website of the nalog.ru, the advertisement will come in electronic way.
In the inspections, such Russians were automatically shocked by online users and cut them out of a standard "booster" list.
The newness consists of all vehicle owners and non-motiveness.
All remaining letters will continue to be received.
However, the possibility of return to the old scheme is also of the owners of the website accounts.
For that purpose, they must visit the tax office and write a statement in August.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and better.
The notification appears in a "fair box" immediately after the preparation, while a letter is going to go a few days and it can always lose.
In addition, the number of Internet users of tax inspections was over 18 million, which allows the State to seek seriously to shoot shoot.
On the other hand, the modest news on the website of inspections is clearly not enough to inform citizens of the changed order.
Some could have registered in a regular chain to obtain a single service and forgot it for a long time.
Those people are not expected to learn about e-mail and, however, will be in the category of non-employers with all exempted consequences.
Access to the Life Payment Office is carried out in three ways: through a accounting port of gosuslugi.ru, using electronic signs or logisms and passwords specified in the registry map.
The last is available in any tax inspection office (unless there is a place for accounting).
Remember that transport tax must be paid up to 1 December in the current year.
The shipment of notifications started in July.
The Tuning Mercedes-Benz G-class, which aims to achieve a very high deal, is something in itself.
But the controversial concept did not cut up G-Power company masters, which were taken for the modifying of the sport version Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power is known by its BMW cars, but no human masters are foreign.
Really, why wouldn't G 63 to 571 strong flight cup with aerodin tank and swimming up to 5,4 cm?
The shocked "muscles" of a shocked "gelic", the master used by the advantages that opened a 5.5-litro-shore swimming snake.
And this is the dinamic of the dynasm of the twenty-spot, and the flight of the flights can be 5,3 cs.
However, the speed of average speed must be significantly better.
The speed flow affects: If the standard G 63 is not slowly 210 km/h, the tuberculosis of a deactivated electronic " driver" can survive 250 km/h.
Except other wheel disks, the U.S.A. is almost uncertain from its original system, except the U.S. 23-D., U.R.A., 305/35 ZR 23.
The Luce Office of Mercedes-Maybach has anonymized a considerable shopping of 6 miles long, which will be presented under the Concours of Eleanty in Pubble Bitch.
Mercedes-Benz company will competite with BMW I and will move its electric models under a single trade market.
In the nearest years, at least four environmental news is expected.
