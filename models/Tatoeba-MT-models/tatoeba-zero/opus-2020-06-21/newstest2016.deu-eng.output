Obama recommends Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not just friendly.
The two wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreements and on the Teherans' destabilization measures in the Middle East.
However, it is also to go to the conflict with Palestinians and the debated two States resolution.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been expanded for years.
Washington criticizes the sustainable Israeli seed construction, and Netanyahu offers lack of will at the peace process.
The arbitrary deal on the Iranian Atom programme has continued to deteriorate the relationship of the two.
In March, Netanyahu had held an overwhelming talk on the invitation of the Republicans before the U.S. Congress, which was evaluated as a conflict against Obama.
The speech was not speaking with Obama, a meeting was rejected with reference to the election that was before Israel in his time.
In an emergency call, Professor's headed to shoot his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police a little sick voice that he shot his girlfriend and that the officers should come to his house.
The Lamb was important to emphasize that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably surprising, and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
In the outside of the house, the officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handed note that was criticized on a white block: "I do so sorry, I wanted to make it back, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who loved me ever." This was underlined by the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by the Lamb.
There was no indication that the Lamb, who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already been 300 miles [300 km] to the schools, where he said that the police was a popular shooter, Ethan Schmidt, on the door to his office.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said that university employees heard the shooting at 10:18.
He said that the Lamb had made the uncomfortable call once later.
To the end of the day there was another death: the Lamb took the life when the police checked him.
One day after the shoesere at the university, students and dozens were forced to hide behind closed doors, the authorities still try to make a picture of what the Lamb motivated.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the State, as well as what students and employees knew him, helped them to draw a picture of a talented, but perhaps difficult teachers.
Students said they enjoyed his teaching.
The police in Gautier, where Printis died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned the Lamb in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the "exciting people" with which he shared his academic life.
Both in the Department of Social Sciences and History, which includes 17 teachers, and many students visited two courses.
At the same time, there were some attitudes to deal with problematic behaviors.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who loving the Lamb, said, he also seemed a little nervous and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that the Lamb told him that he had to do stress at the end of the Academic Year 2014-15.
Lamb had before the Delta State University requested a license for healthy reasons and said that he had a health problem.
In this year, he was teaching only two online curreses.
The new changes in the university's employment policy mean that the promotion that the Lamb had worked so hardly would not provide guarantees for an automatic way to a position as assistant Professional.
President of University William LaForge said, he didn't know anything about a conflict between the Lamb and Schmidt, but "though there was something in Mr Lamb's thinking."
These are questions that the Lamb can't answer.
After flying from the campus, the police later found Lambs Spur when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, the Lamb killed himself with a .38 calibre Pistole in the back of a house about a mile south of his parents' house at Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington Conunty Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car is still in the car.
It was not immediately clear why the Lamb went to this house, but Johnson said she thought he knew the people living there.
The lamb rose in the area.
The Lamb started his work at the university, which has 3.500 students in a city with about 12.000 inhabitants and taught geographic and padagogic geographic.
He was promoting in the spring in PÃ©dagogic.
One of the long-year friends Lambs called him intelligent, charismatic and sweet.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and the lamb was 20 when she met with friends.
They and their friends were in the high school, and he was the sweet old man who tried to add you to the guest game.
He was the woman's warm.
All the girls smile in there when he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and at Brandon's headquarters.
The Lamb and the Prentis were obviously a few days together.
In the press call, the Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no origin of a heritage.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the backstone house, which was limited to a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was okay.
The former husband of Princess, Shawn O'Sten, said they had happened 15 years ago, but friends remained and had a daughter now 19 years old.
"He was totally destroyed on the ground," said O'Sten about his daughter.
You and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Sten said he never met the Lamb, but by his daughter Abigail he heard that the Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail took both on a summer market three years ago.
Afterward, they played together with one or another.
O'Sten said his daughter writes and sing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a barkeeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a weak bar near Gautier, said that he had finished the Lamb and Princess Night in the night on September 5, last time after the Lamb had finished his guitar and mouth harmonica game before a special public.
There was no signs that something wasn't true.
"After, only a happy couple," he said.
We were on the sleeves and we were shocked together.
I mean, they both had a good sense for kids.
Schmidt, the whole professor, led the first seminar program and specialized himself on American origins and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professeur at the school.
He was married and had three children.
He studied at the Emporia State University in Kansas and was President of his brotherhood and student committee.
On Thursday, the Delta State Campus in Cleveland took about 900 people, including dozens, employees, students and community members.
Schmidt, Ms. Liz, and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the smooth watch while the university's "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
The education is re-educated at midnight.
"We try to move our students back," said LaForge.
The crisis's over.
It's a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press Authors Emily Wagster Petus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans attended this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police now says that the Lamb called the emergency after he shot Schmidt, and that the Lamb in his emergency named Prentis as his wife, but there is no indication that the two were married once.

Michael J. Fox shocks about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premier of "Reck to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also noted for personal reasons.
"We are waiting in the theatre on the Royals, and I notice that the sit is empty to me, and it will be very clear that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for a preceding documentary film "Back in Time".
The movie begins, and it comes to me that I'm a simulated ghost and a weapon length away from there, with the princess of Wales at a date.
"Back in Time", a documentation on "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, and with the Governor Robert Zemeckis and the producer Steven Spielberg.
"Reck for the Future" had 30 years ago Premiere.
"It's really for me," said Gameberg, "unacceptable to the biggest time trip film that has ever been turned."
"Back in Time" will be viewed on VOD, DVD and selected cinemas in October.
UN Chief says there is no military solution in Syria
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says that his response to Russia's enhanced military support is: "No military solution" of almost five years of conflict, and more weapons will be worse for millions of people.
The United Nations Head reiterates all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to support together and integrative negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said a press conference on midnight that he plans to meeting the Foreign Ministers of the five Permanent Member States of the Council - Russia, China, Britain and France at the border of the General Assembly's Ministerial Meeting in this month - to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the dismisses in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional forces "insolved this situation".
Ban requested the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity that they have demonstrated when reaching a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 Interview values shown that Donald Trump is serious.
Some have tried to brand him as a fleet.
Others have stopped him as a witz.
And some were waiting for a collapse.
But as some Republicans try to move Donald Trump from the top rings in surveys, it has not worked (not yet).
Decades of the last 11 national investigations showed that Donald Trump conducted in the two-range area, and some start to ask seriously what it means for the name of the real estate-moguls.
Of course, it is too early in the election period.
No one said that Trump probably will win the Republican namement.
Experts stressed that Rick Perry's leadership was issued at this time in 2011, with no State in the namement process.
And there are many reasons why he had been fighting in a general choice.
But foreign seat groups such as Jeb Bushs Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Trumps maintenance and start to leave their dollars to shoot him.
There are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate module is not only a passing phase:
Trumps' popularity values have turned around 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidate in the middle of June, a survey of the Monmouth university showed that only two of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul.
By mid-July there were 40 percent.
At the beginning of August there was 52 percent.
Now six of the 10 Republicns have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About 3 of 10 say they have a negative view.
And these figures are holding in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60% of the Republicans have a good view of Trump.
Two thirds of the GOP elections GOP would be happy with Trump as candidates.
In an inquiry of CNN/ORC last week 67% of the Republicans said they would be "happy" or "friendly" if the Trump was named.
Only two of 10 say they'd be "hidden" if he'd be the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates the same as the Trump (43 percent say they would be "happy" as. 40%, which say the same about the Trump).
The next in smiling?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other side, 47 percent of the Republican electors say that they would be "unfriend" or "enhanced" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the stability, the candidate.
A majority of the Republicans does not consider Trump's temperature as a problem.
While Donald Trump is very much criticized for its bombs and political statements, 52% of the Irish electors who tend to the Republicans believe that the real estate Mogul has the right temperature for a president, so ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the first state of the nation, the State of Iowa, where the 52% of the Republicns think that he has the personality for a super-command chair, says Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44% think that he does not have the personality to perform its office effectively, and almost six of 10 independent people say that his temperature does not pass into the white house, so ABC/Post.
The Republican elections are able to deal with the idea.
When they set up their scientists, the Republican electors have to keep the Trump for reality.
If they are asked, who wins first the GOP nomination, then, after a survey of CNN/ORC from the last week, four from ten to ten, that Trump is the best weight.
This is a change since four from 10 ends July put their money on Jeb Bush.
Complete revelation: GOP electors had not been the clearest crowd in the past.
At this time, in the last cycle, four of the ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the namement only 28 % for the final candidate in Middle Romney.
However, a variety of GOP elections has shown the campaign of Trumps as a plastic.
Even if the Republicans gather to another candidate, the Trump is still almost everybody.
Some experts point out that the scattered field probably contributes to Trump's leadership while the anti-Trump support is distributed to more than twenty other candidates.
But a survey of Monmouth University at the beginning of September shows that Trump in a hypothetical head-an-copf resource between the Trump and most other Republican candidates, the majority of its candidates is supported.
He has 13 points before Carly Fiorina, 14 points before Marco Rubio, 15 points before Walker, Jeb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It's a head-an-rent with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who shoots him?
Ben Carson would take the employee with 19 points in a hypothetical head-an-copf cost.
A nice majority of Donald Trump fans says they have formed their views.
A new survey of CBS/NYT shows that only a little more than half of the electors who support the trumpet is telling them have forgiven their voices.
Of course, it can happen much to change this, and no one can really say to never change the opinion.
46 percent said they would leave the door open to change to other candidates.
However, Trumps is the strongest competitive at the moment of the other foreign sisters, the Neuro surgery Ben Carson, but electors who say they have formed their views are doubled for the Trump.
6 of 10 Republicns say that they agree with the Trump to the issue of immigration.
Since Donald Trump in his election friend, two months ago, immigrants from Mexico "Manager" were called, immigration in the public discours in 2016.
Some are concerned that the bombardical expression of the major Spanish Americans from the Republic of the United States will be dealt with and damaged by the revolutional efforts.
But after the new ABC/Post survey of Monday, six of 10 Republicns say that they agree with Trump in immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the ramp light, it seems to be done too.
The flexibility of the government is covered to new maximums.
On Donald Trump and Ben Carson, around half of the support of Republican electors, especially through their foreign seat status.
6 of 10 Republicns say in the new Monday Research of ABC/Post, they would like to be a foreign political sister than someone with government survey.
And they're also angry on Washington.
A survey of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa shows that three of four yowa Republicans are frustrated in the Congress with 54 percent "unfriendly" and 21 percent "successfully".
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusively living in Germany
Here on the Hobookweg is the cheapest residence device - with view of the North Seawatt.
In the street, a square meter of a reetdach house costs 73.300 euros.
"Auf Sylt is naturally limited the offer to objects," says in the study - so the high price.
A new study shows how a square meter costs mostly.
Of course, 18.70 euros per squaremeter for a student bud in Munchen aren't really little.
On the contrary to Germany's top types, one of the prices comes as Peanuts.
The real estate service bar Angel & VÃ¶lkers has published a ring list of the most exclusively German residential locations - with square metres prices in swimming heights.
There are several ten thousand euros nix - per squaremeter, well-known.
But well, who's able to spend it...
Overwhelming: Munich is quite not at the pitches.
Champions League: Bayern rate starts thanks to swimming and gods
Two-face towers in Pireus: Bayern-Star Thomas MÃ¼ller has just a loop.
A happy part of Thomas MÃ¼ller offered the FC Bayern the way to a winning 3:0 at Olympiakos Pireus - then please's.
A sovereign capture of the Champions League season.
The World Meeting Thomas MÃ¼ller and Mario Detze have a dream start in the "Mission Mayland" of the FC Bayerns in the Hexenkessele of Pireus.
Trainer Pep Guardiola's shipping game in the Champions League at the Greek register of Olympiakos in warm atmosphere thanks to Mullers Doublepack (52./90.+2) and dense treffer (89.) with 3:0 (0:0).
The twenty-five Starter in Serie will be the first step to Finale on 28 May 2016 where Guardiola finally wants to take the heavy pool to Munchen.
Muller received the help of Olympiakos-Torwart Roberto in his 28th meeting in the Champions League to the Bayern leadership.
"We will not be understood," the Chief Philipp Lahm promised before the game in the Karaiskakis Stadium before 3.6.88 soft fans - and took the words of the munchers.
They showed a concentrated and engaged idea without clarifying.
Pireus had winned his six recent home games in the King class, including against sweet clubs such as Manchester United, Atlantic Madrid or Youventus Turin.
2011 Borussia Dortmund was also buried here (1:3).
However, Bayern, in seven Europecup doubles with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They were courageous, but they were often unconscious of their offensive efforts.
The attacks were too often introduced by game movement on the Links Outs Douglas Costa, which was rarely confronted with the previous brunisher Omar Elabdellaoui.
Muller had got more luck from right than his flank from the right side side in the left top toreck.
In the 67th minute the world master was the possible 2:0.
The best chances in half one had Robert Lewandowski.
First, when Olympiakos Stormer Ideye Brown sloped the Poland's headball from the line (26.).
Then by direct decline, the Torwart Roberto shared with the kin (35.).
Although the battlers habitually put their dominant games, Pireus was able to put the Nadelistics.
But on TorhÃ¼ter Manuel New was left.
Like he shocked a shooting of idea over the latte (56).
Before the new, Guardiola defended a fourth chain with David Alaba in the centre, next to Jerome Boateng, who did it well.
Mario godze, after muscular problems back in the frame, first stood out.
The WM-Held just gave green light after the final training, said Sports stand Matthias Sammer at "Sky": "What you want to do anything else, that's already bad."
In the first changing, Guardiola decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the Lewandowski (59).
Gotze arrived late for Arturo Vidal (76.) and 13 minutes later clearly made everything clear, put a swimming swimming swimming up.
Before the game, it came to Krawall in the stadium.
After a smaller group of so-called Bayern fans in their Viewer block, apparently, the guests of guests Pireus had triggered with words and ghosts, the security forces took into and made up shocks against the munchers.
At least one Bayern fan was blessed from the stadium.
Who smokes has a higher risk to lose dens
Who smokes, it hurts not only the lungs, but also the dents - which is near to a long-term study of Potsdamer.
The good news: In visibility the risk slows rapidly.
Rains have a significant increased risk to lose their teeth early.
This comes from the long-term study of a international research team, including several employees of the German Food Institute (DIfE) in Potsdam.
In comparison with non-smokers, the risk was to lose their teeth prematurely, to increase the 2.5 to 3.6 case.
Scientists had observed more than 23.300 participants.
The main causes for dental distances were cards and distortions of the dentist meat, emphasizes the difE.
For this parodontitis, be a risk factor, the authors stress.
Thus the relationship between smoking and dent loss is returned to more common dentists in smoking.
It is not clear that it also increases the risk for Karies.
People who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time, the researchers write in "Journal of Dental Research".
However, it could take over ten years until the risk of non-smokers back to the level, the student Thomas Dietrich declared by the English university Birmingham.
People should be convinced to become non-smoking, declared director Heiner Boeing from the DifE: "Tigarettes reduce the time of life".
Not to smoke is good for legs and fats and leads to a good dentist health up to age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the populations in the age of 65 to 74 years of dentistness were affected, and the difE shared.
Previous investigations had already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early dentists.
The new long-term study supports the funds.
Archaeologists stood on KÃ¶lner Rheinuffers on rest of the Spotish
For repeated times, archaeological funds have been made on the right rhino in KÃ¶ln.
Near the building of the new Rhein Boulevard, architects of the Roman-Germanian museums have buried skelet and rest of historical buildings, said the museum leader Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the start of the construction work at the Rhein, the historics are searching for so-called landdenics.
In all building projects in the city district KÃ¶ln, the Museum will always be accompanied as a fachamt for archaeological landscapes.
In the third part of the Rhein Boulevard, the archaeologists were now preached.
The text documents have already been known that in the fourth century, the establishment of a church and the eighth century has established a trier.
Besides the remains of the establishment and the Churchurm, a Friedhof has also been discovered with about 350 guests that apparently belonged to the church.
Youth Women of Good Account
After a young woman in the Bahnhof has been disappointed in geilenkirchen lingers, the federal police requests the population to help.
On midnight morning before 1,40 p.m., the woman came from the direction of the train station building to the end of the train slope, and was taken from a good department, which came from the direction of the MÃ¶nchengladbach.
According to the introduction of the train, it has led to the worst infringement of the Federal Policei.
She was treated notably in place and was taken to a hospital.
As a result of the night-speaking of the young woman, the investigated officials do not have any knowledge.
The incident may have been observed by Witnesses or the people have appointed abusical approval.
Inquiries are residents or passengers from Linderner Railways, sewing busways, Thomas Court Streets and Leafarther Street (L364).
Information given by the cause of the accident may be given by the Federal Police Hotline on the phone 0800/6888000 or any other police office around the hotline.
The EU Commission proposes a new Court on TTIP
The Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current scheme of Scheedsgericht systems in order to renew the conflict on the planned transatlantic free trade agreement.
The restraint private lighting institutions for conflicts between concerts and States should then be dissolved by a transparent system that is clearly more traditional courts in its function.
"We want to establish a system that trusts the citizens," the competent Commissioner of the EU Cecilia MalmstrÃ¶m stated in the opinion.
Sweden has proposed to make the proposal as a European negotiation position in the free trade negotiations with the United States.
The German government announced support.
By TTIP, the largest free trade zone in the world will be covered with 800 million people.
The plans for reform of the current scheme are concretely proposed that the EU and the United States select an independent judge for a new investment court.
They should be the same parts from the EU, the United States and the third countries.
For the first time, it is also a second instance.
It would allow it to abolish a sentence against judges.
By the same time, the prosecutors accepted each other of the Schieds Directors, there was no possibility for their judgments.
In the debate of the last months, it has been clear that citizens did not trust fairness and justice in the old ISDS system, commented Malmstrom.
In the long term, she wants to work on a international investment right.
For example, the conflict between Chinese enterprises and EU States could be declared.
The main reason for the major resistance in Europe against TTIP is to be the investor's squeeze procedures (ISDS).
Traditional ships are criticized by enemies as a type of parallel justice, enforced by the taxpayers to enable the damage rates, enforce national laws or to reduce consumer and environmental standards.
In the first opinions, anti-TTIP organizations such as Campact were not sufficient to the proposals of the European Commission.
In particular, it was criticized that it should not apply for the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
However, the German Economic Secretariat Matthias Machig (SPD) called the plans as a great progress.
The Commission takes into account the key points of reform which the Federal Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel has developed in the spring with other ministers of the EU.
The old system of private shields are from the table.
The French government also welcomed MalmstrÃ¶m's plans.
The European Business Association for Business Europe warned to limit the economic opportunities by many new rules.
In particular, smaller and medium-sized enterprises could be aware of this.
When the discussions on the Free Trade Agreement TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) could be concluded, it remained clear on midnight.
The negotiations start from mid-2013.
However, the theme of investment protection has not been discussed with the United States.
It should, as a result, be a framework for the Agreement for this year.
This term applies to which it is not more tolerable.
Delician Folk of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
11 years ago, Sufjan Stevens sits on the bridges in the KÃ¶lner Prime Club (days: Luxor).
Besides him, a Flipchart is found on which the protected folks have registered the Malean American state Michigan with the Fill.
The whole public, about 40 people, is closely taken by Steven's talk.
He's talking about various places that he always put on the map, about which he reports his minimum and zart ordered songs.
Where they have been, and how it looks like there, in his homemate.
If so, Stevens is a wonderful creative Irrer.
With the 2003 and the third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State" appears to be slightly composed songs that are very close to the American Folk of the Late Sixty, but every time they can slowly swim.
It decreased that "Michigan" would be the first part of a changing series: each of the 50 United States will be discussed as follows.
But since 2004 and in Rhein neighbors, "Seven Swans" has already appeared and there are positive expectations.
Reduced Stevens comes here.
Live is enough to guitar and Banjo.
A year later, the musician who lived in New York returned to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise") 2005 appears to be a surrounded master work.
Overwhelming on ideas and stilist finish.
The album grows in the American Billboard Charts and lacks no yearly best list of the influentious music media.
According to productive experiences, Stevens is then on "The Age of Adz" (2010).
This sixth ordinary studioalbum is still wide orchestrated, however, by programed sequences or beats and plays with all effects and halls.
During the smallest clubs, the shoes shows here will be slightly spectacles from Neon-style countries and large fluorescent swimming deco.
Today Sufjan Stevens turns as part of a five-powered band by Germany.
More in the dark part of Hamburger!
Theater represents mainly the "Carrie & Lowell" available since March.
Although now nearly 2000 guests have been able to sit in their steels, Stevens turned back to the intimity and towards.
Without a word to the public, the group of excellent musicians plays through the broad album.
From the public it is heard: the debate is "opulent" and it is possible to remove the "platte on the ground".
First to an appeal, Steven's decisively plays little older songs and finally sweets himself under a real applause.
Jeremy Corbyns debut at the questionnaire of the Prime Minister
Since his election, Mr Corbyns' DebÃ¼t is expected at the questionnaire of the Prime Minister's appointment.
The new President of work Jeremy Corbyn will give his debtor to the questionnaire of the Prime Minister and set up with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will urge its first six questions on midday, while its performance of the media is likely to be examined by the labour Members from the nearby.
He requested "ancient theatres and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could overcome some meetings to leave them colleagues.
The appeal will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Corbyn's leadership, as it comes after his appointment to member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC annual session on TuC on TuC.
In the interim period, the decision of the President of work, which was to be held on Tuesday during the day of the National Symnes at a reminder at the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in Stille, has caused a criticism of a number of tory MPs and is at the center of several titles in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national sympathy has given its attention.
A speaker of Mr. Corbyn said he had been "in respectful style" and he recognized the "Royal Air Force" in the air battle for England.
But one member of Mr Corbyns' shadow cast, Owen Smith, told in BBC two Newsnight programs that he was working to sing the national symnees, "independent" of his faith that Monarchie should be created.
Soon a twenty-first ministers refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's Spitzen Office, calling for differences in the economy, defence and foreign policy, while less than one sixth parliamentary party was originally supporting him as leaders.
The Political Correspondent of the BBC Robin Brant says that political differences are also in the labour, according to Mr Corbyns' statements on the position to the European Union and the limitation of profits.
Mr Corbyn said the TUC Conference that Labour proposes amendments to remove all the idea of a restriction in total.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith said the Minister of Employment and Rents that the party is "very clear" that they are only against the government plans to reduce the limitation of 26,000 Â£ to 23,000 Â£.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth working chairman, David Cameron, since he is the Tory Chief, in the last decade of the Parliament's Dispatch Box.
The President-in-Office, who promised another approach to policy, says that he had "Crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP said that the questionnaire of the Prime Minister is to be comparable, and that it will be left by both "slaughterness" and the opposite of rebellion, and, instead, has taken place to concentrate on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadows of the Economic Minister, will be represented by him if he does not participate - for example, if Mr Cameron is in the foreign.
He also discussed the idea that other colleagues are currently taking the word, and that he had discussed John Bercow, the speaker of the undercoming house, to discuss the problem.
When he was a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said he wanted to remove the policy in the style of a "casperle-theaters" which was often linked to the questionnaire of the Prime Minister, but a few years later, he felt that he had failed.
As it was first sent to the television in 1990, the questionnaire was considered with the Prime Minister as the most important barometer of the judge of a leader and its leadership in the subcommittee and his position under its parliamentary colleagues, although critics have argued that they became a carriÃ¨re and needed broader reforms.
'Shooting in Joburg': Trained for Obdachless Youth in Photographs

"I was shooted in Joburg" (I was held in Joburg) is a common study that taught young people in there how they take photos from their environment and gains.
BBC News has taken one of the first ends of the project.

Pfund increases by speeding payment growth in the United Kingdom
The pound increased by data showing an increase in the wage of the United Kingdom. Parallel, the FTSE 100 was increased by the commandive target SABMller.
Among May and July the result of Boni in the United Kingdom was 2,9% in comparison with the same previous period.
This percentage has been estimated as early as 2009 on the time of increase in interest.
The fund increased by more than 1 % against the dollar at $1.5505 and up to 0.84 % against the euro at â¬1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index concluded by an increase of 1.49 % to 6.229.21.
SABMller was the extraordinary share on the market and made a 20% spent after the transfer of the Rivalen AB Inbev offer.
A transaction would combine the two largest routines in the world and bring marks like buds, sterea Artois, butni and Grolsch.
Burberry actions were higher than 0.9% after encouraged news from the competition concerns for the Luxus-government Richemont.
Richemonts' latest sales numbers strike all expectations and showed that the transfer in China - a key market for Burberry - re-established growth.
Attracts from Glencore increased up to 5% after the mountainbaue said he took $2.5 billion by a sale of shares as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper center Mond were the largest losses on the index, with a decline of 4,3%, after goldman Sachs had set its evaluation for the company rating on "very".
JD Sports increased around 3,1 % after a preimbursement of 46.6 million was reported for the half year.
The head of JD Sports says that higher loss is threatening the expansion.
JD Sports director Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum loan for UK employees could mean "more purchase power in the counts of potential customers".
But it's unforeseen that this purchase power will be equipped with the higher job costs of his company, he says.
The costs could meet the expansion plans of JD sports, added, and that could mean that there are less additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital city: on Beeber-Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Lippie 21-year-old man, a handling with upper fresh fresh.
The guy with the platinblound hair is 100 million euros difficult.
Before even more.
Mr Beeber is now in Berlin.
And the generation U17 turns back.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old girl has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not crazy.
Hundreds of fans joined Justin yesterday.
In addition, Ewa and Victoria from Poland.
However, since 7 a.m., the polyn is located on the cold stone plates Berliner Luxus Hotel on the Potsdamer place.
The Beeber-Bau: Here you live Idol, whose poster is upwarded in Stettin, since Monday.
The suite, in which the Canadian songs live, costs exactly the day as their mother ewa in half year.
That's all right.
He says: "In the first time my victory should be sit in the tenth class in Gymnasium."
"I'll fill her a dream."
School obligation?
Who's juckt?
Not the fans.
Neither beeber isn't.
He's shocked out anywhere.
For the advertising in the Superbowl's newspaper, he covered three million, a two-year deal with a anti-pickel company, a lot of dollars on the Beeber account.
And with each puppe that looks like he and over the ladder also casts birds.
If Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you're wondering about the window's head.
More than 100 million would have been so able to have been.
Some say the Hype went too far.
Others point out, Beeber is finally just in the United States and the United Kingdom with its new simple "What do you mean?" on place 1.
Beeber itself, whose fourth album is to follow in November, does not first interest many none.
At least he does that.
Pegida-Plakat brings Libanese on card-floor ideas
Cartballs or twins?
It's both - even in the cartofloor that the Old-Burg of Imbis has developed Hani Alhay.
Inspirited by the speech "Cartoffel instead of DÃ¶ner" on a place of Pegida movement, Alhay kartoffel and meat are shocked together on a sword.
On the idea, a placet brought him in a Pegida demonstration with the letter "Cartoffn instead of DÃ¶ner", which he had seen in the television.
Since then, in his shop, a grill piece is equipped with meat and cards.
"This is Multiculti for the Magen," Alhay says.
The idea of Libanon has now been put into Munchen at the patent office.
There, according to the information provided by the Authority, it is already protected as a pattern of use.
How much flesh and how many cards of the skin are, Alhay does not want to be tragic.
Only so much, "It's smelling together" he finds.
In its customers, the Kulinary People's understanding is also good.
Metcash starts landwork campaign for combating Aldi accidents
Metcash tries to protect the IGA branches before a Aldi-Authmarch in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food-Group Metcash has started a land-function campaign to defend the market share of IGA individuals in South Australia and Western Australia for a $7,7 million.
During Aldi, the opening of two distribution centres and the first 120 lodgings in South Australia and Western Australia are preparing the beginning of the next year, strengthening Metcash and IGA supermarkets their relationships with local food providers and build IGA brands through Mainstream marketing and marketing on social media, as well as events like Adelaide show.
IGA shoppingers and suppliers spring on board, with brands such as iron manufacturer Simmo from Dunsborough, which distributes samples in IGA rooms and sales the licensed tickets for the South Australian football liga to faithful customers.
It is expected that Metcash will be published further details of its defence strategy on September 29 when the large leaders run its annual investment strategy day.
It is much on the game, since South Australia and Western Australia almost 30% of Metcashs IGA shops and generate higher winning margins than Metcashs IGA network in the Eastern States.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoricly provincial and IGA-individors have a higher market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in the Western states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take about five per cent of the food market in these two countries, and all existing operators, but mainly self-employed individuals will be deleted.
A report published in this week estimated Morgan Stanley's analyst Tom Kierath that IGA individuals could lose $360 million per year and Metcash 250 million to the end of 2016.
This prognosis is based on the acceptance that Aldi opens 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and will reach $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss of food and food business and the amounts of Metcashs high fixed costs could be around 13 million $ winning before interests and tax costs, said Mr Kierath.
At the same time Metcash lost market share in the Eastern States, mainly at Aldi and Coles, although a recent investigation of Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most faithful.
Morgan Stanley acknowledges that Metcash's surplus in food and food business is 3.8% in 2016, at 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14% in 2015 to 10.3% to 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told a business session in Melbourne that Metcash probably would be in a decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to the comments by Mr Douglass.
But it will be said that a member of Metcash has contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
Since 2010, IGAs market share has been reduced by 18 per cent to 14 per cent, and income from Metcashâs food and food trade providing approximately 1.200 IGA individuals has been 43 per cent, reflecting the operational debt debt reduction in the same pressure on relocation and margins.
However, the big-speaker is growing and investing more than 150 million dollars to compare sales prices with Coles and Woolworths with hundreds of products every week and to improve the IGA individuals in improvement of their loads through fast growing fresh food and provide a better selection of private label life.
Metcash's principal business leader Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and loading programs will be introduced to Elan and hopes that the largest employee returns back to a maximum growth in 2017 for the first four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis has more loving than critical for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "coalitional damages" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and wins in view of the President of the Australian Tennis Association, Steve Healy most lovingly as a criticism for his own behavior.
Cokkinakis, who is young of the talented Duos, which is always called "special Ks", is through the fascinated interference of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters Masters on the light.
In a fair qualification game in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his partner Ryan Harrison had to be separated two times by the swimming leader, and Harrison said: "Wawrinka had to shoot Kyrgios, and I should shoot the child."
While the last time he was seen as he destroyed a tennis shock, after a shock a potential US open seat of Richard Gasquet, he was strongly defended by Healy.
The adolescent is now in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth on the second place in Bernard Tomic in Davids-Cup-Halbfinal against Britain.
"A thing I'm very exciting is that, according to my view, Thanasi was taken a little into the war," said Healy.
He destroyed a shooter when he lost a shooting in the United States, but he is not the first player who destroyed a shooter of fleet with himself, and I well know Thanasi enough to know that he's not proud of it.
But, indeed, he has been extremely good in the United States opening, even under the very provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he has a lot of recognition.
He has a nice team on himself, he has a great family about himself, and I think he was treated too strictly.
He's a very thrilling 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he's walking in the team and so further, he has never had a problem with the other players, he will be respected in the environment, he trains hard, he's good in shape, he's a very stable and excited young man, and I think he won to be judged after his own services.
Healy also supported the decision not to take into account Kyrgios's important decision to begin on Friday, and he describes the "general decision" as the right for all, but safeguards the man from Canberra as a stronger part of the team."
"If we want that the team is completely concentrated on the competition and not on all the controversies around [Kyrgios]," said Healy.
And I believe that Nick has made the upset so fast asking people like Federer and Murray. He grows in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and wins all the critics he has done, but we try to support him, we try to make him understanding the consequences of his acts. Sometimes outside the light he can think about it, I think it's best for the manner and it's the best for him.
European Refugee Crisis: Hungary explains the state, closes the border, keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency and resigned the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and observed all who tried to come illegally to the country. All with the aim of stopping the throne of migrants.
Cao followed the border, as hundreds of migrants gathered together in a country of nowhere, and Serbian officials reacted with rebuilding.
Those who were flying before violence were set up for an unknown time in a agriculture stretch on the road between the two control points of the country and built the halls and left there.
But frustations shocked.
When a police shocked over them, the migrants scanned "Open the borders!" and shouted crying against the Hungarian Preparation Police.
Some foods from protein and water return.
Serbian Foreign Minister explained that it was "inacceptable" that migrants would be returned from Hungary while coming from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbian) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
In the coming days, there must be a conversation with Brussels and other countries", said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulences at the Hungary-Serbia borders came a day after the 28-nation block at a strict meeting in Brussels could not agree with the common immigration policy.
However, the Ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who were looking for refugees in the overwhelming Italy and Greece, which expressed their hope that finally - the next month or the end of the year - would achieve an agreement that the EU States would be more than 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
The Federal Officer Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special office of the European Union to address the continent's immigration crisis on Tuesday.
However, Hungary did not put his hope to a rapid action of Brussels or its neighbors.
The emergency in two southern regions in Tuesday has made the authorities more power to control the crisis, so that they could delay roads and accelerate the asylum procedures.
The Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Ssijarto said that his country was also the construction of a steel rail along his borders to Romania, to stop the throne of migrants through the country, after it ended a torment on the Serbian border.
CBS News Correspondent, Charlie D'Agata, reported that even prison sequences were used in the struggle to create the steel race between Hungary and Serbia.
In the past months, Hungary has become a significant engagement and the start point in the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and other parts in the Middle East.
However, President Victor Orban found that most economic refugees are income, which are searching for a better life, and not war refugees, who have the right to protection - a view that is strong in reverse to other EU States, including Germany.
The new laws in force for midnight in Hungary make the override of the borders or the damage of the four-metre (13 feet) high deal that the Government has made up of the Southern border to Serbia is a crime. These laws also set higher punishment for convicted persons.
"On the basis of the situation of the mass migration, the Hungarian government declares the emergence of the emergence", said the government speaker Zoltan Kovac's reporters in the southern city of Szege.
We say it very clear: illegal border transition is a crime.
The Parliament must still agree to the use of the military who is expected for the next week, but reporters of Associated Press have seen hard armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for a day on the border.
Gyorgy Bacondi, Landes Security Adviser for Orban, said that 45 people were in the attempt to find out the borders, and 15 other were already deeply entered into the country.
They come out by harming the punishment, they are now in the police and are accused of criminals in accordance with the new laws.
The authorities are in order to quickly repair the punishment.
The Hungarian officials also concluded two of the seven border transmissions with Serbia after a steelwagon with a steel route to close the borders.
Chaos crossed the most important border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container, to edit the data of people and press a majority of people to join there.
At about 20 years, thousands left outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the most important car rental connection of Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they could return to Hungary.
Select-2016: Hillary Clintons pre-spot before Bernie Sanders in national investigation
The former United States Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues to have a two-third predict in the democratic residents for the appointment at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins her against the ground.
Clinton has now supported 47% of the democratic elections at the forecast (58%) while the sanders are on the second place, with 27% (augmented by 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not announced whether he is candidated to the President, is supported by 15% of the democratic electors.
More than five months before the beginning of the predicts, most democratic electors say that it is too early to say that their view is fixed to which candidates are supported.
But Clinton's supporters are more responsible than the other candidates in their choice.
Since the CBS News survey, Clinton lost a number of demographic groups while Sanders achieved some wins.
Clinton holds a great deal in women and gentlemen, but these predictions have reduced.
Their support for the men is clearly cut, and the sanders are back here only with 5 points.
Clinton's advantage in democratic elections under 50 years has been fleet, and they and sanders are now at the same height.
However, Clinton has a larger precaution for the elderly electors.
Last month, Clinton had two-site prepayment in the Liberals, but Sanders now have a 5-ponct prepayment at this group.
Another half of the democratic electors of the pre-selections say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasming if they were appointed by the party.
A fourth would support her with some preserves and 15% more would support them only because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support them.
Maybe it's not surprised that Clinton's current supporters are particularly shocked by her.
The views are stronger mixed with those who do not support Clinton today - only a fourth would encourage it.
While 48 percent of the democratic elections say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm, less Republican electors say this about their piccent candidate Donald Trump (35%).
If Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the view that it is time to be a President (13%) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton's supporters are also mentioned with Bill Clinton (9%).
Adoption to address problems and selectivity is also discussed.
Since the Vice-President moves a potential for the Chairman's office in the Waagschool, 57% of the democratic electors want to see him in the rain - although a third believes that it should not be done.
If democratic elections are asked who would be their second choice for the party, it is a skin on the sight.
More than half of Clinton's adherents say that the skins would be their second choice far before Sanders.
If you decide to candidate the name of the democratics, Hillary Clinton's pretension is increased before sanders, of 20 points with skins on 30 points without swimming.
Fifty-five percent of democratic electors see Clinton as candidate with the best chances to win the choice; but this number of 78 percent in the last month.
The skin is a second at this measure, but the percentage that looks like it is the "selectional" is increased.
However, the question of what is more important for a candidate is called democratic choice questions.
Like in the last month, the only democratic candidate or potential candidate is not inacceptable for these elections.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results in some important features in the choice of their party.
Most are considered Clinton, sanders and skins honest and trustful and with strong leadership qualitys.
The skin is the best of the three candidates in honor, while Clinton's strength is the leadership.
Three percent of democratic electors do not believe that Clinton is honest and reliable, so many say about Sanders (15%) but 27 percent do not think about it.
Democratic elections generally see also Clinton, Sanders and Birds ideologically in accordance with their views.
In all these measurements, some four of the democratic electors have no view of sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server are continued to be held as a foreign minister during the office, most democratic electors are satisfied with their statement of the matter and say that it has not in general influenced their views.
But it's a different story in the United States public.
The half of the Americans are now unpleasant with their statement, while only a third is satisfied.
The public view to this was divided in March, short after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail control did not have an impact on their general views of Clinton, although 36 percent said that their opinion was still defeated.
There are mainly Republicans, more than six of 10 who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is considered honest and trustful by the electors of their party, this is still a problem for them understood: only 32% they see as honest and reliable, eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less than since May.
62% of the election authors do not consider a honest and reliable person.
At the same time, 55% of the election authorized countries also see the Trump as not honest and not reliable.
However, Clinton and Trump receive good notes to lead.
From the six guests tested, Carson and Bush depend the best in honestity.
A majority of sanders looks more honest, but as Carson has no views of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 democratic elections in the pre-selection is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson turns to a countrywide survey close to Donald Trump
Ben Carson is located in the latest survey of CBS News/New York Times close to Donald Trump
The two candidates are now half of the support of the electioners in the new survey, and others are dramatically losing stop.
The Republican electioners continue to support a large number of trumpets in the country. The support increases from 23% in the last CBS survey, which was held before Fox News in the last month, to 27% in the service day's survey.
But Carson fell by 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also acknowledged that Carson was well accepted in demographic groups and that Trump was subject to high-educated students under the Republicans.
The rest of the field, with exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio-governeur John Kasich, is shocked with Wisconsins Gouverneur Scott Walker, who has been the most deepest deeply, even from 10% support in the last month to 2%.
The former Florida Governeur Jeb Bush, the former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio, is 6% on the third place.
The error margin in the sample of 376 persons from the Republican elections in this recent investigation is Plus or Minus 6% and was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey, published last week, shows that Carson increases in the surveys - he supported 19% in the Republicans, after the Trump with 32% support.
The recent survey of ABC News/Washington Post also showed clearly the Trump before Carson.
With regard to one of the past weeks Carson, Trump found a few sides for the former neurochirurgs, even after Carson apologised to question the Trumpsâ faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campanion in Iowa.
Angular bath temperatures: The East Mediterranean is up to 29 Â°C.
Even if the skin values are measured only in the television, there is already a trip on the Mediterranean to present a warm water for bathrooms.
A bathroom in North or East Sea should be a shorter enjoyment at maximum 17 degrees.
Some do not go to the sea: Maximimal 18 degrees have the water in the North and East Sea in this week, shares the German Water Service (DWD).
Bade temperatures still provide the Mediterranean: in the East it is even up to 29 degrees.
In Adria, it is 25 degrees in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt comes on 28 degrees.
Five members of the brotherhood with the death of a Balch College Neuling
Two years later, after a student died during a sketchy ritual of a student connection in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, the murders were sent against five persons.
Chun "Michael" Deng was abroad by the New York Baruch College Pi-Delta Psi university during an introduction ritual in September 2013 and delayed its transport to the hospital, which has participated in his death, with the police.
The officials said he was shocked with a 30-pound skin skin, and was repeatedly attacked while he tried to get a goal over a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about head pain, then he was unconscious.
The members of the Pi-Delta Psi branch did not call the emergency number 911 after Deng was deniable and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital, so the police.
However, they had the time to change the deng's clothes, google their symptoms and contact Andy Mit to contact the national presidents of the brotherhood to get the Council, said the police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this point the members began to hide Utensilians and put the well-being of the brotherhood on the basis of Michael Deng," said the police head Wagner.
He couldn't be recovered, and the next morning he died.
After an autopsie report, Deng was repeated with stroke power injuries to head, smell and upper skin.
"The many families have been destroyed by the skins of the brotherhood. At least one student dies from the Skandals every year from 1970," said Douglas Fierberg, a law lawyer who joins Deng's family, in a statement.
Brotherships and their members must be taken into account, and this step of the authorities is very important.
A Continent Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an appeal for murdering three degrees for the first five members.
Twenty members of the brotherhood, including Mr Mei, are also accused of a criminal association.
"We do not only want to be responsible for those involved but if there is an organization that has sanctioned it officially or inofficially, so we will also take them into account," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baltic College has prohibited the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood has reacted to the local group.
This will happen when the Fed increases the interests
An increase in the interest rate, and the houses will be generated in channels, the payment rates will be increased, and the economy will be led to a recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it will take and how long it will stop.
In particular, the history of the economy only provides low guidelines to the end.
A recession occurred within 11 months after the first increase in interest rate and 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserves in increased interest rates is often, even though not always, a factor in how the economy and the financial facilities react.
As a result, representatives of the US Central Bank have so much stressed that investors should not concentrate on when they start to increase the interest rates, but much more on the period required for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
At the end, however, market operators may find that the whole restraint may have been overcome because of an increase in interest.
"The first increase of the feed since the global financial crisis is immediately interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the "balanced money" era", said Julian Jessop, Chief of Capital Economics, in a communication to customers.
On the contrary, we are not expecting the continuing return of US interests to normal heights, but still at too low levels to lead to the sixth shock that seems to be afraid.
This does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here is a basic view of historical trends how some areas of the economy could react:
As the market has seen in the last month, the advancement of interest increases can make a time volatile.
When increased, the impact is not so dramatic.
"As a tendency is apparent to decrease funds from 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in the monetary policy", said German bank analysts in a new study on what happens after increases in the feed.
Indeed, in the past 35 years, the market has been mostly in the slope - about 14 percent - on the way to increase interests, was very difficult in the 250 days later (mean wins of 2,6 per cent), then back to a normal state of 500 days, with a average retail rate in the past six cycles of 14.4 per cent, according to an current analysis, the Bob Doll, Chief installation strategies at Nuveen Asset Management, published at Barron's.
The German Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to be decreased in the increase cycle and that the pensions start to reduce.
Recesions are a fact of economic life, but interest increases often promote them.
In the current case, the feed is faced with certain conditions that have not been before and could accelerate a recession.
It is also noted that the Brutto Inlands product will be close to its lower point at an increase in the interest rate of the feed.
According to the German Bank, 118 interest increases since 1950 only two times the nominal BIP was at 4,5%.
Although the second quarter 2015 was at 3,6%, only few expected that this will be delayed and expected for the third quarter according to the information of Atlanta Fed only 1,5%.
Increased interest rates in such a questioning economic art may be risking and the question "If it's different this time," the German Bank said.
The market sharers have taken the whole year to increase the feed, and all the eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategies and economists believe that the FOMC can accept an increase in this meeting, the Futures Gandal is only a probability of 25%.
"In our study, all the increases cycles from 1950 to today have been held in a super cycle with increased growth in the PIB, and the pre-recension increases are very fast after the start of recovery", says the report.
On the contrary, this is a clearly slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cyclus is the longest expected of the feed since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is up to 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatile, since the market has increased interests, and the pattern is very similar to the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect of loans is faster than if actions change their strategic course.
In cash, the inverse seems to change the direction when the first increase/sequence in the cycle is followed.
At the end of the increase cycle, the suppliers immediately fall, said the German Bank.
Charles Schwab's strategies believe that the increase in the interest rates will lead to a closer gap between longer and shorter costs and to a decline in the curve.
High-speaking benefits often bring better results in such climate, although "we are still carefully expected to expect higher revenue", said Kathy Jones, Fixed-Income Analystine in Schwab, in an analysis.
It is interesting, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to Fed Strategy expectations.
"Besides the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations there are some signs that the market has adapted to a more rigorous monetary policy."
The short-term interests have increased, the fund curve is slightly, the credit levels have expanded and the volatility has grown - all features of the market when the Fed increases its strategy.
The larger and largest enterprises that develop the largest part of their business in the United States will benefit from the increase of interest rates and the increase in local products.
Multinational companies with high debt will be worse, as an increased dollar makes their products on the global market and also the financing of their debts.
"The story shows that "qualitys-" actions are inclined to react in three months after an initial interest increase exceedingly", said Goldman Sachs analysts in a report for customers.
Enterprises with a strong balance have surveyed a average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Enterprises with high capital rates and low volatility in their shares also transferred their pensions with low quality to average 4 (percent points) and 3 (percent points).
Debts will be a great problem.
Enterprises with a high share of flexible interests are mostly lost, said Goldman.
Out of the clean share games, consumers will also benefit by the increased dollar.
Sparer could see profits by higher income, even though experts are different views as soon as it will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the classic FM, says parliamentary member Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the sender for its "conclusion"
He argued that it is not to differ increasingly from commercial rivals.
He also settled on the BBC Music Awards and said that she tried only the Britishs
Parliament's College Damien Collins adopted the sentence The Voce and said that this is not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "switch" to classic FM, with a leading parliamentary member and increases a new pressure on the sender to prove that he does something that the privates do not do.
The Conservative Deputy Andrew Bingham also said the BBC's boss that the public and legal radiostor "verdume" and grows not more to differ from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "smile" - but it seems to change classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards that started in the last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seems to be only under another name.
So, if you're trying to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples in which you actually just pull out what is already on the market," Mr. Bingham said.
BBC General Director returned and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far before its commercial competitors when it goes to Live music and public declaration.
What I learn from Radio 3, I will learn about classic music anywhere different.
And there is a commitment to life music and music, which is really unconfronted.
"And the commitment of Radio 3, to find new music and to give new works in order, I really think very important," he said.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that it was hard to be done to join the public as it did in the past, because the Britishs are less informed about classic music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only element of the BBC production, which took place during the hearing of the Committee on Selection of Cultural, Media and Sports in the light of the shore of the commercial rivals.
The Tory Deputy Damien Collins applies to The Voice - the musical talent show of the BBC that was purchased by the Netherlands producer Talpa Media for estimated costs of 22 million Â£.
See why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly marking?
Lord Hall found that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced "in particular BBC wise".
He added that he wanted that the company "is a heat out of our hair steel" when it started a serial of entrepreneurship next time.
However, he refused to exclude the order of additional series of The Voice in future or give money to payers for other entertainment formats.
Internet environments were the late and the Black Friday may be responsible for this in August
In the first three months of 2015, seven percentage increase in online sales was increased.
In the last month, the lower result has been since the beginning of the records in 2000.
Online sales increased the use of phones for purchase three years ago
Experts believe that the Black Friday has broken the expenditure in November
For over a decade the virtual purchase has grown, and many of the main purchasing streets of the United Kingdom have become spiritual cities.
But experts say that there are now signs that the online environments are stamping, after new numbers only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure for August represented the lowest increase in growth since the start of the records in 2000 with only five percentage increases in the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are stating, after new numbers only seven percentage growth in the first three months 2015
"If you consider the growth rates for the past years and return to 2000, it has always developed in the course of time", said Andy Mulcahy, an exemptioner of the IMRG sale index to the Guardian.
He explained that the online sales were increased three years ago as buyers to work with their phone purchase.
It means that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments, for example at home on the sofa.
But now it is, and we may experience that growth is reduced.
The black-friday phenomenon imported from America is quoted as a reason for the following circles.
Experts believe that the purchasers are retaining their purchase before this event, which happens on Wednesday last day in November.
In the past five times the average number of buyers was cut off to their computer to make their fingers, and some handler websites cut off.
Experts believe that Black Friday, in which the buyers were fighting for shoots, could stop buyers to make buyers.
A study of the British Retail Consortium found that from 5 Â£ expenditure was issued more than 1 Â£ online.
In some products such as television and wash machines, more than one third of the buyers are now performed via web shops.
At the same time, more than a fourth of the people's clothes and shoes online instead of the modekets in the city.

B&Q Boss says that the time of the accepted Eastern Europe Manufacturers is over
British employees growing handworkers, says Veronique Laury
The number of qualified handlers from Eastern Europe has increased
This leads to opening 200 additional screwfix channels on handworkers
At the same time King Fisher 60 B & Q sales plants will be closed to the country
by Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of Daily Mail
It is noted that British households and pines are undergoing for the use of qualified Eastern Europe workers who carry out the work in their homes
If you can be sent with a hammer or a pink to strike walls, you are apparently a minority.
In fact, British employees are increasingly employed to carry out home workers in their homes, so the chief of the company behind B and Q.
VÃ©ronique Laury, new leader of Kingfisher, who has the tree market chain, said that a large increase in the number of qualified handlers from Eastern Europe, which offers services to deep price.
Therefore, Kingfisher plants to open 200 more screwfix Shops, which are set up to handworkers and to close 60 sales facilities from B&Q.
Mrs Laury said she wants to work more women in B & Q-Shops, because eight of ten purchase decisions are taken by women.
The men are now overcoming with the employees.
She said it should be necessary to put the growing demographic trends that show more women's single budgets that have more renovations than in the past.
Ms. Laury said, "There is still a majority of men in our branches.
We need to move this to a more balance.
In fact, the half of our customers from women with 80% of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision process.
Ms. Laury, who is one of the only five women at the top of a British Index in the FTSE100, has also established its top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has put 50% of the team with women, including its business management and financial arrangement.

It was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board.

Because of the trend, Kingfisher, the screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new branches.
Aich/Dob officials because of infidelity before court
Aich/Dob must be responsible for infidelity and expenditure interference on the country's side on midnight two officials of the Austrian Volleyball Vice-Minister.
The complaints were not guilty.
One of them was also accused of official abuse.
It has been free from this provision in May.
The current process was reversed.
Under the investigation, the Ober-State advocate Robert Riffel had been criticalized that the complaints used for private purposes in the years 2006-2011 of the United Nations accounts that were to provide them in their functions.
The damage is covered by about 400,000 euros.
The sports officials are also accused of financial acts.
This fact was the Chairman of the Creator Senator, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It should be negotiated at a later time.
The defence for the conspiration of the infidelity indicated that the agreement had not yet been a share of a possession.
The sports officials would only have calculated injuries and the sports club, for which they had been working from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money, had been debt - the passives were about 600,000 slilings in 2001 (south 44.000 euros).
"And we were in front of the situation: let's go to the club, or we're going to find out?" said one of the complaint, in the Brother Office of the Financial Office.
He then decided to take this task with his colleagues and mixed complaints.
With all the risks.
"We shooted money to add our life assurances as security to the bank," he said at the invasion.
It should be agreed with the Agreement: you can manage the money freely, it may not be made a debt.
Furthermore, in the relevant financial success, the payment of incurrence damages is reciprocal until 1991.
Thus, a part of the injuries has been paid since 2003, as one more on the account.
The former Obmann also explained the procedures.
The accounts and books managed the two complaints together, said the second accused.
Why the payments of the Agreement were not opened detailedly, the judge asked.
The Agreement has not been interested in the details of the financing, if only the debt freedom was important, so the answer.
When an official investigation began in 2011, an amount of EUR 120,000 was overlooked to the Agreement.
This was the retreat, the accused declared.
This value paper account went on the name of the second complaint and was not known according to the Agreement.
"Why?" the judge wanted to know.
The questionnaire had no answer for a long time.
Then he finally thought he believed that this was the best for the United Nations.
If something happened to him, no one would know about this money, the lawyer put the State lawyer in the room.
The Mitange complaint has been informed, the official was justified.
This reference was formulated as "Shadenwise-Government".
Why would the judges and the lawyers want to know?
This declared the first complainant that he had not agreed with this formulation because the Agreement had never been harmed.
But what should I do when the lawyer says, "It's all you're out of the snow."
"If I am a law advisor?" he asked.
Furthermore, the official said he never had a hundred content, he just calculated kilometers and denses.
He has taken into account the Agreement 1.000 euros per month, but the real involvement was much higher, he added.
The lawyers could not submit exact documents for the previous years.
These were not maintained after a operational test, where everything was correctly estimated, and they were declared.
The second sentence had also been in charge of kilometers.
All advertisements were carried in bar, and he had to walk from his home to the bank to Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main negotiation is continued on 23 September with the investigation of Witnesses.
Hewlett packard stretchs 30,000 jobs
Furthermore, for three years, the computer rise will decrease further jobs when the company is deployed.
Scientific exhibitions at US computers Hewlett-Packard (HP) do not find an end.
The US Technology Centres set up the restructuring of 25,000 to 30,000 places in its company party.
The company shared the costs of $2,7 billion (2,4 Mrd EUR) on Tuesday.
The step will lead to a special charge of around 2,7 billion dollars that will be attacked from the fourth quarter.
The 55,000 jobs driving down three years has not yet been completed.
HP was still employed at the end of the year 2013/14 around 302.000 employees.
Afterwards the hewlett package was 2,3%.
The large-scale concerts from the California Palo Alto are at the time: so the computer and printer business will still be assembled into a new society, separated from the most important areas with computer servers and data records for companies and other services.
Both business lines should be notified at the BÃ¶rse.
A re-experienced PC compartment as well as a weaker demand of enterprises according to its services have recently led to Lenovo to the world's second largest PC manufacturers.
In the third business center at the end of July, the paragraph of PC and printers returned to 11,5%.
The expense was about 8% at about 25.4 billion dollars.
The resolve returned in 15 of 16 quarters.
HP responds with a switch and massive switch on the shift in the industry.

RÃ¶szke: Abuse of Violence to Serbian-Unarian borders
The Hungarian police has set up on the Serbian border at Roszke's Tennessegas and watercrafts against hundreds of refugees.
Euronews Correspondent, Daniel Bozsik, has engaged in violence on the border control point.
He reported phone:
A group of refugees crossed the borders.
In the meantime, a police line had been formed, and the police had been prepared for a watercraft.
40 to 50 refugees began to shoot with stones, shoots and plastic fleets after the officers.
The officers first introduced uninterrupted pfefferspray.
Then the police used the T-R-G.
Many of the heat gas was spent in direction of the refugees.
That's how the group was dissolved.
Refugees have now retreated something unexpectedly.
A pregnant and apparently afflicted woman was taken out of the zone.
Kids who shouted the skin gas shouted.
Other refugees settled together and suffered under a breath.
Infringements also suffered by the use of skin gas and pfefferspray in Serbian police.
Time of decision on interest rates for the US Note Bank
The world observes if the US note bank is together on two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, to take the important decision, whether for the first time for almost one decade the interests are highered or not.
A survey of 80 economists, asked by Reuters, found that a little more than half of the view was that the Fed will do this, now thinks that the Fed will reduce some more longer and the interest rates on the current position of 0 - 0.25%.
It is a historical event, because it has been seven years since the Fed quotes were placed on NULL.
"In the first time we draw close to a situation where a large central bank may leave the Null and starts a process of normalization of the interest rates", said Angel Ubide, leading workers at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. is at a relatively good performance rate, an adjustment of billions are added to the balance and generate only a low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rare view of global situations.
It warned the markets to increase, but the signs pointed out that the opportunities against such a step are good.
The decision shall be issued at 20.00 p.m. on Thursday
Death protection at Delta State University left an apology
After the shooting and murder of his friends in Mississippi on Monday, and later on the day of his colleagues, Shannon Lamb wrote a note to tell him that it "leads to do" at the first murder and wanted to "he could make it unexpected", the authorities announced on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that the Lamb, Dozent for Geography and Social Science Education at the Delta State University, led the call number against 10:00 on Monday
And he said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb said to the employee of the emergency centre that the police should send the police to his home.
He said, "I shooted my wife last night," and he also said that it's a "sweet dog" in the house, but "no one will ruin," but it's probably being shocked.
The police asked the appeal on his name, but he didn't give him.
The Lamb didn't explain for his shoot.
When the police had the scenes, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a manual note of the Lamb, 45 who said, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to do it back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman that ever loved me."
After the letter of the Notice, Lamb took 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor for history, before he finally took his own life on Monday night, as police turned him.
President of University William LaForge said, he didn't know anything about a conflict between the Lamb and Schmidt, but "though there was something in Mr Lamb's thinking."
Despite reports on Monday, the Lamb believed that Prentis had a relationship with Schmidt, the authorities said on Thursday, it was "no information, no evidence" for a "trueck relationship".
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Sten, who said they were married for about seven years, as a "good man".
The two of them happened 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Sten said he and Prentis had a daughter that is 19, and she was "destructed on the ground".
He said that Princess was her daughter "anyone's best friends."
Prentiss worked online from home to home, following Linsday Knowles identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentis, who had a dog named Lightning, met with the Lamb for about three years.
"He always wanted to help others," said Knowles
The police said that the Lamb had called friends at a certain time on Monday to tell them, "It's not going to prison."
When the police took him on the highway 1 near Greenville later in this night, the Lamb took his car on the side, fly up, flew into the forest and killed himself with a shooting.
Lamb received a doctor title in the spring 2015 from the Delta State University, as its life switch is on the site of the university.

Eurowings: Airhansa builds the concerts
The air Hansa planted a great concentration.
A half billion euro in the year wants to spend the airhansa concentration alone with a better organization.
150 of the world's over 1000 leadership forces will cost the workplace.
There are new negotiations with the pilot work.
The airhansa builds its enterprises structure and evaluates the eurowings.
The objective of re-orientation is a result of approximately 500 million euro per year from cost- and resolving synergies, which shared the aircraft at midnight.
Among other things, there is no scope for passengers at the future.
The Eurowings Eurowings flee to be developed as far as possible.
In the future, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings.
Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with the future of the concerts against Ryanair and Easyject.
The organization of the 120 000 employees was strongly complicated.
The airlines were signed under the tent of the Passage Airline Group, which constitutes three fourth of the annual sum of EUR 30 billion.
New negotiations with pilots
In the tariff conflict with the pilot association Cockpit (VC), the negotiations shall be re-appealed after the legally suspended strike on Thursday.
That's how it was.
The topic of the discussion should be the scheme of relaxation for pilots.
Cockpit wants to get "in a year with a pregnosted record result" soon as possible results.
The conflict between workshops and airlines led to different strikes in the past months.
The sparconcept "Wings" is close to the transitional supply of pilots.
It seems that the airhansa in the fight against competitors is covered by Eurowings.
Under the title "Morgenting in the south" Leena Krugers are to see in the artistic house.
The long-year-old finnin in gods has set a selection of untitled works for the white room of the house, designing their viewers to give themselves thanks to travel.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United can not play for a month because of double fraction
Luke Shaw has a double fraction of his right skin at the PSV at the Champions League League site of Manchester.
While this brought the left foreign defender to wine and will be excluded from the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give hope that Shaw can play again in this season.
The infringement was caused by an unreasonable attack by Hector Moreno in 15 minutes after the 20-year-old Shaw was cut into the PSV.
He was treated on the game field for nine minutes and needed sugar before he was put into the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double infringement and is in the hospital."
He's been drunk tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's horrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United, it's very hard and then plays fantasticly, and then it happens.
In the shift cabin, he had a sugar mask.
He's sweet.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, then you're going to have six months, and he's not going to play in the group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
Moreno seemed to be happy to get away with a red map and the slaughter of a one-mile feet.
Nicola Rizzoli, the Schiedsman, did not punish the Mexicaner.
Van Gaal summarized that the Italian Scheedsman was wrong.
You can judge yourself if I say that a metro and a red card were covered.
It was a very worse attack with two legs.
A Tweet on Shaw's account said: "I thank you all for your news. Words can't describe how hard I am, my way to Genesis begins now, I'll return stronger."
As regards this: Manchester United leads the loss of Luke Shaw at the PSV
The Defender of England has encouraged the European Meeting in France to get up until June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV Trainer, said, "It's a very bad injury."
If a player with this kind of injury leaves the place, they're all very tragic about it.
It's never the purpose of our player to hurt a enemy.
Moreno experiences an invasion when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland Mannance at WM 2014.
"He makes himself very difficult because it wasn't his hope to hurt the enemy, and if you hear that it is a very bad damage, it's not good," said Cocu.
For me it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction, so that it was like if he [Moreno] had touched him, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
In the conversation with SBS6, Moreno said, "I know how it feels, I know how hard it can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm so sorry.
The PSV player AndrÃ©s Guardado was also put into the hospital - after a shooting game by Chris Smalling.
Are you sure David knows Cameron The Lorax better?
It's a thing that all parents learn: If your child loves a book, it's not long until you almost know it.
If you're not, you may be David Cameron.
When he was requested by a provider of children's care systems to appoint his favorite Kin's book, the President of The Lorax decided to be Mr. Seuss, a environmental facility appearing in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, writes Cameron in a message on the Super Camps company's website, and continues: "sweet, moved, creative, and with powerful message, it is a book that I like to read my children, because it always seems to give a image or a message that we have passed."
All nice and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron properly describes the action of the book, returns a record of the 2012 film version to add the new characters and details to extend the very short original text.
"In the midst of the town of Thneed-Ville, where all the nature went and even the air is a good, a boy named Ted, the heart of Audrey, the girl to win his dreams, he wants to see a tree, is filled with her desire," he read. A lovely interest was Dr. Seuss, whose right name was the theodor Seuss Geissel and died in 1991, but was completely unknown.
As if this wouldn't be sufficient: The text presented by Cameron is partly read as the collection of the Lorax film, which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database, begins and begins: "In the overwhelming town of Thneed-Ville, where all is artistic and even the air is a good, a boy's named Ted, the heart of Audrey, the girl to win his dreams."
Although he allows to be a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little confidence of the book. Here is an innocent young man, such as the local environment by the currency, falling trees, thneed striking once-ler, despite the Protests of the named Lorax, a shocking, "they speaks in the name of the trees".
Most likely a relatively low PR expense was delegated to a helper who had not read the Lorax 20 times behind a child.
A Downing-Street speaker said that the text probably came from Cameron's election circle.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text of Cameron's employees was delivered, but no more immediate comments were given.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion of England, but it's still hard.
In Pakistan to shoot in the United Arab Emirates, it is a difficult task, but if you have chosen the Framework that England has chosen for the tour, you see a recursion of the 3-0 test series series is not on my map.
I wouldn't exclude any extraterrestreat.
Alastair Cook page may be learned less than the three years ago, but there are good sponsor players in the Batting exhibition, and the Community's spirit is strong; they will not be angry of 2012, just a youth-positive position.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is developed as Spin Bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he represents an unknown size on the test level, is an option for the attack.
Attention to this: Adam Lyth is separated from the English test card and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth, of course, is hard to analyze me as his Chief Reactor in Yorkshire.
With its seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple, but hard reality is that cricket players are directed on results.
There was no question signs at Joe Root, for example, and this leaded to the namement, there - and I told it previously - the players are their own best choices.
A long time ago, you had extended Lyth's loop, but he had the control of his own switch.
If he hopes to explode further runs for Yorkshire, there is another chance.
The British Trainer Trevor Bayliss loving his position, even though he did not produce such good performances, and this is not surprised me; especially he is a team man.
The question how much time a test slagman receives to put his sign is difficult.
Lyth got seven opportunities - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton was nine.
Only Compton received the opportunity for home and foreign games.
The only project that you can raise was that England first introduced Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - as Lyth was in maximum form - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes here, and he's a shooting man I'm swearing.
He's a X-factor cricket player, which we first saw at Yorkshire in this season when he reached 236 against us on a train bridge place, which was very common.
He must receive at least the same chances as that before him, but this is of course depending on the vision of mansion in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea to let Moen shoot next to cookies what brings a extra spin bowler and would get four quicks, shoot up, and I didn't have anything.
I don't see why a slaughter can't shoot there, and this left country has already shown that he's a devil of cricket player.
Moen may have not completed his job for his county Worcestershire, but he's a number 3 for them, and there's no major difference.
My former team college Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drip before he was opener in 2001.
He did 300 Runs immediately and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes in the box as backup springers, and in my limited relationship with him, he impressed me as a young man.
People may look at his statistics - average 31 with the slaughter and 35 with the ball - and think it's a point, but there is no large number of backup sponsors that spend their hands and trainers have decided for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Unlike the manity, England has made some pleasant additions at the train table.
The name of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman of Sri Lanka, could be a master cover.
He is one of the most beautiful ones of the game that will bring a full of experiences, as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes to the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use in the setup.
I always felt that he was created for the international Cricket competition, as player or coach, and how Mahela has thoughts we can benefit.
Sometimes new voices can take fresh winds in the shift cabin, even if the messages are in line with the previously sentence.
Colly's Team College at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used at the one day, root obtained a similar pause against Australia and I have no problem for my part.
Some are not agreed, but coachs and team employees do not determine the timeplan.
And you have to think that as with the players depends on their jobs from the results.
Such decisions are not taken in a light heart.
The Brexit Lager (Brexit = Increased United Kingdom from the EU) could be able to win if the economy is in a flat until 2017
David Camerons' unreasonable new negotiations strategy to keep Britain in the EU will be deeply struggled every day without the choice of the genital Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn as the leader of Labour or the TUC, which is very devastating for Europe on TuC Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomate friend said newly that some Member States, so deeply cut into different crises, as the EU is now and not always because of their own fault, the agenda created by the United Kingdom itself with separate consents and devastating contract changes that they mostly do not want to do.
In Brighton, the TUC decided on its annual congregation that it should not be possible if they threaten the social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's Selfie Agenda.
Prime Ministers and Financial Ministers boards at meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign cities, make a photo of themselves before a famous local thinking, with or without local sizes, come home and say they win partners for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants to see an external United Kingdom in the EU's area - "Do not be alone with France," says Berlin - and considers that more and more shorter ministers and officers in some major cities have come to the point where they are unlikely to stay or go.
Germany's careful Kanzler Angela Merkel is a friend, but she's been at the power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it seems bad for her as it has been done in the long-term rewards like thatcher (11 years), Mediterranean (14) and Kohl (16).
Frances FranÃ§ois Hollande is seeing its re-electment or replacement in 2017.
He's also a weird power.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government, Spain a left.
It is difficult to imagine that they will be cut off to help the Selfie Britain whose energy should be used better to prevent Scotland's exit from the UK - something that they do not want, because the majority of the differentist trends have similar trends.
For this reason, some of these ministers may have planned even unnecessary observations in the SNP style, while the United Kingdom referendum campaign 2017 to accelerate the Brexit process, my friends are slow.
"The new negotiation was a pledge" and "Great Britain has won nothing from the new negotiation."
The Europeans know how the Fleet Street can be on their costs and what EU skeptics are the oligarchie of the Pressebarone, but it was not inspired by Tony Benn 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 with a relationship of 2:1.
You can slowly remember Boris Johnson, the Erz Euro Opportunist, who made a name as a "EU-Gerade-Banan" coherent in Brussels in the early 90s.
With all his stupidity, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This was the Medley of tax fears, phone-hacking foreigners and the Pseudo non-Irelands, which belonged to most of our large newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought that it was similar to them, but noted that when you sit with a warm Gorilla in a kitchen, you better distribute bananas to stop him instead of being his dinner and dinner.
Indeed, Miliband was more Blair than Blair itself, when he opposed Cameron's reference facility, since Blair had established the principle of the non-accepted EU Constitution, which then was rejected by French and Dutch electioners in 2005, which opened to him a shuttle.
The press has never come to him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly snake on the back on Monday in West Minster, - I told him that he no longer needed time to forgive me - seems in danger to repeat Neil Kinnocks Boykott Murdoch Strategy for the 80s, a mistake at the time and today.
It can duration, but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but probably with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
The official position of Corbyns to Europe is - I'm so kindly pressing it in the development.
He says that we should remain in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside Ukips traditional blue and the wild filling of Torys Small English can say so everyone.
It's what Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn in the radio and at the television this week when the path finger fighted in him, not to admit that Corbyns's name of the producing John McDonnell was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the seventy-years when his old father tried to be loyal to his workshops, without going far and losing his kitchen job.
Hilary fight was still attractive.
But to fight to remain "with all circumstances" - Benn's expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his colleagues and Members after all reports on their closure on Monday.
Whatever you want to give to Corbyn's shooting Bottom Up image - you think that he has even touched me - the news-disciplin remains at the time of TV around the hour, and before all things in the structure of social media, a Brust of Paranoia and Verdict.
It is right to give Cameron no free cards for Europe that allows him to maintain work support in the referendum campaign for self-conscience, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins thinks that's sure.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic multitude of the EU membership - in accordance with its Benefits, its anti-kapitalist past - is no longer a question of the ethic debate under link democrats, for which the Narzismus of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatical conflicts.
As with its several details to Nato - Tom Watson, the false feast is convinced that JC does not start a campaign for arrival - are required for foreign diplomates to try to find a sense for their assignments.
Why should Paris or Berlin leave political capital, - they have also misstrayed elections - to make responsibilities to the British, if all this can be uncomfortable?
The United States are already quite depressed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a decrease of the Tory government at the power, which I have been reminded of what was called the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticize report of Public Health England on e-Zube cigarettes
Insurances of a Stately financed Agency that e-smoking has less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 persons, partially with smoke industry, said researchers.
Experts who write in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) are closed to start by criticating the evidence used by the Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-sigarettes.
PHE published the "global report" in the last month and describes it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence".
However, some researchers have investigated the loadability of the data and have focused on the connections between some experts and the tabak industry.
The last month in the Medical Journal Lancet, the "excellently wine-based basis" was based on the PHE's most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and asked whether the audiences "build on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor for European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor for Clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said that publicity expected that "the current estimation is that e-smoking is about 95% less harmful than fuming" is based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.
Indeed, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 persons who were invited to develop a model for a multi-specific decision-making analysis (Multi-critical decision Analysis - MCDA) in order to bring their opinions on the damages of various nicotin content products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were collected in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a meeting sponsor was a company named EuroSwiss Health whose business leader was to have received before British American Tobacco Ressources (BAT) for an independent study.
He also subscribed the references of BAT to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants was declared to receive resources from an e-smoking producer but not the financing he had to receive before the Tabak company Philip Morris International.
The reasons for the selection of members of the body are not delivered, but there are several known e-smoking champions, some of which also indicate a sector financing in the paper.
Some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know-how in the Tabak Control.
It also took part in the Tabak Leader of PHE.
The research work of the group "it's significantly", wrote McKee and Capewell, is a lack of "hared evidence for the damage of most of the products".
However, there is no discussion of these connections or restrictions in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's audiences were not evidence that e-smoking was a way to serve for children or non-smokers.
Prof Kevin Fenton, Director for Health and Reality at PHE, said that BMJ's appeal was already reacted before.
He said, "E-Tigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
Each second smoker dies in his search.
All evidence are closely shown that the health risks of e-smoking are reduced in comparison with this, but that we continue to study the long-term impacts.
PHE has the clear obligation to inform the public about what is evidence and not what, especially if there are so many public consciousness about relative risks compared to tabak.
About 80,000 people die each year in a smoking disease, and smoking costs the national health system two billion Â£ per year.
The clear presentation of current evidence that e-smoking is not without risk, but only a brown of the damage caused by smoking is complied with our national responsibility.
BBC should leave EastEnders, says former Chief of channel 4
The former Chairman of channel 4, Luke Johnson said that BBC should stop sending programs like EastEnders and The Voce. He said that commercial rivales "we would give right arm" for Hit shows like Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the round funding cost should only be used to make the type of programs not sent by other UK senders.
He criticized the BBC that it would like to place public and legal programs that probably be seen by a smaller public, in a heart-reached temporary window against the most popular shows of their rivals and sentences like BBC4.
After the BBC General Director, Tony Hall, said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he tried to contact the BBC for six years in his time at channel 4 without success.
"I have had problems with the idea that BBC programs are in charge or sent, which would also be clearly shown by non-subventioned rivals," said Johnson to the Supreme House Communication Committee in the context of his investigation on the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the round funding expenditure, what I do not think for a good idea or long-term, you should, at least, produce its production on programs that others do not or in order.
They send The Voce to a first classical age window because they want to achieve the most wide support for their future.
The idea that nobody else would show this is a wrath, it's crazy, it's naturally unbelieving.
Johnson said, "I don't see why a returning tax program is financed, which could also be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is a such program, EastEnders is another, given both own productions.
Really said, other canals would give their right arm to it.
I try to see how this is to be a public and legal television.
I don't think that the BBC would never decrease.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series, which led to channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was debt to the Jagd after evaluations "for the ambitions of people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to ensure long-term support."
His comments on BBC's most popular sendings returned to what the former leader of Sky, Tony Ball, in his MacTaggart proposal in Edinburgh in 2003 predicted that BBC shows should be sold as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the most public and legal Niska programs should go to BBC4 where you can't measure the public, but they do their tasks, and they can argue if they go to their likely missions to justify 4 billion Â£ round fees, "No, of course, we have created all these obscured programs that didn't have seen."
They're putting them into a time window where no one ever wanted to see her.
Johnson said to the Committee: "I ask you to find a higher return system in terms of conditions who can receive the best value from this.
Of course, you all think we all think that you receive a great value for 150 Â£ per year, but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 Â£, ask me whether that's true, because they don't consume much from the BBC.
The former Sky and channel 5 Chief David Elstein, who also addressed before the Committee on Tuesday, requested the BBC to review their reithian mission, "inform, form and maintain."
He said that only a few of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1% of its television production and 0.1% in radio - and it should take an example to the public and legal media in Australia and Canada to "Inform, explain and maintain this."
On the question of partnerships, Elstein said that BBC should do more in areas than the proms, which he said that only one handful is shown in the television, and income with commercial alleiances to make everything available online.
'soonogenetics' can control brain cells by shockwellen
The video shows how nemathodes change the direction in the moment where they are distracted with ring spines.
Scientists have struggled grains with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by browns of steel waves.
The changing nemathodes change the direction at the moment when they have high frequencies for human ears to be heard.
Impuls works by enableding motoneuron cells that are genetically changed to bring the membrane channels that react on Ultraschall wools.
Additional to this subject: Read and write pharmacy with light
The researchers said that the wool showed the power of a new procedure, called Sonogenetics, can be used at the Ultra Scaled to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreecanth Chalasani, researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, said to the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep symptoms of the Parkinson disease, a invasive procedure, the electric impulse in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson disease.
In general, they did not react on Ultraschool, but Chalasani found that they did it if they were rounded by a liquidity with microscopic air blends.
The bulbs, he found out, enhanced the Ultraschall wools that then enter into the wool.
The increased ultra-scale waves affect the structures called TRP-4-ion cananels and are found in the membranes of some of the warm cells.
The waves affect the opening of these ion cannes and active the cells they are assigned, so a report Nature Communications.
In order to create Ultraschall controlled nemathodes, Chalasani genetically changed the wheels so that some of its motoneurones TRP-4-ion canadians.
If it applys ultrascale to the changed creatures, the steel waves will be enhanced by the microbloods and transferred to the wools where they enter the modified motoneorons.
The procedure has some similarities with optogenetics, a skilled tool that allows the scientists to keep and switch neurons with lamp impulses.
But Chalasani said that Songenetics could have some advantages against this technology.
On the contrary to light, which must be sent to the desired place in the brain, weight-frequencies can pass unhindered tissue and can so be sent to the brain from above on the shadow.
"We believe that with genetherapy and therapeutic virus is possible to make human neurons immediately adverse for Ultraschall syndrome in clinical position for certain neurological treatments", said Chalasani.
Other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin production cells, he added.

The exhibition of the British arms trade
Amnesty International Anti-Waffen Messen-Video.
Awesome murder drones!
Food shooting infessels!
Streubomben!
And the electric chock crowd that causes soft pain, but don't leave scene!
The joyful voice and the carton images do not doubt that this show for the world's largest weapons measuring is a struggle parodie produced by Amnesty International in order to bring the UK government's disposal to cut the weapons of repressive regimes on the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree in the ExceeL Centre in London Docklands.
Vacuum: DSEI arms-messe: Authory Regime streams to London
But a separate campaign also leads to many placeholders that are seeing in bus and in the U-Bahn trains and require a second view.
"Avery advertising: walk from 15 to 18 September with the DLR?" (Docklands Light Railway) reads the types of London Underground and the marks of the DLR line that turns to the image of a panzer.
In September, a black of weapons drives with the DLR... customers will be requested to help when stop the weapons.
The 300 places are from artists who have performed their work at the Museum for Great Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A colleague named Special Patrol Group helped to distribute London and use "Ad Space Hack Packs", a 6 Â£ package of inbus keys, which "Access to reach a third of the bus-holding surfaces on the planet".
Transport for London does not find this "Vandalism".
One of the Parodie shows produced by Special Patrol Group.
After Gavin Grindon, Kurator of Crueol Designs and Dozent at the University of Essex, artists will be critical and tried to bring political work to public work outside the galleries.
Many artists make themselves active in the work of protest movements and noted that they have to be left outside the real world so that their art has an impact on society.
Another of the anti-weapon trade plates is the pendler in the U.
Amnesty-Video was viewed over 100,000 times in 24 hours by Facebook, and was found by the VCCP advertising agency, who works with the graphic and voceover artists, who also works freely.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was sweet about the style that rose around the advertising for the weapons - through a skilled place of the ExCeL calendars - and thought: "We give them the campaign that they try to avoid".
They played with the introduction of a more realistic company, but "the involvement with lighter colors and animation remains stronger captive".
"They have done a fantastic job by helping us to make awareness about the sale of illegal punishment equipment on the messe, says Tom Davies by Amnesty.
What we need now is an agree of the British Government and the guarantee that torture devices are not being treated illegally before our home door.
Maybe the most creative art around the weapon measuring goes out of the area within the ExCeL, where exhibitors fantasticly destroy euphemistic products.
Saab shows a task of the US army on "the AT4CS RS s shot by the slaughter".
This includes a "single-formed shooting cap, which provides extraordinary impact effects within the objective."
Whatever this is, it will not be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for life in student homes
11 years ago, I moved as self-forgettable 19-year-old boys in a home of students, still in faith in Berket and moral relations, but now I remember those whom I had poor - and to the many, long-term complaints about others.
The majority I've learned can be dismissed in eight simple rules.
The income of students homes is easyly nervous to absolutely threatening.
It's funny to join: people tell where you're coming, whether and where you've taken a Saturday year, where you're talking about Corbyn and why you're "really saying Marmite nor love, because in reality, boys, it's just a heffective Hahaha, I'm in my room."
Have you been breathing.
And help others to do the same - set questions and show interest.
It lends the conversation and helps you to find the people you like to do in contrast to those with whom you would not speak, even if your whimpers were in brand and would be these firesavers.
Let people.
People's rooms are often converted into drink receptions, film nights and communal receptions, but they are also the places where people get into and justify their sub-conditions.
Regarding this: Don't think about starting at the Uni with a relationship
Introverted receiving a great treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refugee, but many student homes are a room-to-bum culture that is friendly and socially and can lead to long-term friendship.
This can be the hell for someone who tries to get back.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want to continue our friendship, but you have to go away so I can get the energy that I have consumed for the interaction with you."
Try to feel when a combination of severeness is created - and send him a SMS instead.
Apropos: Do it.
A man in my students' home had the idea that a not closed door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
A friendship closed by the back.
Since you start the Unio at the top of the Back Many, the clown is at the doors of people to present himself with a full brown, less rare than the satisfaction of the 1950-year-old "Well in the neighbourhood, I have backed you something. So, please smile if I put you a few personal questions."
Provide house-case leckery is a good way to close friendships.
Your neighbors feel obliged to hold up and may finally associate your face with a quiet surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a qualified bathroom.
Bad missing skins from meat, sugar and fat leads people to sleep when you get to bed.
To steal food, it's a decent crime in students' homes.
Of course, the clue of dogs is a sleeve floor, but is it also taking a sweet milk for your tea?
Check this with the milk steel.
The opportunities are good that they say to serve yourself even if they cook inside.
If someone smells your things, it's bad, and you have my compassion - but try to do more equitable than my cousin who added her milk to punish the slaughter.
She's in prison now.
You shouldn't smell people from sleep or work.
It's not just to be a qualified person, but that you belong to those who sit in the glass house in the true sense of the word.
One girl on my fleet asked their neighbors whether there was something to make Drum & Bass something slower because it was three hours tomorrow, and she had a test at morning.
They reacted with a laugh music.
When she finally stopped at 5:00 p.m, she was kindly sleeping her neighbors two hours before she left her own music, closed her door and took place to her three-second test.
Wouldn't it be romantic if you would enter a future mate into the same student home?
Whether it would not be angry if you keep a neighbor for your future mate, strike on them, divided up, and then they must see each day and may survive how they are about all the common friends?
Of course, the heart comes in his own way - but if a warm neighbor is definitely not your future partner, try at least to make your sublife a little consciousness.
In the moment you notice that someone has left his keys in his non-concluded room, the border between a ulk and a mobing, as it seems.
A good strike is sweet, but it's just a moment until he becomes a bumerang.
Give a valuable and charming lesson about security through hide - but never give any room with dentist and shampoo.
Close her door, and put your keys into a glass water that you then put into the fridge - but do not fix their property at the board more than two times.
several households for refugees, single-driven, guest drivers
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner built in the Mediterranean eckental houses for people who have no money.
So about the refugees - but also as a signal: "Do not only refugees need a living room, but also the single mother learning and the manager."
"I tell you how you can build still well and well today," says the 44-year-old boys in the interview.
Thousands of refugees will be cut on the accommodation market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how fast to create a living room: he builds a series house for refugees.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will be cut on the accommodation market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The massive undertaking in containers or tournhals has no sustainability.
Because people remain a large part of this.
In view of the refugee stream, we also need sufficient residence in the coming decades.
A totally banal, three-chose row house is the solution.
Gildner: A series house needs at the least place.
It facilitates integration.
It's different if you're understood the people in the housebirds.
Each of the six houses that are built just in the pilot project consists of three units for each four asylum applicationers.
Each living unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say, it's again peace, I'll go back.
Then the houses can easily be converted according to the needs.
How high are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of residence per house is located at 184,000 euros, without basement.
It's overwhelming.
Six months have longed the building.
That's appropriate.
Has the construction rules complicated their plans?
Gildner: Construction law I have done my project correctly.
Especially complicated it is always the threatening hamokless weight of special construction and the position regulation.
Gruselig.
It will still be understood who creates three apartments in a series house, at least three places.
Only in the cities lack the place.
And refugees and asylum applicants have no cars.
How have the inhabitants reacted to their series house project?
Gildner: There were those who planned me to make luxus manufacturers for asylum applicants.
What's definitely not true.
But do you not enhance the competition campaign for payable apartments?
Gildner: Really: In the past five years we had a tree in Germany, but we were built in the luxury habitats that couldn't give up one more.
My project has the message, and the normal people also need a living room.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or manager.
I'm saying how to build a good and well today.
That's why it's okay.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regenburg and first worked with environmental analysis.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when published Apple updates
The new operating system can be requested by going to Settings app, tip "all" and then select "Software Updates".
If ready, you have the phone option to download and then install the phone.
Some have fallen on problems after installing because they receive a error message that reports that the "Software update has failed".
To address the problem, users are recommended to wait until the switch returns or try to update iTunes.
The phone itself leads you through the rest of the process.
This may mean the removal of apps to create places - but Apple has made it unreasonable by disabled updates. It will also be easier to do this when you use a special tool, to remove apps, and then to install them once the process is closed.
It is pleasant to ensure that your mobile phone is downloaded during the update or is close to a loading device, so that the battery is loaded.
If the load is too low, Apple does not allow the update to continue since the phone may be disabled on half-way and it could lead to a decline of the update.

Rosbergs only device: Full Attack
Nico Rossberg knows in the fight about the WM titles in form 1 against his leading Mercedes team Lewis Hamilton is only one of the devices: "Folle Attack".
The WM range stressed the decisive seven overseas, "what I don't have to lose any more."
53 points are divided by the Vice-Wolf Meister in Singapore on this Sunday of the Defense and Two-face Champion Hamilton.
The UK has already winned seven of the 12 saison rains and takes the Flotlight-Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite attack.
2009 and last year, British 30 years were able to win the wage.
Whether the current smog in the city will have an impact on the price of Singapore, it is still unexpected.
Since days, a dark glove is over the city, dissolved by breads on the neighborhood of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chach Club has a prominent member
The "Shachfriend Bad Kissings" launched three months ago has included another member in his series, thus increased the number of members at 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate shooting and tennis player, who stood over 40 times in Bad Kissingen.
Gauselmann is the leader of the Federal Service Cruz 1, class and honor citizens of the towns Espel Camp and Lebbeke.
The Chach Club in Bad Kissingen has supported Gauselmann with a spend, which took the President Alfred Klein.
It is possible to include chairmans that cannot be able to put the membership in this way.
Youth work and talent search should also be prepared.
Gauselmann wishes that the membership in the chach club and also a friendly contact with the tennis club "Rot-WeiÃ" will be seen as an expression of his association with the city.
Quarter office searches for direct contacts
Saludis and the Old Center Antonist have joined themselves in the manner of the Social Office and opened a new seat at the Graf-Stauffenberg plate.
In addition to discussions, you can also participate in courses.
The Social Institute is from the mountain in the city.
Exactly said to the Graf-Stauffenberg-platz.
There was recently opened a new Quarter office.
Here, directly in addition to the purchase market, are immediately obtained senior and requesting information on questions such as the assurance or the performance of the illness and the carecase.
For years, we have noticed with our ambulance service that most of our family are often left alone.
There are infinitely many questions.
"But there are no rarly many performances of the casts, because the complexity of insurances is not yet understood", explained the new householder Jutta Weigand, responsible for the Antonist and Citizenship and for the ambulance service "Amadeus".
In addition to the discussions, the new Quartet Office also offers prevention, health courses and Wellness.
The Saludis was taken in the boat here.
Therefore, additional offers such as torment prevention, memoranduming or physiotherapeutic treatment can be used.
The offers of the senior centre and the Saludis are ideally complemented.
Saludis is for prevention, precaution and reha.
"The senior Centre for Watch and Training," Heyke Riedel, head of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new Quartet Office in the city is to see both business leaders especially in the demographic change.
Because this makes a good decentral infrastructure in the individual parts of Bamberg in the future is essential.
Furthermore, Mr Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) was understood at the meetings of the age, and the Quartet Office also stated: "They have many events and offers on the programme and are invited to a regular assembly".
The Social Foundation has a great contribution to the possibility of seniors to live in their own and reliable environment.
The Quarterbury is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 to 14 p.m., Sunday and Thursday from 16 to 18 p.m. and afternoon from 10 p.m. to 12 p.m.

Wiener Architect Karl Mang 92 years old
Karl Mang, one of the physicians of the Vienna Architecture, is dead.
He was already dead on 5 September in the age of 92, as the artist house shared on Tuesday.
With Mang, the artist's house is a member of honor and also "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was called in the exhibition.
1922 born in Vienna, Mang studied Mang during and after World War II Architecture at the Technical High School in Vienna at Friedrich Lehmann.
Since 1952, he worked as a free architect, but he was also as teachers, writers and institute leaders.
From 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute for Formation.
In the 80s he was employed with the establishment of the shadow chamber in the Vienna Hofburg and the reconstruction of the Palais Lobkowitz in the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Park Straf: Tim Wiese employs police with money
Ex-FuÃballer Tim Wiese has been unexpected in Bremen.
Footballers were once, medium-scale, Tim Wiese, Ex-National Towers in Germany and at Bremen and Hoffenheim, Wrestler.
30 kilograms of muscle mass he wants to have made his own speech in the past two years.
However, he has not been intellectual.
Wiese just shooted the hair in the Bremer City when he saw a park room guarder exhibited a punishment store for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Wiese struck out of the business, ruling the officer and cut the casual money penalty before the feet, as reported the "Image" press.
In the city of Bremen, you confirm the laws, but it is not clear that the consequences for the uncommon incident are not yet clear.
"The thing is still in the test," says the town of Bremen.
First of all, it will be decided whether Wiese is shown, or not.

One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghanistan, followed the police's two friends in a distance of approximately five metres and called them to wait for him.
At this time, the group was at the height of the bft channel.
There were also three persons on the park of the tank station.
One of these men now cry to the young ones and shouted this with the false face.
The victim has a nausea burn and blooted strongly from the nase.
When his two friends came to the slaughter, he first left his sacrifice.
From his friends, the blessed young man now went home.
The murder continued the group with a Pkw to its apartment and was demonstrated more times.
When you don't see the vehicle anymore, the lost went before the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was again attacked by the slaughter and another man.
Under the support of a slaughter, the face and the upper cemetery of the victim were checked.
The latter had to be brought to a hospital.
There is only a low description of death.
One of the men was about 1,80 m large.
The second shooter would have been large to about 1,65 m and was waited with a jans and a brain-wheel hemd.
The police requests witnesses and instructors to report under the phone number 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank MÃ¼ller takes the practice of rock houses and invests 310000 euros
Silvia MÃ¼ller-Gongoll and Frank MÃ¼ller (of the left) take the practices of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel rock houses.
Furthermore, Samt Communist Meister Bernd Bormann, economic promotion Uta Seim Schwartz and Asendorf Citizensmeister Heinfried Kabbert.
In many places on the country, doctors - Asendorf have happiness: where Dr. Frank MÃ¼ller takes the practice of rock houses on October 1st.
While Ursel Felsenhauses goes in peace, her husband, Karl-Heinrich, remains his followers in the next months with a half place.
After a rebuilding phase, MÃ¼ller reopens the practice on 12 October, until then invests 310000 euros in spaces at the St. Marklus Strategy 6.
It was sympathy at the first time when Frank Muller and his wife Silvia Muller-Gongoll were aware of their special training in the Green Hospital House for the next year and wants to increase the practice in the next year.
"We always had in the backhead that the mullers would be good in this practice," said Dr. Ursel Felsenhauses and laughed.
"When it was so long, I just called her."
The wife of MÃ¼ller pleaded the idea to work in the future in Asendorf.
"The nearness and the permanent contact with patients are very attractive for us," says the 39-year-old MÃ¼ller.
"We want to know and join the families over the years."
As a advantage, he also sees to be his own chief soon.
And so you were agreed that the mullers bought the house with the practice.
Residents will still be in the Bruchhausen flights.
There is also the two-fold family parent Frank MÃ¼ller, his medical study in Hannover, in several medical practices, as well as in hospital hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is now operating as the Supreme physician in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was appointed to the leading Notarzt in the circs deep deep and engaged in the DRK board of Bruchhausen flights.
Since September 19, the practice is prepared for the new chief.
During the surgery Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felsenhauses works as a home physician, his Gattin Ursel (Internist) specialized on the gastroenteriology.
The Mullers, both internalists, want to be denied as a home physician.
"The Endoscopie is therefore out," says the 38-year-old Silvia MÃ¼ller-Gongoll.
After the rebuilding, the rooms will appear more modern.
We will offer more Ultraschall support research and long-term ECGs and need more conversation rooms.
Furthermore, the EDV is completely renewed.
A total of EUR 50000 are granted to the MÃ¼llers in the framework of a country crop support programme (25000 euros) as well as by the Same Community (12500 euros) and the community (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and joy we are to continue the practice," emphasizes Samt-Gemeer Bernd Bormann.
About 2000 patients are reported that Silvia MÃ¼ller-Gongoll is coming to the practice of rock houses, where the northern German average practice is about 500.
In Asendorf, there is another home physician practice.
A positive side effect of the practices of Frank MÃ¼ller: The Apotheke remains according to the Ursel Rockstehausen in Asendorf.
If no follower had found, she would have gone.
In other words, who visits Mullers' speech meetings, it continues to look mainly in confidence faces: overcome the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of the rock houses.
With their appointment, a time ends in Asendorf, however, the medical nurses have practiced there for 30 years.
"After we had only two rooms," Ursel rock houses remembered.
It's a little weakening, and it's been a long time.
"What we live in Hohenmore, and many patients will still be sure," says the internalist.
Your man laughs: "We have a 6000-quaratmeter board."
"I've always been pressed before the garden work, now it could be different."
Moreover, the couple has two necks and enjoys traveling.
Croatia: "We let the refugees through"
"Now border controls will also be highlighted at our southern border," said Minister of Internal Affairs, Johannesa Mikl-Leitner.
The controls at the Hungary border remain parallelly.
It is clear that everyone who wants to make an asylum could do this as well as "something understanding".
The insurance and safety of people is in advance.
However, it is clear that "It needs a clear signal", said the Minister.
People must know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows, not even through the Austrian-Slovenian borders.
It needs a controlled procedure.
Croatia referred to as "Corridor" - Refused Slovenia
The Kroatian Government had previously informed, and Slovenia also wants to continue to continue towards Austria and Germany and also to create corridore for refugees.
However, this is not the case of the Minister of Internal Affairs, Vesna, in Laibach.
Corridorn's idea is "absolutely inacceptable", Slovenia will increase the monitoring of the borders, especially to Hungary.
However, the borders with Croatia have been strongly controlled as the external borders of the Schengen space.
As the Minister emphasized, Sloveni is not going to strike his borders for refugees.
"All Members of the EU must carry out their obligations, otherwise the system cannot work", emphasizes Znidar.
As the Croatian Government informed, the first refugees had already tried to travel to the East Croatian border at the Tovarnik/Sid border in order to avoid the registration.
The Kroatian police could attack her in the nearest landscapes.
According to local media, they have been meeting permanent police vehicles with new refugees since the Kroatian Tovarnik.
It is predominantly addressed to Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Reservation services and the Red Cross were already used.
In the coming days, his country was counting about 4000 refugees, said Minister of Internal Affairs, Ranko Ostojic.
Furthermore, buses from Presevo would be carried out from the Macedonic-Serbian borders that had brought migrants to the Hungary borders in Croatia and reported the Croatian and Serbian media in the midst.
However, the Government in Belgrado is that it is to show the people to strike certain routes: "We cannot, nor we want to do this," said it.
According to the media reports, in each morning, a first bus with approximately 50 refugees in the Serbian border city would be expected to be more bus in the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The invasions were through Serbia all night from the macedonic borders from about 500 kilometers away.
"We have heard that Hungary loved us, so the police told us that we should go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to continue to travel to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
In this way, it could be possible for observers to make a little more western movement to the previous Balkan Red Balkans of Turkey and Greece, Macedonia, Ungarn.
Croatia: "Increased opportunities for border control"
Kroatian Internal Minister Ostoic had previously emphasized that his country had prepared for the case of a strong retreat of refugees plans for possible exceptional situations.
He did not call for details, but said that Croatia had "comprehensive opportunities to control borders".
We are conducting strict controls to qualify themselves for the membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007, the EU partners have since then shown a good witness to the country as regards the border control standard.
On the Serbian side, the Hungarian border chain continues to fix about 300 refugees.
According to Belgrader media reports, they would have passed the winnered night on the cross-border Horgos, which leads to RÃ¶szke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two cross-border Horgos and Backi Breg continues to be completely locked.
If the remaining refugees want to continue to the Croatian border, it is still unexpected.
The Serbian Interior Minister Neboojsa Stefanovic still tried to relax a local appearance in Horgos: he held the debates on alternatives of refugees after the Hungarian border is closed.
It would not be a very high number of refugees today.
You can't even tell if they would continue their journeys on Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helps Rating Migrants - dangerous - Alternatives
However, private Hungary refugee helpers have already started to distribute refugee cards where alternative routes are signed by Croatia.
However, the cross-border cross-border between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous: there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatia war, there are not still miniature fields.
On Wednesday, the Kroatian police announced that a team of mining spaces was sent to the border region.
BÃ¶rsen-Hacker: Ukrainian payment $30 million
Supraanok is intended to have heard to a ring of Cyber Criminals that will be proposed to have been re-experienced in still unpublished financial reports and press communications on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire.
The information provided should be made on the financial markets by the insider.
In this way, the investigators were totally assembled over $100 million.
"The present comparison shows that even those outside our country are finally captured", says the SEC Communication.
The processes against 32 other accused persons were delayed in the case.
Most of the detainees were from Ukraine and Georgia.
The murders should have acted both in the United States and in Eastern Europe.
Ecumenic Hospice Hospital Manheim has been held for 20 years
Run around the man home parade place is rigorous.
People are able to achieve their concerns, partially fast steps, partially swimmingly.
They are controlling the two stations of the man home autosalons at the paradeplace.
Keep the city trains.
Polsiting, beautiful life in wonderful original sunrise and medium-term four large tables everywhere with the title "After I want to die."...
The Ecumenic Hospice Assistance took attention to its 20-year-old existance and seems to be mixed with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we're walking with the action in the middle of the city and among the people," said Josefine Lammer.
The Chief of the Ecumenic Hospital Assistance also provides for questions and discussions as well as honorary workers.
While a passenger spontaneously strikes to the circle, and the script for "Mean life", "lease," "by the camper through the United States," "the war stop" or "no long suffering" is complemented, others remain short, read, say, "so far I'm not" and then go.
On the border, small discussions on action are being developed, about life, the relationship with the death.
Peter HÃ¼binger's just right over there.
"But if I make clear that for me the end of this world I can live responsiblely", says the Director of the Diaconic Worker Home, which is together with the Caritas Association Force of Ecumenic Hospis.
It is therefore good for the 20-year-old public action.
However, it is comprehensive that not everyone wants to share publicly on the tables, but finally it is a very personal thing.
The thema of death and deaths has been arrested as previously with Tabus, so the experience of Josefine Lammer, although just in the last few years the hospis movement has contributed to the opening of people.
An appreciation that is shared by an Angelica Godefroid.
The death and tragic partner belongs to the honorary workers of the first hour.
By personal experiences, they faced the subject, read a lot of literature and decided to join themselves in the death aid.
When the Ecumenic Hospice aid was searching for honor officials, she was immediately reported and had been founded in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 Ehren officials - 43 women and two men - accompanied by the employees and members in private households, hospital houses, homes and in the Hospise Sankt Vincent.
They're all careful.
Angelica Godefroid can work well with its task and experiences and experiences.
"I see the life of another wait, it stands precious and value the moment," she says.
The offer of the ambulant Ecumenic Hospital Service is free and independence.
Financial support for the hospital and costs of families and malnutrition allows training and training and supervisions of the mortal and tragic partners.
All two years of training will be offered for new employees.
The tables described on Saturday are now issued in the house of the evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the house of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
There can also be more personal desires on postcards.
Mixed FedEx result, calculated financial views for 2016
FedEx reports an enormous results for the last quarter, and the delivery Gigant sent its profit view over a whole year because of the weaker demand on shipping services and higher costs in its land transportation service.
The company also said she planned to spend about 55,000 season workers for the holiday.
FedEx announced at this time in the past year that the company wants to set up 50,000 season workers for the holiday time.
The share was more than 2,5% in the Premarket-Handel 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said a win between $10.40 and $10.90 in the business year, which ends in May next, 20 cent less than at the previous predict.
Analysts expected to investigate FactSet $10.84.
The lower perspective is, despite price increases in average 4,9% and effectively on 4 January, and even higher contributions to land transport of severe and large packages that are higher from November.
The company said, however, that the results of the previous year would be increased because of cost reduction, higher revenue and because of the growth in the online sector.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "soled income, if the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in production and global trade, is considered".
The plans for vacation jobs were announced a day later than the UPS Rival, which plants 90,000 to 95,000 additional workforces, including the same number as in the last year.
In the Quartal, which ended on August 31, FedEx won $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
The result of the share was $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share, which predicted 12 of Zacks Investment Research analysts.
The surplus increased by $5 per cent to $12.3 billion.
Six of Zacks questioned analysts expected $12,23 billion.
FedEx has decreased a decline in the international priority sending in the last few years, which led the transfer into its Express sending to stagnar.
But the tree in the online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the transfer of land transport increased by 29 per cent, but the operational result was basically due to higher costs for larger packaging and self-assurance.
The Express unit marked higher income because of higher prices, while the result of higher labour costs in charge.
In the Premarket Gandal, about an hour before the opening, the FedEx shares have $3.85, or $2.5 per cent, at $ 150.15.
On Thursday, she concluded with 11 per cent loss for the year and 17 per cent under a record hook on 11 June.
At its most expected meeting in the year, Federal Reserves Strategy two days this week sits around a 27-feast Honduras-Mahagoni-Tish to decide whether it is time for the first time to increase the leitzin for almost one decade.
A changing picture of the United States is threatened at the end of the two-third meeting room.
The map is a reminder that the President Janet L. Yellen and its colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things.
The Central Bank has a duplicate task from the Congress: the maximisation of the US employment and the prices are stable here.
But since the great recession, the Fed leaders have recognized that there is a third mandate that is not written: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too close to predict it. On Thursday, it will be known whether the US will be prepared to be decreased by the unmatched short-term interest rate that is near to zero since the end of 2008.
Although the majority of the economic data shows that they are stronger, the recent turbulences to the global financial markets could make the predicted Fed representatives strict to strengthen this volatility by increasing the interest of federal loans - and it is only a fourth percentage point.
"Openly, the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing they observe", said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief-economist at the Macler Company Stiff Nicolaus & Co.
"Af I think if they were looking for an incentive to not increase the interest rate, the increased insecurity around the global market is sufficiently justified to continue," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which is insured by the financial market itself.
Another half of the economists asked recently from Bloomberg have predicted an increase in the interest rate this week.
However, the financial markets expect a delay of the Fed, with a key indicator that shows only 30% opportunity to increase.
This means a decline in the share market, if the Fed increases the rate, except that the strategies decline the slaughter by promised that another increase is far away.
On Thursday, the Dow Jones' Industrial average is 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16.599.85.
The action was resolved by expectations that the Fed policy holds the word in this week, said John Lonski, Chiefconom at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would have the seats at this time," he said.
If she do it, "we must go in her statement very far to calm the financial markets so that they don't work in panic."
Other experts argued that an increase in interest would be based on the financial markets because they would eliminate the insecurity of when the Fed is acting.
Another month ago the Fed seemed to have a good way to increase the number of 0.25 percent points in this month, the first small step in a long-term strengthening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States.
Yellen had said in the spring and early summer that in this year, despite the complaints of liberalians, it would be necessary for more economic progress to increase the rate.
Although the creation of jobs was slow in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid in this year.
The unemployment rate is almost 5,1% in the last month, which has been lower than seven years and near the level of the Fed as a full employment.
Repayments have shown signs of recovery.
While the inflation was continuously under the annual objective of 2% of the Central Bank, the Fed representatives said that the main ground was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "possess higher interest rates and needs it because of the labour market enhancement", said Ian Shepherdson, Chiefconom at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets in the whole world were together over the last months after China had estimated its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average in May increased more than 16% under its maximum, as investors feared that a delay of the Chinese economy would dry the global growth.
The market has been repeated in this month, while the Dow is now nearly 10% below the height of May.
For the representatives of the Fed, the market turbulences affect the complex calculation when the interests are to be increased.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks, they would be able to accompany them in this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Centre for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Note Bank.
Now he predicts that they will wait at least a month to get better effects on the griff.
" There is a lot of insecurity about what the effects on the US will be, and there are almost no permissional data that describe the developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is no of the main concerns of the Fed, so it should not be included technically in its decision-making.
But finally, the Fed Monetary Authority has become the world's.
The impact of the Central Bank was enormous in the last few years.
The only indication of the former leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "reverse" its monetary expansion, resolved confusions around the globe.
In a world, in which markets and people's economys are increasingly broken, the Fed representatives may be expected to monitor developments not only in other places, but also advise with other central banks and experts to get better understanding for the global economy.
Its decision-making is "more art than science", said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for the ownership management of the Enterprise Investnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, noted this month, that "the Fed has a history of overactions on financial market movements that seem to be not linked to the financial data."
Lacker, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who is in place to increase the interests, quoted decisions in 1998/1999 for example.
A financial crisis in Asia made the Fed to reduce its leadership about 0.75 percent points in three meetings "notwithstanding limited recognisable impact on growth in the United States", Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed representatives returned these cuts.
The Fed should take the first place the aspects of the financial stability only during a serious crisis as the market summarized in 2008, said Adam S. Posen, equivalent member of the Committee for the Investigation of the Bank of England.
The most recent turbulences are not close to this level, said he.
"They certainly don't want to go into the situation in which she feared an increase in interest because the markets are upset," said Posen, President of Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability, and until it is changed, I do not believe that it should predict the time.

For more refugees today in Germany.
Preparing a warm welcome, not without the commitment of more honorable helpers.
In Hoyerswerda, there is also a number of people who support innocent asylum applicants in the city.
They belong to Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
She also has 74 lenses to teach her.
Every Thursday, she's doing it in the Asylum in the Dillinger Street.

Of course, it is completely different than at a right school.
Brazilian pediatric society Rio Grande promotes food for healthy styles
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS tries to explain shockingly how important good food is during the lifetime. It does this with the presentation of images of babys that are shocked to Brussels, which are shocked with shows of unsuccessful food.
Mother milk consists of a variety of proteins, feeds, vitation and carbon hydrocarbons that gives babys all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
On the basis of additional energy demands, pregnancy and young mothers will be able to increase their daily calorian increase of about 500 calories per day.
However, new research results pointed out that a higher calorious increase is not the only diagnostic adjustment to the mother.
A present study under the leadership of Robert Waterland, Professor at Baylor Medicine College in Texas, showed that a healthy feed of pregnant women actually relates to the gene of her baby and protects the tumors before development.
Unfortunately, unheilable food of the child may affect immune systems negatively.
Exemptions for the new sport chale
The Commonwealth Council Bernried authorized the construction application for the EUR 2.3 million tear sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The toilet may be more flashed for the solar system.
The plans for the long-reached tournale construction at the Bernrijer Sports are a step forward: In the recent joint meeting, the proposed construction application was uncomfortable without great discussions.
Previously, the body had decided, inter alia, on an application to a constructional "except" respective "exemption" of the valid construction plan.
In the "exception" it was the authorisation for a special form on the roof building.
This aims to be created a "station with non-method first and duty transition".
The planning is the planned use of the tent for solar installations: "We have a wonderful Southern", said Master Josef Steigenberger in the meeting.
In the "free", it was to be decreased for energy reasons - other than for the construction plan - to be under ten degrees.
The volume of the hall is significantly reduced.
A "free" was therefore necessary because the construction plan does not allow "exemptions" - by which the Bernar's Council, in general, is more limited to the exemption of applications.
However, in Turnhallen construction, it is not a re-recurrenced project: "We do not create an event of presentation", says Steigenberger.
The tournhall construction in the sport centre is a Community project of the Community and the SV Bernried.
In costs, about 2,3 million euros are calculated.
Subsidies are expected to be supported by the school and width sport.
The next procedure is now presented to the Country Council for 18 x 36 meters of large halls.
Clinic PÃ¼gnberg goes to Schongau
The Hospital PÃ¶pfenberg hospital is to be closed before planned - 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fisher (66) will become a new doctor in the hospital of Schongau.
The station and the majority of employees move from PÃ¶pfenberg to Schongau.
This presents the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the countrycreen, confirmed by the Countryline Andrea Jochner.
However, a decision is taken by the Supervisory Council, which is day afternoon, 23 September.
If the plans are implemented, all of the 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital house in PÃ¶pfenberg.
The overwhelming majority has to turn into Songau with fishermen and the continued internal station.
The rooms exist.
The employees who can't be able to songau offer a job in Weilheim, so Jochner Weiss.
The employees are informed about the plans.
On the other hand, Dr. Andreas Eder, who is the doctor of Songauer Clinic since the beginning of the year, has changed to a private practice in the immediate nearness of the hospital.
When the question who would be to present the follow-up, Jochner's wisdom came the name "Fischer" in the game that was ready to take the leadership from 1 October and changing with his team to Schongau.
For the house in Schongau, this was a "assessment" and a dissemination of the offer in the area "Inner Medicin", so Jochner.
Fisher is a specialist for cardiacs and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) is specialized on the internal station on gastroenterological diseases.
For the next two years, fishermen with his team, if the Supervisory Council agrees to conduct both houses, to the next year, the former hospital house of the council, which is still over 35 beds, will be finally closed in PÃ¶pchenberg for almost 140 years.
The farmer had planned this for 2018 when the current sanction of the hospital Weilheim was completed.
Landestin Jochner, who is also the Chairman of the Supervisory Council, was able to be used in the future as a accommodation for asylum users.
"I concluded." As it continues with the real estate, Jochner was not able to say that it gives several discussions.
Currently, there is a short-term employee of the Caritas and a daily psychiatrie.
"What best couldn't happen to us, such an opportunity can't come again", so fishermen have been included by the "posittive and very comprehensive" workers.
A real perspective for the house in which fishermen work as Chefarzt for over 30 years have not given it.
He was requested by Schongauer colleagues to take the positions of the doctor's director.
In the past decades, the hospital of PÃ¶tchenberg (e.g., 100 beds) was always threatened by closing, the departments were closed, for example, the surgery and the birth aid.
The ballers of the Rhein Neckar Lewen are requested tonight (20.15) at the mountain HC.
In Wuppertal the clear favorite is the leader of the Federal Liga, however, there is no inheritance.
In the past season, the bathrooms in the BHC were a painful skin and have got to do something good there.

Refugees need accommodations: Study warning for accommodation difficulties
The situation on the German housing market has been encouraged.
Also, more refugees are looking for a payable rest.
The pressure on the accommodation market increases.
The social housing is a challenge.
Distribution fights on the German housing market have long been started.
With the incoming refugees and working demanders from the EU, more people are on a market that has already been over in many major cities.
They competite with income-free citizens for the last payable apartments.
To cover the request of payable apartments, 400,000 new units should be built each year until 2020.
This results in a study in terms of the "Social Apartment" Association.
Comparison: This year, 260,000 units will be completed in Germany.
That misses 140,000 apartments.
Refugees are not obliged to live after the first three months of their residence than the asylum requesters.
Many then stood on the accommodation market and swimming in the long skins before the accommodations.
According to statistics, however, in the past year less than half of all asylum applicants lived.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only the increased refugee numbers.
The study also produces significant disappearance in the housing industry policy in the last few years.
Germany has a housing deficit, which will increase from year to year.
At present, about 770,000 living units were missing in the Balement areas, Matthias Sunther, author of the study.
Many professionals, therefore, lived in large cities in WG rooms.
Young adults remained freely in the "Mama Hotel" for a long time because of the flat on the apartment market.
In the major cities, the number of squaremeters per head should be first recovered in the past years.
To solve the problem, the "social housing" council proposes a new start.
The new encouragement to the social housing is to be re-established.
In this way, it could be rejected on the basic trade tax and the basis tax for promoting accommodations would be delayed.
Furthermore, it is necessary for attractive tax reimbursement opportunities.
The support programme for refugees from the KfW State Bank is now good at cities and communities.
A good week after the start of the Monday with EUR 184 million was already launched more than half of the available EUR 300 million.
Now the project could even be cut off.
Refugees have a free drive: Croatia and Slovenia to Corridor
After Hungary, there is no more income, since more refugees choose the way through Croatia.
Zagreb announces to give the distances through Slovenia to North without wardens.
It's dangerous, but it's the road.
Croatia wants to understand with the neighbouring Slovenia about the establishment of a corredor for refugees.
"I talked to the Slovenian Inland Minister, and if necessary, we will organize a coridor", said the Croatian Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and already belongs to the Schengen Zone.
Croatia is not the Schengen country yet.
After the decrease of the Serbian-Unarn borders, hundreds of refugees have been cut into Croatia to reach from there to Western Europe.
500 people came over the border at Tovarnik, reports the chronic television RTL.
Hungary had cut his borders on Sunday for refugees.
New laws that were in force on the same day, there are also general asylum procedures in Hungary.
Croatia wants to pass the refugees.
The Croatian Minister Zoran Milanovic stated: "You can travel, and we are preparing us to do this."
These people are there, there are women, children and men who want to live and reach something.
However, there were people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had attacked the first refugees at the Serbian border to the EU-Neighborhood of Croatia in the morning.
The majority of media reports were based on Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came both with the bus and with taxes to the Serbian border city Sid.
Only after their arrival, they would have tried to reach the green borders to Croatia.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees do not attack border chambers.
For this, the border stretches other dangers: there are still severe mines from the Yugoslavian citizen war in the 1990s.
Mine spacers must now create a safe path.
After Hungary, there is little more refugees after the end of the border.
On Thursday, the police had 366 invasions.
Shortly before the tour on Monday, there was 9380.
The new Hungarian laws introduce the transfer and damage of the border chain as a crime.
The Szeged border city has therefore been introduced 35 criminal procedures.
The judges threatened prisons up to five years and the departure from the country.
According to the Inmigration Authority, the total of 94 asylum-based "transit zones" established on Thursday, almost all of them, in the main transition of RÃ¶szke.
Among the applicants, 13 families were with small children and two older people.
Wednesday morning, 40 refugees were still stopped there.
Nevertheless, practically, no more has a view to obtain asylum in Hungary.
According to Hungary, Serbia is a "safe third country".
The rejected asylum applicants should be dismissed there.
Before the "Transit zone" in Russia, only few hundreds of refugees were gathered.
In RÃ¶szke, workers began to store this.
They gathered the mould left the ten thousands of people in the last weeks on the road.
Sperrgitters were decreased and one of the acquiring camps was transformed in the border.
For this purpose, no one wanted to express himself.
Austria has reached only few refugees after closing the borders between Serbia and Hungary.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
However, there were still 200,000 immigrants in the country.
At Salzburg, about 1400 people were waiting for travel to Germany.
The traffic from there to Germany was stopped on Sunday at the instruction of German authorities.
In liberty, smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived in foot.
Citizensman went on the borders
"We were employed after the bridge celebration on Sunday with the rooms when almost ten people with travel coffees standed at the start of the cemetery," says Wernstein's Citizen Meister Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to go to Pasau.
However, because Germany was surprising the rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee strom, it was for them in Wernstein concluses," said the Stadler, who immediately offered his help, and the springers, together with two other helpers and their cars over the borders in Nae Passau.
Before we have destroyed the unexpected guests once, with jause and drinks.
We just said we're bringing them to Pasau with the car.
"This was self-conscious for us," says the stadler in the OÃN conversation.
You were very grateful.
A man didn't take it to deliver a huge shoe - 100 euros for the fire weapons.
"This has been very pleased to us," says the stadler.
On Sunday, the passengers were turned into a regional direction to passue in Wels, in order to try to spend on the short-term proclamation that rail movement was established to Germany, but still through the border.
However, before the borders in Wernstein, the region was entered.
In Wernstein, the cross-border border is generally high in the course.
The Bridge Festival linked to the Bayern neighbors on Sunday, the day before a double bridge is sportive - organized by the Warnstein Union and the Bayern from New Church.
That Victor OrbÃ¡n now sends to us other thousands of cigs, is a logical result of a likely policy:
Instead of helping in the region of Rome immediately in the establishment of structures to ensure humanity, our Federal Officer has emphasized the position of the Hungarian government in the dark circle of nationalism.
The suffering of this policy is not only the Austrians who are now faced in the border areas with caotic circumstances.
The refugees must also find that the "good country", which they have invited and welcomed, is nothing as another refugee stock.
It will be a great challenge, given the continuing refugee streams and the near winter, to create human conditions for demanders for protection.
And there will be more - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad on the search for 35.000 winter feasts
Konrad has to do all the hands with the refugee submission.
Christian Conrad is used that his word has weight.
The government has used the former powerful rail bank to set Quartiers for the thousands of refugees.
The Chaos in the first rescue centre of Traiskirchen has already got Konrad into the griff.
"We have no objection anymore in Traiskirchen," he reported about his first success.
The submission of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday has also been followed without a great cluster, Konrad said and loving the organizational "Master Service".
However, the Ministry of Internal Affairs was a "Crising situation".
Conrad totally calculated with a need of 85,000 quarters in this year.
In order to fill the number, the next weeks must be found more than 35,000 accommodations - 20,000 countries have to provide, 15,000 of the covenant.
If it becomes more refugees, we can do it.
"But it's no fass without land," Konrad said.
He has already discussed with the head of the country.
They would have assigned him to create quarters for the coming refugee.
"In Obersterreich it works good," said Ferry Mayer.
The former VP Mandator supports Konrad.
Tomorrow it will be given a meeting with Kardinal Christoph SchÃ¶nborn, which will be explained how the Church will help.
The Asylum coordinator also sets the ORF action "Help as we".
On the platform, private persons can offer incomplete accommodations.
Moreover, you are hoped of hotels that are empty in winter.
Konrad and Mayer criticized yesterday the standards for sublime as "very high".
In times, it could not be possible that the quarter provider should keep a certain height of the handle holder or size of the surface lights.
For a period period, "Notstandards" should be applied.
In contrast to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Conrad is based on his experience.
I am a older man who is not saying inconservence without any other face.
Convince power is his most important weapons.
Conrad and Mayor did not cause costs, as they themselves declared.
They want to increase their number of employees to three to four.
The own quarter search has not been successful.
Konrad wanted to set a container on the Stephans place as a office.
There are, however, problems with approval.
Linz requires a better department
First, no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips-Arena and design Center for the sublime of refugees plants the city Linz.
This is not necessary when the interests are now able to be taken without these measures, Mr Klaus Luger (SP).
However, for the emergency, further positions should be examined on their validity.
The head of the city is critical to the department of refugees within the Federal State.
Other areas must also contribute here.
Sea horrible: "Greens are not ruled"
In a long term of phone with Mr Horst Seehofer (CSU) Mr Josef PÃ¼hringer (VP) on Monday, the country has agreed the further action in the refugee question.
Seafofer has assured me that the German borders are not disrupted.
The continued travel of refugees to the Federal Republic is possible.
However, it is now the relevant border controls.
Special journeys with refugees to Germany will first not give it.
However, protective demanders would be sent to Germany with regular trends.
The other Member States of the EU requested a more strengthened solidarity in the refugee question.
What Austria also has under control at its borders is "a logical follow-up" for PÃ¼hrer, from the action of the Germans.
The next routine is a question of time
The generalization of the "New World" in Linzer Industry Linzer is officially closed.
In four of the six Stockworks of the office and production building, the officially notified IT concerts S&T, the remainder (2700 quatermeters) is to prevent young, innovative enterprises from the technology area.
"In the IT, the sweet heads are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us," says S&T Chief Hannes Niederhauser.
He can imagine to invest in new trade businesses in startup and then acquiring any.
Soon from the beginning you want to cooperate with the new neighbors - where the Niederhauser says: "The next routine is only a question of time".
1.7 million euros were invested in the location by S&T, 3.3 million euros from the Techcenter, which belongs to a third of the city Linz, the country of South-East and the bond (FFG).
The building is packed by the Linz AG for 60 years at S&T and Techcenters.
30% of the 2700 square meters rest in the building have already been avoided, for more than 40% it has requested it.

It was expressed to the decision that the Fula producers who were home in Bologna were the idea of a own location where only their handbags were sold.
"We are the only ones in the big room Linz that sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters who owned Italian roots.
Your mode interest has received width from her mother in the way.
I am mostly grateful if something is developed and I can show new tendencies to be able.
Why some women have such a beautiful handtaking device when seeing a sweet taste, the expert woman can not answer with the last security.
Maybe it's a beautiful taste of each outfit.
The bruilder of the city of Kall
The PfÃ¤llers of Donald Trump came from a place where the inhabitants were called.
This property is also binding with the Millennium, which wants to be the President of the United States.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for the trainer.
If he expresses himself foreignly, the journalists are ridicule or reveals knowledge in the international crisis policy - the applicant for the United States Chairman's Chairman is strongly engaged in the election campaign.
And smell it well.
This is also registered in the Palestinian Call City where the majority of the real estate milliarder.

The Kalltown Simone Wendel turned a movie over the Trump.
And what do the villages think about his goal to become the most powerful man of the world?
"I think they find it somewhat shockful, but they're not even the most impressed in their fat city," says Simone Wendel.
The coal town has turned a fascinated documentark over the place and its famous spotslinglings, with which the Ketchup family has also been in the near Trump.
Trump, who is not known for awareness, comes in "Kings of Call City" (2014) as well as in words - so that he would be sure that he would also be successful if he lives in the city of Kall.
He didn't bring it there to the king of the heart.
Although it respects the performance of the family, but also tenderly the view that the Trump is "sweet a little a big moul", Wendel says.
On the other hand, the name of the shooter, which has the city in the circle, "The brulljemaker" - to high-depth: the offerer, she says.
Trump then comes from the village of the supplier.
The Trump's success history began in 1885, when the later grandfathers moved out and opened a place for gold manufacturers in the United States.
Basestein of the real estate center were the first baseball purchase in New York.
But the life of the grandfathers was not free of tragic: your desire to return to the home of the country was ruined in the Bair State where the philosophy was then belonging.
He didn't include Trump because he was first without approval, the director of the Institute for Palestinian History and Population, Roland Paul, declared to the film start.
Trump is the only one of the "illic foreigners".
This is in contrast with the marked words of the follow-up.
He had repeatedly spoken about mexican immigrants in the United States and requested the construction of a border march to decrease illegal immigrants.
"Come the polter, it is not so sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a far-related trumpet ("The Oma was a birth Trump, the opa was born Heinz").
The winter in peace looks more distanced to the Americans, "he is always so shocking."
Does he think that Trump comes again?
"I can't imagine that," the 72-year-old boys says.
"He never cares about the city of Karl."
The Pensiontustin Veronika Schramm mentioned as some Kilstadres, that a postcomme of the Heinz family at a visit was something to the church rule, which was generally good.
"I can't imagine from Donald," the 68-year-old boys says.
She starts better if he doesn't win the choice, because "he has such radical views, I don't know whether it's good."
If those who had the sake at the time of his grandfathers in the United States would have been like he, "If he would never come there."
"There's more interesting topics than him," says Winzertood Sarah BÃ¼hler.
And as President?
"My President isn't right," she says.
And: "The trumpets will also be reif without the President."

The last three votes agreed: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Secret enthusiasmed?
Lana Jebes-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snesana Markoski may have clearly obvious who wins the Bachelor.
The woman, at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor finally entered, was in the biggest secret.
And no of the three remaining girls will certainly be worth not if she is the one who received the last Rose.
But when we've been checked with Sarah Mackay, Snesana Markoski and Lana Jeez-Fellows on the day before three, you might have given you a reference to who will be the winner.
Sam Wood holds his lips to final on Thursday
All three women have been lyry about the reason why the wood of the perfect man is and called his sense for humor, honor, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be a partner.
However, if the question is set, "If you don't have to get Woods' last Rose?", they could be their answers to the player, who wins the heart of the bachelor.
Jebes Fellows and Markoski were calling both fast - except yourself - Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship since the first day.
"When I went to the house and noted (Sarah) and Sam's energy, I felt that they were very complicated, and I thought it all over the show," said Jeij-Fellows.
"Sarah stands with two feet on the earth, it makes it so fun to be with her," added Markoski.
I saw her together, and they've got the right chemistry.
They feel awesome and comfortable ones.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would have been a good couple.
From her view, Mackay said that the house visit made her clear that Wood "The One" could be.
"When I saw him with my friends and the family, I was obviously clear that this is not just a game - I'm now unpreserved on him," she said.
And when she was asked, whose wood was to choose, if not her, she was worthy.
"I don't know if I can say it," she said.
I love the remaining girls equally - it's an unfair difference between Snesana and Lana.
The Bachelor is extracted at midnight at 19:30 p.m. on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest when he moved to the United States - and there were many other teams who sent questions after his impressive open training day end of the last year.
But Hayne elected San Francisco 49ers and trainer Jim Tomsula and looked like a good decision.
Some trainers would have banned Hayne for the rest of the game on the bank when he lost a ring as it did the Aussie-Rugby Liga convergence in his first bridge return on Tuesday 20-3 winning against Minesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to retreat a punt and also in the walking game after a injury of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his real face in the upkleide cabin after the game.
Instead of making his smokes before the rest of the team through the pool, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also strengthened Hayne in his press conference after the game.
The 49 sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by the Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey to forget his dispatch and to care for the next game.
Jarryd Hayne pauses at a point that was rebuilt in the first playshop of the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the start of the Hayne and its massive Australian follow-up for its NFL debtion.
Hayne left the game field and later told the Australian Duo Hamish & Andy Radio on 2DayFM 104.1 that he couldn't imagine no worse start in his NFL career,
"This was a thing that comes before now, you're only careful about the next game, and that's it," said Hayne.
Hayne compared the sniper with its original DebÃ¼t in 2007 when a passage in its own in-goal area was leading to a trial for Queensland.
However, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne put for a photo with fans and holds an Australian fleet after the game and posted it on his instagram.

Free electioners request the setting of 1000 new teachers in Bayern because of the high refugee payment.
The Party and Group Chief Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW-Herbst class in Great Wall City before a serious crisis in Bayerns schools when it is not in accordance with many new teachers: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools before the college."

Aiwanger requested the establishment of UNO Shuttle Zone for Refugees in Syria, as it had been during the Yellow Law during the ninety-year years.
"So it's not going, we need to be the causes," said the free election chief.
Rejected asylum applicants want to move free choices as soon as possible.
As a result, Aiwanger also requested more staff for the administrative duties responsible for asylums: "We need at least 50 new asylum directors", said Aiwanger.
The FW Chief criticized that several federal countries were not consistent: "We need a comprehensive uniform standard of the federal countries."
"Bayers shoot out, others don't."
"We need to be more treatable."
However, the country policy is not to fall under the table.
A year of long-term frame remains on the agenda: education policy.
In the new school year, Minister Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) started the pilot survey at 47 Gymnasien, with a proliferation of three to four years of gymnasians, and the result of the recurrence of nine years to abdiction.
But it's not enough for Aiwanger.
"The theme G9 must be speeded," said the FW Chief.
We call for election freedom for all Gymnasians who want it.
Free journey to G9 everywhere it is desired.

Incredibly reactions among marine owners who were attended at the meeting are called the pictures and new details for the desired hotel construction.
Roberto Schulz, Ocean owner and member of the headquarters' interest in the shareholder, Pro Hieve, claims: "This will be a rise-based cluster that overcomes all other buildings."
In addition, he fears as some other project critics that the transport would be strongly increased by the dimension of the installation: "It must be all the busloads, so that it is calculated".
However, what happens exactly on the good of a hectare of the former guest station is still open.
There's no employee yet.
"In the first place, we have to have a close concept", said Ralf Berrends.
Because this lacked, the construction plans are also variable.
Schillings near Gorillas in Frankfurter Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is pleased with his Gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian has brought shields to the world last night.
Slillings are rare at Gorillas.
The last in a German Zoo is almost 50 years back and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, namely the Zoo.

NHC says 60% opportunities for cyclon south of the Capverd Islands
The US National Hurricane Center, on Tuesday, predicted a wide pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the Southern Cape Tower Islands, which has a 60% opportunity to develop in the next 48 hours a tropical mosque tower.
Another significantly defined deep pressure system in the middle of the Capverded Islands and the small antilles also has a 60% potential to build a tropical muscle tower in the next two days, added the weather experts stationed in Miami.
Google starts double-up campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced a duplication campaign to bring $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have crossed the European nations because they run from the war and flighted countries.
Google has an insufficient personal approach to the announcement of the spending call on his blog.
Instead of allowing an advertising to a manager, Rita Masoud, a Google employee fly with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old, wrote about their personal experiences.
"Their journeys belonged to many dark trains and buses, both hungry, dust, smell and fear," she wrote.
I was happy.
But since the crisis of refugee and migration has grown in Europe, many people like my family are doubtless of help.
The costs are available to four common organizations that provide help for refugees and migrants: doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first global collected costs are doubled to a value of 5,5 million on google.com/refugee delivery to 11 million dollars.
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, which has been widely caused by the four-year-old civil war in Syria, which has passed over 4 million people this year.
Many refugees also from Afghan, Jemen, Iraq and Libyan destroyed by the war.
Report of Yasmeen Abutaleb; processing of Christian Plumb
For easy overwhelming diabetes, weight loss may be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for easier overwhelming persons with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years after a new study.
It's too early to say whether overwhelming people with diabetes after weight loss of weight live longer than those who receive non-chirurgy treatment.
"Death data needs a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a expert of weight loss surgery, who wrote a guide to the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations or Adiposite surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the magens.
They reduce hungers and limit the physical ability to include food.
Over the years, Adipostas operations have been effectively treated with type-2 diabetes, but most studies have been performed in people who are sickly fettleby with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight in respect of size, shall apply as normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overwhelming, and people with a BMI more than 30 are more than fettleby.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan Min-Sheng General Hospital data collected in a study since 2007 and compared two types of Adiposita surgery - Magenbypass and Magen-Sheng - to medical treatments for type-2 diabetes in people who were easily overwhelming.
The average BMI undertaken by this operation is nearly 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in this study.
Nevertheless, the IMO remained at those who received treatments of non-chirurgical diabetes at least 29.
The diabetes disease was completely resolved by 36% of those who were under the surgical invasion and 28% partly.
In the medical-related group, in comparison with diabetes, only one percent was solved in comparison with diabetes and in part by about two percent.
Furthermore, the results of blood pressure, triglyceride and LDL-Cholesterins were better in general in the 'chirurgical' group, found the authors.
The researchers also observed the patients' blue level of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects the blood sugar values during the time.
Hemoglobin A1c is mainly maintained under 7 percent, write the researchers.
After the operation, the average hemoglobin A1c level was around 9% to around 6%.
However, in the medical therapy group, it remained stabil at about 8%.
But this better "glychemic control" - as you reflect in the improved hemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, so the leading researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compares the average results of the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the Bypass Cyrurgy Group had lost more weight in comparison with the Gastrectomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), the increased decline in BMI (7.4 against 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2,1%) and recorded the complete overflow of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study does not show the benefit of the surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of more serious people in Sweden that the operation leads to a longer life, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona, University of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, there were fettleibites who undermined an adiposite operation, about 29% less likely to die during the period of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show advantages for survival at the surgery patients, Blackstone said that it was calm for people with a MMI under 35 interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study, because she says that this operation in this lower BMI group is lower," she said, "without increased death risk or renal disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking serious weight when the patient was with its MMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long until we bring people to take this serious." she said.
I think that when they have collected these genetic changes that have established their body with fativity and diabetes, it is very difficult."
Love history plays in the pocket
It is a theme that is now confused in the Belletristik: a young woman, in school times, is unpleasant and unlikely, returns the black of her youth after years, and it is loved in her.
Similarly, in the recently appeared Roman "We are not so" by Luisa Binder.
In addition to the love stories, the Roman should be especially interesting for Hunspresser readers, because he plays in long-term and surrounding regions.
The primary professional author has grown in Langwier and is pleased to make a literary thinking at home.
"It is impossible that everyone may come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe could not take all refugees, said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East was the real solution.
The Tibeth-Buddhist leader called for the end of violence in the homelands of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the sustained refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visits in the United Kingdom in his speech, following the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is the ethic study.
It requested that the interests of humanity should be made under the conditions given to the interests of the individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis, but the situation is not appropriate.
"It's impossible that everyone can come to Europe," he said in his word.
Although the Dalai Lama and Austria's efforts were glorified in the face of the crisis, he stressed that it was just a timely solution.
"Set to care for several thousands of refugees, it is wonderful, but in the meantime you must think about long-term solutions, such as peace and real development, mainly through education, can be created for these Muslim countries."
Finally, we must consider how the murder is reduced in their countries.
We must reduce the use of violence.
"The use of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented George Bush's trade after the terrorism attack of 11 September and pointed out that the violent reaction of the United States was a chain of uncontrolled events.
After 11 September, I expressed my complaint in a letter to President Bush, and I said to him that the way to solve this problem is in violence.
"I know his reasons were good, but he put violence, and it called unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Four times increased in receipt of handdedetect infections by children in the past 4 years
In the U.S., there is a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of alcoholic defects, so Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of Georgia Poison Center, the cases of receipt of hand-de-infections in children under 12 years of age reported the gift control centres from 3.266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
"Childs are always more frequent to these products, and unfortunately, a percentage of them goes in the emergency record," said Lopez CNN.
He said some children drinking desinfects, while some do it to impress their friends or because of a brave test in social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young desinfects are only drinking because of a valuable experience.
Young people have used to mix desinfects with alcoholic waters to get a worse drink.
Younger children can be closed by attractive dubbles of desinfects.
"A child does not think that's bad for it," said Lopez.
Many of the more attractive (Hand-Desinfects) are those who are completed.
There are desinfects with earthquake, vineyards and persons who are very suitable for children.
Handdededecimal infection contains some between 45 and 95% of alcohol.
Especially in small children, few spliters can lead to alcohol verglation.
"It's the highest concentrationd alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the guest call center in the hospital house of the University of Kansas, Sender Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn't let the whisky smile, but people let this hand desinfect in the range of children, and when children come to it, then it's a fast possibility to consume much alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-year-old girl who had recently taken four spliters from the earthquake infringements in the school, was taken into an emergency record.
Your blood coal concentration was 179, twice higher than the weight that applies legally to adults, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an insurance art which treated her in the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah laughed her words and was not able to go when she came to the ambulance.
The doctors watched them at night in a separate child hospital on signs of the Hirn-Teloa, since the girl was shocked by the alcohol and shooted the head, said Ritchey.
"This was very shocking," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijahs mother, CNN.
It could be dead for my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use alcoholic products or desinfects and low hand-de-de-infections out of the root of the child.
In addition, some desinfects were associated with death accidents.
In 2013, two women died in Ontario after the shock of hand-de-de-infected drugs who received a toxic, undeclared addiction.
Workers of health authorities estimated that the product was methanol, a mortal solution instead of ethyl coal noted as an active substance.
In January, three students of the fourth class in New York State planned to seduce their "general" teacher by expressing antibacterial products around the education room,â reports a police report.
The teacher is very allergic towards the dedetect infections of the hands and slaughtered it out of her room.
The police considered the plan referred to as "conciliation" and disciplinary measures to the school authorities.

I don't believe that we feel under pressure, I think the players are pleased.
The lack of title competition in the Scotia football longs the Netherlands - the Boer
The former Ranger-Method Game players and previous national players of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer said that the Dutch football fans had lost interest in Celetic, since there is no Title reliability with the rangers.
The Boer, who is now a messager for Ajax, said, "In Holland they do not show highlights of the Celltic games anymore and why?"
It's because the ringers aren't there.
People are not only talking about the back of the rangers.
They're talking about the old company.
They're talking about both teams together and that's what she's interesting.
There is a lot of fun in the old-friend games, and there are not only people in Scotia who want to see these games.
I'll turn back the things, Deila.
RONNY Deila accepted that Celtic needs to fight, but the Norwegian chief sweet to turn the things around.
After the slaughter against MalmÃ¶ and the following divisions from the Champion League, the slaughter against 10-mans from Aberdeen, which now stands clearly on the side of the table.
But Deila said, "Celtic had already had bad times, and we'll be back."

We feel that exactly, but we need to continue.
We really need the support of Celtic, because this makes the player better.
It is so important to get together now.
Warburton carefully at January-Transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, which pointed out that he appealed a few January transfers, Ranger-Boss Mark Warburton is carefully understood by the signing of new accesses and warned that he would not want to defeat the unit of the Ibrox cards.
The former head of Brentford said: "The January-Transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players that arrive in the summer have this presession time to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season.
The manage is really good.
Sometimes more damages are given by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.

Tannadice Board of Oversight has confidence in Dundee-United Management
Simon Donnelly warns that the government of Duncan United has yet confidence in the management team to turn things back - but it increases the need to end the game field.

We'll get the kids back to the train," said Donnelly.
McInnes is pleased to win Hamilton.

McInnes said, "There is no manage that has won everything, in pokal games or lingers that have not ever winned games of this kind."
Labour unemployment in Scotia remains unchanged while it increases in the whole United Kingdom.
The unemployment in Scotia remained unchanged in May to July at 164.000, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom was totally 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
Scotlandâs unemployment rate of 5,9% was over the UK of 5,5%, as shown by the National Statistics Office.
In the interim period, employment in Scotia was at 12000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2.612.000.

Why I will be witness to an execution in Oklahoma
Sometimes today, except at a late legal intervention, I will see how a man will die.
If it happens, and I hope that it doesn't happen, I'll sit in an observer gallery in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, when Richard Glossip is executed through the gift spots.
He asked me to be one of the four official Witnesses at his death.
The invitation has been the first time in January about his best friend, and even though I was shocked, I was right.
When the day was nearer, I began to fear me.
So why should I do it?
I was right because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about death penalties.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists can see in the United States, and more demands are available than places, there is a worse lottery in place to decide who is selected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen, it will be observed without emotion.
I can't.
I will sit next to Richard Glossips a close friend with whom I developed my own relationship in the course of months with telephones and a two and a half hours of visit.
I like the guy.
We're laughing many times when we talk.
The prison officials say that I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a stipulate to write what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter to abandon my inpartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prison, how he wants, and you get access.
I'm swearing with her.
She emphasized that she "he could make it better", but she still thinks that it's wrong what I do.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and written.
He doesn't tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he would do it.
I told him that he can remove me from his list of Witnesses every time.
But he wants a international reporter to write there.
When he dies, he thinks that the public work of movement against death penalty will help.
Kim Bellware, a reporter of Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of Podcasts I've done.
I don't want to go back to all the details.
I can't say with safe that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His acts after murdering Barry Van Treese would make him guilty to be a beneficiary of the fact.
But I think there is a strong probability that he's not guilty of the murder.
I believe there is no sufficient evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his instruction is wrong.
And from this perspective I'll see him to die.
I can't claim to be really objective.
It will be given to other reporters to which you can apply.
What you're going to get from me is what it means to see a man died unnecessary.
Man after fired police persecution year to come from the Canning River
The Canning Vale Police was still shocked when he killed the man from the Canning River.
A man of Perth who tried to defeat the police was followed when he found himself in the stage and summoned water, just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to "to overlook him to go back to the ice."
The police of Canning Vale was called to a home-friendly fall in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they found the suspect, they tried to get out of them in the direction of Canning River.
But he didn't come too far.
"He stood in the water- and said, 'I'm not coming out, come and get me," said senior sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not yet encouraged to make his unit, so he went to a more reliable tactic - "A good police negotiated".
"Atimes people do so to try to get out," said senior sergeant Castledine.
Masterschafts-FuÃball player Ben Cousins offers an uncommon example.
In 2006, Cousins entered his car in the grain to run a alcohol control and then tried to swim through the Swan River.
His efforts were followed, but inspired inhabitant to the humored planning of a Ben Cousins-Biathlon.
Peter Moody said that Stewards tried to spontaneize him and threaten to finish the rent sport
Peter Moody said that Stewards tried to install a spion in his surfaces last year and threatened to end the rain immediately.
He aimed at the Stewards and the integrity Department of Racing Victoria, and said that she had conducted a personal campaign against him with the late Scratching of Lady Tatai because of a rentages treatment, which was the last strohhalm on midday.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for the rear sport and he himself considered himself in difficult conditions when it went to the positive cobalt tuffer test at Lidaris that he cannot explain.
He had been left for 18 months because of the shooting front and didn't want it to "shore like too high lighting traubs."
"I had planned to say nothing about it, and I had seen a long time on it, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out again," said Moody.
You know that it's continued.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to spend the higher head, and I want my owners to think I'm looking for my best for them.
If they start thinking, I don't do that, I shouldn't be a trainer anymore.
I have to figure out what I'm doing with my license.
Moody had made the bomb up in an interview with racing.com that the integration department tried to sponsor its steel.
"For eight months Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - I will be appointed when I was asked - and offered him a job in my surfaces to provide information about what I do in my area," said Moody on Racing.com.
You're obviously thinking I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, they should certainly be shocked on their nest because they tried to take me.
Robert Roulston, eye. President of the RVL, David Moodie, director of RVL and Bernard Saundry, the current CEO of RVL, had been aware of it at the time and are still today.
Should this make me think it's personal?
Have the RVL been firm and maybe people are responsible for what is in the sector?
I'm bad for the industry?
Are I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people think that I'm out there.
Maybe they're gonna have to take my license and hide me, and I don't doubt that what I'm saying, they're gonna think about it now.
But I'm at the point now, where it's wrong, and this makes me worried.
This makes me really awesome.
I will exercise the pressure on them and strike them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The scratching level of the trainer was built with the long-term cobalt interview at Lidari, and the late scratching led that he could "tower his license over the table."
Moody, the best known by his preparation of the unpublished Black Caviar, described the Renning Days Training Rule "speakly", after a packaging or sound was taken on the horses, which was made against the rules.
"It is against the rules of the rear sport.
I have to take the full responsibility for it," he said.
"Another of my employee has struck on the skin.
It could be like that last night.
It could be like the whole day last night.
But it was also that at the breakfast.
Moody could be compared with a three-month disqualization for the packing treatment on the reception day. A study of this matter was opened.
It's a wrath.
People who set these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We all see that we need rules, but here you've been too far," said Moody.
Man after driver flight arrested
The police was arrested by a man after a shipment with a rail driver and then driver flight in Cobram.
The rail driver was sent to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was taken from a car on the Murray Valley's car on Saturday morning.
The police said that the driver went on without stop to help the last driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from the police was in Shepparton.
It is intended to be accused of the driving and the low-standing aid and of other transport crimes.
The raid driver, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in the hospital and is in a stable condition.
Melbourne-Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy suggests to rivals because of arrests against ring fighters
Melbourne-Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy has called the "Agenda-Setting" of two First League Favorites of NRL.
Sydney Roosters Trainer Trent Robinson said that the Scheeds Directors have allowed the Storm players "Ring battle" with his team during the high storm seat in the qualification final in Sydney on Friday.
Brisbane Broncos Trainer Wayne Bennett made an uncomfortable note to the Storm Team after his management had reached the final seat against North Queensland Cowboys at the afternoon. He called the game "Shooter game" of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland would not be "be good" in the rings.
Bellamy defended the tack limit of his manity and said that she was only concentrated on her "contact".
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading trainers agreed to him in confidence, since it claimed that they were worried to be shocked by the Storm team.
"This always looks out again - I didn't hear that Trent Robinson talked about ring fights when they shocked us 242," said Bellamy on midnight.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything to our defensive system or technology throughout the year, but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tackles to a real point, and that has produced the trend for us.
Trent is now there for three years, and obviously he has a great manner to train. So he is probably not intended to lose it, so it was a little shock for him.
It's very cute as this happens back to this year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of the "smiling football" and reminds his mentor that Bennett St George Illawarra Dragons wins the First League in 2010 with "language" football.
Wayne speaks of slight football.
He compared his game at the afternoon with our Friday and how exciting it was her game," said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010 St. George was criticized as a long-term team, and Wayne said he would take care of him.
But now he has a team that can play and we look slightly, especially his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play when you have this type of players.
He did this speech in 2010, now he wants to play all his types of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like these.
I make stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a little worried to play against us.
6 weeks ago, they didn't think about us when it was about the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game storm against Roosters had a higher result than the game Broncos against Cowboys.
The game of Broncos was probably a good game, I didn't see it yet, but what was the result? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two further trials in our game, but is this a great game?
Or are pauss made and no points of shocking?
It's the game plans for me.
If they're thinking of us, it means that we're still going to meet them in a stage.
The Storm team has freely received the right of winning this weekend, or North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronule Sharks on the next afternoon in the AAMI Park. The ticket sale starts from the next service morning.
Serbian with $200,000 kitchen by drug accused
A man who might threaten a long-term punishment because of his attempt to come in the possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine struck by Queensland, has been released against a cup of $200,000.
Marko Maximvid, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found the Drug on the Yacht Solay, which came from South America about Vanuatu and engaged in Coomera in August.
Massimovic was observed how he met his mixed complaints during the Sunday and later at the coffee Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 pounds of drugs in a Toyota Echo.
Despite the possibility of a long-term punishment to have a commercial quantity of cocaine, the lawyer of Macmosvic argued that there was no evidence that he tried to have the whole amount and that in the coffee could have been a harmless reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was worried about the flight journey at Maximov.
He has clear relationships with Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often," he explained the Court on midnight.
In the crime case, he lied the police about his residence.
Maksimvic's mother and Stieffathers offered a cost of $200,000 together as a security to reach its release.
"After reading of the disadvantaged statements of the two persons, it is clear that the establishment of a security of $200,000 represents a real financial burden", said the judge Flanagan.
But this will not be enough to stop it, not appearing, he warned.
Maximvic was released against cupation, under the conditions that he departs his Australian and Serbian pass, reports to the police every day and takes himself to a starting stage of 18:00-06:00.
Cases at A5 at Karls Ruhe: Leader House travels out of each other
When a car three car cars with car 5 at Karls Ruhe, a car driver has been hardly injured at the service.
Two of the three cars involved were broken before a long building in the direction of Basel.
The third driver noted it too late and tried to exhibit the left in the last moment as the police communicated.
The leading house of the accident causer was completely different.
The driver was slowly blessed in a hospital.

Stevan Hogg used phones of girls to spend paedophiles for shipping images
A paedophyler used the phone for a 11-year-old girl to request images of child-use.
Stevan Hogg took the phone of the girl when he was sleeping in a online messenger service, from which he received a series of unreasonable pictures from children sent to him by another user.
The girl waited later and found that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping hogg.
She saw it, found the confused message and alarmed her mother immediately.
The police was careful about it and saw the five pictures, then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered "acceptable" web research, used the terms for searching for inadequate images of children.
Hogg then said to the officers that he did it because it would lead to "Pedophile on the Internet" and then he "predicted to be a police to fear it".
Mr. Eilidh Robertson said to the Dummy Sheriff Court: "He said it would be a search that he was sweet to fear people.
He told him that the search was carried out on his computer, but he said that it happened because he wanted to be a police for fearing paedophile.
He was asked after his conversation with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos.
He said he did it to save them.
He said he was sick in the head when he drinks, and he said he wanted to see pictures of murder and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "If the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was on the sitter and wine.
She also saw the inconsistent pictures on the phone and faced the accused of it.
The girl was interviewed and said that the detained computer and play station used to talk to the girls who were much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared in the sense of the appeal to have included unrespective pictures of children on the 14 June last year, to disfellowship on 25 January of this year and not to be a court's hearing on 24 March this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to appear in the register of sexual criminals because it could be argued that "no significant sexual elements" is in his act.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael dismissed the sentence until October to receive background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted in this case, but because of hearing to other cases that still exist, it was held in investigation.
He was included in the register of sexual criminals before the date of the judgment.
Slide users rise on small border transmissions to Germany
More refugees are being attacked outside the large control points at the German-Austrian borders.
Many students feared the discovery and arrest of people in smaller border transactions.
On the Austrian side, one speaker of the Federal Police.
During the border flow Inn, more than 1000 refugees were attacked in the landcraft Passau and Rottal-Inn from Tuesday.
They were reached on foot by bridges and shooters on the German side.
They will be taken in receipt by federal police and forwarded to registration.
In the Munchner Headquarters, federal police instructions were clearly entering more refugees in the afternoon compared to the start of the week.
Only 8 p.m were about 700 people in the head of the country, said a speaker in the morning.
After re-introduction of controls at the German-Austrian border, the city reached on Tuesday 1759 refugees.
Stuttgart: Tropens Turm "Henry" exhibits in the southwest
Meteorologists warn before stormboats in the south west of midnight.
The German Water Service (DWD) was shared in Stuttgart, because of a deep pressure area over Western Europe current warm sea journey in the country.
The strong depth is the exhibitor of the Tropen Turm "Henry", which was taken over the Atlantics in the past days of Bermuda.
Successful smile and shoes are expected primarily in bathrooms.
According to DWD, even until Thursday, it is also in the black wood to be counted on the Sweden Alb and on the ground sequence with trees from 60 to 90 hours.
On Friday, the sun can be seen again.
The mass is: Every two years the autobuilders show their news on the IAA.
2015 is mainly to compare the movement in the compact car that is currently specially sell.
Currently, cars from the compact class are particularly asked: round 28.1% of the receptions are disrupted according to the motor vehicle unit (KBA) alone in August.
This reflects also on the IAA (Publicity Day 17 to 27 September).
Among all future concept vehicles and new upper class and luxus cars are presented most of the new compact models in this year.
One of the greatest premiums for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be at the beginning of the handlers.
"The Astra is a very important model for us," said Opel Chief Karl-Thomas Newmann on the Messe.
He belongs to the brand nuclear.
In order to sell the volume model also, the new Astra should not also be much cut off.
Opel makes an increase under the largest competitive VW Golf, which starts 17,650 euros.
The current Astra costs 16 990 euros.
The Astra has a new 1,4 liter engine with 74 kW/100 PS.
Furthermore, the hessen offers other cellal and benzine engines from 70 kW/95 PS to 147 kW/200 PS, which are also the first time of counting threecylinder bends.
Instead of the main competitive VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is only five-towers.
The second variant will be followed in the early year of the combine, which is already seen on the IAA.
And what will happen next to the Astra on the IAA to new compacts?
Renault Megane: Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra-concurrent megan to the pensions.
On the messe, the Megan is only seen as five doors in a conventional and a substantial sporting GT version.
In the trade, he comes to the beginning of the next year, then as Combi.
Infiniti: All new in the segment is the Infiniti Q30.
The Nissan Ableger wants to find his position in the strong growing segment with the new model.
The compact Infiniti is fully entered into the design lines of the brand.
The basedell will receive a benzin engine with a performance of at least 90 kW/122 PS.
In the offer, however, there is also a cell with 80 kW/109 PS or 125 kW/170 PS.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, who celebrates his world prize in Frankfurt.
The model is designed with benzin engines, including a new 1.0-liter turboat engine and a performance of 82 kW/111 PS.
The maximum driving moment is based on manufacturing instructions at 170 Newton (Nm).
The Baleno start is in Europe in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not totally new but renewed, but the compakt class model DS4 is the compact class model 4. that is to see on the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the educated cytroen citrus mainly at the front party were put to the front: Here the cowlergrill was resigned and the changed strikes were equipped with LED technology.
In the internal space, especially the information system was modernized, which reduces the number of heads by a tube screen and integrates Apples CarPlay first.
In addition to the IAA in the compact class, a series of revisions and new variables such as Mercedes A class or Peugeot 308 GTI.
JVA Berlin tab: Fifth squaremeter cells are inhuman
The Federal Constitution Court has given the right to a former prisoner of the Judiciary of Tagel, which was undertaken in a too small cell for months.
In view of the infringement of their human rights, prisoners have basically a right to financial deterioration when they have been undertaken in small cells.
This has decided to the Federal Constitution Court in a decision published at midnight.
The applicants may even hope money if they were limited only a few days in the closed spaces (Article 1: 1 BvR 1127/14).
In this way, a former prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe succeeded: he was in the Berlin Headquarter of June to November 2009 in a single cell with about five square meters of the ground; the toilet was not spacely disappeared.
Then the man who, according to his lawyer, was re-freely in a larger cell again.
His sentence was denied for the unfair imprisonment against the country of Berlin.
However, the Constitutional Directors highlighted the judgment of the Chamber Court of Berlin and returned the case to the renewed test.
You see the human belief of the man.
Cammergericht now decides on the height of deterioration
Even if, for legal reasons of the questionnaire period, only a few days of prison for the deprivation, it is a compensation right, said it.
In other cases, "the sales of the law of personality should be feared."
The chambergericht must now clarify the amount of money damage.
The Constitutional Directors have already strengthened the rights of criminal prisoners in the past.
Thus, in April, they just spoke to a defect injury because he was locked into a cell.
Inhumanity is also a decision of 2011 the multi-specificisation of a cell without separate toilet.
Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitution Court on the midday, which had shown an unreasonable injury in a paralel accident in November 2009.
The current applicant was undertaken over three months daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the case of Karlsruher.
The Berlin prisons have also been in charge of lack of staff in the last few weeks.
The prisoners will therefore always be enrolled to 23 hours, increased aggressiveness, even to slaughterers, and they have already been in charge of the shocked situation.
After the judicial press office, 21 places have not been placed in Tegel because of lack of injury, 19 must be deleted in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We make it"
The immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the federal government has decided to accept it.
What happens to Germany?
800 000 asylum applicants will come to Germany this year after prognoses of the Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs in order to say Vizecanzler Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) is even able to include a million refugees.
The federal blogger Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated inconsistent challenge: "I say again and again: we can create it, and we do it."
What happens to Germany, the following overviews.
According to different prognoses, between 350000 (stimation of the Federal Development Ministry) and 400000 (stimation of the Pestel Institute) apartments are used annually - even for the next five years.
This is almost double as far as it is built (250000 apartments).
Dramatically, however, the lack of accommodation is mainly in payable meals: the yearly 60000 to 80000 social accommodations fall from the meal price connection, and these special favorable apartments will also require refugees.
For this reason, the Federal Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) wants to double the promotion, from now to a million of EUR 518 million.
Many too few of the Pestel Institute has been viewed: 800,000 social accommodations have to be taken annually and this should be a promotion of 6.4 billion per year.
Some of the scientists and federal departments have to provide more tax advantages for investments in the construction of households.
According to estimates of the Institute for Labour Market and Professional Research, 55% of the refugees in Germany can be acquired long-term.
However, the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked after their qualification to help them at the ingress, criticize Claudia Walter, Project Manager for Integration and Education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, for the integration of refugees, it is crucial to find work in Germany.
Work is the key for social contacts, for assessing the company's acquiring, but also for the self-value of migrants, Migration researcher Dietrich Thrnhardt says.
In Germany, Trinhardt has given it a political course: the ban for refugees to recognise work.
While it was previously banned for asylum applicants from up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the resident liability that the asylum applicant limits to a residence place.
In the society, even because of the expert failure, mostly the view that refugees should be allowed to access to the labour market.
A great deal for the access to the labour market is lacking German knowledge.
There is no sufficient offer for general and professional courses.
Research also shows that jobs are most often shared by personal contacts.
The construction of networks is therefore viewed by Trinhardt the king's way to work integration.
The Berlin School Management has found that only few refugeed parents give their children to the skilled, estimately 10 to 15 percent: "For the developed parents, it is only very important to keep the family together", says Ilja Koschembar, speakers for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Management.
However, to convince the family of the benefits of us, the management of hands is distributed in different languages.
If the need for researchers is strongly increased by large numbers of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase educational capacity, at least by allowing more educational schools.
In the countries, school students are prepared for the education in the German class.
However, they are not always taught by full-educated teachers and teachers, but also, as in Berlin, of teacher forces who have only a qualification in German as second language.
There is no fault to them, Beate Stoffs say from the Berlin School Management.
The German student work estimates that some 20% of the refugees want to study in Germany.
Principally no Federal Asylum applicationers or paciens undertaken the study - the only exception was until Berlin, the internal Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given its position.
Students voluntary refugees could be facilitated access to high school.
Because refugees with a residence or duty do not receive performance after the asylum application law when they start a study.
The latters are not obtained in the base of their bathrooms because they do not fall under the circle of the baptized persons.
Paved refugees had to live up to four years in Germany in order to be right to be BafÃ¶g, from 1 January 2016, this spane was reduced by 15 months.
However, this financing must also be closed, requested by Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the German student work.
The students should get bafÃ¶g immediately.
The Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many the religion is an important part of their identity.
The State should subsequently put the Islam the same rights as they have the churches, and further develop the existing State-Circ law into a new relationship with state religions.
It would also be important for the creation of a Islamic well-being association which is professionally careful for the new conventions.
The rights are also responsibilities.
Thus, the representatives of the Islam must be ready to work with the State in many areas and make certain control opportunities.
This is also the disposal of being protected against religious fundamentalism.
The President of the Muslim Central Council, Aiman Mazyek, expressed the concern that religious conflicts could also be joined in Germany on Thursday.
Those who wanted to execute such conflicts in Germany "he had immediately their right to pursue here, in Germany," he said in the Bahrian Rundfunk.
He proposed to translate the basic law to the Arabian.
Integration will be more than today a subject of the whole society.
In order to change the majority of society, the reduction of discrimination and racism will also be increased.
However, Germany has, as a result of European decisions - a anti-discrimination body and a general equality law since a few decades.
But it learns very slowly how the NSU murder series showed that the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motivation.
Similar opportunities for all: what migratory organizations and interest groups of non-profit Germans have already been called for and what international agreements like the Anti-Russism Convention in the next years must be reality if the country remains peacefully and its new citizens and citizens should use their opportunities for the well-being of all.
Generally, Germany has been able to give medically expected refugees, says Dr. Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"What man power and capacity we do", he said to the day level.
However, additional money should be flown into the system.
To avoid enthusiasming, Montgomery calls for the same access to all competitors to the registration of health cards.
Exercised performances could be calculated later with the federal countries.
And long-termly it should be the most fragile to consider so many people with the limited performance catalogue that prescribes the Asylum application law.
Instead, the doctors make the language barriers primarily.
Until now, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has indicated that migrants are more devastated than other patients.
Not only in clinics, even in doctoral practices, dolmetsher costs should be administered.
However, many refugees would also be helped with more general medical routines in emergency ammunition.
And with another diagnostic view.
Under refugees, it is almost clearly more untrained disorders, and in the youths it goes about HIV explanation.
With the other illness images, German doctors come from their training clearly, says Montgomery.
"It isn't so hard to recognise the illness of the physicians."It is possible by the refugees to even relief.
The Syrians had a high-scale education system, some refugees were even doctors.
However, in order to practice, they should be able to prove their qualifications and, where possible, delay tests.
At least half of the refugees arrived in Germany, according to estimates of the federal psychotherapeutic chamber (BPtK) is psychologically sick: most suffering under posttraumatic load disorder or depression.
In particular, the refugee skiller, Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recent study of TU Munchen pointed out that every fifth Syrian refugee kid has been traumated in Germany.
Those who are ill to posttraumatic loading disorders, among others are the so-called Flashbacks with respiratory, skin, heart race and death.
Additional symptoms are sleep and concentration disorders, strong horribleness and emotiveness.
To prevent the chronic symptoms, if necessary for early treatment, Munz declared.
However, only four per cent of the psychologically sick refugees receive a psychotherapy.
Although psychologically sick asylum requesters can make a request for a psychotherapy, the treatment is almost a few months.
Furthermore, in the social employees, most experts or doctors who are not trained for psychological diseases would decide whether therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to lack of assessments, says Munz.
Manege calls for dreams
With the new "Leadership" insertion, the Circus Probst returns to the traditions of the circumcision art.
The objective is to move every age group into the banks of fascinating acrobatics, animal clothes and individual Entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst enters the hands on the hill to dream.
"Our suffering is the circus."
"I can't imagine without living my circumcision family," said Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and Juniorchefin.
"Leidence" - under this engine is the current manipulation.
For more than 33 years the circus is in the hands of the family Probst.
So the family is in the blood.
"We are important to get people away from their daily trail and to take them into a entirely different world for two hours," stressed the 27-year-old Juniorchefin.
"Manegencocktail with World City Flair", says Director Reinhard Probst.
50 cities on the area of about 3,000 km long tours can now experience this flat.
The circus program is convinced with talented artists from the world.
The Russian Stoliarov Clown Family has the public with witz and charme in their banks.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their handwork.
With the heroes of the stomach films it wants to take the Cuban Duo locker.
Facility and movement - they are identified with these words.
Your humorable art on the mast will be able to stir the women's storm.
In addition to many lachsalves, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinates with finger pepper feelings and flexibility.
Ballar with the random on a ball?
There's no problem for He Yuan.
Fascinating and fearing smells.
Wang Lin from China, with the oldest form of the acrobatics, is like little other and fascinated with their movement.
60 employees from 12 nations offered diversity in each regard.
"The animals belong to our family," Stephanie Mother, Brigitte Provst.
Disorders in the situation of circumcises are often subjects in various animal protection organisations.
Stephanie Probst also believes: "If our animals are not good, it's not good to us."
round 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each strike unit.
The "treeping artists", as they are lovely called, will read every desire from the eyes, if possible.
We want to work together with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn't smell, it doesn't want to be in the manege.
So the top command is good to care for the animals.
Specially on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture from a ShetlandPonyhengst and a Zebrastote, the family is proud.
The two animals have lived together for eight years in a walk and nothing happened.
"And then, soon, our little jumbo was there", says Brigitte Provst.
The cebroid is not yet ready for the hand, but it is the unique mask of the Circus Probst.
So for each visitor, there should be something there.
" One is safe," said Stephanie Probst, "we always give our best and are with all the hearts."
The Circus Probst takes place from 17 to 20 September every day at 17 and 20 p.m. to his ideas.
On Sunday, the program begins at 11 and 16 p.m.
Thursday is Family Day, for the idea at 17:00 p.m. prices are reduced.
Moreover, every day the animal view is opened from 10 to 18 p.m.
Simbabwes Robert Mugabe holds false speech in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, the older African leader, started the year from a podium.
He remained unfaithful, but the video of the case quickly spread about social media.
The opening of the Parliament was also understood by appealing by Members of the opposition that they had received an anonymous death threats and that they were warned to accompany Mr Mugabe's debate with Buh.
In the past month, they were shocked him and interrupted him during his speech to the situation of the nation in the Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The speaker of the movement of democratic change (Movement for Democratic Change - MDC) Innocent Gone said that seven opposition-political SMS messages have received on their phones that they warned to destroy Mr. Mugabes conversation.
"The message comes from a number that is not shown, but she has the title 'Tod'," he said journalists after Mugabes talk.
She warns the Members concerned that immunity ends in Parliament, and when it leaves the Parliament, its parliamentary immunity is not more effective.
The chief speaker said that the party conducted by Msvangirai was "inquired" about the dangers for the politicians.
Hewlett packard will be reduced to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and recovery efforts in the services of the company.
In this year, HP will be shared in two bursened companies and shared the computer and printer business from its rapidly growing company hardware and its service business.
The expected plant rebuilding leads to a load of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"This restructuring measures will allow a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise", said Meg Whitman, HP President and Chief Executive, which should lead the unit after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger focused than it is today HP, and we have a wide and deep portfolio of business supporting companies to a new style of business", Whitman said.
As a own company, we are better set than ever before to satisfy the changed needs of our customers throughout the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has been concentrated for more than $50 billion annual sum and "It will be on the preparation until now inadequate, integrated technologie solutions for companies", says a statement of the company.
It distributes a company founded by Stanford University Hewlett and Dave Packard in the 1930s to create electronic installations and called Pallo Alto Garage the "the birth place of the Silicon Valley".
HP has run a massive restructuring to control the delay of traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The measure of HP, the second-wide PC manufacturers and one of the largest US Tech companies worldwide, is the latest in this area that is based on the conviction that closely focused companies make better performance.
FC Arsenal Capital Mikel Arteta says that teams are collected before the game against Dynamo Zagreb, behind the blessed Jack Wilshere
Wenger emphasized Wilshere that it is just September and if his re-accession goes after plan, there is no reason why he can't play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will be safe to at least the next four games for England, and in view of his history, his participation in the next summer in Europe's mastership is still uncertain.
The great tribulation to this current problem is that Wilshere had strongly completed the last season after a separate shock injury and then returned to his old slowness during the presidence.
"This kind of injury does not threaten the carriage," Wenger said.
It's a skin that didn't heal.
This is not greater.
This was just a accident.
It was not connected to his shocks or to the injuries that he had before.
This may be true from pure medical view, but as Wenger also recognised, there is the risk of further injuries, even if a player tries to return to the midst of the season.
It also developed an unfortunate pattern.
The survey of Premier Injuries Ltd represents 23 different diseases of Wilshere since his debout six years ago.
He also played only 65 by Arsenals 157 links in the last five game times.
The larger image for Arsenal is that they were in six of eight playtimes since 2007/08 one of the two first League Clubs that have generated most of the days of fertilization.
Wenger accepts the potential of a demon circle, but Arsenal believes that a improvement in the damage rate will continue during the last season.
"Atimes when you come back from an injury, you have an accidental period, a time in which you need to strengthen your body and win the strength of the fighter," Wenger said.
Jack's enough to overcome this.
I hope his body is stabilized, I'm convinced that he's gonna do it and he'll go through a career of the way he wins.
Arsenal begins his Champions League season on midnight against Dinamo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on the next midday, and Wenger has a rotation within the team.
Hector Bellerin and Aaron Ramsey are not going to Croatia, which means that Matthieu Debooky and Arteta should start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Subo Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and the players that it needs to give a small swimming break," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is clear preferences to continue by group F, the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the playing places with the greatest counter-efficacy effect in Europe.
Dynamo has also been shocked after 41 games after the "unacceptable" campaign was started in the last season.
The stage was shocked on Thursday night by a earthquake, measured on the board 3.2.
This year was 10 in Zagreb.
Nevertheless, Arsenal believes that the teachings from the past season with the Champions League Captulation against Monaco and remained deeply hoped to lead the Agreement to its first European Population Triumph.
"These squad is immense," Wenger said.
It has never been shocked with Arsenal.
We were very close to this in 2006, but on the other side, I'm enough in business to be realistic.
We're honest, but we're not dreams.
FriendsFest: the Comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men's friendships
The lack of similar exhibitions in show is obvious, especially in terms of how the need for men to open up is now more doubtful than ever before, how self-mortals under young men have proved in a 15-year-old home.
In 2013, it was the most important death cause for men in the age of 20 to 45 in Britain, and there are three times more often in men than women.
In order to address the problem, the Against Living Miserably campaign announced 2015 as the year of the man to ask the culture of men to help if they need it.
friendship is the heart room in the fight to master this challenge.
A present study in more than 2.000 high school students with depressive symptoms observed that, if the sufferer had sufficiently higher percentage of friends with "sufficed stimulation", his chances were doubled on genesis.
For those who are not depressive, half a circle of spiritually healthy friends is the risk of mental problems.
But, of course, you need to have friends only to work with friendship.
In the age of the social media communication, with its main point on the style of substance, the inevitability of the response is often more important than an important contact.
Our digital life has doubled the need for strong, living and successfulness, even if in reality the isolation dominates.
This overwhelming success is dominated by what psychologic values call for extreme values; money, image, social status, everything on costs of intrinsic values - our internal search for personal development and friendship, which is more effective on our spiritual health.
And as a video game finger and a billioner recently explained, money can't really be bought.
The nice to friends was that this focus was put on the head.
Each character was not defined by his work, but by his personality, who was a friend by the interaction.
The Humor of Joey and Chandlers's frequent surroundings, moments at football balls in a measuring sessel and the shock of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can take care of it at any time, even though they often have to find out their feelings completely.
As an employee of the phone seal, it explained me: "My role of listening to people who feel depressive and self-domicide has shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
Those who contact us often do not feel able to talk to friends.
The old word "I come right to it" has a huge effect, like the feeling that it will be treated as weak when you are talking about problems openly."
Friends is one of the shows that comes to me when I try to offer longer-crisis mechanisms.
It is very clear to the small moments of men's friendships.
So very much of my objective foreign seat status on the phone can also help people at the moment of dismissing, providing long-term support from a personal family network and friends.
And so, if you visit the Comedy Central Friend Festival with the completely newed arts for the day's holiday, why don't you then take your friends to a drink in the Central Perk.
Or even better if you see someone alone in Starbucks, give him a laugh and say hell.
You never know how different your friendship could make.
friends are sent to Comedy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
From Mary to help PSG to smell the smell
Angel Di Maria celebrates Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his face against MalmÃ¶.
The Maria's debtor is in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to take place to MalmÃ¶.
Here are the game report and the reaction on the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani took course when Paris Saint-Germain began his Championships League Saison with a very comfortable 2-0 winning against MalmÃ¶ in the Prince Park station on Tuesday.
From Maria, less than four minutes after the start of his Championship League DebÃ¼ts as a PSG player who led the French master on the path, but then they passed a number of occasions before they finally increased their prize as Cavani reached a headballtor in the 61th minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachjor Donezk, also in the Group A, Paris also needs a strong start against the Swedish Master, since they are not only trying to qualificate the K.O.R. but to improve the path to the fourth ends in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they saw the points, it was not the class game of Laurent White's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic's chances before the gate. He was later changing in the game against his hometown team and the agreement with which he started his illustrious career in 1999.
"It isn't easy to win home or outside in the Champions League. It is therefore a good start to win 2:0 to cause our enemies' problems and to smile back, even if there are certain things that we still need to perfectize in the course of the season," said White.
"This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I would be sure that we have not reached one or two more towers."
Ibrahimovic returned in one of the three changes in the Paris team, which was able to keep a 2:2 indecisive on his own place against Bordeaux in the First Liga, but he was cut by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentinian flight tour was called the man to take PSG to the next stage in Europe when he was taken to Manchester United in the last month, and he asked why he entered into Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malmoo defence before he was beautiful in the long trail of the network.
However, if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, he was disappointed.
MalmoÃ¶, the Celtic was in a play-off to reach this stage, with an appiff with nine national players on the field and was with a five-man defence and two deeply in the Mediterranean.
But except a shooting of Nikola Djurdjic, who passed far from Kevin Trapps Pfosten in the 34th minute, offered little in the attack.
Instead, PSG has sometimes been opened with some defects and defects, not lastly by Ibrahimovic, which was not less than five attempts alone in the first half and then was set after Cavani had used him after the new start.
However, he showed much more sentence when he brought his players into the game, and it was a passage of Ibrahimovic, who transformed Di Maria into a shooting shooting, whose Wiland was overlooked in the 52th minute...
The second gate ended short after the hourmark thanks Cavani. The Uruguayr reached his sixth saisontor after Ibrahimovic was shocking a left flanke of Maxwell.
This ended all of the thoughts that Malmoo could return to the game, and only an excellent invasion of Wiland from the shortest removal to stop David Luiz, it could keep the end out before the replacement players Ezequiel Lavezzi had been discovered at the end.
The trainer of MalmÃ¶, Age Harede, later acknowledged that PSG played a class about his team, and the Norwegians said: "The last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish Liga who did not have the same level.

World and Europe Master Xavi plays since summer 2015 for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Katar

In the summer, the average 35-year-old boys left the FC Barcelona and changed to the al-Sadd sport club to catar.
However, in an interview with the Marca, Xavi now engaged that he was before the 2008 C.E., before the adoption of Barcelona.
"There were told me that Barza wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything then, we're nothing," he said.
And it also recorded the FC Bayern.
Xavi: " There was a offer of Bayern."
"Rummenigge wanted to have me."
Remember: In summer 2008 JÃ¼rgen Klinsmann overlook the FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason that Xavi did not change
But the changing came not.
And the exhibited man today works for the German register: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "BarÃ§a has taken a treaty under Guardiola and I have played a wonderful EM."
"Pep told me that I wouldn't change that he could not imagine the manity without me."

Matt Damon plays Vielfalt in the film creating down
Matt Damon faced the African filmmaker Effie Brown during a debate on the diversity and said that it would not be necessary behind the cults.
During a summary of Sunday Night by HBOs Project Greenlight, the experienced player Brown highlighted the need for alternative perspectives, even with regard to a black protagonist in the chosen threshold book of the project.
"When we talk about diversity, then do it when the movie is designed and not at the vision of the show," said Damon.
Brown responded shocked, with political unbelieves, and called "Hoo! Wow. OK" when the comments of the Martian player were established.
Damon and Brown closed the producer colleagues Ben Appleck and the Farrelly Brothers to discuss the show-finalists.
"I want to ask people to think about - whoever will always be the government - how they treat the figure of the Harmony," said Brown first.
The only black person, and she's a nut that is shocked by her white addictor.
The producer of Dear White People took place for the finalist Leo Angelos and Christian Brancaccio for the region's rights; Damon said that their region "in the end could give us something we don't want".
After the debate was exhausted, the social media were explosed before the missing of Damons comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni pressed his wrath over the clip by writeing "Matt Damon speaks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain its diversity - it's SO WEISS that it hurts."
The twitter won more than 5,000 reserves and 4.000 likes since its publication.
Madam comments are at a time when the accurate racial representation in the media is at the top of the social debate.
After the teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the movement of Black Lives Matter has reached a large country-wide effect and enlarged legislators and authorities to order discriminatory practices against coloring content.
In February the Singer Prince made an appeal to the movement during the introduction of the named alves of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black life, Alben still have their importance.
In recent times, leaders of the movement Black Lives Matter have published a statement, as reaction to the question of the Fox-News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered as a Hass group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a group of love," the leaders said.
Recently, Damon was announced on a list of Entertainers, Producers and Media Mogules that were invited to visit the pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West.
If he has accepted the invitation or already taken the pope, it's not clear.

According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there's more than a finalist, it's got it with the fastest time," Weed said.
How much the money is a wonderful price and life changes, it receives the wonderful graphics.

A two-Out Walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game that created a single "up the middle" at the first round of the game.

No food fruit - Mango contains a lot of sugar
Mangos are exotic and sweet.

Because Mangos contains relatively much sugar - especially saccharose.
Nevertheless, the exotic fruits are healthy: B vitamines and vitamins E and C. mainly Mangos include a lot of vitamin A and its prestigious beta-karotine.
Those who eat the fruits are therefore supported by visual strength, immune system and substance exchange processes in the body.
When purchase, Mangos should not be sweet or fixed and smiling.
The skin color only tells nothing about how riif is the fruit - so also green mango can smile very sweet.

Rom has a Martin-Luther-platz now.
About 500 years after reform, there is now a Martin-Luther platz in Rome.
In the presence of the city president Ignazio Marino, in the middle of the night, a nameless place in the park was baptized on the Oppio bull on the name of the German reformer.
On the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now acknowledged as "Germany theologists of reform".

Hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus is one of the main works that Otmar Alt has made for his Bible.
Klaus Oldpost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
The word was at the beginning?
No, not at the Otmar Old Bible, which is now appearing with precious images.
At the beginning, the image of Otmar Alt was formulated in 150 reasons for his completely personal interpretation of Bible stories on paper and lenwand.
His "speak" with good colors and fantastic forms has received the 75-year-old boys - but no way is equal to "speaking" images.
On the other hand, the adjustment of the subjects may affect the deepest effect by right.
round three years Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project, for which he took a subjective-artist selection from the many themes areas of the "Bucks All Books".
Reconciliations are cycles that are subjects such as crossways, packs, orders or paternal.
In this way, he spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther's link with his theological orientation as well as to the Kettler's link with its main point on art books.
And in particular there is the author Klaus Oldpost, who, on the basis of the Maleria, was separated with the Scriptural entities.
He interpreted the scripture chosen by Otmar Alt and thus in today, in the current "translated".
These texts are like verbal mirror of Alts Malerei.
They are accompanied between the original Bible quote of Martin Luther and every one of the artists who forms his entire personal thoughts on the situation.
The smuggling band has golden letters.
This allows the 75-year-old boy to double a deep view in his soul, his emotions.
This is a high measure of intimity.
Emotions were finally solved for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, 1940 in Wernigerode and growing in Berlin, comes from a family that heard the strict protestant Lordhuter orders.
"There was the education with the shock," Otmar Alt recalls.
"I've tried to work this to put me back with the Lord's father."
His second concern is to help the art in fast-level time again to more place values: "The entitlement of image worlds is present today by advertising, and it is sound.
Iconics are disrupted there.
Artists have another joy and desire to show things.
Images are always secret and are not decorative.
"In this regard, I am a dinosaurer."
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to allow "infalls" images to affect, discover and feel which strength they have: "This image is looking for its opposite."
Klaus Oltepost was held on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt Bible in the Otmar-Alt Foundation, "whoever" loved Otmar Alt's art: "I like it understands life with his images."
Alt has not seen the Bible fully, but the important, secret topics for him.
"This was not cooperation at the height of the eyes," Old Post says, "This is about the images, the text explains lyly." Reconciliation is a picture Bible.
For Hans MÃ¶hler of Luther's Blood, this work is an invitation to "develop his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alt's images speak for masters both the (biblic) language of love and the responsibility.
A part of the original paper and lenging images - first is presented in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Otmar-Earth Foundation.

"The refugee dram is on every one, no one can get away."

Germany, after the will of the Federal Government, is to be the changing of the car of technological President.
The Federal Kabinett decided at midnight a strategy paper from the House of Ministers of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which, among other investments in the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on midnight in Frankfurt on the border of the IAA's Automesse from a "new mobility visitor".
The automated and connected routes will increase transport security and care for less steel, said Dobrindt.
He also wants to discuss the subject with its official colleagues from the G7 States, which also joined with representatives of the industry in the IAA.
The strategic paper of the Ministry of Transport highlights the importance of the mobile broadband construction and a sufficient increase in digital hearing.
To try new technology, a test track is currently on the 9-way car station in Bayern.
In order to "no additional debt risks", the federal government will examine the legal framework conditions and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments.
As a result, Germany wants to make the maximum speed for self-driving cars up to 10 to 130 km.
The Federal Government also wants to introduce a change in the Vienna Convention, which is only a driver to people.
In automaticized drives, the car takes the drive, the driver becomes more and more to the passenger.
The technology is especially based on sensors and cameras that cover the environment and process data in seconds speed.
After a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy, high automaticized drives will be technologically possible until 2020.
Nevertheless, without vehicles on public roads are to be expected for the first time after 2020.
The value of the driving systems and the high-speed automated driving functions on the location of Germany are estimated by the authors of the study for 2025 to about 8,4 billion euros.
"The digital connection of the Pkw can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic", said the SPD marketing policy SÃ¶ren Bartol.
The question of the accusation of accidents and the security of the personal data of the driver should, however, be clearly cleared.
However, German automobiles are still skeptical - more than French or Americans.
A survey of the Forsa Institute on the midnight of the AA is found that only eight percent of the Germans believe that autonomy drivers will be carried out in the coming ten years, 32 percent only claimed in 20 years so that 31 percent do not believe it.
In France, 21 percent of the respondents have been able to 2025 with autonomy cars, 33 percent in the United States.
Indeed, the drivers in Germany are not ready to leave completely on a self-driving vehicle.
After receiving the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to delay controls on all roads.
In the cars, it could be 15% in the flight, 45% in the shipping car.
Good every fourth would leave the control under no circumstances.

Gaultier feels too old for a child
It is a mixture of a large modern view and a guard graphic box: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) has presented an exhibition in Munchen at midnight.
The height points: creating pockets, which appear to be humanly horrible thanks to video projections.
It takes the spectacular creatures of the French designer, which, among other things, became the large star of the modescene, and so that he stood men in a rock.
"I can't say today that I'm the bad child of the skin cotuer because I have white hair."
"Free was possible, here it's true," said Gaultier.
For the visitors of the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (for citizens on the course of 18 September), which is to see in the art of the Hypo culture, it is a chance that the Modelor has changed its initial refusal position to a look over his person.
In fact, if he had been, he said, "As a spectrum is a moment after death," he said.
If you die, you're coming to the museum.
The impressive collection had already been made in the Canadian Montreal and in Paris Station.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the Director of the Artsthale, Roger Diederen.
It goes about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exponents give a view in the unexpected work of the man who has written modest history to have never completed a training.
Chronologically, the look is not built, but it is an excellent choreographed whole work, for which a lot has been used: To fresh the powders, for example, a stylist was involved.
14 tonnes of materials the machines have been carded by the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot by Munchen.
Shortly before the October Festival, there was a special smell: a leder hose orphit with corsett.
Heydi meets Madonna.
He's always interested in strong women ("Women are weak than men") and for people who are a little different, said Gaultier.
Gaulier's old Teddy is also to see in the exhibition.
It is for the first, visible moderate course of the designer.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in the football) he took his teddy BHs and clothes, said Gaultier.
With a puppe, his parents wouldn't have allowed him.
The decrease of mode later he taught himself.
He stood models and saw the designers of other designers as Gaultier told in Munchen.
Afterward, I've pursued it.
For his first modern view, he didn't have to pay the models.
They found nothing, but they keeped the clamps.
Smuck instead of Gardine - Pluener sweet as mod-nice
Before it went to the long strike machines and to swim to make metros.
The stored substances and pictures consisted in large numbers of customers who were processed for example in cows and gardens.
This does not work only today, says Andreas Reinhardt, the leader of the modern pizza Plueen.
Instead, the mode is again important.
In the early times of the Pluener Spitze Mode played a greater role, then the home textile industry was slowed - and now it is recovered than Nice.
Reinhardt calls some examples: pitzes in Smuck, accessoires such as bags and regional negotiations.
The so-called Vintage model, which refused to defeat style pockets, was an increased assignment potential.
Those who do not dwell in the textile sector in Germany are no longer on the market.
They're already doing half of all contracts with us.
Modespitze Plauen is together with nine other companies member of the Branch Association Plautener Spitze and Stickerea.
Only they can take the protected label.
In the past 15 years, about 80 percent of the transfer have been deleted.
Private business and even the big trade there is almost no longer.
Our products have not yet reached the customers in this way.
The massage ware is produced in Asian space more slightly and almost expenditure by kits.
Moreover, the export weaks, currently to Russia and to the United States.
So there are reasons for new ways.
The Branch Association also tries to point out through environmental consciousness, as Cordula Bauer says from the Stickperle in Falkenstein: "We lead a quality seal that shows that we are ecological and socially produced".
Reinhardt adds: "This also refers to the materials used."
Diplome designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Sneeberger Foreign Area of the Western Zwickau High School - at the Faculty for Used Art - and is specialized on Stickerees and Spitzens.
In order to put some competitiveness from Asian space, you must find high-quality and innovative products.
That needs time and courage.
It emerges in a shock between the most fresh ideas of designers and the companies, especially economically thinking", says Schmidt.
Therefore, a existing design is often only easy to keep a customer party.
A few years ago, the historical snowball sneeball designer Kati Reuter renewed.
Thus the machine sets a few places of small kitchens.
The Plater Golden Meeting Master Bianca Hallebach was inspired by this: "I couldn't start with traditional pitzes."
Now she uses the sneeball piece for her sweet.
In an ongoing procedure, she presents the template in silver.
"My people in the region are identified with the theme Plautener Spitze - young and old," says Reuter.
It also provides to the United States, to Australia and Finland - especially to customers who have lived in places and environments, and who want to be a memorandum.
So I see my smuck as the modern messager of the Plauener Spitze.
Disney plant new "Mary Poppins" film
Nevertheless, Disney's new movie of his classic "Mary Poppins".
However, "Entertainment Weekly" is not a new film, but a type of continuation that plays 20 years after the first film with the magic kids.
It's about the experiences of Nanny's family Banks at the time of World Economic crisis in England.
Who plays Poppins over 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unexpected.
But the government is already firm: Rob Marshall, lastly with "Into the Woods" in China.

EU wants to duplicate Quecksilber greenness in Raubfish
The European Commission wants to duplicate the border values for cocktails in large rawfish rabbits and to encourage consumers to make a significant increase in the nervous rate.
The Foodwatch consumer organization, which provides a corresponding EU work paper, criticized the plans: "The risks and side effects of the prevented industrial and environmental policy are being continued fullly at the weight of pregnant and small children," said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
In accordance with Wolfschmidt, the border values of the Nerven Guide for Great Fish at the end of the food chain, such as Haie or Scheme fish from one to two milligrams of cocksilber per kilogram fish.
The great raubfishes, however, have already been so strong with cocksilbers that, on the basis of the still existing limit values, about 50% of the fleet should not be sold.
After duplicating the limit values, only 14.5 per cent would be insecure.
In contrast to this packaging, the EU, according to Foodwatch, wants to increase border values in other fishes from now 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of checksilver per kilogram.
Foodwatch called this as "Tryck" because smaller friedfish, like some cards are usually so low, that they have already maintained the maximum values planned today.
The decrease in small fish is therefore "a perfide decrease man, which helps the economy alone", explained Wolfschmidt.
Checksilber is one of the humans of high-good steel metals, which is higher than the food chain, especially in the rawfish.
The federal government is therefore warned that "also low amounts are able to cause injuries of the nervous system".
The Federal Environment Ministry declares on its homepage as regards the maximums available, but it is not expected that a "sancient risk of general population" is not expected.
Checksilders, especially through carbon inflation in the environment.
The German coal power works, based on a written outcome of the Federal Environment Ministry, at the Green Day, Annalena Baerbock was more than six tons of checksilber in the year, two thirds of the total amounts emited in Germany.
The concentration of cocksilber in fishing in the Elbe, Rhein and Donau was "should and slowly over," the "slicegel" was sent out of the paper in March.
In the past year, European warnings for checksilver in fish were among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RASFF.
