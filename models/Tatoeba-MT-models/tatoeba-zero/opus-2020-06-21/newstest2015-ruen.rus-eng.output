scientists have found way to discover the family stars
Astrophysicians from the University of California in Santa Cruz have studied a careful transition and its impact on chemical unity in star collections.
The opening of specialists is expected to enable parents to find out among the stars, which are from one class.
The results of their research were published in Nature magazine, and they can be found on the University website.
The same chemical component of the nearest stars is a careful movement in the gas areas pre-education of the stars.
Even if the born star then leaves the star class, a chemical composition may be determined by its birth and region of the astronomy education.
The previous scientists doubt that the evolution of the star outside the class may lead to the appearance of the differences in its chemical content from such a family in the class.
The results of the astronomic models show that such differences should not appear.
In its study, specialists with supercomputer modelled two inter-state gas flows, which together formed the cable.
This object during a few million years is converted to a classer that begins to form a tray star.
Scientists added the specimens in the original gas flows and established that by rapidly enhanced transmission, the area reached a high level of chemical unity.
As astrophysics consider, their research proves that they can search for chemical stars and to determine possible educational regions of such objects.

As regards the answers of our measures in the case of the new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I'm not even going to talk, to fantasize, because everything must be specifically covered, he said.
And when we understand what the European and American partners will like, then we will decide how to answer it.
This will not be related to the men's doors, some of the two falsely understood, - emphasized the Minister.
We will, above all, disappear from our interests, interests to protect our economy, social area, our citizens, our business, and make conclusions from partners' actions to their adequateness, contractability and trust.
In this way, sanctions steps may be very well judged about what partners are doing, continued the head of the FMI.
If in the whole voice says, "They will be sanctions too ill for us, but we're forced to go to Russia to make it so that it's probably not very suitable."

The very American idea of working rights is human rights
The Congressmen of China Allison and John Luise proposed a draft legislation which is protected as civil law.
"When the professions are there and the workplaces of the Middle Class", says Ellison, democracy from Minnesota, who is the co-president of the Congress of the Progressive Fraction.
This is why I am proud of submitting the Act on the Expansion of the Rights of Workers together with the symbol of movement for civil rights by John Luiz.
This innovative legislation project will provide workers the same legal possibility as in discrimination to the organization of professionals, as well as in other forms of discrimination stopping the force of professionals
Amendment to the Law on Labour Relations so that employees with discrimination to participate in the workshops, search for justice in civil courts, and compensation of damage and cost payments, a reasonable and necessary initiative.
However, this is not a radical initiative - at least, in American standards.
Indeed, the best way to consider what Ellyson, Louise and the counterparts of the draft legislation are to remember the very American idea.
Despite the attacks in the past few years, the Americans in Viskonsyn, Michigan and other countries have ever supported the whole world in order to adopt, expand and respect the labour rights.
It was time to remember millions of Americans when the country was simultaneously protected the democracy, the freedom of words, the freedom of print and the right to organization.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Dugol McArthur and his assistants helped the country to take a Constitution designed to ensure that the armed Hideki Todz has been replaced by democracy.
The full understanding that employees and their professionals play a role in the formulation of a new Japan, they included the text, which directly recognized that " the right of workers to organize and negotiations and the collective action is guaranteed".
When the United States occupied Germany after the Second World War, General Duyd David Eisenhawr and his assistants helped the Germans to write a Constitution which ensured that the fasism of Adolf Hitler was replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that the employees would have to organize and be heard in the new State, the Germans included a article that openly stated: " Happy to train associations to protect and improve employment and economic conditions will be guaranteed to each person and to each professional or field of activities.
The agreements that limit or attempt to defeat this right will not have legal force; the measures aimed at these purposes will be recognized contrary.
When the former Lady Eleanor Ruizell was Chairman of the International Commission on Human Rights, which was the World Declaration on Human Rights, adopted in 1948 the Organization of United Nations as a global agreement, Ruizelt and its composers were ensuring that " every person had the right to organize and engage in prostitution for the protection of their interests".
Populations of the Americans accepted as a fundamental position that the rights of work are human rights.
When the country has consulted other countries about how to create civil and democratic society, the Americans explained that the right to the organization of professionals was to be protected as an equal partner in collective negotiations with corporations and government institutions.
Now, when these rights are attacked in America, it is wise to return to the American idea that workers must have the right to organize and to hear their voice in a free and open society.
As a favorite Martin Luther King, he said 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that professional movement did not affect the force of the country but increased them.
Increasing the living levels of millions, professionals were wonderfully established the market for industry and increased the entire nation at an unfavorable level of production.
Those who attack professions forget these simple truths, but the story will remember them.
The story will remember how we should.
Official recognition of labour rights as human rights and the enlargement of civil rights in order to prevent discrimination against the organizations of professions for a long time.
Kit Allison and John Lewis are born the ideas that have historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy.
The judge temporaryly blocks the law that could close all abnormal clinics in Louisiana
In the United States, the Federal Court has temporaryly blocked the introduction of the law of Louisiana, which said its parties that he may probably close all five abnormal clinics in the State.
According to this measure, which was signed to the execution of the Governor of Louisiana Bobbie Dynadle in June and should enter into force on 1 September, the doctors who do abortions would have the authority of receiving patients in the hospital at 30 miles from their practices.
However, the judges will mean that at the present time the doctors may continue to do legal abortions by continuing searching for such powers.
“It will be allowed to work legally, continued to receive authority” wrote the judge John de Gravels in his decision.
The hearing will be appointed within a month in which the judge shall make a more continuous decision under that law.
Defenders of the right to abortion had met this decision recently against similar measures, saying that it would give the doctor more time to receive hospital powers.
"Annual decision guarantees that women of Louisiana will be protected from a covasive law which is trying to leave their health and rights," said Nancy Nortop, President and leader of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, which has issued the search for the suspension of the law from three of the five clinics of the State.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision was related to doctors from two clinics who did not speak in this case and made a statement to the admission authority.
Louisiana includes 11 States that have adopted such laws and recently recognized such non-constitutional measures in Alabama and Mission.
The key part of the Tays law, which would close most of the remaining clinics in the State, were blocked by the Federal Court on Friday.
The fighters on the right to abortion, together with the American Acoushers and Ginekologists and the American Medical Association, said that the laws on the acceptance of authority are the doctors who do not need to be medically limited.
Adverse adverse reflect that such measures are aimed at protecting women ' s health, although some have also noted their positive effects in closing clinics.
Only one physician who made abortions in Louisiana has the authority of receiving in the hospital, reported the Centre on Reproductive Rights.
If all the other doctors in the State are required to stop implementing this procedure, the doctor, fearing for his security, would stop implementing the procedure, reported the group.
The criticism of this decision, the representatives of the Louisians said that they would not be punished by the doctors who made abortion until their claims were awaiting the decision.
What will introduce the cube to the substances
At least half of the products in each kind of trade networks must be Russian production, and it is considered by Mrs. Gosmen from the "Speaking Russia" fraction of Olympic.
The parliamentary has prepared a draft law aimed at introducing protected measures towards manufacturers, writes the Newspaper.
The document will still be detailed to avoid the possible disk for buyers.
This applies to goods not produced in Russia. The other groups of products that are produced in Russia must provide at least half of its parts to the individual producers,” reported Nicola.
However, amendments under Article 10% of the Act on the basis of the Government of Trade Regulations in the RF are the amendment to the Tax Code establishing a decrease rate of 10% in the implementation of the products produced in Russia.
The idea to introduce 50 per cent of the coat in trade networks includes the stimulating package for Russian producers.
The devices appear in a number of times more inherent goods.
However, the initiative may have positive and negative effects, says experts.
According to the Advocate of the Nalgovic Company, a member of the independent expert centre of the "Official Dome" Sergey Litvianko, Russian economy, as well as for a particular agricultural and food sector, will be a positive nature, and will lead to growth.
In addition, farmers, farmers, small shops are produced.
They can sell more, and that means that the profit will grow.
They will also receive the right to dictate their conditions and prices, as they will be obliged to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to raise their activities and sell that will lead to higher tax payment than previously.
This increases the income of the budget, establishing new workplaces, some sectors will start to expand some of the rapidly increased, will contribute to GDP growth.
Russia’s dependence from foreign food is cut several times, in fact not soon," notes the expert.
The previous Russian companies could often try to use local shops because of high competitiveness from the exile analysis.
Now, after the invoice of the embargo, the nickel was free and can be reliefd.
But it should not be forgotten that after all the necessary agreements and sanitary checks on the Russian market food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will be made.
In other words, there's a "measure" now when the previous games have gone, and the new ones have not yet come.
Only a month later, you can speak about the growing demand on the basis and the increase in the prices of the prepared product,” said AiF.ru the first Vice-Vice-Chairperson of the Russian public organization of the Russian Financial Club of the Financial Directors, to the Casian Tamar.
Similarly, the idea of sale in each category as at least 50 per cent of Russian food products allows to strengthen the sector for local producers.
In that case, they will competite each other, not with goods supported by the other State, but with goods.
In other words, the fight against the buyer is deployed between the companies working under the single law of the sector.
On the other hand, Casia notes that Russian producers are able to meet 50 per cent of the internal needs of co-economists far beyond all articles.
In this situation, trade networks must " spend" the part of Russian goods to half of the assortium.
In this regard, fears are increased that inadequate products are made on the packs.
Maybe there will be drought products with switch-based stores in Russia,” adds the expert.
Negative effects from the importation of cubes feel large trade networks, especially those who benefit to cooperate with importers.
It is logically that foreign suppliers themselves suffer, since their demand is decreased.
Lithuania does not exclude that the cowboy law may also be reflected on consumers.
The case is that some Russian production products may be in the quality of import analysis, while the purchase may be able to impose prices to second as a deficit product.
At the beginning of the 2000s, the economists' idea of import reemployment re-elected again in February this year because of the unexpected routine.
The question of refusal to import products is now more accurate on the background of the western relationships.
The Law aims to bind ritualists in the forming of orders to provide providers to be considered to be inherent manufacturers.
Then we are much faster and surely going through the import replacement, and the planning system for the necessary production will be created in a shorter period", says Mr. Oлег Nilo.
In particular, the effective coal mechanism will be for agricultural sectors, where particularly high capacity in milk sectors, for example, where the import share was 25 per cent.
Our farmers are really able to close fully the Russian shopping packs.
Furthermore, the powerful impulse can also receive milk production.
As it is known, the largest part of imports remains in the guadeline from 30 per cent to 35 per cent.
It is that 65-70 per cent of Russian products are to be in the whole place," says Casia.
Experts believe that the introduction of the cube to the product is enabled to import remarks and may accelerate the process.
However, this initiative will not make its own import remarks, since this requires a set of measures, surely Lithuania.
In any case, 50 per cent of the goods sold in accordance with this initiative may still be brought out of the border, which means that the full import reemplary will not occur, but significant steps will be made.
Nevertheless, it is necessary to establish the cube in the country to comply with these cubits.
The data of the cubes as a time are guaranteed and provided," constitutes an expert.
The unexpected diagnosis and the absence of access to optimal treatment means that wealth cancer in rural areas is more killing
Angelina Joly and her brother James published a video of the memory of their dead mother who died from egg cancer in 2007.
Women in the rural area of Australia have a higher risk of death from egg cancer than those living in towns.
Studiers analyzed the cards of disease of over 1100 Australian women with the "Yang Cancer" diagnosis in 2005, found that only 35 per cent had been survived five years after the diagnosis was placed.
A surveyer Susan Jordan from the Institute of Medicine Research QIMR Berghofer reported that the probability of death during the study is 20 per cent of those living in the regions and far away from those living in the city.
NEW ISSOLUTION: New medicines may reduce light cancers and bone cancers
For researchers, women had seven years of medical path.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of women at the time of the diagnosis, the type of ice cancer, the existing of current diseases and social status also affected the possibility of survival.
Women of older age and cancers had the lowest survival rates at the time of diagnosis.
For those living in regions or far-related regions, the possibility of death during the study was 20 per cent above than those living in the urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the cities were more likely to die from the hemisphere cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that the temporary diagnosis and the absence of access to optimal treatment could be possible.
"The disease is best treated by surgery specialized in genecological echoology, and they are mainly in large cities", she said.
Despite the improvement of the quality of the uredzine services to reduce the impact of the distance, it suggested that the increase in the exit number of travel services, which allows specialists to treat women close to the house, and the support programmes for persons who are from their home to house could help.
Dr. Jordan said that, despite the geographical situation, the study showed that the long-term life of women with bone cancer was rare, emphasized the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
A study financed by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, 33-year-old young mother with the Golden Lake Elish Nieve said that it had an aggressive form of egg cancer.

Inflation left out of the department.
Should Russian raw growth in prices
As a result of the recruited sanctions of RF and Western inflation in Russia, it will be fast and not put into the prognosis of the authorities convincing the BTB Capital Analysis.
Experts believe that the impacts of the sanctions lead to inflation shock in the first quarter of 2015, writes RBK Daily.
According to the last Mine Evolution project, inflation is 6.5-7.5 per cent in 2014, in the next year and at least 6,5 per cent.
However, according to the Commercancy newspapers this week, the EFTA should be "small but principleal" adjustments in macro-economic prognosis until 2017.
According to the publication, the State may reduce inflation assessment for 2015, which allows the expected increase in population income.
The provision suggested that food sanctions of RF operate annually until August 2015.
How could such a situation predict such a high inflation?
The present situation is a different shock, but the low inflation train does not change", said the source of the Minnesota newspaper.
Economists from BTB Capital do not share the expectations of the Government ' s financial and economic block on inflation and predict the growth of prices in 2014 to the level of 8 per cent.
The main effect of product bans will begin together with possible RF tax in the RF regions (SNP) in 2015, and the experts are convinced.
Inflation pipe for 9 per cent is required in February, after the annual growth rates of prices are going to fall, experts believe.
In the past week, Ross has brought the first inflation results after the RF introduced "accurate sanctions".
Iaf.ru asked experts and explained their inflation expectations.
Artem Daev, Director of the FC A Forex Analytic Department:
The growth of prices is already observed in the main segments of goods.
Furthermore, when socially significant products began, the Government had to initiate the system monitoring of price stability measures to prevent unreasonable price increase in a short-term perspective.
The suppliers and ritualists are already referred to a daily basis before the regulatory bodies, so that the authorities know exactly whom and why the prices are launched.
The key factors of the growth index of consumer prices continue to remain the colonial level of capital, the excessive refinancing of the banking sector from the Russian megaregulator, the internal converging because of the refugee in the foreign currency, as well as the embargo for the transport of food products from countries associated with the sanctions against Russia.
If inflation pressure remained under control, the value of the cornice of the minimum product would not be 12 per cent for only one quarter.
The prohibition for the import of food products was shocked on the internal market and made a completely logical increase in the cost of a certain value.
Since we are not fully able to launch the import reemployment mechanism and to increase the autonomy of the Russian market through internal production, responsible sanctions will continue to bring the risk of growth in inflation composition.
In addition to the physical reasons related to the lack of confidence to national currency and the worst economic growth perspectives, inflation may be over to 8 per cent at the end of this year.
Alexander Ravuv, Director of the Alpary Analytic Department
In the 90s, inflation has sometimes reached 20 to 30 per cent in the month, and the nucleus was also higher than the current level, and another case, which was then compensated by rapid economic growth.
I think inflation is 8.8.5 per cent over the year.
Platon Maguta, managing the CR "Maguta Fund" assets
The external factor related to the sanctions against Russia until it has succeeded, but if pressure is further increased, mainly the financial sector can lead to certain difficulties and increase inflation expectations of the population, which are usually traditionally shown in the purchase of money in order to ensure their reserve.
It may suggest that the Government, the CFD and the Ministry of Finance are trying to reduce the slowness of the rubber, such as market methods, and public regulations.
But the growth of the prices begins traditionally after the summer, and it may be more sensitive.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia by 7.5 per cent is likely, as the FF is still financial.
Sadduce centres are suffered from the low number of contractors
Such a decrease of an exceptional age of 35 years of age may lead to the loss of ten million feet per year when the current young demanders have reached a "formal age of sanitation", according to the HTA study reported to the Financial Times.
According to this report, people who have a housing is averagely cost 55 per cent of the amount of which the own households are expenditured.
It mentions the increase in the number of people living in high-urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of the duties in front of the park house and the reduction of the garden size as other factors that are threatened for the sector, the annual sale of £5 billion, as estimated.
In the largest London, where the number of contractors decreased from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, the lower prices in Britain for household harvests.
HTA and the Kingdom Sadducing Society reported that the absence of housing and garden spaces did not mean that people could not grow.
Gay Barter, the principal Sadduce adviser in RHS, said: "The enhancement of plants in containers, for example, is popular to ardenators that can transport plants with themselves when they move. "
The HTA report determined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "solf-wet" market for savings as a result of increased number of contractors and economic prosperity from the end of the 1980s to the middle of the 1990s.
It is also expected that the market will be improved in this year by a better weather after the unfortunate conditions in March and April last year.

The largest Chinese companies joined against Alababa
Chinese companies, among whose larger commercial income in China, are the Dalian Wanda Group and Tencent Holdings Internet Guigans (Sociétés, Messengers and Dr.) and Baidu (China Current Search), who will competite online trade markets with Alibaba.
However, the miracles of the Chinese Internet, which have been left behind, will not be easy for their American counterparts - eBay and Amazon.com.
The Greatest Union
The company plans to place a joint company of $5 billion ($814 million), 70 per cent of which will belong to Wanda and 15 per cent of the Internet companies, reported in the Walla Group.
Registration of the company is planned in Hong Kong.
The SS combines the search services of Baidu with the popular WeChat social platform (the main number of users with about 438 million people), Tencent and Wanda infrastructure.
Besides the network of 40 phenomenonal hotels of the Wanda Group, at least 49 installations of trade in movement throughout China and 40 commercial centres are managed.
Last year the company invested $50 billion in the construction of cinema studios and the thematic park in Cinadao (which rewards on the east of China on the Yellow Sea).
The project is expected to accumulate more than 1 million visitors annually and bring $960 million income.
Moreover, the Walla belongs to the American cinema network of AMC Entertainment Holdings, which makes the company a larger cinematographer worldwide.
In 2015, Wanda plans to equipze all its commercial centres, hotels and places of e-commerce services, which are developed as a timely formed Alibaba competition.
According to Dun Zé, the new company is able to increase the number of users of their e-commerce services from the current 40 million to 100 million to the next year.
The new area should be the largest online-to-offline platform, notes Dun Zé.
Online-to-to-offline (O2O) markets are to adquire buyers in the Internet so that they have been in general oil magic or purchased other traditional services.
The classical example of O2O is the sale of purchase services for Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
O2O is the biggest "pearl" in online trade," said the leader Wanda Van Zìnland (quote for Bloomberg).
"The present area of O2O in China does not exist, and in this situation the possibility of all is nearly equal," he believes.
The Chinese internet market is larger in the world, and, according to the McKinsey & Co., it will increase more than three times to 2015 compared to 2011, to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese users have grown up to 632 million, bringing Bloomberg official statistics to the population of any world, except India.
According to the prognoses, the number of people can grow up to 850 million by 2015.
The richest Union
Head of Tencent Ma Hutan has recently been the richest man of China, but, according to the Broomberg Index, Alibaba Jack Ma has already deposed $5.5 billion.
The state of the Jack Ma is estimated by $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion is the share of the Alababa.
Baidu Robin Li is now the third place among the most richest people of China, while Van Zìnglin from Wanda is the fourth raying building.
"The struggle is very interesting to observe: three of the richest people are bound to make the calls more rich, " said the Director of the Chinese Centre for Electronic Trade in Hanchyo Cho Ley.
But he believes that the new company is not possible to competite with Alibaba immediately after the creation: "Rim cannot be built for one day."
The fact that Alababa is not so simple to compare not only new companies, but also the leading leaders of the worldwide internet trade, shows the document published on the Alababa financial indicators for the last quarter.
Alibaba often describes something more medium between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June the Chinese company paid more than both its American competitors.
The total revenue of Alibaba for the period almost two times exceeds the same amount of competitors, which grew nearly three times per year and was $1.99 billion.
"Alibaba still has a huge capacity to generate money, in many ways through its mobile applications," commented Bloomberg's analysis report from the Hong Kong Arete Research Service.
According to the updated view of Alibaba on the United States Challenges Commission, the number of mobile service users in July was 188 million, which significantly exceeds the marginal indicator (163 million).
At that time, 32.8 per cent of all transactions of Alibaba had been held on mobile devices.
Alibaba should call the value of its actions before the IPO.
According to the average assessment of 11 Bloomberg analysts, the company may be evaluated at $187 billion after sale of shares.
According to the sources of Bloomberg, Alibaba is in the New York Fund (New York Fund) can be held on 16 September.
The Road-show company, which was before this event, starts 3 September.
It is expected that Alibaba would be recursive in the NYSE history and allows the company to acquire $20 billion.
Together, the refund of the United States refunds belonged to the Visa payment system, which has paid its shares in 2008 to $17.9 billion.
At least half of the food products in trade networks must be Russian production, which are considered by Mrs.
They developed a draft legislation on the subject.
It is about the changes in page 8 of the CF "On the basis for public trade management in RF" and the Tax Code.
The purpose of the document is to introduce protected measures towards Russian food producers.
Under the draft legislation, at least 50 per cent of the goods in shops must be in each type of goods.
However, the document will take into account that there are goods not produced in Russia, such as winter fruits and fruits, so that it will be made for them a " squeeze " to avoid the possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law also introduces a change in the RF Tax Code, establishing a decreased rate of 10 per cent of NDAs in implementing all food products originating in Russia, reports the Newspaper.
On 27 August, the Parliament has been introduced a draft legislation on the changes in the GF, which proposes to restore the agricultural markets in Russia, where small producers will be able to implement their products.
The Police Chief of Magaloup was accused of corruption
The Italians provided evidence of the requirement from the police and officials of the municipality of Calvine in the office of the State Prosecutor of Mallorki on Friday.
Calvin Police Chief in the Mallorque Island was arrested as a result of corruption by businessmen and owners of bars in a scandally known centre of the unrecognised drink of Malawi.
The Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was placed under detention because of the accused of corruption against him by several employees with Punta Balen, the street where most bars and night clubs of Magalua.
According to the daily online building of Mallorca Diario, the scholars presented evidence of the requirement from the police and officials of Calvine municipality in the Office of the Mallorca fighting against corruption in Friday.
Other two local police officers were arrested by the National Guard of Spain for corruption charges and will be invited to the judge together with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC reported that the unwanted owners of night clubs said that Protectionism from the authorities is seriously reflected in their business.
"There's no longer about paying money, it's about to survive," said the judge to one of the businessmen.
You can't put the sources of our existence under threat.
We don't lose anything.
Magaluf was in the title of the international press this year after a popular video on YouTube, which was shown by a 18-year-old British relaxer in the mines of 24 men during shocking bars.
The island authorities have since then tried to stop the abuse in the nervous situation among the relaxing Magalauths, with a minimum number of known skandals by bars.
Furthermore, the Playhouse club, where a mine accident occurred, was closed for an year, while the playhouse and the organizations in the Carnage bar were shocked for $55,000 ($73,000).
Tourist smoking, mostly popular among young British relaxers, was also a place of numerous accidents in the condition of alcoholic abuse related to a sweet smuggling known as "balconing " when people swim from one balcone to another or with a balcone in a guest bassin.
The first spring day is marked by mocks and wind conditions affected by the aircraft at the Adelida Airport
The WEU has prepared a cold surprising surprising on the south of South Australia, bringing rain and strong winds that have affected the airport of Adelaide.
More than 5 meters of rain slowed to the city at 9 night, following 6.6 mm from Sunday night.
The last rain predicted a couple of short liquids with a explosive wind, including the silver that began soon to 8 nights and led about 4 mm per minute.
After the winter's early spring for the past week, the temperature was back to summer to the maximum of 15.8C in the city.
The shortest conditions, as predicted, were one of the reasons for the delay of Virgin Airlines Railways from Melbourne in Adelaide.
The summer had to be landed on the planning immediately after 7:30 a.m., but the wind switch was slowly changed or the wind direction to a short distance, and was required to take a height.
The wind passements reached 50 km/h on the ground at the Adelaide at that time.
The flights showed that the aircraft had to take a height during the second floor, and the aircraft was at the end of the night at about 8:40.
The delay of the race was called for a delay of several other races, including the Race Emirates from Dubaa and Qantas from Sidnea.
Maxim 16C is predicted in Adelaide on Tuesday, with the probability of one or two liquids.
The calculation of the RF building objects will be new
The cost-education issues, the management of the building sector and the problems of the Federal Anti-monopol Service are specially monitored.
The FAAS established a expert Committee on Competition Development in the Construction Area.
At its meeting, the head of the JKK, the construction and the natural resources of the FAAS Wadim Solove stated that “the annual calculation of the estimation of the building objects is absolutely incomprehensible”.
The standard basis makes price education unproportional and may lead to an unreasonable cost of construction to the FAO.
They propose the cost of the construction of hostship objects at the projecting stage to determine the market prices of constructive decisions instead of the current estimated standards and unique technological estimates.
These proposals are introduced in the road map and are now being reviewed in the mine.
" The name of traditional measuring documentation in the construction of constructive elements should lead to less corruption in the area, " GRB " explained by Soviet Wadim.
For now, every bottle and cycling is discussed, and it is not always possible to check everything, so at times in documentation the unexpected constructive companies can cover the "thy tractor".
The FAO's mine agrees.
The " Recent transitional operations on the cost of the constructive elements are already: the cost calculation methods developed for constructional decisions, the dimension of the indicators, reported by the head of the department of grading activities and architecture of the mining Elena Jacques.
The area of road construction is selected as a pilot.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
According to the head of the Profi-Invest company, Anatolio Demianco, the estimated standards have been slow, but the other business mechanism has not been proposed.
"What is in respect of the proposed constructive calculations, it is difficult to realize, as buildings are often used in the construction of different technologies," he believes.
It is not a secret that the building is being developed in many ways by the honourable.
According to the Chairman of the NGO ' s expert community of the Hospital Professionals, the State is the most powerful claimant today.
The Ingenieur of the Capital Capital Centre of Rosato Vladimir Malakhov pointed out that the market was divided today to companies with access to the contract port, and to companies who own monopoly competences and who do not permit competitors to this field.
He believes that the establishment of a transit market may only be possible if the access to contracts will be maximumly affected by any management effects.
The Expert Board was proposed to formulate the register system so that one of the same executives could not receive more than 1 billion rule or more than 1 billion rubber contracts.
The mine believes that this approach is necessary to assess the impact on business and the effectiveness of construction.
According to Elena Joke, in this case, the claimant would be required to provide the functions of a genealog, which would lead to increased state number of assets and budget costs on its content.
As a result, the claimant specialists should have knowledge that will enable the quality of the undertaking organizations to evaluate, as well as their security.
This disappearance is often necessary to determine who would be responsible for the security of the object in general.
Furthermore, this approach may affect the decline of high-qualificated guarantors in relation to ininterestation in receiving an incomplete amount of work and a small amount of contract.
The statements of the expert-advisory Centre of the Institute of Procurements by Alexandre Eustachenk believed that the applicant procedure now has become a business game for a contractor's attention.
The following example is: "In full of the complaint, " concrete indicators" should be indicated without words: "or equivalent", "that should be", "also", "more", "anon", "anony", "type", "type" "not "low", "low", "left", "more", "move it may be", "return", "not above", "no permission" and "t" etc.
Consequently, the claimants often use their right to establish the requirements for the application provided by sub-organities.
Another issue of 44-FZ, in the view of the European Union, was the need for further evaluation of the applications for the quality of work through the "building" proposal of the party.
In examination of the request by the party, only the qualification of the contractor, but not the quality of the work that has not yet been carried out, the expert believes.
The quality of work can only be assessed at their receipt.
The Expert Council was also proposed to transfer marginal income from the top to the lower eye to disappear interim contractors.
The Chairman of the Expert Council, the Secretary-General, the FACE-in-law manager André Kingy, believes that this should not be done, as the order should be reacting to the order.
And there's no way that the renowned Arcadia Rikin's Arte: "When are the guests?".
Israeli children return to school after the war in the Gaza sector
Thousands of Israeli children in the territory around the Gaza sector returned to school on Monday after the flight in bombs, when missiles and mines falled on their settlement during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while the Gaza Sector schools remained closed when the territory was rebuilding after the war.
School occupation began to make the joy and concerns of those suffering from the Missile of South Israel, but the consequences of the war continued to be slow.
In the south town of Ashdod, a child garden Pashosh, who was in the missile, took the sequences of the skin and the kids before the disciples arrived.
"We're a little scared, but we're glad to see in the future," said Ronita Bart, a resident of Kibuza Saad and an English speaker in his school.
Many children in our area really need to return to a great life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shaney Bart, said that at once she began to go to school again.
"There was a difficult time, and we didn't get out of our houses," she said.
The Chairman Reuben Rivlin visited a chick that is close to the border of Gaza to express its support.
Before the war stopped last week, thousands of residents, such as Saad, did not go to the street or leave their homes, wake up in more safeer areas from the Gaza sector to save from the missile and miniature fire.
Many people who live in Nahal Oz, close to the border of Gaza, where a four-year-old boy of Palestinian mine was killed, are doubtful that they should return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about half of the family was still not returned.
Their children were sent to other schools at that time.
Prime Minister Benjim Nyanjahu visited a school in Sderoth, a town in the border of Gaza, which was a great tribute to the Palestinian fire.
He recommended the children to learn strictly and said, "We will do everything we can to give you knowledge and to ensure your security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an imminent death on Sunday last.
The fire stopping agreement immediately ended war action, but the unresolved key issues, for example, remained the requirement of Hamas to remove the Egyptian and Israeli block of Gaza and the opening of airports and marine ports in the Gaza sector.
Israel wants to put Jamas the weapon and return the body of two Israeli soldiers who died in the war.
The new stage of non-direct negotiations is expected to begin in the month later in Egypt.
In the war, more than 2100 Palestinians, among which three four were peaceful citizens, were killed, and at least 494 children, as estimated by the Palestinian and the United Nations.
Israel opposed these figures and claims that at least half of the murdered were assaulted by the fighters; despite this, he did not provide significant evidence that confirmed the approval.
Israeli parties have died 66 soldiers and six peace-related people, including one Chinese employee.
During the warfare of Hamas and other Gaza forces, 4591 missiles and mines were launched mostly in the south of the country.
The Israeli army, at that time, held more than 5000 aircraft and other attacks.
Israeli attacks have been damaged and destroyed thousands of houses in the Gaza sector, and 2500,000 have found refugees in more than 100 schools, which were converted to income.
Because decades of thousands of people were still in their homes, and the battles continued to have been responsibilities for education last week.
"I hope that the school will be open soon that we can complete our education as the children of the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammed Amara, a 13-year-old boy who is now living in one of Gaza schools.
According to the popular price criteria, the most winter growth has been shown for seven years.
Index of RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic housing in the Australian capital increased by 1.1 per cent in August, reported RP data on Monday.
This increase has resulted in joint increase in June, July and August 4,2 per cent, the main increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual growth rate was 10.9 per cent, more than the twice increase of 12 months to August 2013, but the increase was not equally distributed in the country.
The Director of Research Data Tim Loules reported that Sidney and Melbourne had a double-level market.
The RP Data digits show that the population price in Sidden has grown to 16.1 per cent in the last year, while Melbourne is 11,7 per cent.
The following market powers were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices in average increased from five to six per cent.
On the other hand, Canberra was divided into government reductions, where the prices were totally up to 1.4 per cent per year.
Mr. Lawless said that, when the spring begins, the increase in the number of non-related objects on sales during the following months, which would be "the actual test" for the market.
"Bearing in mind the current high speed of the sales speed, the general high speed of sale and the current conditions with a low percentage rate, the value of the housing may still be increased in the following three months," he said.
How People Live in the Old House
In the former house of Gold Industries and Eudokhams and his son, Ivan Demid, on the street of the Octjabri Revolution, 57/1 (ex-Green Cazana) 18 apartments.
The house of the XVIII century has not been practically changed if it was not considered to be sweet.
Military people are here as an excursion, and the people suffer more than their privileges are the right to live in a older holhyme house whose wall is remembered by Alexandra Sucrova.
The date of the house building is uncertain, and the historians indicate two dates: 1730 and 1737.
But in any case, there is no 300-year-old building.
An old door, always opening the door, scripting a box.
The doors of the apartment are close to each other, the walls were shocked, and the shooting shoes of the shooting shooting places are visible.
It seems that it's a honorary word.
And local people believe, "It doesn't seem to be that."
It is very difficult to live in the village house of the 19th century,” says Tatiana Lukiano, a resident of apartment No. 3.
The object is on the hospital, but the money is not paid for decades, but we feel museum exhibits that the authorities have just forgotten.
The last repair was 40 years ago.
The skins are still sweet, but the foundation is all predicted.
Many people still walk in the toilet on the street and pray for a week in the public bathroom.
How can we be satisfied in such conditions?
The road goes directly under the windows, no even the heat zone.
Dad's shocking.
Now it appears that it was just heard: the flow of cars is under the windows.
Look, the kid's steel is constant, the window can't open, but the smell of a smell.
But the man is attractive to all the things, to the good and bad.
Our apartment is still grateful, thanks to the husband, his hands are golden.
Moreover, we have two rooms, we're living with a son.
And other families have a great worst, and in the second stage, the flights are more than half feet higher.
For the contract, Tatiana proposes to go to a neighbouring apartment No. 6 Virgins.
A nice hospital woman offers a coffee chair and with a sweet smile:
We have a single apartment, 14.5 m2 for four men, and we live: we are husbands and daughters with grandsons.
I've been here since the birth, and there's never been another housing, - Ludmila's got the eyes of the room: anthers, two wonderful letters "g"; one of them has been put on a laptop.
It is very closely and little different from the normal interface: only the slights are beautiful, "historical".
But from the fridge regularly, there is no water driver system.
Ludmila speaks of her apartment habitually and surprisingly as an Italian whose house is at the Roman ruin.
This is a very old and recent, daily and legendary one:
Water carried out about 40 years ago during the last repair.
Then we made a little kitchen in a cotton and a toilet from the old shirt.
We live at the second stage where David and his family aparted, we lived in the second stage.
Our apartment is not privatized, right?
The WF's Negotiation Center says that privacy has no importance.
Nevertheless, we can only receive a single apartment, no more claim.
Four months ago, we were promised to smile us, but the promised case wasn't gone.
I wasn't inclined to blame, and I'm not going to.
In this apartment, the whole dinastia died: my grandmother and my grandmother, my mother and my dad, I am with my husband and my daughter with my grandma.
It's all over that time.
For instance, healthy crystals run to the kitchen.
Look at the wall of the floor, they're a metro thick!
They say it was cut into eggs, so it keeps it so long.
The house has been designed primarily, thanks to Damid!
That's why no one was killed by a slaughter or a swimming flight.
Only a building dies slowly in our eyes: tills and swimming houses are broken, the fields are often missed, we put the cement, but it's not useless - the smelling goes into the earth as in the collar.
They say, that's it's -- under our room of a swimming lace and walk to the Belarus River, which have been specially made by the older people here so that they can be opened from the danger, in any case.
They were persecuted.
Ludmila Starstyna tells him how some historist came, and pray to start in the apartment.
Then he avoided to give them a dwelling in the exchange of his own spectacle on Octjabria.
The history replied:
Where are we going to four in one?
And there's a bit of hope that they're going to give a housing more spacious.
We wouldn't have won anything anymore.
Nevertheless, the family of the Almighty has won nothing.
The largest dream of Ludmila to be cut off, and the daughter of 16 years of age gave a single room.
The two families have set a double apartment instead of the most greatest routines in which two generations are now living.
Simpatic, miniature girl Ollie Carsaka from apartment No. 11 and 12 shows the second stage of the home.
There are two close rooms in the general area of 232 m2, named by the apartments, and its large family.
We all have seven, two children.
See yourself what conditions.
The shoes are disabled by pieces such as window frames, in kitchen walls and in the rooms.
Water in the roof of the year is only cold.
When you go to the apartments of the old house of Uffa, you can be sure that more people have been in the Lawrentian apartment 4.
They're doing the most spatial rooms of the first stage.
You're right. There's a lot of places.
The location in 75 squares is recorded for three men.
We live as once in the rooms where the legend stopped Sugara during his stay in Ufe, - says the head of the family Alexander Dmitrievi Lawrentyi.
The flights are high, it's typically.
One bad thing - all around the swimming swimming, disappearing, slowing.
The neighbors probably haven't told you!
The more painful of us with fields, the trees slowed, the land was literally out of the feet.
I've put up the back, the legs, and there's nothing else in the room, and we're going to the other room as we're shooting on the shooting, so much.
About the house of the Eudokham Demid, Alexander Dmitrievich can tell you better any excursion.
The gold industry is like a family, says that it is with sweetness.
Indeed, the personality was unfavourable: the household of the Kaghin and the Uzians built a house, shifted the guns and the collars, holding the Ural machines.
The results of the purchase in movement are proud, but they don't want to live under one piece of history.
I lived here, a child in the 40s, says Alexandre Dmitrievich.
Then there were wooden places for cart, horses and carawl buildings, and then covered.
In 1968, they wanted to get out of our house, but something didn't...
History repeated in 2014: again the new housing was taken.
As the team, we collected all documents, avoided the necessary instances, and soon we found that the apartment movement was transferred to 2015 or 2016.
We don't believe it anymore.
Two years ago, Lawrencej went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan to know about the house court.
The people haven't accepted.
It was sent from one table to another, and then, as a shock, they issued a paper without signing and printing: "The Ministry of Culture does not affect the disappearance of the inhabitants."
I have even felt that our house was not a long time in the city, since he was first under Number 57, and then became 57 A and now 57/1.
It's like it's been made in the 70s.
The Russian planet was called on the conducted information and analytical management of the UF of the Würmira Barabash Land Resources.
The home on the street of the Octobre Revolution 57/1 includes a dwelling program.
I can't respond to the action of the 70s, but I know that at that time the plan for the contribution of all old houses was present, despite historical importance.
Happily, this has not happened, and the decision of modern authorities is to restore all old houses on the street of the Octobre Revolution, which represent the architecture value, is successful.
Residents are planned to be divided into new apartments.
According to Barabasha, the restoration of the home of Demid will be Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.
It is now the architecture binary in Italy, and the "Stara Uph" project is presented there, including other.
I hope that all the former Kazakhstan Street will be refunded until 2016, says the official.
The house will be acquired a suitable species that had been before three centuries ago.
The house of Demidia may probably be a museum open for all the desires.
Furthermore, at the government level, it was decided to make the street on weekends.
Unfortunately, the house is not obtained, a too large burden of the city’s road.
The future museum of Vladimir Barabash is promised in 2015.
Otherwise, they will remain satisfied: their new apartments will be the same area as the present.
Just from another era.
The forest flight began in the shore because of the silver.
The smooth gold was caused by the forest burden in the O'Haqqiya region of the Pool Polar Area.
A group of forces and funds is strengthened at the place of rebuilding.
The CGSB's Guideline of the Pre-Marian Aviation Aviation, which is established at the fireplace, requires aviation admission.
Vasil Meddeviv, Vice-Chairman of Aviation:
The fire in a difficult space has found a guard aircraft with an An-2 patrol aircraft ship on the 3-hectare area.
The horse of the old horns.
The strong decline of the territory and the circle of more than 45 degrees, the lack of swimming powders in the swimming area are significantly complicated.
We need a Mi-8 helicopter.
The supply of powers in the Mi-2 helicopters and An-2 aircraft is very difficult.
After the finding of the fire on the shooting, four parashawists were operated.
The main task of specialists is the struggle of the fire and the preparation of the area to provide additional powers and fire resources.
In the dining area, the Howard Helicopters have been added to 3 feeding detentors.
As the helicopters will be prepared for helicopters in the fire area, specialists will be moved to the kitchen place, it is reported on the Premort Administration website.
Lenny Henry: My father never understanded me.
I never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of the seven children born in the family of immigrants with Jamaica to Dadley in Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked on the manufacture, and their relationship was limited.
Henry is the committee, the Red Plastics Rudy, which is partly based on imagined conversations with his father and has grown from a series of transmissions to Radio 4.
Saoundrek is a rhyg and a rhythm, and the melodies are life-related.
However, Henry had to pass through some difficult memories of childhood.
After his mother's death, Henry often thinks about the relationship with his father.
He was not very available.
You never saw his face, you just heard his voice, "Cree to smile.
Get away from the sister.
Come on!
I want to look at a cricket.
My old brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a child, went to the pab and talked about things such as a form of bird stain, a cricket shock.
I never talked to him like that.
He was such an uncomfortable man in the edge who read a large part of my life.
He had recently opened a lithium master in Dadley, and although the conditions were better than his father’s day, he could see what his life had to be.
There's little more than it's, but it's the dark, dry, deep labs with fire shoes, houses, and bathrooms.
My dad put in the bathroom and just sit there, and you heard how he's starting to sing about himself because he wanted to get away from a lithium master.
When I came there, I understood that he did these years and years to pay us for a survey, and I began to appreciate him more.
However, Henry went out of the child of a lonely parent love.
My dad never understood, never said, "I love you."
Only when Mom became bad at the end of her life, we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of her own daughter Billy, from Don Frank, allowed him to share the love that he had not enough in the child.
Can you stop this "I love you?"
Just stop seeing me!
Dad, I'm 22!
From Don Frank.
Why wouldn't I be friending with her?
She's a good mother.
They're still good friends with Frank whom he was married 25 years old.
Don is a good man.
Why wouldn't I have friends with Don?
She's a good mother.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
He was one of the ones that killed her.
So when I was very corrected, and I had the symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "We have to take radical measures.
Then I started a serious physician, and I also had to sit on a strict diamond to get away from the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's funny.
No one's eating marble.
The change of the carriage tractor, Henry, may have reflected in his pleasant, short-term board.
Since he received a critical recognition for his Hotel, he was loaded in the theatre.
He followed the Commons of Errors, and then Ogasta Wilson's Zabor.
This work is different from the networks and commodities that were an integral attribute of his native professional life.
He started a car when he was 16 and worked on the manufacture.
Dijay noticed how he's passing on the scene, and wrote it to the New Face.
His television career began in the middle of the seventy: "A long time I was the only black counterparty/commission."
He learned at work.
I had not only to grow up at the public, but I had to learn to be an effective shooting machine between 1975 and 1985, being a star, working on television, and it was very hard.
Lenny in New People in 1975
As his manager had the right to the Black and white shoot of mines, a light-shooting program in which people "his face," Henry found what she speaks for five years.
My family didn't like it.
I'm like to want that never to be with me, but I'm not sorry that I did it.
Although it was a strange, worthy condemnation of the position, I worked in large areas and learned to work with a smooth.
But what was "the reward of a easy developing class for years and years of British television" was also the "which rather than the black people".
Representing the people who had been divided over the culture of black pools in Britain and revised it, Henry worked in an alternative commodity project in the eighteenth.
The first season of "Shoo Lenny Henry" was translated in 1984, and in the nineteenth he was known as the head of Geret Blacklock from the commodity series "Chef".
Advertising roles, documental films, television and roles in the film took the next ten years of his life, but after his series in 2008 "LennyHenry.tv," he thought, "what are you going to do further, Len, because it seems that you're going to spend time or slowly on the side."
There was also a series of documentary transfers to radio 4 named "What is good to...?"
The first thing was Shexpire.
I had a real allergic for Shexpil.
I couldn't say that I was fully taught about this at school, and I thought it was, in a lot of white people's midst class with colleagues and cut down the front.
So I was very scared of him.
Everyone we've got an interview to transfer, Peter Hawk, Trevor Nann, Adrian Lester, Judy Dunch, said, "You must try.
Don't worry about it until you don't know what you're talking about.
Listen to some of these words, and you understand why we all love Shexpil.
Henry's passing 20 lines from the last hotel monologist for documental transfer, and he got shooted.
I feel that I can do it.
I've been correcting my head.
"There is a serious matter about this, learning your text, a little study.
So the replication process was hard, and I read this drink months and months before we put it.
And she had succeeded.
It seemed that they were waiting for disasters, and it wasn't happening.
Soon we started "The Error Communication".
Soon I'm in the National Theatre, and I couldn't believe it until the end.
It was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
And Henry felt instinctly that his business was to disclose the public.
The voice inside me said, "You're going to work 10 minutes until they're doing a computer."
Instead, the Assistant announced that the presentation would be renewed only as the problem was resolved.
I went out of the scene and something in me said, "Oh, God's glory."
That's not my duty.
I can let someone else find out this.
"You're playing a drink, stay in the role."
Henry in the Theatre Daches
Learning the text for the "Rabors" was difficult.
Panic is very useful, it strengthens muscles.
She also took good, so it was like a sign above that shows, "What you need to do?"
He says that, of course, by the voice of the GROWIS.
So I'm holding it.
I really love it.
I like to be in the reception room.
On the other hand, Henry still has a cocktail thinking -- the whole way of our swimming smells shoot his humor when he starts, it's gonna finish a couple.
I just decided not to work in Standape, because this shooting with a mere repayment from the full room of non-conciliators, I think it's very dangerous.
If you're always trying to do this, it can lead to the smell.
I sometimes work in Apollo's Premier Ethiome, when I want, but, mainly, I don't receive such satisfaction as before.
I'm asking if he'll give a stendap tour anymore.
The joy to sit in place with a register that helps to make a form of start, medium and the end of the road - I don't think I ever want to reject it.
That's his new involvement?
I think so.
I like to be a actor.
It's a nice fun.
You're always telling some story, and you're here a good place for this.
I love the story.
People love history.
Kenya registers state officers to identify "invisible workers"
Kenya started a biometric registration of all State servants to try to remove "invisible workers" from the Government's payment state.
The Government's statement shall be reported to workers not registered within two weeks next.
The Government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive payments after leaveing the public service.
The President of Uhura Kenita promised to reduce corruption in State structures after the authority in 2013.
The audit check previously found that at least $1 million ($70,0000) per month was paid by "invisible workers" and other financial violations.
The Government suspects that payment continues to be paid to bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves the public service, reports BBC Vanjama Chabushiri reporter from the capital of Nairobi.
All public officers should appear within the identification centres in the next two weeks to ensure that their data will be collected through a biometric registration procedure, reported in the Government's statement.
Any who does not do so without a respectful reason will be extracted from the payment state shall be reported in it.
" This procedure significantly enhances the rationalization of the public service, determined the real number of State servants, and will also be used to clean up payment state at both government levels, so it will put the end of the problem of " invisibility workers " , said Ann Vigur, the secretariat of the Ministers of Planning and Structure.
Decades of Turkish police arrested against Government
The total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey for suspicion in the "conspiration against the Government" reported local information agencies.
The police representatives did not immediately comment that information.
Among the detainees were 14 high-employed officers, reported by Hurriet Daily News.
Some of them participated in the detection of corruption events aimed at checking Government staff, including four Government ministers.
In July, some Turkish police were arrested for suspecting the establishment of a organized criminal group and telephone hearing.
Turk President Regip Tyrdogan (one of the Prime Ministers at that time) identified them as a part of the measures taken against him and other in the Islamic clinic Fethullach Gulene.
Not all children returned to Ukrainian school
Schools in most parts of Ukraine have again opened their doors on Wednesday (1 September) after summer channels.
This day, traditionally, is a larger event for the family, and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents, the Prime Minister of the Yankeeke deployed her daughter in school.
There he said to the expected journalists that not all schools were reopened again, but that he will do everything to protect the country for future generations:
The first September ceremony was not at each school.
There is no peaceful heaven over every part of the Ukraine.
We have to fight for a peaceful heaven.
All Ukrainian, the large only Ukrainian national front, must be fighting for peaceful heaven.
Alexandre Pastokhov, director of the school in Slaviansk, in which the daughter of Yaskouk went, spoke in Russia.
We hope that the world will finally be set here and that children will receive knowledge that will benefit in their further life.
The first day of the school, traditionally, notes that children swimming up the shoes, guard aircrafts in the hands and give the colour to their teachers.
In the face of Ron Fairheed BBC, she might have found a pregnant leader that she needs.
It is a shock of glory from the world of bank business, media and the internal towards Tori Party.
Indeed, it has its own experience of work at the headquarters.
Her carrière began to the Consultant Bain and Co Bain and then continued in Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the world of media in Pearsons.
She was the Financial Times Leader for seven years, when the high position in Pearson's main company took a colleague who worked lower.
They say it's near to $1 million.
Its political rating is also forgiven.
She recommended David Cameron, Lord Brown, former head of the BP, when he tried to bring specialists from the private sector in Witcol: she became the advisor of the Ministerial Office.
Her husband, Thor's former adviser.
Previously in May I called the work of the Chairman.
BBC is not just a large and complex organization in the heart of the public, but it has an internal paradox.
The Council has two directions: inside the BBC itself as the top level, but it is also the voice of public concern and concern when something does not happen.
This is almost unreasonable duopy that requires a full radical reform.
However, what new Chairman will risk coming, growing and destroying the institution as complex as the Chinese dinastial if he himself remains working in this process.
This is a difficult decision.
It wouldn't be so difficult, so many people will be glad to see the BBC's decreasing size - after reviewing its powers, financing and status.
While competitors circle and new technologies shrink the calls of old attractions, noneastern license negotiations are a special danger for BBC.
For the modest amount of £145,50 in the year, the Britishs have certainly acquired the largest average company in the world.
BBC tells a good story: It claims that the results of its work are 96 per cent of households and that each of them is only 40 hours per day.
Moreover, it is apparent that the population of Beeb is growing: 53 per cent is supported today against 31 per cent of 10 years ago.
The BBC models have changed: I now get news headers on mobile phones and see the launched iPlayer programs.
But it remains a very popular and extraordinary institution.
He needs the preaching chair -- I hope it's found.
Perry from Texas says that a lower Twitter was written to some bilaterally
Twitter with the confirmed gouverneur of Texas, the Republic of Perry, on Sunday night, contained a devastating picture of the environmental prosecutor from democracies situated in the centre of criminal prosecution for the abuse of authority.
The Twitter was later removed, and there was another of Perry's accommodation, where the record was denied.
Only with my accommodation was published by the Twitter, which was written by some multilaterally.
"I don't approve this youth, and I removed it," reports the late record.
Perry's assistants did not immediately respond to communications with request to propose.
Although the records were downloaded with the confirmed Perry account, it was unexpected who actually was published in the shipment.
More early Twitters contained an inadequate career in the district of Travis Rosemare Lemberg, who acknowledged the guilty of the injury in April 2013.
Perry made a prohibition to finance her state when she refused to leave a departure, which led to the election of a large prison in Ostin in this month against Perry, a potential candidate to the President at the elections of 2016.
The sign in yours says, "I'm not always taking a car in the depression state, three times the permission level of alcohol in blood, but when I do this, I pronounce the accused of the Governor Perry for what he says about me."
I'm the drinkest democracy in Texas.
The Lemberg Wednesday has not been investigated with the participation of the large prison against Perry.
They were employed by Michael McKrum, a Special Prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed by the Republic of Justice.
Perry did not admit himself guilty and called a political accusation.
His powerful legal team requested the judge who led this case to reject the accused act, claiming that the law used for the persecution of the Gouvernant, which performed its responsibilities more than all in the whole history of Texas, is declared that it is contrary to the Constitution.
Perry has stopped funding for $7.5 million from the State Department of Public Control, which is based on the Travis district, and has been persecuting corruption in the Texas public sector when Lemberg refused to leave.
There was a official complaint from the public control group with left views.
Perry confirming availability is often updated, and sometimes becomes famous.
At the fifth meeting of the Iwave party during his presidency campaign in 2012, Perry responded to hearing that he could go out of the game, publishing you with a photo walking around the lake, and saying: "We are, Southern Caroline!"
Berkeley reports that the democracy market returned to the normal state.
One of the most famous manufacturers of London warned that the market of non-motiveness in South-East England returned to the normal activity level.
The house in the capital was subject to a living demand and a deeply growing prices, with a wide expansion of the fear that the creditor was subject to the Bank of England to establish the limitations of the hypothesis in June.
Tony Pijley, the constructive and chairman of the Berkeley building company, said on Monday, "After the current financial year, the market returned to the normal level of transactions from the 2013 pick," added that this was the "stabilious medium".
London’s inmobility market was shocked during the fall, as foreign purchasers went into the capital.
The prices in the city increased to 18.5 per cent in the last year, according to the Earth Chairman, significantly reduced the average rate of 6.7 per cent in England and Wales overall.
The average market prices for private, accessible and student schemes in Berkeley increased about one five in the past year, reached 423000 £ at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the fund in the past months has been less attractive for foreign purchasers, some of whom also stopped introducing new taxes on non-motiveness and political ritoric around the potential "special tax" before the general elections in May next.
The London Inmobility Agency for Foxtons last week warned that the April Market Reform, which had been introduced more heavyly, also affected the decrease of the market growth as the market purchase in movement as well as the prices in the second half of the year.
The frequency data from Bank of England on Monday showed the fall of the number of approved hypothetical injuries in June, predicting further housing markets.
Hamptons International, another non-motive agency, has reduced its prognosis of growth in London ' s inmobility prices by 2015 to 3 per cent on the basis of the decrease of the prices of immobility.
At the same time, transgressions have been cut for four comparisons to the previous year in London's most road areas, such as Chelsea, Mayor and Kensington, on the information of the WWA Elliss Agency.
However, the home question was very beneficial to Berkeley, increased the amount of sales above 2,2 billion.
Mr. Pidley added: "The question of the good design and the best place remained previous and, reflecting this, the sales for the period have remained."
In June, the company reported that the sale of 3742 new houses in this year until the end of April was almost thirder than the precrisis pipe in 2007.
The annual income of taxes was 40 per cent compared to the previous year to £380 million, revenue to 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
On Monday, before the yearly meeting of the company, Mr. Pijley reported that the preferential income of Berkeley for this year would comply with the current market expectations.
According to the unilateral opinion of analysts, the income is expected to be paid to $450 million per year.
The value of the Berkeley shares was holding on £23.96 in the second half of the day on the London board.
Photos published by Jennifer Lawrens on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrens arrives at the 85th ceremony of the United States China annual prize.
The photo of the actor Jennifer Lawrens, received by the Oscar Prize, was posted in the Hacker Internet, which believes that there are more than 100 catalyst photos of the catalogue stars.
The representative of the "Great Games" confirmed that the photos of Lawrens are real and condemned the hacker for "now invasion in personal space".
They have been treated in law enforcement bodies, and they will follow anyone who publishes the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrens.
Photographs that were originally posted on the website of the 4-chan photos were obtained by the lack of the Apple iCloud online storage system, and the victim 'catalog' includes the names of the dudy women, including Rianna, Kim Cardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winst and Mary Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It's not clear how many of these photos are down, although the stars "Scott Pilgrim against all" in Twitter were also condemned.
"The one who looks at the photo that we made with my husband a few years ago, joining home, I hope you're proud of yourself," wrote Winstred at Twitter.
However, Victoria Jastis from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorian Victoria" checked that she wrote on the photos of the Twitter: "These are the photos called me FALSHIVIK, people.
Let's stop it in the skin.
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that the representative of the post-star Ariana Grande had checked what photos it would like to be drawn.
Exclusive exhibition from the new Rom Howard Jacob on love and letter "J" calling critics
They developed, better say so, they gradually disappeared like a swimming card box left under rain.
Only a woman has told him that he was too serious, hard in society, pressed, closed, and may be a little disappointed.
And then she kissed his hand.
He saw disappointment in himself.
He was sweet like egg, yes.
The last victim of this colleague was a small man whom he expected more than normally, the release of a single life and, possibly, even some satisfaction.
Aline Solomons was a tricky of beauty with shocked hair and a thrilling heart from the northern island village, more distant and sweet than Port Royben.
She came to the south of the satellite to the older one, who Kevern considered her tea, with the latest heritage of the house in the heritage, but seemed to be a paradise of the Valley under a joyful name of the Ray Valley.
No one lived in the house for a few years.
In the bathrooms, the swimming powders left the slippers on all windows that are sure that the house belongs to them; the garden of the shoes like the giant cocktails.
It was like a cottage from a child book, a horrible and horrible garden with full secret.
In view of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose "J" Roman is included in the Buckery Prize list in 2014.
The sharp list will be declared on the next week
Kevin and Aileen sit down, guarded the hands, in shocking shoes among the hot, enjoying unexpectedly warm birthday; they both spended into a slight console, which enjoyed the country of a mixing music and a calm news, when he looked at her baptized root feet, he recalled the old sing of the old slowest artist who loved him to listen to his father from the shoes to the house.
You have too big feet.
Because of their aggressiveness, the songs of this type of console have no longer been played.
They were not prohibited - nothing was ownership - just lost them anymore.
They helped to be archaetic as the word "archy".
The public has done what would never be able to achieve orders and prescriptions, as well as the books of people have chosen the memories of the poor, the culinary books and the loved Romans, they have chosen the ballots from all musics.
Instead of this day, Kevern began playing on the imagined forthepiano and the smell of comic voice to shut the great feet of Aline.
Alain didn't understand.
"It was a popular song of a jazz pianiist called Faths Waller," he said, machineously put two fingers into the legs.
So he always did his father to stop the "J" letter before she gets out of his leg.
This began with the game they played when he was small.
His father played with her father as he told him.
Start the word "J" forgetting the ring of two fingers, and that's going to stand on you.
It wasn't a very fun game then, and it wasn't very fun now.
He knew that he was waiting for it, it's all right.
He was supposed to explain what's Jazz.
Alain never heard him.
Jaz did not play, although he was not openly prohibited.
The improving came out of the mode.
There's only one "exley" in life.
When the melodies started, people wanted to know exactly where it ends.
It's exactly the same with the stroke.
His inevitableness has acted in nervous.
Jaz was a stroke expressed by music.
Although he reached a ten-year-old age, he never heard about Sammy Davis Mrousch, but Kevern knew that he was a jazz from the father's disappointment collection.
But even if he didn't have to tell Alain that Faths Walller was black.
Notwithstanding her age, she remembered the time when the popular skins were not black.
Any more, no law or pressure.
The society was obedient, and this means that each of his sects agreed with thanks to those who cast the judge with the principle of group preference.
People in Africa and the Caribbean temperature and physical characteristics have been well approached to the field of disappearance and sport, and they shouted and fled.
The expenditure from India, like the natural talents in all matters of electricity, has been taken to ensure that no family remained without the working electronic phone.
What remained from the Poland Diaspor was worked with sanctuary work; what remained from the Greek, a bit of tall.
Outlooks from Persian Valley and Levanta, whose grandfather did not want to leave the country when TO, TO PROYSOSHLO, ECLICE WORKS SOW has occurred, in fear that they were accused of smiling the smells, in fear, in the own way, that the smell will shoot them the following, opened the restaurants with the lab and the calians, and they were not shocked and shocked out of the part.
Each of the ability.
As she had heard only the ballots, Alain was difficult to understand how disappointing words that just slaughtered her Kevin could actually be placed on music.
Musical is a expression of love.
"They are indeed not disgraceful," said Kevern.
Anyway, it may be for people who have great feet.
My dad never struck anybody, but he deserved this song.
He said too much, but the launched garden gave him a safe illusion.
No word was able to pass through the sound-isolation of guigans like clusters.
Alain didn't understand.
How could your father love that?
He wanted to say that it's a sweet, but he didn't want to get two fingers back to her.
She's already considered it strange.
"He seemed to be funny," he said instead.
She's innocently cutting her head, locked the Cair's review.
There was nothing in the whole world, except the shoes of her hair.
Nothing he would like to look.
"No, if you say so," she said, staying at her opinion.
But that's not exactly explaining why you're going to eat her.
It seemed to be really disappointed.
I have too big feet?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
I don't know, maybe...
And you're saying you hate me because my ships are too sweet?
I hate you?
Of course, I don't hate you.
It's just that stupid song.
He could say, "I love you," but it was too early for it.
"You like me just because you've got the biggest ships," he tried to say instead of it.
I'm so sorry.
It was wrong.
He wanted it to be funny.
The attempt to smile was often brought him into a poor situation because, as his father, he did not have the calm appreciation that could smell the brutality shocking in the shock.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevin, wanted it.
Despite good eyes.
Alinn Solomon was shocked and stood from the shuttle, shocked the console and swallowed the wine they drinked.
The wine from the shooting could not be sentenced to him.
In her concern, she seemed to have drove as palm letters in the uragan.
"And you like me just because you have a crazy head," she said...
Even if you don't like it.
He was regretted to her and because of the painfulness of his words, and because of the fear that appeared in her view when she gave him refusal.
Does she think he'd shoot her?
She didn't talk to him about life in a cold northern archive where she grew, but he did not doubt that she was like a sweet.
The large swimming ocean was on both sides of them.
The same men, even more sensitive and fairly after the TOT, who were assaulted by a man, were prepared to put the hand to any woman to reject or sign them.
That's a sweet head?
They would show her a sweet shock if she wouldn't be careful!
First, it would be smelled - the seed now became the most common expression of herotic disaster between men and women; the opposite to the prestige ballots that had issued the console - to eat it first and then to shoot it.
The most accurateness, according to Keverna, is that it was already smelling for himself.
Allin Solomon's corps showed that he had to go.
He was up of the shirt as a old man.
She felt a sweet pain, but his weight was surprising her.
It was not the end of the light.
They're just aware of each other.
She looked out, and she looked out of the upper window, and she looked out, her satellite was a man who had shooted himself.
Adam who left the garden, she thought.
She felt that she and men, some of them had taken up on her hands.
A man who was away from her with a soft shooting, shocked, shocked, all the ability to fight left him - why did she feel that she knew so well if she couldn't remember any case until today when she saw that?
Another Alain Solomon looked at his feet.
For twenty years before the above-mentioned events or around Esme Nusbaum, a intelligent and energy 32-year researcher who worked in the Office, the informal supervisory of the General Assembly, has prepared a small report on the maintenance of a low and medium-sized violence level in the country, where it was expected that, if it was not completely stopped, it was expected to be delayed, taking into account the means and forces of its elimination.
"My people have been done, and many are done," she wrote, "to strike up the aggressiveness of people who were struck in the thousand war and winned by most of them, especially among these satellite winds and the strips of the place, where, despite the earliest parts of the churches, the breath of human goods was rarely seen throughout the history.
Some qualitys, however, are unexpected.
Besides the shock, it seems to be less than it's pregnant.
The population is smiling over sensual ballots, the history of overcome obstacles, and proclaims its faith in the well-being of marriage and family life, but not only the old rape of its strongness as well as in rural communities, but also of the new and bad drugs in homes, workplaces, roads, and even rural areas.
"You have a tendency to write too much," her scientistman said, reading the report with a whole.
I think you should read a little less routines.
Esme Nusbaum was cut off the head.
I have to ask you too, are you atheist?
"I think it's not the obligation to answer," said Esma Nusbaum.
Are you lesbian?
Esme reiterated his right to private life and silence.
Phoenix?
Another silence.
"I'm asking", said Luther Rabinuz, "not because I am against atheism, desbiation or pheminism.
We don't have any warnings here.
We are the servants of society without warning.
But some kinds of hypersensitive, absolutely accepted and inspired themselves may sometimes tell results, such as what you have shown to me.
Obviously, you are warned against the church and what you call "fade" and "truck", others would interpret as a expression of natural life and energy.
Continue the need for TOM, WHAT TO TO TO, WHAT WORK TO TO THE LOVE, as it seems to have occurred if it happened last night, means to leave the country of its necessary life force.
Esme Nusbaum was looking at the sides when Rabinez spoke.
On his head, racial as flamingo, light-did letters repeated the advice that Ofnau gave to the country the last fourth century or more.
Listen to your neighbor, prices of your couple, listen to the ballot, go to the muscles, talk on the phone, communicate, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
A conversation is better to silence, a word of song better than the written word, but nothing better for love.
"I totally understand what you want to say," said Essme Nusbaum quietly when she convinced that her scientific leader ended saying, "and I don't want to say anything, except that we didn't get so effective as we convince ourselves.
I am worried that if we are not ready, we will find that we are repeating the errors that have been made to TOMU, TO THE PRAYSOLO, HOW WITH WORK THE PROCEDURE.
Only this time we will turn out our wrath and infidelity to others.
Luther Rabinuz connected the fingers to the piramid.
This joke had to mean uncomfortable patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "invoking the "error" actions that made or did our grandfathers.
You're getting too far and when you're talking about they're cut off their "good" and "infidelity" on the other.
There should be no need to remember that, understanding the past, we're not talking about ours and them.
There were no "no" and no "others".
It was a time of uncommittee - it's all we know.
"The one who, if being honest with himself," intended to enter Esma, "no part of society could be well justified.
I don't blame anybody.
Whether it was bad or good - what was done, it was done.
Then it was.
Nothing else need to say - here we agree.
And as no one should blame, it must not be justified if it was appropriate or if something could be corrected.
But why's the past if not to learn?
The past is to forget him.
If I can add to this one word--
The pyramid of Luther Rabinician has disappeared.
"I'll consider your report," he said, leaving her.
On the next day, on the way to work, her motociclist was slaughtered out on the throat, as the shock described, "in a wicked wrath."
The birthdays are happening.
Army Lesozo claims that the movement was not planned; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
The representatives of Lesozo checked the facts of the shifting process to the Government, claiming that they have acted against the police that suspected in the attempt to wake up political fans.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, claiming that the army of the country had surrounded its official residence and cast the government buildings in the capital of Macera.
The Primer takes his family to the neighbor of South Africa, claiming that he was threatened to pursue his life.
The representative of the Army, Major Ntoi, stated that it wasn't actually turning, but that the army had reacted to the threat of the "political fans", which the police tried to wake up.
"What happened this morning, the commandment of the Lesoco Armed Forces took steps, receiving a number of information reports that there are elements that are really planned to weaken some political, young political fans who were ready to build haos", he reported the United States.
The representative of the South African Government, Clayson Monella, said that the army's action was a turn.
"There nobody has claimed to shut up the authority of the force, in all senses, the acts of the armed Lesoso forces at this time have the fundamental signs of the movement, " he said.
The representatives of Lesozo reported that the soldiers returned to the chairma on Sunday and that in the capital was peaceful.
At the time, the Vice-Minister Moettjo Meetsing managed the Government in the absence of Taban.
Tabana said that it was believed that the attacks were caused by trying to fight corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesoco was very pressed since June when Taban has suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of disputes in its common Government.
He stated that his actions did not rape the Government, despite the accused of return.
Shelse Defenseer Marco Van Hinkel will conduct the next season on the right of the aircraft in the Milan, reports Milan Channel.
The 21-year-old Dutch will arrive in Italy in the nearest hour for medical survey.
In the past season, he went to the field in the London club only three times.
Let's remember that the Milan was driving in the "Liverpool" attacking Fernando Torres.
Production in euros at the lowest rate of 13 months
The growth in Europe was delayed to the low indicator of 13 months in August, according to the popular research.
The latest value of the market-based independence index (MMI) in the marketing sector was noted in August by 50.7, delaying from 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders were detained, and enterprises suffered from the growing pressure between the EU and Russia regarding Ukraine.
The values were made before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
The lines will be expected from the bank ' s clear plan to deal with the stopping of the euro, as well as with the threat to deficiency in inflation that is totally 0.3 per cent.
There is a recommendation that the ECB Mario Draguy leader may later give additional signals that he considers a quantitative assembly scheme for euros like those used by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.
"It is a better growth than no growth, the thrombous effect of economic and geopolitical incertitude to producers, " said Rob Dobson, the older market economist.
The production sector in Germany, the largest Russian trade partner in the EU, has fallen to the lowest than 11 months of note 51.4.
As a result, at the second level of the block economy, France, the SME has slowed to 46.9.
France continues to cause this concern, as well as the weakness of Italy from stability growth to stability.
Noting that the impulse of growth in the main industrial engine, Germany, and Spain, and the Netherlands also does not add confidence," said Mr. Dobson.
The shortage of the industry, more likely, is still undertaken by analysis expecting additional monetary or tax stimulation.
One positive news was from Ireland where SMEs increased up to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, the primary economist of IHS Global Insight, said: "There is the very important thing that can be said about the augustic investigation of the Euro-Productive Index, and that it shows that the sector still grows."
He added: " The Europeans, apparently, have seen a very serious life at this time, as the current increased geopolitical tension - especially related to Russia/Ukrainian - adds incertitude to the still complex conditions in many countries.
This increased tension apparently has been attacked by business - and in particular by consumers' confidence, and it probably causes some orders to delay or even cancel, especially large orders.
He said that "too more like it," that the ECB, of course, must be carried out a number of variations, "we want to suspect that it will be limited."
The people of Mariopol will have a living cep against the employees
In Mariopol, before the last week, everything was peaceful - nobody had been able to organize the National Republic of Mariopolis, the city was living and worked in the Asian Sea.
Now the people are in fear waiting for the arrival of the civilians.
In the version of the politicians, separators are passed to Mariopol to go to the Asian Sea, which was recently taken by the city of Newoazowski, which has not yet entered into a self-employed Republic.
Mariopolis decided that the Ukrainian army was going to protect them, but it had a little against the excellently armed representatives of DNA-LNR and was gathered to help the military.
They're growing offs, building blocks and strengthening.
On Saturday night, a few thousand people came to the eastern border of the city, and they stood there in the lived tent, shocking the mountain of Ukrainian.
They're going to do the same in the case of an invasion.
Volunteers will collect and retain, collect medication, published newspapers.
In the city, shops are slowly closed, stop the work of banks and banks.
Ten years old for the survivors of Beslan: ten years from the ill-school of school as children who have been in her, still suffered
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken in the Tschechian fighters in Beslaw, South Russia
More than 330 people, more than half of their children, were killed during this three-day trial test, which has struck the world
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who were inflicted by death during the illness at school.
About ten years later, after the terrible invasion of the unlawful school, 334 people died, including 186 children, who were heroically surviving catastrophus last night for the new appeal in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, disfellowshipped and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new fourth time, it seemed to be a very extremely possible evil.
Tragedy joined the east and the western retreat, which was wonderfully growing into action and hope for the future in the conditions of serious tribulation.
Ten years later, we returned to Besland to the south of Russia to find some of the victims who were inflicted to death during the school beliefs.
We have found wonderful young people who have opposed the calamity, although the memories of terrorism are going to live with them forever.
The greatest hope of them?
What a war that is now quoting Ukraine, in which children died as they are, now stopped.
A girl who's trying to get back to a shooting room on the picture
It was printed on a picture of a famous Russian photo, Dmitri Bellaka, when in one white, he tried to get back to a shooting sports hall after the mine explosion.
Aid was desperately looking for her mother, Laris, who is now 40.
There were fears that both they died, but in fact they survived.
"The woman told me to run out of all the forces, but I couldn't," Ida said.
My feet were broken with blood.
I stood and used back inside to find my mother.
The Soldat took her and took it in a safe place.
After the surgery, she thought that it was completely restored, but yesterday said, "Third months ago, he was worried.
I'm afraid, I can need more operations.
A few of them remained in my core.
She's now being a donist, helping people as he helped the doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but she, of course, did not cut her", she says with a call.
"It happened with me, and I can't change this fact.
Once a year, I'm always going to this sports room to remember all those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about this in other days.
It's too strong.
My best friend, who had to be my colleague, was killed there.
We played together when we were kids, and we dreamed that we were going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I'm not going to work.
I'll think about the family later.
She says it's sweet to be with her, although the memories are smelling every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our disasters, and we are so grateful for the assistance we have received from the people from Britain and from here.
When I see in the Internet photo where I'm in the school window, I think many people will see it first, know our tragedy, and do so that doesn't happen anymore.
The boy who runs through the grape of a ball, thinking that his mother was dead.
It was his first day at school (the Russians starting school for seven years) and survived three days of smooth, understanding their mother Tamar.
Then he was seven, and he said, "Mother said to me to smell if the explosion was, and to keep her in the hand."
After one of the explosions he thought she would die.
She said, "Good."
Thus she was dead, he fled and on the road saw a laughing little, took a child behind his hand and fly through the grain of a ball.
His father, Vladimir, who took his son outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was elected to freedom and was in a hospital with feet in his feet, and he was thinking that her son was dead.
After their unions, she said, "I cry with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He escaped and escaped me.
Amira later arrived to London (the present unbelieving news of the World), where he was rewarded as the Protector of Childs from the Barnardo's Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Shery.
"This fear returns to you every day, but I would like to stop remembering him," said he yesterday.
I can always tell you that I'm in the memory he's smelling.
I remember as soon as I put all my game weapon off.
But now I can play in computer games with a gun, and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to return to that sports hall, but I don't think about myself.
I remember the kids I played in the room that didn't have a choice.
We never say they're killed or dead.
We're saying they're staying in a sport room.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially a playing shop where I have allowed to choose everything I want, and a trip to the car with an open top.
But now he is afraid of the places like Ukraine where wars bring to the tribulation he and his friends.
This fear comes back to you every day, but I would like to stop remembering him.
"I'm so sorry all those suffering from these fears," said Damar, who had been working on the voluntary work last week in the women's monaster.
I want to help you so.
I want to serve to the police and I hope I will be counted in the next year.
His mother Tamara, 48 years old, said, "37 children were killed in our quarter, can you imagine yourself?
I remember the smell of the calm immediately after the shoot, but there was no children who would cry and run around, and this silence continued a few months.
She's gonna remember his trip with Damar to London.
People in London were crying when I told our story.
I understood how people at the other end of the earth can understand our feelings can support.
She was grateful for Sheri Blair and her fund for that reward and the opportunity to go to London on October 2004.
I would like to call Sheri and just tell her that 10 years ago, but I still remember meeting with her and her husband in London, and how they helped Damy and me.
I remember that when Damar wanted to eat the ship, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with the officers in the restaurant, Damar shot them out of his water weapon, and they run and played with him.
And the whole month after our shock was then.
I was surprised that the British people were so ready to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I all think that this world is not better than these ten years.
Now the war is in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think many children have been killed and they will be killed.
It's just the same kids as ours.
I think for many people of war it's a news report that they're listening when they're crazy or when they're doing something else.
I just know that these people feel, horrible.
And I can't stop feeling him.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so painful.
Damal grew up and became a very calm and peaceful boy, not agressive, not a wicked.
He's not looking for places, for example, he's not circled on this past cosmart.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close to six colleagues, and they're going to a sports room from time and smell there.
When he was younger, he suffered from this - I remember when he stood on the guard, turning away from us, hours.
He wasn't sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he cast out all his weapons and other military games, and I am now 17, he is above me, sympathetic, intelligent and healthy.
I'm sure with my job for a few hours I was so sure he's dead and I'm never seeing him anymore.
When I was able to justify from the explosion and up on my feet, I saw the hell around myself when the body was slept all over there.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could survive in this fool.
"I remembered that I cryed to him, "Damir, run, run!" but again I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard and fled.
So life continues to be different from many others.
Georgium Ilin, 17 years
A boy whose shocking photo after the shoot became a determining tragedy in Beslaw
Fire: Beslan George Ilin and his mother Fatima after the slaughter in 2004 and Georgy today
On his shocked face, it was an impression of fear when he was saved from the death when the Tschechian terrorists shooted his colleagues.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarics in Beslawn.
His mother, Pharma, in 54, led him to school at the first day of school before taking him to the University of Withorn.
"I went for two minutes before the terrorists fled to the door, so my little boy remained one for three days," she remembered.
Not just one, there was a family of our parents, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgy could survive.
Before this date, it's harder to think and talk about it.
There's no day when we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes of these days in my front of my eyes.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
The soul is: the photo of Georgia (left) was one of the most shocking pictures of the attack and was shocked in the sculpture (right)
I remember Georgy wanted to go to school on the day that he said he wanted to understand the teacher.
I just knew he was alive when I saw him at the TV.
There is even a sculpture of Georgia in San Marino.
Georgy doesn't like to look at this photo, and she's hidden in our book shooter at home.
I understand, but I also think that through this photo, people from all the world feel our pain.
Georgy now says, "It's important that this never happens.
"I doubt that we will ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragics and never know the truth.
Now they investigate the violation of Boing in Ukraine.
Do we ever know what she was called?
This world comes to something very bad.
"I can't understand how this happens, because if you ask people, nobody wants war, so how does that happen?
Ten years - nothing for such pain.
We need to pass for decades to forget her.
She affected my health, and I still feel her.
For about three or four years, I've been shocked with the shock, but now it's been better.
I returned to school in 2004, and I was very scared every day.
I thought about my friends and colleagues who were killed.
That's why I continue to go to this sports room before each September.
I want to give me the memory to my old friends.
I'm hard to get into the sports room, but I have to do this.
I don't feel a victim, this story is part of my past.
I'm not forgotten about this, but I don't feel bad for myself.
My life continues.
I finished the school this year and did a medical university at the Governing State.
I'm going to learn to become a cardiochurgo.
My first choice was to go to the army.
I wanted to be military, but the health hasn't allowed me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgy Farnives, 20 years
A boy who survived, despite the leg of a terrorist murderer
Incredible: Georgy Farniv was at the foot of the terrorist murderer while he was discovered, but he could still survive.
During the shutting, he was photographed in the sports hall, sit down with a bomb in the foot of the terrorist murderer.
Indeed, it's a wonder that he wasn't killed.
"We think it was still yesterday," says Georgy, who wanted to learn to the FBI Intelligence Office, but couldn't cause the damage caused by his health during the injury.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and I say that kids are easy to handle the bad smells - I have to say that it's wrong.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists, and I felt little better after that, but I can't forget it.
I would like to forget.
In 2005, the next year was the first and last time I entered this sports room again.
I lost my conscience.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show where I sat on this known photo.
The survivors: Georgy Farnivev today with an open football photo in the hospital after heating
My pain is great, and I'm putting her with myself every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or to discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
With regard to physical condition, I'm healthy.
I need to be careful with a colleague who was damaged, but I'm fine now.
But the whole health did not let me go to the FBI Academy in San Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical conclusions, and they answered that it was impossible.
My second infringement was animals, so I went to the Water Institute.
I've been there for two years.
He's learning to treat all animals from the cows to the bowl.
He said, "I know that I will never tell my children about my experience.
That's not what children need to know, and of course not what they have to survive.
His mother, Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
She's in my soul, worse the birth is near.
I'm going to go and I'll be present at the ceremonys that will be held to notice it.
I know that Georgy's not going.
She must be stronger for him, because he was there, and I don't.
I was waiting for him home and I couldn't help.
I'm so grateful that he's returned to me and that's the impression in Beslane.
He's staying with us.
Georgy is now grown, but this cocktail is still with him.
It's hard to accept that when something is so badly injust, it happens to you.
He's a boy, he loves sports, but he can't take care of them.
He had several operations, he could walk, but he couldn't do a sport.
I would say he'd over 50% overlooked this shooting, but it's impossible to overcome and forget it.
This wearing experience will remain with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the injury, and that's only to increase my pain.
I lost many people that I knew well and who were my ways.
My son with me, and it's the best gift that God could do to me, but my heart hurts those who were killed.
I know the family where new kids were born, but I know the ancestors who have never been married.
It's hard to accept that life continues, even if you don't want.
I'm never forgetting how the heart shooted me out of the snake at the time I saw him in the hospital.
Now, I look at what happens in the world is wars in different regions.
Why are these people fighting?
Why are they killing one another?
The war is very close to our country now, and I'll believe it.
We were a friendly country in the past, so how did we have a war now?
People and children suffer, I'm sure many children have already been killed in Ukraine, and many will be killed.
If it could be able to take all the traders and get away as far as possible.
Alena Zcaeva, 10 years
A girl who has strictly taken a safe struggle for the specialist
Savior: Allan Chavhu is in the safe place of the Russian battle of Spences (left).
Now she's ten (right) and she will not really remember the wonderful crime
The world has stopped breathing in 2004 when a small Alena was shocked out of a sweet school in Beslana, Russian police.
The terrorists abandoned her, but with cruelity, they left her 30-year-old mother, Christine's sister and Brother Mahara in the sporting room.
Mahar, who was then three years old, was saved, but Alenian’s mother and sister died in a dead battle.
Her father Ruslan has been married again since they had a little daughter with his new Sweetheater, whose name was Christian in the memory of her lost daughter.
Alena, who is now ten, will not remember the sweet and grow into a wise and living girl, says the neighbor.
"He's a great happy family now, and Alena and Mahar are both beautiful children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a magnificent father and wants to keep them beyond all memories when the tenth anniversary is noted.
We can understand why.
The Defenseer Sindzi Kagawa, returning from Manchester Yunuit in the Dormud Bourness, said that he was able to go back to the field in the form of a German club.
He said that this transfer is a joyful event in the carriage.
Of course, I'm very glad that I'm going to play again for the Bourssia -- brings Kagawa's words.
It's very good.
Positive emotions and with enthusiastic waiting when I can again go to the field in the Boursia form.
Remember, Kagawa moved to the Mediterranean from Burundi in 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he was not able to shut up in the English club, conducting a total of 38 mathematics in the Championship of England, killing 6 pounds and delivering 8 resulting transfers.
Man is accused of training a girl at a swimming "pelican" shock in Fife
A 78-year-old man will be present before a court on a three-year-old girl at the "pelican" passement in Fife.
Gordon Stuart was slaughtered a girl in Petevine in East New York.
Prosecutors stated that Mr. Stuart had made his Audi Q3 without adequate care and attention and murdered the girl, as a result of her trauma.
Stuart, 78 years of age, was denied by his guilty in the Sheriff Court of Dani.
Sheriff Charles McNair, the Queen lawyer, appointed the date of the court in January.
Obama, Mercel and Olland are not retreated in the Vladimir-Est
The shopping of Duty Free Airport, Vladimir-West airport, issued a table that prohibits a number of world-wide political leaders to purchase this shop.
Don't be disappointed by spirits, waters, and horses.
The Administration of Magazine decided that the President of the United States Barak Obama, the FIG Angela Mercelle, the President of France, France, Vitalia Clíchco, Julia Timochenco, the Prime Minister of Japan and some other known companys would not be able to dismiss the water, the horse and the spirits of their shops.
And it was on the door of the corresponding table.
Before, Obama was prohibited to appear in a less available to him on the type of Institution Service, the Diatric Table of IMOs, as reported on the site of the firms.
Whether the President of the United States had a dream to ask for a diät table in Russia, not known, but the authors of the bans are apparently terriblely strict to themselves.
Is there a snare after the embargo: Medveiv gave the advisory to the Agrarians
The Prime Minister of Russia, Dmitri Medvedev, believes that, in the conditions of the Russian aggregators, new technologies should be undertaken in order to arrange the deployment of insurance purchasers.
The Council was given at the meeting of the Southern Promoting company Agromplax.
The Head of the Government also gave the reservators to resort to the Russian meat, the quality of which is at the level.
The annual embargo for food imports was imported in Russia from 7 August.
The main trainer of the Russian Valentin Masslake collected is welcomed by the outcomes of the tourist DecaNation.
According to the specialist, the third place is a good result, taking into account the absence of targeted training for reconstruction.
Our sports have been speaking at their level - it brings all the sports.
The third place is the confirmation of our high-level command.
It is glad that the advantage of French and even the Americans of us is minimum.
We have not been ready to do so.
The season was closed, and we did not force our leaders to participate in the DecaNation Match.
In the past few years we became the second tower, but in this season we've been updating the assembly.
France, on the contrary, was a bomb team including 13 Championships of Europe.
They did not hide their intention to win this year, as they were several times declared publicly.
But even such a composition was not able to oppose the Americans.
I therefore believe that the Russians have been in such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some kinds were at the order below than the British League.
It's finished.
Of course, sports are no longer so important, as well as the decrease of the command level.
The main place was here.
The results agreed to be the absorption when the men were so affected by the tactical switch of flights that showed the results below the average level... of women's escapes.
4 Indications how to achieve the best quality of photos and videos
If you want to photograph or take a video under the water, the whole range of device options will be before you.
The most lowest option is a water-conducted "million", for example, Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an exchange, for example, GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are sold for $300.
I made these pictures on a family party with a number of cameras, just $350.
Independently from what equipment you are using, several rules are required to comply with the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a water-conduct camera, make sure that the camera battery and the other rooms are physically closed.
Furthermore, set your camera for the type of photos or videos you're going to do.
Some photos and videocames have switch modes or object types that optimize the exposition for posted subconditions.
And before swimming into the water, find out how your machine can slow down.
Some cameras are divided up to 5 feet, other 50 or 60 feet.
Look at our purchaser leadership and the ring of digital cameras and for traditional and water-produced models.
Take a few cards - because many of them are not receiving.
The "million" has J.C. that will help you shoot pictures, while they're not normally there.
Even if you have a JCD, it's gonna be hard to look under water, and the camera company will be an accidental process.
So do a few cadders.
Also, if your camera has a series of eating modes that takes several boxes with a few different installations of exposition, use them.
Stay on the surface.
The number of lights are significantly decreased than you nervous under the water.
If that is possible, stay on the surface when you get in the basin, the river or the ocean.
This also allows you to send more colors to photos; you're going deeply, less you will see.
Clear closer to board objects.
This is a good board for swimming powder, but it is still more important under water because of cutting light conditions.
Especially important if you get to the exchange camera: this device is often equipped with a fixed, widely wide line, which means that you'll need to draw close to coma objects if you want to fill the cart.
The Olympic Game of 2012 for the voluntary fighting of Bill Mahov may go into Greek and Roman fight.
This reported the main trainer of the Dugestan collected for the voluntary fighting of Said Saiida.
The Specialist did not exclude the participation of the world championship in Tascant in September 2014.
Bill Mahov is currently in the collection of classic teams, which produces "R-Sports" words of Sajda Sajid.
Indeed, the university was speaking in both styles.
At the world's early 2005, he became the winner of the volunteers and the third machine in the conspiration of the Greek Romanians and decided to concentrate on voluntary fight.
For a long time there was a conversation that the new stage of his carriage will lead to the Greek and Roman battle.
I'm saying more: Macov can already go to the world champion in Tascant - if he wins the shooting.
But the decisive word is always for the trainer head in the head of the Coguashville.
Andrew Lawson was a person whose personality power could strike around, even in a gigantic organization, such as the National Health Service.
Consulting anesthesisologist, he dedicated his career to liberate sick people from sickness and treatment.
Among those with whom he had been to remember his wife was the officer of MI-6 who had to live with the devastating consequences of torture.
Lawson understood that while the doctor is involved by diagnosis and diseases, the treatments are mainly worried about something different.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one who began to suffer.
"I didn't feel like normal," he wrote in May last year.
I was hard to find the power in myself.
Battle with symptoms like grip, he found that his wife, Juliat, was struggling.
"I want it to happen quickly, not later," he noted.
When Juliat went on the case for a week, Lowson found that he was uncomfortable and incomprehensible for the reason.
There was something wrong.
He asked the colleague to make the rings of a crude cell.
Two weeks ago, he was cast on legs in the French Alps.
The results of the rings are coming.
It was a mezotamic, unexpected cancer that affects the tribe or the skin of light.
For most cancers, it is difficult to find exact reasons.
Although some smokers are ill with light cancers, for example, not all linger cancers have been smokeed.
But otherwise with the shooter.
Just in all cases, it's a reason to contact the abast, a sweet building material that has ever been called a miracle, but that is now known to be deadly dangerous.
For most of us, it is a disease that can't be attentioned to.
Asbest, at the end, is material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbest is not used in Britain since the 1960s when the recommended industrial ban has entered into force.
Even when he used, only people from specific areas worked closely with him, such as tuberculosis, constructors, bodymen and workers, for example.
Industrial toxin from another epoch, it is only the cause of concern today.
But it's wrong.
The Great Britain is on the episode of the mezotors today.
There are more people from the Mesilians than any other country on the planet.
Annual mortality has about 2500 people, more than two times more people died from this disease than the result of car accidents.
Annual number of deaths from mezolets since 1980 and predicted deaths in the future in Britain
The reason we feel about his deadly consequences now is that, although the use of abast has been contrary to many years (all types of abast, finally prohibited by the law in 1999), the development of the missiles is usually decades.
And the invasion of the mezolators is not limited to veterans of industrial construction.
Asbest was, and in many cases it remains in the house where we live, offices where we work, schools where we learn, and shops where we go to buy.
As a result, the messanger does not take attention to the class, the level of availability, professional or age.
Based on election, from the modern London universities to private schools, as it happened, not saving.
The Parliament's building is decreased by the Abbasto.
Even hospitals intended to treat us have been reserved by this mortal cancer.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a pneumonic.
Indeed, he was supposed to think where he could contact Abby.
Then he turned out.
"That's like it could be a lot of abstaining in the tunnels in the Gay Hospital, where I've spent six years in the kitchen," he wrote.
All students, nurses, doctors and loaders have used these tonnels.
How many of my cousins have the same disease?
It was a question to which, unfortunately, he could give a partial answer.
"The four doctors who were in the Gaya hospital and who later developed a messor for the past five years," he stated in 2010, "and one remained alive."
How many of us have this disease?
Andrew Lawson was placed a diagnosis of "Missar" when he was 48 years old.
When he died, 17 February, he was 55.
Living so long.
Fifty per cent of the sick mediterm died over eight months after the diagnosis.
She's always dead.
So now we can just repeat the question of Lawson, "Why of us are ill with this same disease?"
According to the leading expert on the Mesilians in England, Professor Julian Pito, the most likely suggests that between 1970 and 2050, when the abuse of epidemic in Britain is to survive, about 900,000 people will die.
Most now do not represent that they will die so.

The rapid review of reports from the court hall where the victims are often in charge of compensation shows how far they have been dispersed by the messangers.
In June, for example, Marks & Spencer acknowledged that Janes Ellen had been contacted with Asbestom.
She worked in the network of nine years, from 1978 to 1987, the clothing offices on two objects, one of which was the main shops in Oxford Street.
Miss Ellen was only 18 years old when she began working in M&S.
She now has two children older than 20 years.
"And as it happened," she said, "I never heard about the messenger, I had just known about the abusive.
I couldn't come in my head that it's gonna cut me.
Many people really know the abuse.
Indeed, abast is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
They received their own name from the word "abstainform", which means a blonde structure that reports to them flexibility and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in buildings.
Crizotil, a widely known as a white abast, has often seen many others in buildings today.
He was used in blood pants, water packs, therapy of tuberculosis, swimming powders, even the cars of cars.
He is less dead than other forms of abast, but still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization of Serious Health, which can lead to death.
The more dangerous, however, is a shorter abast (ambist) and a blue abast (crochid).
Greece was once the largest importer of the world's core abast, and experts suggest that "wealth has been, although the outstanding reasons to believe that this is the main reason for the only high number of patients with the mezollator [in England]".
Marks & Spencer has affected the assasstor's main business shop in Oxford Street, London Alamy
Janes Ellen may have not been thinking of himself as a typical victim, but the work of Julian Pito makes it possible to suggest that her story is not far off.
He conducted a study of sick people who suggested that "the real percentage of the messors, when no known effects on work or home, were likely caused by the impact of the abast from the environment".
Most of these effects, he says, "normal use and weather impact" on our buildings.
Nobody seems to be sure he's safe.
The report of Goddard Consulting, which was considered by the Westminster Garden, shows how people, even in the government centre, could have an incomprehensive impact.
In 2009, Goddard reported that parliamentary committees had been infected by a beast which had been decreased by the death bottles that could be able to move somewhat unlikely as the powerful air flows.
Members of Parliament are often accused of their own interests, but in that case it seems true.
Although the Parliament ' s Technical Services Directive had emphasized that the Westminster's " clean witness" had now received, she recognized that it was necessary to work at $1 billion for the reconstruction of the parliament, improved the electricity and removed the abast, and that the members of the parliament may be meeting at the QE2 centre, not in the green camps of Westminster, after the 2015 general elections.
The Goddard report noted that "the situation of abustom was not ruled in accordance with different rules".
You can't know if this management would be a life.
All you can do now is waiting.
One of those who couldn't detect their contact with the Abby is Graham Abbott, the doctor of General Practice.
Andrey Lowson, Abbott, 50 years of age, suspects that he had been affected by the abuse when he worked in hospitals.
"I worked in the hospital, which was successfully announced to be abused," he said, "but I can't prove this in my case.
It's so difficult to remember all the places where he worked, and the date.
What he will clearly remember, that day at the beginning of December 2009, when it seemed like a slip.
He was 45, and he was on the midst of the afternoon.
Soon I started to smell.
This started very fast.
I felt horrible.
I thought I couldn't go all the way to home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that he had pain from the snake, the slippers around the light.
However, as Janes Ellen, he just had no reason to suspect the messenger.
Finally, he couldn't go to work for a month.
Recent doctors made ringgenic pictures and set triversal categories to remove flexibility and to analyze it.
But his state remained without diagnosis.
His health was slowly improved, and he returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms returned, often after his sports and he was hardly breathing.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came to him with similar symptoms, and he was then put the "Myssellor" diagnose.
But even then Abbott did not connect it to his own case.
At the end, his patient was a ten-year-old age and worked directly with Asbestom.
The relationship was clear in that case.
In September 2011, the state of Abbott was again deteriorated, and his consultant doctor showed the results of the TCT and the ringgenic pictures of the specialist group.
In December 2011, nearly two years after Abbott began feeling bad, the tank that was equipped with the camera, it was introduced in the field between the shell of his brown cell and the shell of his easier.
I'm optimist.
I'm just going forward," he says.
I didn't worry about this, honestly.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried about it.
The result of the biopsy came for a week between Christmas and New Year, "I said it was a mezotema."
Graham Abbott: Diagnostic diagnosis
Abbott was immediately loaded in meetings with Macmillan's nurse, one of whom he invited to contact the lawyer.
That's why he realized the epidemia.
"Asbest has been widely used, especially in large public buildings, where a lot of diagnosis in the tube, " he said.
People who have affected the abast in these buildings are now ill with this disease.
Thus, the Mezoryer is now intriguing young people of non-typical professionals.
The most dangerous isolated asbest tubes in hospitals were in the invasions, so it was little likely to suffer patients.
But many staff that passed on the heating tonnels to get from one building to another (cake Andrew Lowson) or eat in dust tables (which often did Graham Abbott) almost really have affected toxic substances.
Over a few decades after the war, hospitals were a place where, theoretically, they saved life for posters, but a place represented an threat to life for doctors who were treating them.
He's still getting away today.
Schools set up their mountains in Bunzén on a beast subscription
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbest has often been used in offices, shops, libraries and marries because of its wonderful isolation and fire-based characterists.
Schools too.
In general, many likely have had the first impact of the abast in the class.
In the whole country, at countless chemical lessons, school students set up their horses in Bunzhen’s abstentions.
Web sites were shown that they focused on the issues in schools.
As a result, in our homes, there were inadequate things, such as a pool or a snake, normally with a beast.
"This is the industrial nucleus in a large number of buildings", says Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Louson in the case of Gay's hospital.
In one case, the only contact that a sick woman could remember was raised in the 1970s.
So be careful, smiling gardens.
Effects of diagnosis when you know that illness is inexilable, terror.
"But to understand this, there's enough time," says Gregor Abbott.
I returned to work and tried to continue, but I realized that I couldn't focus on what I do.
I've been in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized that I'm going to go and get out with me.
Well, I won't meet Christmas.
One of the most difficult things was the transmission of the doctor's situation in the patient.
As an uncertain number of patients before him, he remembered how he was slaughtered with the accurate number of information that he had to take.
"It's hard to understand everything," he says.
"I asked my doctor how much time I have?"
I gave it about 12 months.
I remember how I thought, "I'm not going to meet Christmas.
"It's everything."
The Mezoryam is especially dangerous, since the engineer is as we support life, the breathing act is caused by cancer that kills.
The majority of the cases of the slaughter have been contacted with the Asbestom.
Asbest is of the crochet ball.
When the swimming smells are disrupted and the bottles are breathed, they can swim into the shoe, the slipper of the light.
The volcano asbest disappoints the snake and can cause mutations of cells.
"The fabric is due to the breathing of the shock snack of a beast", Professor Tom Trejar, a cardio-operation surgery who came to the Gaya hospital in 2001.
This is the hospital where, as Andrew Lawson suspected, he had the impact of the abast, now, on the iron of the judiciary leader of the Mezolet treatment center.
Trayer knew Louson and treated others who may have been affected by steadily in the hospital.
When the eggs of the abbist fall in the legs, Treyer says, "The breathing of them is on the perimeter where the ball is.
This is, in fact, a invasive process since the beginning.
General treatments in other forms of cancer are often less effective in the mezoter.
The effectiveness of the surgical involvement, for example, causes a deep conflict.
Some seem to have to try.
The trainer isn't agreed.
"I can't get out of the tribe," he says.
You can't start around her feet.
However, this cancer is "no very goodly subject to chemistry", which does, but does not cure.
"There are the sicks who live long from time," says Trejar.
But finally, they're all dead.
Happily, some patients live far more than they are expected.
Steven Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis was placed.
Two and a half years after the diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he was sick, Abbott met Andrew Lowson, who, four years after the diagnosis, became one-year support office and consultations for the same sick.
"Allo, the Headquarter", he lively said when they called.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He's put diagnes four years ago, and he's still very powerful.
First, Abbott suggested six chemical cycles that would take four months and extend the whole life for a month.
"I was in disappointment," he said.
I wanted to get out of here.
However, Lawson was able to make a few more positive scenes.
When he met with several specialists, Abbott decided to continue treatment with professor Lloyk Lanj-Lazungski, professor of toxic surgery in the hospital of Gaia.
"We had the advantage that I had no direction, I just called them, and they accepted me," says Gregor.
A medium-statistic patient would have to be provided for guidance and approval for funding.
Days play a decisive role for sick sickness to get the best of existing treatment.
However, when such treatment is ineffective, many sick people still face a financial matter for concern - the future family they remain.
And then they're on the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It is well known that abust is harmful for health since 1898," says Morgan.
But what has changed in the 1960s, it was understanding that even very small numbers could risk health.
It was then discussed about the inequalities of companies.
Andrew Lawson and the Gay hospital, finally, have resolved the case, but it was not a “resolution for the full value”, as Morgan did not have a clear evidence of the result of his measuring in the guest of Gay.
After investigating his death, the representative of Gaia's hospital still confirmed, however, that "beating in dual places that were speaking has been removed in the 1990s".
It was too late for Andrew Louson.
How to remove abest
Indeed, to communicate with an asbest to a company or a workplace, usually after decades of years, there was a great problem for patients who need compensation.
Many of their former employees have changed or closed.
The fearful archives could be lost.
Those who are protected from the skins know that at their side, of course, no.
In response, there have been severe new legislative acts that facilitate the sickness of compensation, even though their former employees could not be followed.
In accordance with this law, a £350 million fund has been established, funded by the insurance industry, for those who had been diagnosed after July 2012 and who could be able to contact, but who would not be judged.
In such cases, sick ones receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could normally condemn the compensation of about 120 000 £.
About 300 succeeding scopes are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, as many who work with a mezotamic, believes that $350 million represents a "something good work" for the insurance industry.
"This is a contract written by insurers for insurance", he said, "the amount is the fourth thing that the insurers should be paid if there was no temporary space and the sick persons with the insurance would be able to follow the company and seek a habitual way.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister of Labour and Pension, acknowledged that the law was "incomplete".
However, Penning and Morgan recognize that, when seven people die each day, rapid action was needed.
"Their people suffer so strong, and they need help today," said Penning during the second reading of Bill's messestrian in December last year.
At that time, Graham Abbott was in the hands of Professor Lock Lanj Lanzungski for 19 months.
After the initial consultations, Lanj-Lazungski recommended a surgical interference that, in contrast with Tom Trejare, he is considered effective.
This followed radiotherapy and chemotherapy, three therapy, in which Lang Lazungsky can be able to plead the total 40 per cent of the patient survivors in five years.
Abbott feeled like a powerful.
"This is, of course, one of the most important things," says Abbott.
You're seeing this in patients all the time.
There's some power that supports you.
When you get it, the situation may be very fast.
Graham Abbott has been able to operate in March 2012.
At the end of August, he finished the last six cycles of chemotherapy.
The following scanning has not shown the incidence of the disease.
Then I was scanning in March [2014].
There were a few five [cancers] in my breast cell.
I had to do 50 times.
It's not the threat of life.
It's the end of life.
And Abbott again passed through six cycles of chemotherapy.
There's no snacks now.
However, this process was physically and emotionally heavy.
You can think of practical things - about finances when I die, for example, or what the wife must show, how the phone works on the boarder.
When you get bad news, you're unreasonable.
We need to look forward.
As Dad Ellie, 16 years old, and Tamzin, 14 years old, it is not always easy.
"It's difficult for the parents," he says.
It's hard to understand what to say and how much to say.
When I was first diagnosed, I told the girls that I had a disease that means I'm not living before older.
They reacted very differently.
Tamzin is very comfortable and energy.
She told all his friends, and it was very fast to call us many.
Ellie was more deserved.
She didn't say much.
Such interviews are something that should be cut off all the ill cancer.
However, such discussions are not equal to hope for sick people, even the possibility of surviving.
This disease is with herself (as well as, finally, for Steven J. Gould).
According to Andrew Morgan, "the Member is not a threat to life.
The body of the tasted pharaohs is cut into the skins.
Wolfram abasts are used to strengthen the cash and improve warmty.

Now it is completely discovered that is not payable.
I've seen the cups made from him in the kitchens.
The current commercial use of asbesto begins in Italy, where it is used to produce papers (and banknote) and towels.
In Canada and South Africa, shocks are opened and soon later in America, Italy and Russia.

During the Second World War, judicial construction is intensely developed, one of the most dangerous professionals in the context of the contact with the Abby.
Voluntary industrial prohibition for imports of blue abast
The appeal Court confirms the first successful demand for health damage resulting from the contact with Asbestom in Britain.
World abast production will grow up to 4213000 tons per year.
Britain imports 139.000 tonnes.
The Executive Committee on Health and Industrial Safety in Britain requires that all abuses workers receive license.
The import and use of a blue and corrupt abast were prohibited by law in Britain.
All abast uses are prohibited in Britain.
Act on the Messenger adopted in Britain.
The compensation scheme of £350 million was declared.
Asbest is prohibited in more than 50 countries, but the white abast is still being used in low building materials in many parts of the world.
World production is preserved at about 2 million tonnes per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders; the protesters plead
The China Parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong's elections to move candidates to the election of 2017, despite the growing demands of democratic reform.
This step, likely, will begin long ago to the promised protests in Hong Kong's Quartet, as activists have started planning and mobilization in the following hours.
The decision of the General Assembly of the People's Representatives, in fact, allows communist leaders to remove all candidates that are not faithful to Beijing.
"This has not been inflicted with our expectations, but it's all anger," said the lawyer Emily Lau, Chairman of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Peyn promised.
They were inflicting Hong Kong people.
And of course we have a case with the authorisation regime.
Defending China's decision, Le Fey, Vice-General, the Permanent Committee of the Alliance of People's Representatives, said that it would be too "haotic".
Since 1997, when Britain returned over Hong Kong to China, Beijing promised that the people of the region could choose by voted by the head of the Government since 2017.
The Chinese leaders submitted the decision adopted in Sunday as a democratic step, as it provides to the Hungarians the right to a direct vote, but it is also obvious that the Chinese leaders continue to keep the process strongly in their hands with the Commission for the Movement of Candidates, which is widely controlled from Beijing.
Under the new article, only candidates who " love and love Hong Kong" will be granted.
The decision was adopted after the summer when one of the most wide and largest protesters in Hong Kong has been received for many years.
A major part of the promo-democratic campaign in Hong Kong was the Occupy Central with Love and Peace, whose organizations were threatened to reverse the Hong Kong financial area, if Beijing does not guarantee this entire election law.
On Sunday night, a few hours after a statement, hundreds of Occupy Central were gathered before the headquarters of the Hong Kong Government.
The organizations claimed that their movement was at the new stage of civil innocentness and that they would be shocked on the sights of protest in the following weeks.
However, they did not report details, obviously, to avoid problems with the public authorities.
In the online declaration, the organizer reported that the movement " had thought to close the central area only as an exclusive action that could be taken only if all possibilities of the dialogue were exhausted and no other election could be taken.
We are very regretted that today all the possibilities of dialogue are exempted and that the central area will be uncertainly covered.
The Governments in Hong Kong have been prepared to declare Beijing a few days, and the security measures were strengthened at the Headquarter of the Government's headquarters, with the accession of the police and barricad.
Many in Hong Kong feel that they are slowly losing control over their own city.
The protocol of maternity people increases competitiveness in the field of goods and services.
It also increases the fear that the value of Hong Kong, such as democracy and freedom of words, begins to decline under increased pressure from Beijing.
Some criticize the Occupy Central movement, saying that his demonstrations are a risk of business, a source of living force of Hong Kong.
"The question of which they say, it may lead to a great economic damage in depending on how long the person will participate and how long it will be", said the legislator of the Regin Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We don't want to diffuse the concern that Hong Kong comes out of control.
This is a submission that is dangerous for investment.
Chinese public media have also reported reports in the last days in which democracy activists were demonstrated by divergents shipped by western states.
In that year, activists organized an informal election law referendum, which brought to 780000 participants, more than one of the five electioners of Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands were one of the largest promo-democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
The United States educated ball culture is at the University Life: the first students suggested to arrive on a personal aircraft
We are glad to respond to such a question, starting the first service in Britain for the trips of the "Lux" category for the current students.
To leave a clear impression from the university, the company also proposes transport options such as a personal flight, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stuart also stated that the service was thinking of security.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who are usually to take their things through the whole country into a dangerous loading machine.
In combination with our new VIF options, we are deeply waiting for the help of students to reach the university with the minimum efforts and the maximum growth rate.
The representative of the company reported that since this service was just running, the orders were not yet made, but added that "the students would start ordering this service in the next few weeks".
The company also stated that, despite the need for students to pay for education of 9000 £ per year, she hoped to find a market for this service.
Current students have been very different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in regard to expectations and hopes: more important than ever, to make great first impression, and VIF is what they need.
Nevertheless, the National Union of Students discovered this service as a reliable from reality.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the Supreme Education, said: " This project represents an incredible effect from the lives of most students.
Many students who are starting at the university in this month have faced a crisis of the value of life when access to financial support in the form of credit and funds does not have a deep increased expenditure on basic needs, until they can actually start thinking that thousands of funds are a simple income in general.
Faminists take the question of raciality and the conduct of the police after Ferguson
The safe adolescent was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, previously in this month.
Those who arrive, skinly, say, "Let up, don't shoot!" until they are waiting for the fires.
After two weeks of protest in Ferguson, Missouri, associated with the murder of an unarmed adolescent Michael Braun, the blogger of Miriam Zola Prus noted the Internet discussion between white feminists.
According to her experience, white pheminists left comments made the genitors above racial belongance when the income moved reproductive rights and income inequalities.
However, while the pressure on the Middle West was growing and attracted to national attention, Overs saw the responses of white women, which focused on racial origin to 100 per cent.
In comparison with the reaction of black women, soon after the murder of the 9 August, personal exhibition with the titles such as "Ferguson's thoughts from the white woman" and "Feminism is not only about women's depression".
But for Pers, they have shown a substantial trail.
"In the feminine, I don't think there are many people who say about the white hair color and prize at such a high level," she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
This is very symbolic for the crisis we faced, and because (the situation in Ferguson) was so linked to racial origin, they felt that it was to be indicated.
For a professor of the English language at the University of Ogayo Corita, Mitchell Ferguson has discussed the problems with which black Americans face each day, but they are not investigated as "women's problems" in the cultural field.
"I can write something funny in the Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner, and I get 150 pieces out there," says Mitchell.
When I write something about how blood people are attacked in my own country, silence is earned.
"Why are women safely talking about relationships but not about public security?" she asked.
For black women, such as Mitchell, who have studied racial, gender and sexuality in the United States history, there is no divorce between racial and gender issues.
From its view, the blackness of women are in the situation to clearly share these problems; they are faced with the complex reality every day.
While white women are now joining racial origin and gender issues in the feminist Meister, Angel Huttery, professor of women and gender research at the University of George Mayson, says that their former women had been opposed.
"In the early 1865 and 1890, at least 10000 black men were broken, and there has been almost always a rape of the white woman," said Hatter.
We needed a white woman who confirmed the statement to defeat the ring.
In view of Hattery, a disappearing between white and black women occurred when white sophisticists, for example, Susan B. Entony studied the situation at the end of the 1800s and saw that the fight against election law would only be effective for a group: women or blacks.
"They decided to put all the eggs into the corner of the right to vote for women, and the right to vote for blacks should appear later," said Hatter.
Regarding such things, we have clearly shown why flore women do not trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women have reached the right to vote in 1920, white women have been united against the South Women's Association for prevention of lenses.
The group appeared nearly 40 years after the first request for assistance, Missell said.
In view of Mitchell, the reactions of white pheminists to the situation in Ferguson, the police ' s conduct, racial discrimination, reflects the time when white pheminists had been "doubling " problems with blackness women in several generations.
"One, it would be good if activists who have such an [traditional feminist] ideology would have seen the right to kids, as they are regarding the right to contraceptive?" asked Michel.
The second waves pheminists who have made the carriage to combat reproductive rights and access to contraceptives now begin to understand what this means.
The known white activist of the feminist movement Gloria Stein after two weeks after the murder, Michael Braunn used Fasbuck and published the slight article of the Guardian Rebecca Carrroll, which needed that the white Americans participate more in protests on racism.
"I hope that women with another, but like a reason for understanding the dangers of the physicians, - and the point of view of racial problems that are significantly different in public matters - will be in the head of change, " wrote Stein.
Although the pheminism involves its own and racial affairs, the genitor, its comments on racial racism in America still surprised.
Scientist of the American Business Institute, Christine Sommers, author "What has stolen pheminism?", said She The People, that young men in the United States, especially colorful young people, "morely vulnerable than their sisters," but the comments on the Pherguson faced a criticism that she had previously expressed.
Now we have hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for the boys.
However, when the White House recently initiated a small programme, “Strage to my brother”, to help vulnerable black and Spanish young people, followed the angry reaction of many pheminists, including the Gloria Stein.
Police relations with the black community is not the only problem to move forward to the traditional pheminism.
After the U.S. border service arrested about 63.000 young people without association to the South-West border this year, the immigration reform was again on the surface as a problem of women.
Andrew Mercado, co-chairman We Belong Together, who mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that to address this problem as an important for women, she only had to share the historys of immigration women.
"They say themselves for themselves," said Mercado.
When the majority of the working visions are issued [immigrants], women who are coming with them are in the position vulnerable for domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories are called in women's organizations," she said.
Ipskin house is sold by a sweet.
The home photo was removed by non-motor agents, when there was a large sweet swimming pool on the guest.
The private house with one bed is on the private road in Ipswicky.
The detailed description was the photo of a guest house, which was drawn up by a dog with a head covered at the guard.
Connells Inmobility Agency reported that the sweet is a home owner of the home.
"Only, the photo was displaced as a error and already removed", reported the representative of the company.
In details of the house, Connells described the former congregation house as a "unique apart house with one bed".
Although the Agency has removed a photo from its website, it is still in advertising materials.
The house sale was interested in social networks where some asked whether a pork was sold together with the house.
The Russian tennisist Maria Sharapur, in the fourth circle of the United States Open Caroline of Wonnicks, believes that it is lacking stability.
According to the deportation, she wants to complete the year and try to go to a new level, transfers from New York Vasili of OSSI.
How do you evaluate your results on the Good Slamming Tours in this year?
Of course, I'm glad I could win Rolan Harros.
With regard to the three other tourists, I haven’t had the stableness, especially in the end of some matches.
Now, of course, I'm disappointed.
I couldn't even go to the fourth finance.
What challenges do you face before the end of the season?
I have a huge motivation to go to the new level after the two invasion.
I'm about what to work, and I'm going to do everything I can to complete the year.

In the city of Harvey, South Wales, a new million was seen after the winner in the lottery
Game in Harvey's lottery in this month.
Search for a new million in the south-west of Perto, where one happier is going to get home for almost $1.1 million with a lottery player on Saturday night.
The Harvi gas kitchen offers gold in the second time for five years, as last $1 million in November 2009.
However, a lucky victory must still declare himself.
Steve Forvard's owner said that the winner was driving a small town to the south-west of Perth.
The whole city says about this, and it's all very excited.
We thought that such a winner could be secret.
Eight winners from Western Australia were the main winners in the last month, noting the end of a few weeks for the state players.
Last week, the Canning Wall player was one of the five million augusts, as a result of a large $7.5 million, a couple of Belmont's winners all over a few weeks before it.
The winning couple has been playing for twenty years and reporting that the winner gave them the opportunity to travel to peace and buy a new house.
Military of Harveys has been granted the main calls in Western Australia to 59 in this year, with a total of $85 million.
Mine-development wants to accelerate the growth of the electronic market
In this week, the Mini-Economic Development has introduced a comprehensive development plan for the environmental clean transport in Russia, reporting by the Department of the Ministry of Oлег Pluglers around the table, conducted by the Moscow Bus salon, 2014.
The plan is set up as a government mandate, one of the main objectives is a reduction in the gas emissions.
It is expected that the document will be adopted at the end of September to the beginning of October, said the Deputy, the proposed measures relating to electrical engines and hybrids - the development of gas vehicles in Russia are already available.
The plan (copie has the "Vedomities") is estimated for 2014-2017 gg.
The criteria for the evaluation of electric and hybrid transport should be developed and should decide how to stimulate the use and production of environmental clean vehicles.
The report of the Government in which tax and customs support measures will be prepared to December 2014; the iron credit scheme will be developed by April 2015; and the proposals for reduced the price of the machine, the stimulation of localization and the establishment of services infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015, a change in legislative and legal act should be made to facilitate the conditions for the construction of a loading infrastructure (in parks, auto-care stations and other).
In addition, federal officials are intended to formulate for regional authorities a proposal to encourage the use of environmental clean transport in the form of the provision of advantages in the movement and park, for example, and to February 2016, and proposals for enlargement of such transport.
Finally, the mini-economic development has already been listed in the list of indicators for evaluation of regional authorities, reflecting effective support for the production of clean transport, loading infrastructure.
The electricity line in Russia only has been formed - in 2013 in the whole country is sold about 100 electronic mobiles.
At the beginning of 2014, the import ship was switched to the electricity, so the sales are about 500 pieces, predicts the main executive director Mitsubishi Motors in Russia Andrey Panks.
However, five-class growth does not make any marked electricity: in Russia, in 2013, the European Business Association has been sold by 2.78 million light and light commercial cars.
Only Mitsubishi Motors is imported until Russia.
Renault's imports are prepared primarily towards corporate customers, says the Director of Strategic Planning and Partnerships of Renault in Russia.
Most of the other electric transport producers have been in relation to Russia's survival position.
The development of electronic motors is also in Russian manufacturers, GAZ, but it is slight.
For example, in January 2014, "AutoVAS" issued 30 electronic mobiles.
The question of the deficiency due to the prices of electricity is recognised by the Director of Aman's Initiative Sergey Sergey, without a passenger in this scene....
The development of the Russian electric motor market, instead of the roads of cars (electrombles sold in Russia, in the average two roads of anams with internal shuttle engines) maintains the indevelopment of the loading infrastructure (unit), involving the Autostat Sergey Citizens.
Because of the cost and low levels of self-employment in the nearby 3-4 year, the Russian market remains low, predicts the main editor, Mihael Polandese, the goals agreed with it.
Instead, automatic producers say that some electronic models are close to the cost of the ordinary.
In the Russian market, the good prospects of electricity mobiles are mainly the confidence in consumers that electricity is real; in particular, it will facilitate the emergence of all new carriage stations, emphasizes the President of the BMW Group in Russia of Volfhang Schlem.
Such infrastructure projects are, for example, implementing the Russian cooperation: a number of stations have been built in Moscow, and there will soon appear about 80.
Debates on the construction of a network of contracts are also conducted with other regions.
According to the director of the Russian Department of Sofia, the company believes in the electronic market and is ready to build contracts throughout the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electronic mobiles in the country and the absence of a single standard for the loading of different bridges.
Moreover, Russians as a network company do not have the right to sell electricity, there is a possibility to do this with regard to the loading of electricity.

The Nuclear Tax will take action until the end of 2014, the possibility of extending it, the extension of the luxury list.
The replacement of environmental taxes (the idea is discussed and related to all machines) also supports the market, but we do not feel as customs preferences, Panks.
In Russia's small transport tax, Panks says, for example, from Norwegia, where tax reduction has resulted in the raw growth of electricity sales, there is now 12 per cent of the market.
Russia requires and stimulate measures for automobilists, such as a free park in the centre of the city (cack already done in Moscow), aware of Panks, or the possibility of movement of electrical motors for selected pools, which is not yet in Russia.

We've just brought, they say.
Kolonel, all the battles to destroy it.
In the Dunbass bathroom, as well as many of his friends, Alexy made volunteers, because in the Ukrainian news, we have told the beliefs that were able to do on the south-east of the “separators”.
Alexy has already seen a different picture here.
His mother in Lugansk was killed, not someone but the Ukrainian military.
My friend called and told me that it's a minimist gun that maybe it's the Ukrainian armed forces, says one of the soldiers, Alex.
I wanted to go out of the battle.
We didn't get out of Iloiaska, said we were in the row.

From the collections of Zurichlow, we moved to Iloukuk immediately.

Twitter tried to be more interesting for new users
The Twitter Mikrobs has changed the user registration process so that new participants could quickly be involved in active platform interaction.
This measure should reduce the number of people's mixtures.
Now new Twitter users will be informed during registration of a large number of recommended battery servers to compose their read circle immediately.
The recommendations are composed of the interests specified in registration.
This is where Twitter automatically sets a subscription box for all automatically selected actors.
This is why the user must be able to cut the balls in ownership so that he does not read those who do not interest him.
If the users of the microblog server have previously seen only the advertising availability of the users recommended, Twitter now provides a picture of one of the popular blogs to help make a person's impression.
This is the largest change in Twitter registration in the past three years.
Twitter has recently worked actively on the modernization of the server.
This is mainly related to the continuing attempts of the service to achieve an unexpectedness.
In 2014, the microbolic service was slowed by the growth of the user base and the decline of the reader activity.
The company is now delayed to need more faithful resources to consumers who, once again, would remain long.
Only in this way is possible to ensure the stable flow of advertising resources.

The program consists of all the cars older than six years.
The amount of compensation is from 40 000 by a easy car to 350 000 ships.
In Russia, such a programme of identification of cars has already been operated.
The main difference of the current project, explained by the Minister, is now not only the machine-classification to obtain the following shuttle, but also if the car has been reached by the age of more than six years, the new shop with the shooting of the older in the dileader is transmitted to the "Interfax".
The previous federal certification programme, operating from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011, was lost more than 16 billion rubbers.
Thanks to her, the production level of light cars in 2010 was 2.1 million (e.g. 101.4 per cent in 2009).
Creator Coming Out Simulator will launch a game on modern journalism
Hey, Nicky Case, known as Coming Out Simulator game, decided to release a game on modern journalist.
He told her project in the Kill Screen interview.
Case began working on the game a few weeks ago, but the wide knowledge of this fact was just now.
The source of inspiration for games became events in Ferguson, where Protests are now starting after the police killed an unarmed pregnant adolescence.
In the focus of the project that has no appointment, the information lighting of history will affect their impacts.
The Game, a civil journalist, will have to be photographed in areas where the police and the population are shocked.
Heritage may have a different picture of the event that affects the events.
If he takes the scene that the police will appear heroes and the protesters, the police will begin better to treat him and leave where the ordinary person cannot go.
If he will see the events otherwise, his photos can convert peace protests into a wide burn.
The game shows need to be collected by the Twitter hero, where new signers will appear when the photos there are popular.
The game has no name.
The date of exit and platforms to which it appears are unknown.
Case, however, published a picture that shows how the event could change in depending on how the photo was made and processed.
In the interview, Kill Screen Caes explained that he was thinking about the concept of this game for a long time, but he was intended to dedicate it not to the U.S. Protests, but to the events in the Gaza sector.
After he began to collect a game material, he was aware that he was missing knowledge and ability to reveal the history of the region.
However, when he saw Mediterranean events in Ferguson, he decided to make a game on the motives that happened.
Nicky Case is an independent developer who launchs browser games.
The worst known project became Coming Out Simulator, above 2014.
The game, in which Case's biographic events, is dedicated to how biosexual adolescents are trying to tell them about their relationships with homosexual parents.

Tony Stuart's return to the truck has been a little more than in the middle of the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stuart slaughtered in the wall the second time his right front was cut into 172 rounds and put the end of his statement.
Stuart brought his car to the garage and then went out without talking to the reporters.
The leader of his team Chad Johnston said that 14 members of the team were destroyed, but now focused on the shooting at the next week in Richmond, Virginia.
"I would like to be more lucky attempt and a more lucky finish for him," said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond and I hope there's better.
Stuart was first cut into the wall before a resurrection evening after the assembly with Kyle Bush, which needed the recruitment of the right side of his car.
"I started this day with a very great hope to come to the Finish,," said Johnton, "I haven't been able to get it."
Shortly after the second accident, the Stuart's car was loaded to the evacuator, and the team was assembled and was ready to go.
Stuart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup locks after his machine killed and killed the other driver during the shipping shoes in the northern New York State.
He decided to return this week, and he had to win or to Atlanta, or to the next Richmonds in order to participate in the Persian.
He returned to work during the investigation of the tragic incident, resulting in the death of a 20-year-old Kevin Ward Much, who had been on the trace to declare that Stuart was inflicted during the hole.
The law enforcement authorities reported on Thursday that the case of accidents would continue at least two weeks.
The decision whether Stuart would be accused, it was not adopted.
The three-class champion was met with a sound appeal and appeal when it was represented before the shooting.
At the 12th position, Stuart went to the first 10th stage at the beginning of the hole, reaching the fourth position.
Then on 122 rounds after the Bush restaurant.

Initially, and Vitorgan are sigarettes with the Jvanzigk in Odes
The Countries and Maxim Vitorgan are now in Odess, and the television leader has not been able to report in its Instagram.
Indeed, one photo was very surprising and shocked by couple worshipers.
Photo made in Jvanz.
"In the morning in Mihail Mihalach of the Young Max explains what's the instagram:) #decess," signed the picture of the Kcenia Sangak.
However, in addition to smoking on the table there is nothing.
No coffee, baths, oil and other...
The worshippers decided that Ksush was also smoking and condemned it for it.
"And the cigarettes who?", "Curation kills!", "It's a cigarette breakfast," "It's like to be on the morning, and on the table only smoking)" "You're smoking too?", they sweared for your loved signer's blog.
Remember, recently, The Lawrence was the one who had prepared her for Max Vitorgan.
"Freely, when you come to the date, the husband has prepared a dinner to your arrival.
The picture shows that Maxim is preparing something with the helmet, and there is already a soil and a smoking smoker on the table.

Army controlled the new Government of Thailand
General Prat (right) designated as the Minister of Defence of the Hungarian Rights (left)
The military government and Prime Minister of Thailand, General Prat Chan-Ocha, declared the composition of the new Office of Ministers of the country, where more than three posts are employed by General or General.
Army representatives received key posts: defence, financial, foreign affairs and trade ministers.
In Monday, the Chat Chan-Ocha was officially approved by the Prime Minister as the King of Thailand officially approved the appointment of the heads of the temporary military government to that post.
The 60-year-old military who was insured by the country was the only candidate to the Prime Minister.
He was elected by the Prime Minister at the Parliament's meeting.
The previous army appointed Parliament's deputy.
According to the Praeta Cha-Ocha, the shift was the only way to maintain stability.
He had predicted the continued half-year demonstration in which the protesters requested the departure of the Prime Minister of the Chinaват Government.
Officially, the Chan-Ocha Plan will be an temporary primary, since the military plans to carry out general elections at the end of 2015.
However, there are fears that military attempts to strengthen their authority in the country.
Military arrived on May 22
on the basis of the full paralysis of the civil authorities.
The leaders of the main political parties were temporaryly arrested.
After the arrival of the military authorities, they were temporaryly arrested by the leading country policies, including the Prime Minister of Yinglake Chinavat.
Some journalists and public persons were also detained.
The current political crisis is in the roots of 2006 when the army pleaded from the former Prime Minister of Brother Yinglake Chinavat Tasin.
Both are used for the population of the rural population, especially in the northern regions of the country, which did not have a success in the elections.
However, many representatives of the Medium Class and the capital elite entered into an anti-governmental movement which almost paralyzed the country since November 2013.
Nobody said that the media's gonna be better in the hall, I didn't promise you, I'm looking for an officer from Palm's new Brazilian.
It should be formally recognised that this is true, but the thought and desires are still unrestricted.
Because they know, we say Belgium -- we're understood media, we say media -- we're going to say "media" -- the Belgium.
The restaurants liked to declare that the success of the institution depends on three factors: the location, the location and the location again.
There are such places that are not good, but even good, but some of them.
I remembered that there was a "Goodoc" coffee here, and then "Odessa Mom" and the restaurant Bogole and a drinker.
Now it's a drink again, but it's not a nostaligic and Belgian.
On the ground, only the top of the Iceberg was located: a bar and a couple of tables, the rest of the space is free of the sun.
It is fun here as the child room: red, frozen, and green walls, different windows, instead of television windows, where girls and women swimming.
Belgium firms in Petersburg haven't been in news for a long time, so there is a comparison with what.
Here, eight species of different birds (260-300 rubbers per 0.5 l) and an innumerable number of bottles (170-1550 rubbers).
The company positioning officer is gladly presenting the menu, saying that the " media are large seeds" and should be noted: it is a service, despite individual deficiencies, the most positive part of Palm.
We are waiting for content, but often unexpectedly.
But whoever, for example, is given to warn that a meat rule with the ballonic sleeves (280 rubbers) is, in fact, a carpacho covered to the same so slightly that the primary paper is shown to the material that is unlikely total.
Listen to something you can do, just if you smell together.
It's worse with the salts.
Classic League (260) would be the right thing to recognise the crime against the Belgian people: some heat iceberg that has ever been covered a long-term card discovered by the Kenya Fassel, obtained from the becon plus a smoke.
You don't want to meet anybody with that lie salt!
The creation of the Belgian Salat was partly otherwise, but the impression was not different.
If there was still a closed eye on the unexpected pillars of swimming powders or overwhelming shampoes, why are the media seeming like they have been able to disappear and disappear a few times for their life!
Because I already know, there's fully normal media here!
They're in the box for your choice (490-560 rules for 0.5 km).
Sows of midnight, a white wine, a farmer and a marble have not been openly shocked.
There are sweats, and the aroma isn't, if there was wine, and it remained a spectacle.
It is very good to believe in the media of fresh with the home mayones.
The curious vatter in here is not a shock, so that in depending on the order, you can decide, first or second shooting before you, but a nice mate.
It was stated that a local snake was prepared in a drunk soup and nothing was said about the smell.
The situation was diagnosticly contradictory, and the dismarin was depressed.
It was impressive that the blood of life was slightly smelled with dismarined skins, which was the father of the flesh as an unexpected aroma.
But there was a wonderful snake to the footstep -- no, just a slightly shock in the carramiled corner.
Vaphli in Palm is proposed not only a shock but also with skin, smoke or bacon and smell (220-280).
The skin was a sweet driving shoe, and the snakes were shocked.
But the manager's table was very informally interested in the editional impressions.
I mean, we should come again.
The cost of the dollar was higher than 37 rubbers on the news of the new sanctions prepared for Russia.
It's a new historical record.
The Dollar was calculated "tomorrow" to 10:29 msq by 26.9 cops and composed 37.02 rubbers, the euro rate was up to the 48.73 rule, shows the Moscow board data.
The wheat corsin growed at 28 cops to the previous closure level and was 42.28 rubbers.
Before the chronic events, the dollar reached the maximum of 19 February 2009, and then was 36.43 rubbers, and on 3 March 2014, he had already been 37.005 rubbers.
Tonight, on August 29, the White House reported that the President of the United States Barak Obama and the President of Germany Angela Merckel discussed the possibility of introducing additional sanctions against Russia.
The rubber weakness is long-term, and in the euro couple and in a couple of dollars.
The long-term prognosis predicted this note, says the older Alpary analysis Anna Bodrova.
All related to Ukrainian or otherwise will be reflected on courses.
As long as that will continue, investors will react.
Today, the listening to the invasion of the army was not confirmed by any other part, but the market was very emocional.
All conversations on his sustainability to such news were switched yesterday.
The week, according to the specialist, is closed around those levels - 36.90 and 37.05 rubbers per dollar.
The tax period has been finished, the prices of weak oil, policy, sanctions, the problem of the gas transit through Ukraine are all of this.
Inflations are also projected: at the current prices of skin costs are 5 to 10 per cent.
Eventually, the sezonal fruits and fruits are finished, and there will be some vacuum until the network is crossed to other suppliers.
Dollar came to the note at 37 rules, passed it and returned, there was no powerful exhibition, comments the Chief of the Market Analysis Office of Broker Constantine Busheev.
They will still consider whether the promised sanctions will be introduced in Saturday, as to the NATO.
Rubl, according to his words, was slightly slow after the tax season, and then the news went to Ukraine, and the CIA stated last week that until the end of the year was completely moved to the swimming course and rejected any monetary interventions.
If you look at a daily assembly, it was nothing different from the previous months, all were afraid of the 37 sections, and the analysis continues.
Well, there's nothing to do with the traffic.
The prevailing time for the currency market was remembered at the end of January, as well as the third March, when the ECB had downloaded the recursion of the currency.
In the UFS, the IC is a positive part of the rubber deficiency.
The main analysis of the UFS IC Alexandre Cozlol is mainly income from export operations, as well as the increase in the competitiveness of internal manufacturers through imports.
The travel of imports and services can be remitted to negative times.
The results of Russian currencies are significantly reduced by investing in Russian economy, enhancing inflation pressure growth and, as a result, resulting in reducing money imposition, which, on the other hand, turmotization of the development of the economy of the country.
When it is said about the market of actions, a number of rule estimates the decrease of the shares expressed in the rule.
For example, IMIB Index reduced 1,67 per cent during the trade, with 3.27 per cent of the RTS index.
The amount of significant difference in relatively lower indexes is explained by the weakness of the rubber during the day over 1,5 per cent.
The rubber deficiency is emotional and is explained by massive attempts to purchase the currency.
As the practice shows, emotions are slowly not, but the cutting of the rubber is partly or fully restored.
"We think soon we can see the percentage of the dollar and the Russian currency nearly 36 rubbers per dollar," says Alex Kozlo.
Genetic violation is often wrongly diagnosed
Britain reported that she's passing many years, thinking that she's going to die, after a wrong diagnosis.
Carin Rogers had a large part of her adolescent age, thinking that she had been alive only a few years after diagnosing another disease.
Indeed, she had Sharko-Mari-Tut (SMT) diseases, a group of inheritance violations that cause nervous damages outside the brain and the smuggler.
The CMT UK reported that the wrong diagnosis was a part of the problem among people with MST, because it was so little to know about the situation.
About 23,000 people in Britain are supposed to have SMTs that can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, uncertain path and feet.
The worst can feel a feeling of emotion or pain, and the condition is not healed and progresses, which means that symptoms are raised in time.
When Rogers was 13 years old, she thought that it was suffering from the assault of Fridreak (AF), a prognosis for which was very bad.
Rogers thought she'd be touched to a disabled box until she was 18 and died before she had 30.
The mother of two children now 51 said, "I knew I couldn't do what others could do.
I fall every day, and I've got more time.
I was never able to shoot the roles or skeetbord with other kids, and I had to get a lot to school because I went and run.
Rogers said, when she was 13 years old, after a few operations to free cylinders and shoot up, she looked at a medical card when her doctor was out of the room, and there was written that she had an AF.
"I felt guilty because I was smelling the noise where it should not be, and so I didn't say to anyone, but I went home, found information about this state in the library and wrote to the AF Association," she said.
When I received information in response, I was shocked and tried the worst panic that could be possible.
I thought I'd be in the disabled box in 18 and die before I get 25, and I'm going to lose all my ability in this past.
I passed through it alone, and I planned my own horns.
She said that at that time, when she completed 17, she realized that her ability to walk did not hurt as much as she thought, and asked her doctor about it.
He just washed up and got me and said, "My dear, I don't think you've got this disease because you'd already be in a disabled box."
I think you have something that represents a very small threat for life.
After several genetic surveys, the SMT was found.
"When he explained what the SMT was, I thought it had a happy ticket", she said.
The SMIT-building organization announced the monthly information on SMIT to try to focus on this disease.
The tax burden on the Washington Zone is increased by the recovery of the economy
The restoration of the economy means more customers, more sales and new workplaces.
This also means higher taxes.
The payment rate of State taxes and local companys in the country has been deadly increased in the last year when the recovery of the economy has been spent by the new research published last week, and the company in the Washington Zone is not exceptional.
Maryland and Virginia shared $27.6 billion in the current state and local financial level in 2013, with more than $26.6 billion in 2012.
The tax burden for state business and local level in the past year increased by 4.3 per cent, to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 per cent of the year ago, and it was the third part of the year of growth after each other in the year when the account was decreased, 2009 and 2010.
The tax increased rapidly, 4.3 per cent of local taxes, 3.9 per cent, based on the research carried out by a professional service company, Ernst & Young and the State Tax Centre, a tax policy group.
More than half of the tax income in the area, 56 per cent of the undertaking taxes, while 36 per cent of Maryland's tax revenues are in the company.
Virginia, with 28 per cent, produces less tax income, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.
Increased tax income increases have been returned to the level of non-motiveness of companies, researchers say that 3.7 per cent of the year after three years of increase was less than 1 per cent.
While the large part of these income is in major states, such as California, New York and Texas, it appears that the same is in the Washington Zone.
Maryland and Virginia shared $10 billion for the inmobility and local level in the past year, more than $9.6 billion in 2012 than 4.2 per cent, compared to the previous year.
However, the return values to non-motiveness have no similar effect on State tax growth and local levels in Maryland, where the tax insurance tax is exceeding one five company accounts.
Virginia and Colombia are paying about half of the State tax accounts and locally in the form of non-motive taxes.
"What happens in Maryland is that the large part of their in movement, especially the tax base around Colombia, belongs to or to the Government or an non-commercial organization that does not pay infringement taxes", said Duke Lindholm, Executive Director of the State Taxing Centre.
Maryland, therefore, had much more confidence, such as income taxes, to pay the same services that are in other states.
Recent tax growth from enterprises could not be fully explained by the recovery of the non-motive market.
Income of entrepreneurs also seem to be amended according to these data.
The company in the region declared the company's cost tax in the State level of $2.3 billion, more than $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland has collected $1 billion of corporate tax revenues, mostly in the region.
Although trends are directed in one direction, the tax burden of enterprises at the local level does not increase the same speed in all three locations.
The growth level in Colombia was at the same level as the average in the country, 4.3 per cent, while growth in Mary was significantly rapidly, 4.9 per cent.
Only in Virginia was observed by the rate of tax income below the average, equal to 4.1 per cent.
In Virginia, it was the lowest corporate tax from three laws, each of which is equal to 6 per cent of the corporate tax.
The company rate in Maryland is 8.25 per cent, while it is relatively high in the area of 9.975 per cent.
It seemed to be studied by the United States Toergo Hall in this year that Virginia had shown the taxes below for state and local entrepreneurs and, in general, a more favourable climate regarding business taxes than Maryland.
The circle was not evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantages, Virginia experiences competitive pressure from its neighbourhood from the south.
The Northern Caroline has recently signed the legislative act which decreased the corporate rate this year from 6,9 per cent to 6 per cent, as in Virginia, and the rate was up to 5 per cent in the next year.
If the State continues to achieve the tax goals in the next year, this law could prove the tax rate for entrepreneurs even to 3 per cent by 2017.
As a result, a small business in the Washington Zone seems to be better and, therefore, it pays more state taxes and locally, according to recent research.
Income for entrepreneurs paid in the form of the individual income tax by small business owners is a transitional structure which has been established by most small businesses in Colombia, Maryland and Virginia in the past year to $2.4 billion, with much higher growth speed than the cost of enterprises in general.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in enterprises in the whole country are likely to be maintained in this year when taxes from trade in state governments and local levels increased by 6.2 per cent of the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington Zone can be delayed, as the decrease of federal costs is marked on the market of work in the region.
The Russian Snapshot Brans
The home Championship of the Peace on the Suite brings two golden and seven bronze rewards to Russia.
The Russian indicator was only the main favorite of the collected Japanese.
Turnier in Chelabinsk was a midday, and the first day of the Russian team took a silver meal.
Her owner became Beslan Mudran, speaking in the category up to 60 km.

In the Final Union, the Russian Champion of the World 2011 and 2013 Japan Massasy Ebinum entrusted.
Han-Magomed, at the fourth financial stage of the lost co-technician, was winned by a comfortable tourist and was a owner of the bronze reward.
In the tourists of the categories of 52 km to the third stage, Natalia Kuztin has also reached a drinking rate of 52 km.
In half-five, she played a world champion of Milynda Kelmendy from Kosovo, who had spoken under the flag of the International Rail Federation and successfully protected the title.
In the controverse for the bronze of Questine, he wins in May-Ini from China, but after the end of the tourism, he acknowledged that the third place was not exactly what she was counting.
And again, the Russian path of gold became Kelmendi, who fled to Côte d'Europe's Championship.
On the third day of the tourist in Chelabinsk bronze in a Russian collection copy of slaughter, Mouss Mogusk was placed in a category of 73 km.
In the fourth finance, he was the former representative of Moldova Victor Scoortz, who now speaks for the OAE team.
However, then the Russian wins two battles and became a owner of the rewards.
Moguishkow spoke on a home champion with a tragic holnostopa that he plans to treat at the nearest time, so he takes a pause in the slaughter.
With regard to the ex-moledonian of Skworthh, he and he arrived to the bronze meal.
It is interested that the other co-conciliator of the OAE sportive citizenship Ivan Remarenco had finished the speech in the category to 100 km.
The fourth day, the CM-2014 also brought a bronze to the Russians, which entered Ivan Nifont from 81 km to 81.
In the serious shock of the small finish, he wins French Alan Schmitt.
On Friday, three reward complexs were played immediately, but the Russians were limited to a bronze in a man’s turin up to 90 km.
His owner, Kirill, became Questions, which was guaranteed by Russia's collective meal: his comfortable final co-teacher was Kirill Dennis.
However, it was not the one that the questionnaire couldn't go to his fathers because of the trauma.
The man's bronze was buried by the guests and on the sixth day of the assembly, the Renath Said, who spoke to the category of more than 100 km.
In the comfortable end, he gained a clean victory over the Brazilian David Mour.
This ended the individual part of the world’s primary.
On the last day of the tourist in Chelabinsk, on Sunday, the world championships were played in the teams of conspiration.
Both Russian assemblies and men and women were one of the main claims for rewards, but, as in individual conspirations, the representatives of the beautiful field had not been able to achieve.
And here, the Russian Dynamikists have buried a command arm.
In the decisive opposition, they entered the main opposition favorites of the Japanese team.
The Russian collection took 2-0 after the clean winning of Han-Magmodev and the left-to-left Denise Yarceva (weight up to 73 km).
However, in the larger pregnant categories with the Japanese counterparts, Murrat Havillor (81), Magomed Magomid (90) and Aslan Kambie (100).
The scenario also developed and a bronze shop in the women’s tourist where the Russian assembly was 2-3 in Japan.
The president of Russia, Vladimir Putin, was present at the Challabinsk board command, which after the end of the tourism, welcomed the man's assembly with silver.
"The second place is very clear, but I want to say that you could be a champion," said Putin, whose words brings "New News" RI.
Gaining Japanese, the snares of the shooting, there's nothing wearing here.
But I'm sure you can have them and win.
The Russian meeting at the home championship of the world was much better than a year ago at the conspiration of the same level in Rio de Janeiro.
Then, in the Russian team, there were only three medals, one gold and two bronzes.
Thus, the current tourists have led the Olimpiade Champions of Arsen Galsten and Mansur Isaiah.
We're all, of course, great maximalists.
Yeah, I want gold meals.
But let us remember that if a man in the Olympic cycle enters eight more stronger, he's a potential Olympic winner.
Moreover, in the sports way, as a shooting, "it has produced the results of the Minister of Sport RF Vitalius Mutko, whose words lead to the Championship Press.

The family Joan Rivers is hoped to be the best
Joan Riverz is inconscious of the hospital arrival in New York three days ago, but her daughter expressed the hope today that the 81-year-old comic actress would be changing from sickness.
"Thank you for your continuing love and support," Melissa Rivers said today.
We hope it's best.
Her mother arrived in the Hospital of Maunt Sinai, on Thursday, after a extreme call about the stop of her heart at the High East Side Hospital, New York City, reports sources.
The doctor intends to keep it under drugs and under strict monitoring until it is not satisfied with its status that remains “haar”.
The response was wide, including a number of supports in the Internet from Donald Tramp, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripp.
Everyone will be able to king
In the sale of a debted album by the Royal Blood group, the new hope of the British Year, which was made from the direct clubs in the stadium.
Dueth Royal Blood has a scene all year, but has already been actively named at the BBC musical prize, a strike tour at Arctic Monkeys and a visit to the New York Congress from Jimmy Pedge.
They have a single album over a few months before the reliance received 100 000 predictions, and the contract on his release is at the Mejor Lable Warner Music port.
In view of the current laughing situation in the musical market, the situation from a number of outdoors, since it is not the new Lane Del Rey or the interim vote by the representative of the "new R'n'B", and of the doctrine of britannians playing the topic of volume and intensity, which has been last few decades ago.
In general, the rates for the first album in relation to all the above-mentioned circumstances were particularly high and have already been completely corrected.
Douth did not get himself a name to which before it could be able to get something that was completely deceived by hair metallists, and the blood of the kings, as they seem to have in their lives, also understands.
This is, of course, most of the heroes of the past level Led Zeppelin: as the great quarter, Royal Blood was intending to strive to use the British Year's blood by bringing it to a new height.
Prognosis relate to the success of this company until, be sure, he's blessed, but something could already be said.
Decades of songs in thirty-minutes are not so much the demonstration of the phenomenonic gift, the safe and powerful declaration of purposes.
Some of the individual numbers, which are determined, cannot be rejected, say, the pilot sync "Out Of the Black" characterizes what is replaced not a melodic line, but a slaughtered party.
The musicians smile say that this song is easier than getting.
It must also set a powerful "Little Monster" and a closed platform of the "Better Strangers" composition with a shexpitry quote in the rubber.
However, it is true that each of these songs will sound good at the celebration of the heavy year, but they are swinging in more or less typically.
And it's not necessary to be bad, even instead.
The Royal Blood Power is that they do not claim to new Lenin and MacCartony labs (which quickly seen in the Motorhead premiers), but he has produced a number of thro-duats from the Indian clubs.
Their music, despite a number of differences, has been created for stadiums, in a place less than a few thousand people, evidently close.
The secret to participate in the heavy use of the bass replaced by the guitare in a relative format designed at the beginning of the White Stripes.
However, the case is not only in instruments but also in the approach to the channel.
The heroes of the retrovers with great work were chosen from the border of the post-modernist paradise, with a huge shock to recognize themselves not just by episodes, but by self-sufficient creative units.
Royal Blood now sounds so powerful and shocked that this opposition has successfully caused some of the secondary and solidarity of the music material.
Well, at the end of the end, who said that the year should be wise?
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed the information reported on Tuesday morning: Online Magazine and Video Producer, and hundreds of other substances, purchases the Twitch flowing services for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
This news was not surprised because nobody expected that Twitch would be sold, but because many expected that YouTube would be buyer.
Three months ago, Twitch's videoholder Google's sales for a good billion looked completely ready, and it was natural.
Twitch, founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, set up the goal to be the streaming service of the general nature, the YouTube version in real time.
Instead, he became rapidly a platform where the heakers translated their internal games; "YouTube for real time games," says Business Insider.
Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genitor who gives all the skilled games, such as the Tainity Theatre, are already popular at YouTube.
The case is that YouTube is often mentioned when Twitch describes, so the news about the YouTube's purchasing Twitch was met without a special interest, a classical example of a counterparted technological company that purchases potential competition.
This is the secret why the YouTube shop was lost, given that he was ready to pay less than Amazon.
All we have at this time is a statement by the executive director Twitch Emmett Shira: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us reach them quickly."
Another secret, honestly, is the unbelievable Twitch success.
I'll be able to make the sports better than look at it, so it's hard to understand how to look at the games instead of taking it into the janice hands.
One case is to look through a friend's head on the 3th morning when she passes through the Resident of the Evil, and a completely different look at how some bilateral person receives 20 shots in Call of Duty.
All the games you could look right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today have been divided into one person, so to look at their coffee, without controlling the edge of self-respectively, may be the principal pain that is accepted by Do It Right.
I agree that the speeds in which Roger Bannisters of our electronic century end all the games in the recursion periods are slow.
But if this isn't talking about the virtuosis of games or humor, it's not likely that his Twitch channel will be very interesting.
But what do you know the sceptics like me?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors in the month, and this is the fourth source of small internet transmission.
What's the fact that Amazon's going to do for this?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch's turning back to Amazon Instant video like YouTube could just shoot Twitch.
However, Twitch has the satisfaction of receiving any company: young men who have dreams of advertising.
Like the head of Twitch Shir, Amazon and Twitch, "dow believe in the future game", and this channel does not give signs of defects, even as a delicate type of sport.
In 2004, more than 330 people, including 186 children, died.
More 800 people were blessed.
We spent a few days in Beslane.
They have spoken to the survivors - almost all students who are dead with the parents of the city of Angels - Ramon Kaspottat, head of the Matrix Bissanian Committee, who took part in the special operation of the IPS staff, - reports the representative of the Office of Elizabeth Antonio, who worked on a special project.
After returning to Moscow, they met with Aslambeck Assahamano, who was the President of the North Caucasus 10 years ago and held negotiations with terrorists, as well as with the Officer of the V.
What I was particularly surprised at work on this topic is that Belarus seemed to haven't had been these ten years.
This subject is extremely sick for everyone who has some relationship with her, people agree to speak about what happened.
The impression of the trip is very hard.
But I can't forget Beslan, and I hope we have done with our task," said Antonio.
The special project is prepared for the Rambler & Co Holding Info study, which works in company since spring this year.
Previous special projects were dedicated to the First World War and 15-year-old Volmier Putin's residence in the authority.

Deputy proposed to accelerate the entry into force of the Personal Data Act
In the case of successful initiative, Russian data cannot be stored on the servers by slaughter from 1 January 2015
The Board introduced a draft law which provides the transfer of the date of entry into force already adopted by Russian personal data, from 1 September 2016 to 1 January 2015.
The initiative is located on the basis of legislative activities of the subparty.
His authors were chaired by the Championship of Wadim Day, Yaroslav Nilo (LDD), European Federations, Vladimir Parisin, and Alexander Southern Countries (CPR).
Such change, according to the initiative authors, will facilitate more operational and effectively the rights of RF citizens to maintain personal data and comply with the secret of the information and telemune networks.
The Law, which is entitled to the parliamentary, imposes to store personal data on the territory of the RF on the internet.
He also makes the compulsory records, systemization, collection, store, specification and extraction of personal data of RF citizens in the Russian territory databases, as well as information on the location of such databases.
Furthermore, the Law provides the right to supervise the Court ' s decision to restrict access to information processed with violations of the RF data legislation.
The Law also proposes the establishment of such "share lists" of offenders websites - an automated information system "Speakers of personal data violations".
The Law was adopted by the Hospital year.
The authors of the draft legislation introduced Andrey Lugov and Vadim Dayn from LDR and Alexandre Yuzako from the CPF.
Day and Yuzako are also one of the authors of the present Law Draft on the transfer of the date of entry into force already adopted.
Those who have no RF centre date must be paid for the loan.
The Communication of the first sentence of the Committee on Information Policy of Leonard Levin today to the Gospel stated that he would not see the problems to transfer the date of entry into force of the Personal Data Protection Act.
In his words, the companies who will not have their own personal data on the RF territory of 1 January 2015 will be able to enable them, for example, to "Rostélome", which often said that they are ready to provide their servers in the arnd and already provide their servers, the Mail Group, in the western companys that are already offering their servers.
" There are also several independent data of the centres prepared to cooperate in this area, " he added.
"If the company decides to comply with the law and continue working on the RF Territory, I don't see the problems, they will receive technological opportunities for logging", said Levin.
Compliance with the draft legislation
After the publication of the draft law, the Russian Electronic Communications Association expressed fear that Russians would not be able to use many global networks.
In particular, it is about online blue aircraft services and hotels.
The Asociation believes that "the legislative project remains subjects of personal data - the citizens of the Russian Federation of the Rights to provide their own data into an imperative determination that their record, systemization, etc. should be provided only in the databases set out on the territory of the Russian Federation".
The Declaration stressed that a more effective measure would be the establishment of a user information mechanism on where the record is implemented, the systemization of its personnel data.
In that case, you can choose the territory of which action will be made.
Similarly, the adoption of personal data in other countries has resulted in achieving global services and significant economic losses.

IMD RF: Russia takes responsible measures in the case of the EU ' s new sanctions
Russia remains the right to take accountable measures to protect its legal interests in the introduction of new anti-Russian sanctions, reports MIF.
In the report of the Russian external state, the European Council 's decisions 'affirmed the incapacity of EU Member States to overcome the intelligence of the insurance of their chief authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in the east of Ukraine, pursuant to " absolutely uncertain approval on the presence of Russian armed forces on the territory of this country," says the status site.
MID RF regrets that Europe, instead of interesting its Member States, is affected by countries interested in enhancing conflict with Russia.
The Members of Europe should call on the peaceful settlement of the conflict in the east of Ukraine, and also to ensure the fully valued "diagram between the opposing parties", emphasizes the state.
The website also notes that there are no objective assessments of the humanitarian situation in Donbass, where the total humanitarian disaster has been developed, and the number of victims among the peaceful population are also increased.

In that regard, the representatives of the EU cooperate closely with American officials.

New sanctions of Europe can be the energy and the financial sector.
The Australian Government also announced the expansion of sanctions against Russia in the field of defence, financial and oil industry.
Hytric ways to spontaneize university education
While the cost of university training for many students exceeds $1,000 per year, Matt Schrader, who will soon go to the second course, has planned a huge way to reduce expenditure.
He developed a system of way the brother's books were inquiring in the elderly, proposing a nominal compensation to make them sell.
"My mathematical analysis student, which is usually $180, I received a seminar for $10 and the Chick-fil-A peak," says Schreder, 19-year-old, who is learning at the Colege Covenant in Georgia.
The necessary literature at last seventh would be $430, he says.
He lost $120.
According to the Council of College, the average student costs more than $1200 per year for training and training, but students have a number of options to reduce these expenditure.
Students are increasingly selecting Internet magic and creative ideas like the Shreder's system.
The book record is increasingly popular, allowing students to use a book during the seminar, and it is often deteriorate than their purchase.
The Nybo Incorporate company, which belongs to more than 250 university bookshops, reports that the number of book switchs increased from 2011.
Research shows that some four books were taken in University Book Books during the past summer session, says Vice-President Nibo, Trevor Meyer.
The less than half of all books are acquired in university bookshops, according to professional association of the National university shops Association.
That's a introduction course for the best way to make a benefit.
Acquisition in the Internet Magazine
Sometimes, if you go to Internet, the prices for a new book may be a third of what you see in the university book shop.
The nineth Matematic Analysis Publikation Ron Larson, Bruce Edvards and Robert Hosteller are about $290 for the pre-scale, but a new exemplare can be acquired for $239,99 on Chegg.com website, which is specialized for the sales of trainingers.
Purchase of Detention
If you are not against foreign places or damages held by training is a good option.
"Mathematic analysis" is sold for $93.49 in a deserved view to Chegg.com.
Matt Casedia, 25 years old, says that the fourth course from Briggham Yang University has paid in Amazon.com 42 century for the deserved trainer "Strategic decisions in the Mediterranean: understanding the business part of the public business".
The book was sold for $48 new.
Promotors, for example, Ingrid Bracey, Director of the Colege without Stan at the University of Massachusetts in Emherst, invites students to clarify their professionals whether they cannot use previous publications.
At times, the updates are inadequate for employment.
In such cases, old publications can often be found for a very small amount of value of the last publication.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon websites, Half.com, belonging to "eBay Inc", is a popular alternative for buying detented books.
Procate
In order to take up training, you should be thinking of if you're going well with them, not forgotten to return them and you don't want to leave them after the course is completed.
You can scene more than 80% of the value of the new book.
For example, one student could take the "Matematic Analysis" for about $20.
Explain the rules of the shop where you are taking the books, including any trap that can be issued for labels, emphasis and damages.
If you take a book on the smell, remember: If you don’t return to the book, the slaughter may even exceed the value of the new angle.
Electronic Books
Electronic books instead of traditional training are another option.
Sometimes such books are switching, obtaining electronic license for a certain period in distributors, such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The Matematical Analysis Profile is about $61 at Chegg.com site for six months.
Bracy says that students studying literature often can find the most advantageous prices, since many classic scientists can now be scanned free, while the literature of natural and engineering science may be very costly.
Nevertheless, consider it.
Joe Holt, a 29-year-old age who will start a school at the Pepperdin Legislative School, recommends that use the ISBN number to clarify the value of the book, as it ensures that you are looking for the text you need.
Before you do a code on the Internet, you're going to check if the book really is on the basement.
It was not easy to give him this lesson.
The provision of the book he received was replied for four weeks and, at the end, he paid the full price in the university bookshop.
Putin declared the full inefficacy of the Foreign Development Fund
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, presented a meeting on priority investment projects and the territory in the further East, reports the Interfax budgetary investment fund for further Eastern Development, which has been established two years ago.
"15 billion rubbers have remained on the deposites," emphasized the President.
During the meeting, the Head of the State requested to accelerate the approval of the list of the Territory Foreign Development Territories.
He recalled that the draft legislation necessary for the establishment of the Tors should be introduced to the Gospel of this hour.
The Federal Meeting, noted by the President, did not adopt the list of the Territories of Progressive Development in the Forest, and their criteria.
Vladimir Putin has also established the key objectives for the development of the further Eastern.
Among them, enhancing the access to the region, infrastructure restrictions are both on the internal market and for the development of export.
Furthermore, it must be necessary for additional investment in the region and to form the territory of restraint development that should be competitive towards the key business centres of the ATR, emphasized the President.
Remember, the Territory of Training Development could replace the OECD.
Why the galaxies couldn't save cash collections
Sylvester Stallon has returned less than $30 million from its $90 million budget in the United States, while "The Sins: Women to kill" only returned $12 million from its $70 million.
Cameron Diaz had only $14.6 million in the first week, while children's films, such as "Kak to appoint the dragon 2" also discovered.
The article of the Telegraph Robbie Collin shows that when it comes to children's films, it may be the badest case as films.
Collin named 2014 the year the worst year for the whole history of children's films, and called "How to make a dragon 2" and "functioning" funds continued.
However, when there are films aimed at a number of more older ages, it seems that the problem is not necessary to be the most films.
In July Entertainment Weekly compared the average retina of CinemaScore and Metacritic each film that was above the year in the number of at least 2000 cops between May and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results that take into account the views of both cinema and cinema critics make it possible to suggest that the films in this year are like a calibra with the last year's chemistry.
Some comments suggest that the case may be in a changed attractions and the growing popularity of the internet flows such as Netflix.
Resident John Faarro, who works at this moment soon on the exit of the Dynasian film "The Book of Jungley" said the website Hollywood Reporter, "I think it's time to change."
We must recognise that and not try to smile for what happened before.
Unlike the current fall of the cash collections in Hollywood, Netflix was reached by the river reproduction services of $1.2 billion, almost two has exceeded the last year of $837 million.
Last year, the director Steven Spilberg discovered the study because they're too trusted in the Francis of Chemistry and promised the slaughter of Hollywood.
In the light of the current decade, some comments say that there was a part of the truth in his mourning predictions.
As a result of the outcome of a number of potential cassettes in 2015, including “Publics: Arri Altron”, “Minion” and “Surse Park”, other film industry are more optimistic.
Simon Kinberg's producer recently called a cycling of casinal collections, said Hollywood Reporter, "Slide flight will be the most casual year in the history, and no one will worry about it."
Product sanctions are not scared of the owners of the Caucasian and Medium-Asian food, but for the restaurants of the European and Japanese Russian cook.
And in general, there is no preferable for the prohibited imports, not from Russia, but from Latin America, Israel and China.
"There is much more than the bad mosaics," the Head of the Italian restaurant Barlotti Mariano Valerio is cut off with regard to the quality of crystal, which offers him to put it in replacement to Italians.
The Mozarrella and the snare of the burrat finished in the first restaurant, a small time of guarding.
The parmegazine's got to stop for a couple of months.
What do you do?
Go to Russian?
In 2005, I was at the Doromily Market.
Mariano Valerio does so clearly: the shocking memories do not leave him until now.
There was a meat on the tsunami over 30 centimeters from the ground!
There's a kiss!
Crowns!
Then I said, for our restaurant, we're never going to buy anything at Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe there's all changed.
But on the day, I was brought to the test of fish from the Dark East.
That's how she's been crazy!
I said I don't even want to talk to someone who brought it to us.
Valerio is surprised that many common things for Italy are for the Russian manufacturer in dicokine.
A few years ago, I was forced to buy Russian guaidin.
In Italy, milk is in the cold camera for 10 days at temperature 1-2 °C.
It should be depending on being mild to disreduce the mouse.
I've done this with the local guadedy.
Then they asked me, "Where did you take such a sweet meat?"
I said, that's your, Russian!
Why don't anyone do this?
In five minutes of walk from Barlotti to the French restaurant, "Brasserie Most" on the kitchen is a shoot list that indicates the lack of products: French strippers, sea food.
The head of the restaurant, "Brasserie Most" and "Streeka" bar, is not so pessimist as Valero: the French slaughters have already replaced from Tunisia, and instead of the French restaurants, they will buy Swiss.
On the other hand, and Reise becomes more emocional when it comes to the Russian suppliers: " The Great Capstal is 200 rules!
I ask, "Why do you think it's so much?"
I answered, "No, we also have to pay."
But this capstal shouldn't stand at 80 rules!
We're buying a weight in the south, but they're 15-20 years old, imagine how much their panciller's weight?
The price is that it's a super-delete.
It seems that Russian suppliers are one of the main sources of drought for foreign shops.
Standard history: "The three months ago, the quality was slightly slow."
Main claims: Russian suppliers may not be stable and quality.
Many restaurants of the European kitchen do not know that they will be with them when the smells are completed

Synchronising menu
The President, Vladimir Putin, signed the statement of the application of individual economic measures to ensure Russia ' s security, which are the main product sanctions.
The country is prohibited to import gums, sweats, meats and subproducts from home birds, meat, fish, milk, milk, yellows, creatures, grains, fruits, fruits, sweats, cows, and sugar shoes.
The restaurants began Chachard with suppliers: the prices of the product have been grown, the same must be urged from other countries.
This is the stronger than it is said on cherished restaurants with the monocokine of France, Italy, Spain, where products were put directly from the "matterin" countries.
The demand was to be overlooked before.
For example, when Russian acknowledgement was prohibited the import of Australian guayadine at the beginning of 2014, and the previous year is American and Canadian meat.
Instead, the suppliers were arranged for guayadines from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the sanctions of summer-2014 were more serious.
Indeed, 20 August, Prime Minister, Dmitri Medvedev, adopted amendments to the President's instruction, which would be made out of the prohibition of the children of the Atlantic Boat and Forel, unregulated milk, seed cardfel, sagar curuse, horns and legs for visit.
The Italian Valerio hopes that sanctions can still be defeated.
However, there is a part of the restaurants in the conditions of incertitude.
According to the West-Ocean company, one of the largest Manufacturer HoReCa was 70 per cent of imports in the primary segment.
" The friends of restaurants must change the menu in making local farmers and other countries, " said Sergey Miron, restaurant, the owner of the Restconsult Agency.
If the chief's strong, it's not gonna be a problem for him.
We've only got a few of such things, and the development of a new menu can take two-third months.
Triggle from the Brasserie Must restaurant is ready to do this: 10-15% bags and half of the menu are to be processed.
In the restaurants with a sweet kitchen, for example, the skin from the shoes of the befstrogans, says Sergey Miron.
"The sons of Europe can be replaced by Russian, Whiterusian cereals, Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile, and the representative of the Eastern Zealand company Oxan Gilbчuk.
Little and milk products from Europe are similar in Russia and Belarus.
The curriculum from the United States may be replaced by Russia and Belarus, shoes and seeds from Norwegia - roses, seeds, forel of Belarus and Chile.
The lack of fruits and fruits of European production may be compensated by producing manufacturers, proposals from Serbia, Moldova and China.
Mironwa believes that the budgetary restaurants will be rebuilding more simple than the primary segment: unless there were gurmans that have been able to distinguish the Italian shower from Russians.
Although the Ginza Project is difficult, he believes.
Ginza Project has a number of tens of restaurants under different burdens and with its menus.
"There's going for a few years," says Miron.
In Ginza, comments were rejected, referring to the absence of owners in the country.
The owners of the Café and Medium-Asia coffee highlight that products from the former Soviet Republic of Europe are more Aromatic
But there are many restaurants who are not almost covered by sanctions.
They relate to the kitchen of SNG countries: buses, zombies, Armenian and Azerbaijan.
"In the Bus kitchen there are no precious products," says Hatuna Colbay, the owner of the Bus restaurant Saperavi and the coffee "Way Mee!".
All the skins for us are done in Russia, based on many smoke fleet, we're not using exotic green."
In Colombia's works, no observance has been selected from the menu.
Timor Lanka, a restaurant owner of Chichona N1 with the Zabec cuisine, is not angry: it's just need to change in the New Zealand.
If Russia runs imports from Usbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we're even winning in price, we're going to be decreasing than import from Europe, he says.
From the CNG, you can receive extractions, jewelry, powders, shootings, fruits.
In this way, what they bring from Middle Asia is much better than "plastic" from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
About the Zabec powders, everyone knows they're beautiful, sweet.
Nobody say about the Spanish.
After the sanctions of the representative of the Usbekistan, Olymboy Artics stated that it plans to increase the export of vegetable products in Russia by two to 2016.
It was intended to replace European imports in Russia almost immediately after the sanctions was introduced by Belarus and Kazakhstan.
Fastfound restaurants who responded to the Deneg's request, also reacted very calmly to sanctions.
McDonald's Press stated that localization exceeds 85 per cent and worked with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatiana of Goddan, the Director of the Working Department with Subway Russia's suppliers, some 80 per cent of the net products are buying in Russia, although it may have been timely complicated with providing fruit and growth of milk products produced from imports.
There was no more than 4 per cent in the Terrek.
They didn't get sanctions and the skin Wacker.
KFC, Burger King and "Crown Cartosh" were not answered, but other market participants say that the Burger King's location is less than McDonald's.
In the absence of the Norwegian fish, restaurants are ready to purchase chilian better than Russian further Eastern
To your storm
Together, the restaurants are regretting that price increases even in local products due to the increase in demand.
"The product for Graley's prices has grown average to 10 to 15 percent, for the Italian restaurant "Cerry Mio" two times," says the restaurant Romans.
Even in the Buscan restaurants, the smoothity is up to 5 to 10 per cent, recognizes Colombia.
"Oceans" does not refuse: "Napromer, the Belarus Milk Product from the beginning of August traveled to 10 to 15%."
"The Brazilian suppliers have led prices almost two times to the sweet, "Sergey Rack, Vice Director of the Stardogs.
Railways traveled to 35 per cent.
Let's wait for China's price, maybe they shock the brasilian heads.
In the nearest time, Stardogs will be planning to increase 8% prices.
Now and so unfortunately to take the prices, says Rack.
In statistics, the growth in the second quarter of 2014 is of 1,8 per cent.
This is the smallest indicator after 2010.
Remarkable prices will continue to grow, but it is unreasonable, as soon as the majority of the restaurants have been stolen for the next two months in hope of surviving the transfer of the purchase prices.
But what's going after two months, no one knows.
There are ten chairs decorated with green and trees in front of the marine of Moscow.
In the center of the scene, musicians play waves.
This is the festival of regional products with a joyful name "The time is."
"We've been planning to celebrate local foods, and here as a sanction, we've been struggling, organizing the festival," says one of the organizers.
As a scene with the Greek Poor-Anastas, he prepared salt from macaron and home confects, there was a master-class for the preparation of boards with charmed balls on day.
All of the Russian products believe organizers.
The exhibition of the Russian nationality is in the shatars.
Med from Baskiria, Oland, from Salehard, fruits of the Sub-Subjosa name Lenin, shoes from a frozen Italian Jay Crouss.
"The restaurants can be able to replace peacefully the other fish of roses with the Dark East, " said the owner of the fishery "Is people" Philip Galkin.
We have a nerve, a box, a kitchen, a sweet, a sweet, a king's cattle.
Yeah, they're not so grain as the Norwegian stone, because it's a dick fish.
The Norwegian rock is the same aquaculture.
You're taking him in the hand - he's not even going to shoot.
And we're on the east, you're not in your hands.
Only non-specific claims are agreed to replace the Italian guiding
In the shooting of his shooting, there are shoes with the "Maragan," the shoe, the mould, the mushroom, the mediums with the Crema, the shoes of the Dark East.
Halkin is sure that long time is time to go to fish from the Dark East.
According to statistics, fishing in Russia in 2013 to more than 4 million tonnes of fish in Japan, Korea and even in the United States.
Fish imports in 2013 to about 8000,000 tons.
His people are working since 2012, sell the fish through the Internet magic, until sanctions were in place, there are still half the restaurants, for example, "Boost things".
Now, 15 restaurants have been requested to Galkina.
The same sweet can be made from our fish, he's sweet.
We've been shocked, tried different receptors.
Now we're sell through the web magic for a million rules per month.
Our fish is a few times deceived, and the delivery is the maximum of 15 kilograms.
In confirming the Chair of Galkina, I'm preparing the Philadelphia port with the box.
Unlike the roles of the seed, these should be more joyful, but knowing that this fish is our fancy.
On the site, your "Is People" is even the roles of the balls and the sea eyes.
In the sushi-bars, the Norwegian balls are really liked to replace the Chile.
Halkin explains this that the success to plan new recessions with further Eastern fish.
"Russian suppliers haven't proposed us before," says Killfish Bar Dmitriy Eussev's owner.
The same situation is also with other products: Russian producers could take the free weight, but it does not happen.
According to the founder and owner of the Lavka Lavka Boris of Akimos project, it is possible to speak quickly about the substitution of imports from Europe and American imports from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large transnational corporations with powerful logistics and large numbers.
They can quickly notice the banned imports from our farmers.
This is the prohibition of winning the largest producers of other countries,” says Akimo.
However, in the last month, the restaurant has received more alarm than product sanctions.
As a result of the low-speaking inspections, three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow and two regional companies in Stabulopol and Ecatherinburgh were temporaryly suspended.
"We study the meaning of the claims for the identification of action needed for the rapid opening of restaurants for visitors," said "Dengam" in McDonald's press service.
Indeed, no one understands what will continue.
If everything is limited to product sanctions, it is one option that can survive, is said at the conditions of an anonymity of the company employed by the restaurant.
If McDonald's is starting to close around the country, the scenario will be completely different.
"Europrotocol" instead of the HYBD help.
Casco payments can be obtained without the aid of GID -- so the CB intends to stimulate the EuroProtocol in Russia.
The Russian bank has developed a project of indications that, from 1 September this year in order to obtain the cowboy payment, could be able to be used without the HIDAD assistance.
It's true, it's only the cases when the accident was formed on the EuroProtocol without the routine police.
It is, if only two cars were involved in the TTT, no physically affected persons who have not exceededed the deadline, and both drivers agreed to the issue of the accident.
From 2 August, the Europrotocol is 50 thousand rubs and from 1 October in Moscow, San Petersburg and the Moscow and Leningrad area will be increased to 400 000 rubs.
The fact is that, often even in less damage, the situation when the EuroProtocol, the driving in the accident, is incurred by the DSD.
For the police, the cocktail was not able to repay without HIV.
The parameters set out in the draft indication are aimed at eliminating the obstacle to the introduction of the EuroProtocol in Russia.
According to them, the maximum payment of the SDT without GID staff should not be lower than the "europrotocol" limit.
However, it could not be above the limit defined in the Coco insurance treaty.
The idea, of course, is useful and theoretically able to download both DPS and roads.
But it is probably not going to come from her insurance, nor any insurance insurance.
Recently, it is a serious threat to the growth of fraud that could lead to the introduction of new rules on cash.
With regard to drivers, it is difficult to imagine what work should be done to survive the ironical Russian consertism.
The driver in most cases will be time to wait for the inspector to make a small accident because it is more reliable.
And it's not known that it'll be easier to win driving or convince drivers in the reliability of the EuroProtocol.
Conservation certificates make them unfortunate
Minfin wants to prohibit the reserve certificates for the prosecutor, so that the banks will allow them to make an analysis of their free contribution.
Minfin shall prepare a draft legislation prohibiting the conservative certificates of the applicant.
This instrument recently collects popularity as the rates above than the bank contributions.
The case is that the reserve certificates of the claimant are not insurance system, and the bank is deficit because they do not need to be calculated in the fund of the Investment Insurance Agency (ASS).
The situation is that this step is planned to be taken because of small and medium-sized banks that distribute such certificates and suffer from Sberbank and Moscow Bank, which controlled 98 per cent of the profile market, according to ACS assessments.
The amount of Moscow Bank, according to the Agency, is around 3,5 per cent.
The problem, explained in the ASV, is that customers of a small bank who purchase such a certificate are trying to obtain money to the ASV.
Some grants, with no sufficient financial graphicity and purchase conservative certificates to the applicant, may suggest that their attachments are threatened.
The lack of insurance payments for these certificates may result in inconsciousness and social tension.
In practice, the Agency had been cases when the claiming certificates tried to repay the insurance reimbursement through the court,” stated in the ASV.
It's, of course, a problem.
The purchaser will still have no one, since they have the right to repay from the State.
If this would be the case that the instrument is not threatened in the ASV, it would also prohibit a metallic account on which the citizens are referred to in grams of one of four metals, gold, gold, silver, and palm.
As these accounts are not also insurance system, but there is no attempt to exist.
It is likely that the prosecutor certificates are a very valuable boost that can actually play in the role of the questionnaire.
There is no control of their movement: any client of the bank may buy a certificate, deliver any citizenship, and a number of guests may change.
In the law draft, it is not possible that the conservation certificate must be the precisely value of a depositive burden that should be stored in the deposite.
In order to submit the pile to banks, such certificates shall be allowed to issue without the right to duration.
This is the analysis of the free contribution that the bankers have been dreaming for a long time.

Germany sends 30 anti-tank complexs to Iraq
Germany will put a weapons in Iraq for the anti-terrorism group of the Islamic State, reports 31 August, with a reference to the decision taken by the Governments of the FIG, headed by the Officer of Angel Merckel.

The views of the GFF citizens on the expulsion to Iraqi weapons were separated.
Ones believe that it is only possible to stop fighters from the Islamic State, others are afraid that this weapon may eventually be shocked in the hands of terrorists.
The Ukrainian paternal chatter in the Asian Sea

It is clear that the incident occurred today around 16:20 ms.
Young people took a helicopter from the Heavy Mountains

Two Unions meetings
The negotiations at the top level in Minsk did not resolve the problems for which they had been addressed but have been generated a new format: the first persons of the European Union had met the first persons of the future of the European Union.
Please be concerned (the situation around Ukraine does not suffer), EU leaders and the Tambour Union have first discussed a number of “good problems”.
Whether this structure can work effectively, uncomprehensible; it is quite clear that one who has removed rings from this summit.
The questions on this account took place on 26 August, when the Belarus and the other Europeans and the Europeans were seen in the televisions of the new President Lukashenko.
The Belarus's leader showed an example of an accurate teaching, which was a man ' s conduct, which just smile a jackpot, and plans the appropriate age in the top society.
How Maydan Lukashennko helps
In Minsk, immediately, three major European Commissioners (EU Ministers) who met Lukashenko and allowed him to speak on a final briefing on their behalf - not just the legitimation of the President's 20-year-old stage.
This is a claim to recognise Minsk the full subject of European policies and the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
The Old Analytics of the Belarus Institute for Strategic Research Dennis Melissans is sure: Brussels is not able to talk to Minnesota as previously.
"The fact that Catherine Ashton met the Tet-a-t-Tet with Lukashenko, gives the reason to believe that the relationship with the EU will continue to be disappointed," he said, "Ogonk.
The iceberg has a hidden part: the preparation for the slope of the Belarus authorities has started for a long time before the Mayan of November 2013 in Keve.
The results have been achieved and the EU are successful negotiations on the facilitation of the visa regime and the readministration, the modernization dialogue, and the Countries of the Honour, and the United States have been negotiations on international security.
The States have even taken some sanctions.
With regard to Ukrainian events, they themselves and reacted to the guidelines of Belarus only highlighted the process.
Minsk, from one part, has been able to maintain a relationship with Ukrainian - quite warm enough to lose the mutual trade, and President Pettyenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.
Another Belarus leader who had not recognized the association of Crusa to Russia and called for the Prostitute of Donbass, with all the strictness, was not confused and with Moscow.
Minsk was not out of the Taliban Union, nor from the ADCD, and the Russian Aviation Aviation is located in Baranda.
Brussels and Washington noted the balanced position of Minsk on Ukrainian issue - and assessed it, the certain Belarus experts.
When the movement of Lukashennko to political diversification is successful, it will be shown how often Minsk is to take meetings in the EU+TS format.
In the press office of the High Representative of the EU on external policies and diplomatics, Catherine Ashton did not have been able to respond operationally to the questions that Brussels expected to be in a new format.
The secretary Ashton Maya Cosidianchich only stated that it was not a priority to address war issues and peace.
It was reported that the next meeting on the Ukrainian issue, with the participation of the first persons in the new format, could also become Kazakhstan.
The Champion of the Degy for Minsk was a statement by President Nörsulatan Nazarbaev, in which he acknowledged that it was requested by representatives of the European Union.
However, in the final briefing, Alexandre Lukashenko understood that all of the parties did not oppose Minsk to remain a central area for meetings as well as in Russia -- OBSE -- Ukraine, both at the heads of States and high representatives of the Euro-Home.
This means that the recent Dictator of Europe is the status of a European leader who helps to address the global problem.
The best friend of the European farmer
The delegation of the EU, including the Euro-Euronomists on Trade and Energy, emphasized the conclusion: the main sub-access of the Somit is not a tragic situation in Donbass and the economy.
Indeed, the schedule of future gas supply negotiations and the overcome of the TS countries on the EU Association Agreement is more than peaceful declarations without specific date and digits.
However, the Commissioner for Trade, Carl De Gucht, stated: "The representatives of the EU came to Minnesota to seek a decision of a political crisis that has economic consequences, not contrary."
It seems, however, that the economic crisis in Ukraine works in Belarus.
His consequences - and first-term mutual sanctions of Western and Russia - give Minsk, which is the long-term sanctional pressure for the manner.
According to the words of the Director of the Mixed Research Center, the Ex-Candidate at the President of Belarus, Yaroslava Romanchuk, European investors are actively interested in the possibilities of Belarus's agricultural production in the sector of sanctions.
This will be moved out of delivery schemes for Vladimir Putin on the shock of Minsk.
"The initiativers of these schemes," emphasized the Romanchuk "Ogoniko", "does not the Belarus businessmen, but the Russian companies."
They have long deployed goods supply schemes, including Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and these schemes have been destroyed today.
Russian business is necessary to restore them, even through the bicycle structure.
Secondly, the expert continues to relate to the fact that many Ukrainian companies do not allow the production of Belarus from the Ukrainian base, also with a Russian market orientation.
The Ukrainian manufacturers ordered for $4 billion of exports to Russia and the Belarus's trade schemes can now be extremely inhabited."
Romanty believes that the role of the EU's negotiations and the EU-TS is perfect for Lucas and with the view of economic relations with Europe.
He recalls that the loss of the EU Agrarian Sector from Moscow sanctions is estimated by 5 to 10 billion euros, and the European Union has currently proposed 125 million euros of compensation.
The President of Belarus may invite Brussels to work together in order to minimise the consequences of the euro farmers.
This may take up the authority of Lukashenko to the EU at an unreasonable height.
Hospitality without initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarus's authorities for the Summit initiative.
But paradox is that the official Minsk was denied by its active role in the TS+EU-born format, and the Belarus leader at the meeting with the Ukrainian colleague stressed that the new format initiative has become Kiev.
"It was your proposal to gather, without any request to discuss, not with the boarders, after the signing of the Treaty on Association with the EU, in the situation that was at that time in Ukraine," he called on to Peter Pettynco before the cameras.
In addition, observers were promoting this as a attempt to relax Moscow, and it was initially against the Minnesota media, which increases its political weight.
In the Belarus diplomatic state, the Belarus emphasizes that the EU and TS in their country is not towards the important goals and that the final purpose of this format is the establishment of a single economic space from Lisbon to the Swedish East.
"This is absolutely in the spirit of the concepts that, in other areas, in particular in the area of security, move and move the leadership of our Strategic Union, the Russian Federation," said the "Ogonko" in Belize, the State where the last few days are slowly collected.
In Moscow, there may be a payable income zones
The Moscow Government considers the option to introduce zones with paying access as a means of combating central roads to other large cities of the world, with a reference to the Moscow's seal on Maxim Lixtov transport.
One of the options that successfully recommended themselves is a pay entrance.
This is an expert opinion, we're required to study it, to look at all the past and plus.
To tell them that there is a decision to do so until early,” said Lixuth.
Zammar stressed the importance of Asian cities that were similar to Moscow, for the authorities of the capital authorities.
One of the decisions taken from these countries is already the construction of a central corner car, added to Lixut.
The recent construction of the Central Current Card is an example that it is not necessary to pass all the traffic through Moscow.
If there was a sufficient infrastructure for the train, it would not be necessary to have a transit traffic in Moscow,” said the Emer.
The Maxim Lixut also stated that the introduction of payment parks had significantly downloaded urban streets.
In his words, the national authorities do not plan to stop the achievement.
Remember, on 26 August, Mr. Sergey Sweden, the capital of Russia, participated in the trademarking of the first launching complex of the Moscow Headquarters (CCAD).
Skick of Sin
Film Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez "The Women's Slaughter" did not completely the revolution that could be expected.
The first "Good of sins" (2005), covered by the minimum but symbolic participation of the Quentin Tarantino, made revolution in relationships between films, mixes and literature nucleus.
He also skied his revolution: in the sense that he destroys the fundamental idea of the modern "Tesis antitesis synthesis" (if you understand under the test of the universe nuclear and under the antithesis, the scope of the comics).
It should now be read, "thesis is antithesis haos".
"Good of sins" is also dramatic and philosophical: both times he has a ridiculous sense of words.
Yeah, a part of the heroes is known on the first "Good", although this is, the rule of Marv (Micky Ruk) is remembered, the end of the electrical store, and there is nothing, just and tried to embrace - in the role of this popular wife, from the leg air and other pieces of drought.
But the elders literally distribute new pieces that have been cut into a other film, about the meaning and smile of which the slaughter would not be worried.
Yes, his story, which was uncomfortable by the authors on the most interesting place, was in the super-speaking player of Johnny (Jasef Gordon Lewit).
It's in a volunteer-friendly Eve Lord (Eva Green) and for some of her sweet Duyte (Jush Broline).
But this trip, in which Duyte says, does not differ from Johnny - more than the persons, such as other parts of the body, is not the poor or even half of them.
It's not a man, we know that this is the archipels of noir: a yearly shooting that is too sure of the player who enjoys the "medium wood" sex detective, corrupted senator.
Well, when the archipeller gets out with the architect and the architect, it's not the movie, but read that an abstract life record.
And bringing an abstract of questions about the logic of the smuggling is just funny.
Furthermore, even this suspicious world has something constant.
The battles from the first "Good" continue to hold a round defense from their neighborhood body.
There's no call for detective Hartigaran, and Bruce Wilson's always welcome to see.
The main problem of the "Good of sins" 2 is different.
Frank Miller was good that as a talental manufacturer had connected comics and zeros, and as the writer turned up the presentation of how to move mixes to the screen.
Comics and Nuer are two aggressively anti-reality.
The phenomenon of the comics was born at the end of the 1920s, and then, when the Romans of Dashila Hammeth (1929), the Maltian Scool (1930) and the Skill Key (1931) created a noir canon called hard-boiled school.
Well or pulp fiction.
The comics gave a lot of decades of heroes: from the Popaia Sea, the grain of the skin, which gives him rich power, superman, Batman, and Deck Tracy's shoes to Calka, Thora, the Pauca Man and the other "mests".
But in any film on the motives of the mixes there was something harmful: the designed persons did not want to choose the screen meat and remained manufacturers in their neighborhoods of the "real" world.
In fact, they were totally slaughtered by the system.
Nevertheless, the most exciting jealous of the world literature.
After world wars, a traditional Roman, with concerns, characters, family scandaries and historical background, has lost any confidence.
What forums are the Tibo and Rugon-Macal, even the Bolcons and Rostovs after Verdan, Osvencim and Hiroshima?
This roman has been peacefully mutatised in milk operation, and the criminality, as defined, has increased to the level of philosophic prosecution.
Hammet at his sculpture learned that it's a sanitator on the front.
He was a communist.
As soon as, we were close to the computation and the columns of the garage, such as the writers of Horas McKick and Jim Tomson, director Jull Dassen, Joseph Louce, Edvard Dmitrick.
This is why the architecture which they brought, first, strike and quoted, and the second is softly social.
It's not a American variant of sociorealism.
The first "Good of sins" was observed just as contrary, but organizedly connected comics with norm.
First on the scene, the mix was waiting for nothing, not for its graphic nature, but not for the " real" film.
The world of sales, where the cardinal ordered the murder, and the senator covered a wonderful son of Sadiest, was fully worthy of the first Hammet.
The biographic details were like the heads of the sadist decorated with their nest, the priest of the Genial James Elroa, author of the Black Orchidea, and the best is the representative of the Neonauara.
"Good of Sins" isn't even a decline, but the capitalization of the radial style Miller-Rodrigues before the comics tradition.
It's likely that happened in many cases because of 3D technologies.
When you look at the second "Grey of sins" you feel in prison in a sleeve sharp, in which the snow snakes a snake.
Otherwise, it's not a snow, but a blood skin, but a large difference?
Well, sociality and nothing.
Because it can only be possible when somewhere there is, let us go and do both of the cold pain, but there is a normal world where we can return to a girl's trail or, we say, to the unlawful parents that her murderer is punished.
But if there is no place in the city of sin, except for sin, there is no sin, nor the standard.
It's sweet like any standard.
"The Lord of sins" is just unfortunate.

France's socialists must " shut up and bring France to order", says the key unioner of Frausua Olland
Mr. Val called for the deeply separated left forces to "to demonstrate the warm relationship" to the attacked president-socialist who had not found the stops for the majority of French.
The Chairman respects each one, pledges our loyalty, he grants our support.
"This is our debt - stay close to him," he said, calling applauses.
The Prime Minister believed that his Government would not put in question a 35-hour working week in France, despite the disadvantaged conflict proposals, to reduce the rules made by Emmanuel Mcron, the new Minister of Economy, before that week.
At Saturday, Mr. Olland urged his socialist partners to remain "one" with the Government.
However, Christian Thobian, the Minister of Justice, put a board in the route, came to the congregation of inconsistent members of Parliament from the Socialist Party, and discovered the Socialist Party for allowing the French "to lose faith in the future".
Marin Le Pé, a leader of the extremely right front, expressed a prerequisite of permanent internal conflicts among socialists, said that it does not represent that the new Government of Valle remains more than a few months.
Francois Olland is a black king, but the black and prince Manuel Val, who was obliged to gather a new Government when it was not longed and flight.
"And the new will not be continued on the hole or wine," said Ms. Le Penn.
She repeated the call of its party to a parliament, said that she was sure that the party could easily win and be ready to be managed.
The French legal party had survived from the martial elections, and the extreme legal national front was the first of the EU elections in May.
The resurrectional journal du Dumanche found that 76 per cent of French believed that the Socialist Party was a risk of several confronting fractions before the end of the President of Mr. Olland in 2017.
Packel Perryno, a politician from the University of Sians Po, warned that the French would lose patience quickly if the new socialist government could not correct the economy and re-coorable unemployment.
"He has little time, but the public's opinion needs to feel quickly what is changed," he warned.
On the other hand, the situation may be worse.

According to the investigation, the State was required by the court to recognise the unexpected treaty of a memorandum.
In view of the MIGISO directive, there were no substantial conditions for the allocation of cultural heritage.
The Swedish arbitration court rejected the appeal, then appealed to the 17th arbitrary Court of Permi, who was satisfied.
The same Court has then provided a cassational complaint to this decision, which remained unpleasant, after which the Supreme Arbitration Court has been sentenced to the Supreme Court, but the Court adopted the party to the directive.
In 2013, a new Arrangement treaty was concluded that the fund again began paying the Ardenian payment was reported by the head of the city of Eugene Royzman.
The payment was appointed for a month to 300 thousand rubs.
The previous Administration provided this building to the free-drive use of us, acknowledging our responsibilities to combat drugs as a sign of respect for the fund.
The current Administration decided to be different," he stated.

All candidates should first receive support for most members of the Exemption Committee, which would likely be the place of Peking Loyalists.
The decision is almost impossible for a democratic opposition to pass into the election Bulletin and made the democratic movement actives again promised to stop the Hong Kong's financial centre by the Occupy Central Protests.
Political reform is the main source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese leaders fear that the calls for democracy are distributed to other cities.

Briffing Lee is organized by the Government of Hong Kong and the Chinese Office on Contacts in Hong Kong.

Putin requires to start negotiations on the "statute" of Eastern Ukraine
According to the Russian news report on his comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin needed in the Sunday that the Ukrainian Government stopped combats with separators in the east of the country and immediately started negotiations on the "economic" of the region.
His secretary, Dmitri Pesko, later explained that Putin did not mean to advise that the Eastern Ukraine Territory would be part of the Russian separators, but that its status within Ukraine should be revised to provide the Russian region to protect their rights and interests.
However, it calls upon the Chief Government to start negotiations with prostitutes as equally with a clear strategy that he should start from the beginning of the bloodproliferation five months ago: help separaters to take the territory and urgency the Ukrainian Government to provide the new proclaimed territory of New Russia to draw close to Russia, not to West.
In the interview of the first public television channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to return by the territories contained in the eastern Donetsk and the Lugan regions, which were entered in March and April after Moskwa Annexed the Ukrainian semi-orienters on 18 March.
Cleml and separators have recently called New Russia’s invaded territories, or New Russia, which refers to the pre-revolutional day of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that any person who believes that peace negotiations will occur in the nearest future when the Ukrainian policies begin to parliamentary elections on October 26 and when the Governments attack peace-related populations in the remaining separaters of the regions, the " Illusion Leader " reported by ITAR-TASS.
"We have to start immediately a comprehensive negotiations and not only on technical matters but also on the political device of society and the state of South-East Ukraine to enable those living there," he said.
He said that the words of the Pope of State were in the context of a broader autonomy, which was discussed over the months with the leaders in Kiev in trying to maintain fears in Russian speaking areas, that their cultural and language rights were dangerous.
Only the Ukrainian Government may provide the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions, said Peter.
This is not a matter of debate between Ukraine and Russia, said Pesko, "for this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
Involvement of the secretariat Kremell to amend the "now interpretation" words of Putin emphasized the decision of the Russian leadership to conduct himself in relation to the separatistic resurrection in the east of the open Cruma, where most of the 2 million Russian people are ethnic.
Moscow would have to make a larger battle to join even Donezku and the Eastern Ukraine, as most of 6.5 million non-Russian people, and surveys before the beginning of the conflict showed a wide support for remaining within Ukraine.
The autonomy, which the Russian diplomates had discussed on international forums, would provide regional governments in Ukraine to determine trade agreements and external policy, in fact, transmitting Cromil a real control over the Territory, which would combine Russia's main territory with Croma.
The Russian military fleet, as well as the commercial marine institutions and the historical marine smokers, is located in the blacknother semi-style assembly five months ago.
In the regions between the Russian region and the Crom, there are also shoes, manufactures and lithiums that produce necessary equipment for the Russian army.
The Ukrainian President Peter Pettynko proposed in its inaugural record on 7 June that the Ukrainian legislators, after new elections, would be amended to the Constitution that allows the separate regions to control their finances and language status.
However, his view of autonomy seems to be very different from the view of Kremell and the separators, in the arms and undermines of Moscow.
The last call by Putin to Kev to agree with the leaders of separaters, as with equivalents, followed the new attacks of the rebellion last week after the Russian forces and dancings entered the Eastern Ukraine from the front of the peace area across the Asian Sea.
The supported separators of Russia have taken control of the city of Newoazlovk in the invasion of which Ukrainian security staff said that they are afraid that it is the start of a strategic sea territory campaign to the Cruma itself.
This has resulted in the extensive civil and military efforts to strengthen Mariopol, a steady port of 500000 people, between the New Azobian and the Croatian Mediterranean.
On Saturday, the meeting of the leaders of the European Union in Brussels was called to call on measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Council's Republic, which was independent of 23 years.
"We're closer to the point of unfold," Pettyenko warned.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign dancers are now in the Ukrainian territory.
The EU Summit did not take certain measures; the leaders called for a project of more ridicule sanctions against Russia that will be adopted in any case of the Ukrainian crisis.
The Ukrainian soldiers had to go with their position in Iloyask after two columns of Russian blonde and 1000 military in the past week in the Donece region to support the experienced separators, the embassy Andricia Lissanko, the press secretariat of the National Security Council and the Defence Traffic of Ukraine reported reporters in the Saturday.
The first of 63 Ukrainian troops, which have been held in Iloyask as a result of the Russian imprisonment, were exchanged on Sunday, on 10 Russian airlines in the Ukrainian territory a week ago, reported Lesenko on Sunday.

The most universal and functional emotion of the human
The heartfelt expression of persons is universal for humanity, and everybody participating in the creation of the body and group of museums is not a case, and is an additional means of expression of force and threats, declared Australia and the United States.
They told them about their openings in the Evolution and Human Beaviour magazine, and they can read in a press-religion of the University of Santa Barbara.
The angry expression of persons is a twiced and cut down brown cut in the ring of the legs, cut into the same in all cultures, and even blind from the birth of children who have never seen it, notes the leader of Aaron Sell's research author.
In the context of a large research project dedicated to the angry, the scientists explained that this emotion had occurred in the effective conduct of disputes during the conflict.
The more physically harmful one may cause another, and more he has the possibility of dictating its conditions, and he brings it to the co-conciliator with a wrath.
Researchers have found confirms and other hypothesis: physically strong people are more slow and move to the guidelines, thinking that others are inadequate for them, and they also prefer strong ways for peaceful solutions.
Dismissing the angry, mostly, of the “emotions of trade”, scientists decided that the movement of each of the seven muscle groups who have a heartfelt expression should represent the angry individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the counterparty, as soon as possible to agree with its conditions to avoid conflict.
For the verification of this hypothesis, researchers were modeled on the computer where each of the seven elements of the angry person existed or missed, and showed them to the informants.
Although the slaughtered browns or the previously discovered in individuality did not make a wrong person, a more stronger physically participant of the research was recognized unilaterally.
Men's angry, as well as animals, is threatened: a pronouncement of their own power to agree and to submit.
The man smells the smells and smells the same purpose as the smell that smells, or a grandfather, who shows his legs.
The " wine " is launched by the committee ' s refusal to adopt the situation, and the person immediately takes the form that most effectively demonstrates the counterparty of the refused effect.
But the most brilliant -- that no one of the injury components is arbitrary, they all express the same," said anthropologist John Tubi.
