CSSD didn't know Voldemort or Pasture in Prague.
The new CSSD elections to the capital's master will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier to understand at the level of the municipal advisory with their elderly and new ODS colleagues.
The Actualne.cz newspaper "tested" the new members of the CSSD municipal council, to know whether they knew the argot that was born over the past few years to Mayor, when they were partners of the current coalition in Prague.
The vocabulary coded that the Prague's political cream was launched during the previous era of Master Pavel Well describes some of the personalities, situations and causes of the metropole.
It is surprised that it was found that the new elections do not understand well known terms.
Actually, they say it.
"Who is Valdemort."
"I don't really know."
"I'm a youth in the Prague policy reacted Lukas Kaucky, the election to culture at the test of the "parrain".
And with regard to the political veterinary, the elu Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example, the sense of "golf triumph".
"It's the only expression among those you propose I use."
Instead, I don't use the argot.
From the vocabulary, whose current daily.cz published the expressions in June of this year before the Pre-ectoral Congress of the ODS, the edition chose 6 examples, in priority those related to Prague's mastership.
The socialists had to explain the sense of "Voldemort", "the largest golf troop in Prague", "aller to the patience", "boouf nerve", "Chair Traition" and "Eoller".
Three elections were agreed for the quiz, the fourth-Catryme-Antonin Weinert, which should lead to the education in Prague in the future - promised first, but then did not decrease the phone.
The fifth election Petr Dolinek carefully refused the test.
"I don't care about all these things here and how the representatives of citizen democracy are pleasing: I will not give my opinion."
"I take care of the way we will understand in the framework of our programmes," he reacted.
As we have heard, the elu Lukas Kaucky would not apparently recognize in the above legend, that it is Janosek's influence on the entrepreneurs and friends of the former Roman Wel.
"Voldemort" doesn't say anything to Koucky, and the only expression he did in the test is "the largest golf strike in Prague".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kucky immediately, "but I know newspapers."
"I'm going to pay me a language course", liked it.
Not only murderer Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, who is elected for the environment, know that the golf horse is the tunnel of Blanko.
The two social-democrats know who really is Voldemort and Lukas Plachy knows the place where he finds personality - he thinks about "to go to the pasture."
"I think it's going to go to a company," Plachy is ready to consider that it's Janosek's company seat.
On your same Brezina recalls that he took his knowledge instead of newspapers and not from any vocabulary he would use.
According to the test candidates, there is no luxury in the social democracy.
"I took advice with colleagues, and he seems that we haven't really something of this kind."
"We say the names are sometimes using abreviations and symbols", said Peter Hlinsky, President of the Democratic Social Party, that the members of the Party call Hulda.
"We called Briza to school, but I don't know if my colleagues call me like that, he vowed Karel Brezina about the surnames.
The current newspaper tested the name and it walks.
The El Lu Weinert is Papy for the members of the Party or the most older Petit, the representative of Miroslav Poche, who attracted the attention to him before the elections by the scroqueries during the sponsoring of the party, is called "the small game".
The surnames are also the only ones that are allowed to employ within the Party of the Social Democratics.
It seems not much like Hulinsky listening to Hulda, but the newspaper Kutel.cz recorded another name for this Prague President.
"Doctor in the right of matraque" appears that Petr Hulinsky has obtained his title in law JUDr. At the Bratislava Police Academy.
The Government wants to reduce the torture of “sourders”, editing a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, widows declared have common trafficking.
They are instead part of old generation, for example they can not work for health reasons, are free and have no children.
Those who become "sorcière" are isolated to not threaten the rest of the village.
"The man has this destiny very rarely."
"We do not judge young women healthy because they participate in the work and have children," says a sister who is in the capital of this West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special institution of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to act against this inhabited "social" measure.
He edited a brochure that should help limit the shooting to her sisters.
The case is a hyc.
"Besides 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso do not know read," reported the daily The Standard on the inconvenience of written education.
In other African countries, the accused of sorcellery is common.
In Ghana, the Neighbor of Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman who had been tortured by three women and a man then burned with the oil they aspergied.
It's the BBC server that transmitted this information.
Criminals claim that it was a bad eye.
According to their version, the oil that serves to ritual onions was fled in the contact of the woman.
The oil flamed, like him, when the team wanted to "have the bad spirit" of the woman.
The isolation of "sourties" is approved by people from all levels of education.
The newspaper The Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur in Burkina Faso: "Human spirit eat has always represented a danger," he said.
While Burkina Faso is trying to reduce the chase to hersters, Gambia later after the last year even saw the President itself.
"The President of Gambien Dzami, after the death of his tea, launched a large chase to her sisters who, like he, would have participated in his death and would be struggled by the black magic to kill the President also."
"The calls from Guinea nearly arrived in the rescue, brought to the strong president in Kavali, under the protection of the police and the personnel guard of the President, men and women selected to the harvest in the villages of Gambia," reported the organization "Amnesty International.
In the closest case, incarcerated persons had to drink a plant base on hallucinogen effects that caused other effects on the nests and intestins.
Two prisoners haven't survived.
On international pressure, it is about a thousand people who were released free.
The localist of Bakal: The pools heat, he signed a higher lounge.
A old imponente man is out of the door of the client centre of the RPG Byty company of the "carbon baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments to be lodged in the Czech Republic.
He brought a file with three new location contracts for three apartments: the siden, the daughter of his daughter and his son who came to purify a punishment.
Deregulation has increased the lounge to these three people.
Instead of paying 3500, the child must regulate from the next year for a 2+1 apartment of 4100 corners.
"And there is no warm water and heat functions on solid fuel," shows the dog on the new contract of his son's man who has the power of signing.
"But I ever signed," he explained not to be motivated in anger and half resigned.
The Citizen Association of BytyOKD.cz Apartments who described new location conditions as "immoral and indecent" recommends the localists not signing and waiting until 7 December, the date to which a notice will be published to explain the method to follow.
But the man reacts to this by a man's hand gest.
"The one says this, the other says something else," frozen the smells.
The Ostrava region becomes the laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, the majority of the apartments in Czech Republic whose loans do not correspond to the market price.
Update.cz has decided to visit the "laboratory" for this reason.
The RPG waiting room at the Havirovska Street is one of the four of the Ostrava region and it is already full of Tuesday at 09 a.m.
Just next to the door, a security company is guarded with a device to call customers.
A special button, "location 2011" is on the tactil screen.
One pressure and a paper with a number out of the device.
You don't have the time to read your number "157" that your number starts to illuminate on the large screen under the top of the waiting room.
In a second fraction, it's your tour.
After a short moment, a old couple arrives to teach himself on the home, but the new homes seem to not relate to people in the waiting room.
Most people have come to address current problems as requests for repairs, insurance events and others.
In the Ostrava region, people with more than 44000 apartments from the RPG portfolio receive the emails with the new ballet contracts in their letters from half November.
RPG Byty suggests their payment increases from 15 to 38 per cent.
the special guide for new loans is open to the public since November 18.
"He works for nearly one week, so it's still on the test," answered the employee after a moment of hesitation, after the guest when the customer is presented as a journalist.
Deraguation and older apartments of Bakal minors are a very sensitive local subject.
The Vice-President of the parliamentary and originating region of Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek of the Social-Democratics has made sufficient support before elections, and this is now filled with local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor."
"They haven't even changed me a snake in the wc, the men mentioned.
However, they are especially, according to employees, retreats that come to be assured that they will receive a resort on the new loan price if they are now signing as the RPG promised in a special offer.
It is a retail of the half of the payment amount that will receive the other loans that will have signed their new contract before 15 December.
But the "deregulation" guide of the Havirovaska Street is not really accrued by questions.
"From the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 have come to the household," says the employee at the guichet.
However, RPG puts both on its website as well as in the vitrines of individual rentals when it is necessary.
If the two parties do not listen to the loan, it is an independent court that takes the decision.
'This is not threats but only to inform about the unique and legal way to act legally,' states RPG on its website.
"Here no one goes to the court" thinks one of RPG Byty employees and the man on the street before the customer center gives him right.
"I have 13,000 retreat corones, and there's 5000 corones to eat, I don't have enough to go to the court," he said.
The employee feels very bad at the eye.
"We're seeing."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asked no one to sign and therefore wait for people," says it.
The regularity of loans ended in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and the increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic need.
"And moreover, the current loans do not always reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of housing funds," says Pavel Klimes, director of the RPG Byty company's residential portfolio, which is just the decline of the fund for housing in anger is the main reason for the increase of the loan.
However, in 5 years between 2005 and 2010, RPG was able to invest 4 billion apartments in four years 2011-2014 with 5.2 billion.
The large screen increased on the platform face of the rewarded shoes from the Havirosvka Street waiting room, however, repeats some of the information specified in red.
"In 2011, a loan increase is 15 per cent and is not less than 31200 apartments at more than 90 per cent of RPG apartments."
"And it will always be at least 7.50 Czech Koreans the m2 per month," says the screen.
38 per cent is only 400 apartments of RPG portfolio.
"In these cases, it is an increase of a very low amount of 19.66 Czech Koreans to m2," adds RPG.
The next year the lounge will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause radical but progressive growth in 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money of loans increase (cf. the graph) is made to apartments in the form of heating economy - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the loan increase agreement are priority.
The maternal school is part of the offices also included architects.
the Adriopoint Administrative building is the new seat of the Arch. Design company.
Nobody could expect that it also opens a small maternal school with all that you need - color walls, imaginative furnitures, games and finally a field of miniature on the terrace.
Since October of the last year, the children of the employees of Arch design can be made there.
The company of Architective Projects, whose workshops produced a large number of buildings in Brno, imagine its mini-matrimonial business school since the first buildings of the Avriopoint building.
She employs about 90 people, especially the age to make children, and it was important that the architects and project leaders could quickly return to work.
At the same time as labour labour contracts, the maternal school is a good proposal for its employees by the Arch. Design company.
Constructors and architects thus have the possibility to move to work with children's care.
These are the employees of Arch.Design.All who imagine this maternal school and with the support of the direction they obtained a donation from the European Union and the Ministry of Work and Social Affairs.
The maternal school is financed by the means of the European Social Fund through the operational programme of human resources and the State Budget of the Republic of Czech.
Thanks to the financing donations (a higher than 2.8 billion of Czech Koreans). They could buy equipment and equipment and after two years to ensure qualified staff as well as on the route.
After the use of the financing donation (2 years) the company Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to operate the maternal mini school on its own funds.
The preparation of the project has longed a year and is the Economy Rating company who helped to make the request of a donation.
Child care is provided by qualified staff, every day a nurse and a maternal institutor take care of children. Children may go to maternal school without a age limit but have more than three years for most.
As it is a "matter school" may have only 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more places.
The work of the school is slow in accordance with the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use this school without viewing the historic position.
Although it is a care and individual education, the maternal mini school program is comparable to that for pre-scolary education.
Children do not just play a quality education and are also assured - from the beginning to the preparation to school banks is taught in English.
The class is equipped not only of imaginative games and games but also of a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents may at any time control their children and do not have the stress of a delay to go looking for children in a remote school from the home of work of their parents.
Parents therefore use their work time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that a natural relationship of loyalty is created between employee and employee.
Arch.Design. is thus registered among companies offering a bonus choice for the recruitment of new employees and who are friendly towards the family and through this programme strengthening RH marketing.
The house in fascinates still 100 years later. Get a look in Gaudi's interiors.
The toilet is similar to the two of a prehistory saurien, the scalar to a verteer column of dinosaur and the balcones with open fish rings.
This is the house of Casa Battlo in Barcelona, Architecte Antoni Gaudi.
As a result of its organic forms, the house received the name of House in oss from the locals.
Organical forms, wild colors, inhabitable stone use, carreals and mosaic fragments, recording scales and partly presents corners, this is all that is sweet for the New Art of Antoni Gaudi.
The frontal façade of the house runs its dream lines, colors and pleasant textures that remember the nature and animals.
During a more detailed observation, you see geometric, rhythm and order with specification.
In the night the house's façade becomes more dramatic and is slowed in such a way that the printing of colors is strengthened.
The rotation and torment of forms appear in the interiors with the same measure.
The wood copy the window frameworks, the ballasts, the decorative elements of the doors, the oilton and the lamps.
The Battlo house is located in the Eixample district on the Passeig of Gracia at the number 43. It was born from the construction of a house of 1877 from the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction has been made for two years and the house finished in 1906.
The investor Joseph Battlo, a rich entrepreneur, first stressed the demobilization of old construction and the construction of any other new but quickly accepted the idea of Gaudi's inhabited and better market reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a multi-scale house was not thought by Gaudi alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It's just about his project that decorations are born for a apartment representing the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the façade.
For the façade also worked with other artists and creators.
The joint work for Casa Battlo house plans began with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudi Casa Mila house and Guell Park where there are other works of Gaudi.
The locals named the hot house just after its end, because of its organic forms "the House in os".
Others, as regards the specific window opening mechanism, they called it "the bath house".
On the top of the construction there is a sword like that of Saint Georges the patron of the Catalogne.
Other elements of construction sculpture contain hidden religious motivations.
Gaudi thought for the house an unique system in its central heating time, with typical airway events and roads.
The inclination of 45 degrees seems strange.
During the creation of Gaudi did not absolutely respect the value construction directives and has not been hindered by them.
At the beginning of the construction, he obtained the permission to build, of course, that the data carried out on reconstruction plans were so slow that two years after the end, the municipal Council was horrible and requested for amendments.
For example, it was not pleased to members of the municipal council that the pillars of the construction were empowered on the public slaughter.
There was no amendment, but, on the other hand, only 15 days after the call of the city Josep Battlo asked (and receive satisfaction) the authorisation to lodge the two highest floors.
The owner moves to the lower floors.
In the gallery at the second floor there was a common room and third room and a private part of the apartment.
The shooter was shootered to a swimming shooter.
The whole house of six floors is shared by a scalar by which it is accessed to an independent toilet terrace.
All right angles and right lines were cancelled by the basic elements of reconstruction and replaced them by curves walls.
Gaudi also worked with the modern concept of space connection.
The common party can be fully connected by opening the doors of the halls and the high society can comfortably communicate or by limiting the private space for more interim enterprises.
The house with Gaudi's rebuilding has also received new façations a non-traditional stone and two floors on the other.
Gaudi game with light is also impressive, blue and white shoes with which the inside corner is decorated and with the shoes of light.
The two color game gives a maximum light in all floors of the house.
It was just enough to parish on the principle than the white reflects more than the shadow that, on the other hand, absorbs the sun rays.
The Casa Battlo House, which was registered in 2005 in the World Patrimonial Fund of Unesco, may be visited by each.
At the first floor of the house is the most spacious and most beautiful apartment available to the public.
The owners decided to frank this step in 2002 at the 150th anniversary of the famous Creator's birth.
They continued visits because they found that this is a lucrative company and they extended the field of visits to the common spaces and to the greenhouse, including the toilet terraces.
The monument is not really frozen and costs EUR 16.50; students, retreats, groups and tourist card holders have 20 per cent of rabai.
The sum is even above the entry price in the other buildings of Gaudi in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic tours, you'll need to find a closer among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mats and a summar: women have other criteria than men.
Not a hospital framework, but instead of the quality of the bed-reserved surface, so the matlas and the sumser give a real base for a good bed.
They must certainly complement themselves in harmony to enjoy a concrete user.
During the choice of several things, weight, size, age, health status, and sex of the owner.
The type of internal in which the matlas and summar is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the camping house where the late mats are not permanently suitable because they "hire" calmly.
They have overwhelmed weight more than standard polyurethane mats.
It is necessary to often return them.
If they do not have enough ventilation channels in the heart and, moreover, remain on a solid floor, they keep humidity. The skin can also form it.
The habit is also determined in the choice.
The one who passes the clear time in the foreign where it is often used very slowly with a swimming skin, it would feel very difficult on a low and hard surface.
"It's how all Hockeyists returning from NHL are regretting that they can't sleep there."
"For their fatigued shoes, the feet and the coasts, they needed mats with a smuggling shock of likely mousse."
"They are also recommended for people who have a problem of the nervous system that takes bad "information" of articulation and skin", explains Sylva Adamczikova, who specializes in the refunded furniture.
That's why, just a few years ago, the matlas with the like museum has conquished the hockeyists and other customers.
"That is all good today, Temppur, the Italian Magnifex, but also the Tropico cheque, for example, have appropriate masses.
You don't need to be a NHL guy to be able to appreciate a likely mouse.
This "miracle" just works.
It optimizes its strictness and shape according to the absorpted heat or well adapts to the heat of your body.
No pressure on you and you will not return to the night as after a difficult match.
You're just sleeping better.
The similar museum also works as a protection against square.
For the selection of the matlas in fonction of your size, add the length of the feet, or about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman of 180cm size need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each for a bed at two places should be 90 cm or in total 180 cm.
For single beds at one place, for example, it is recommended to take at least 120/140 cm.
It's fair to visit.
'Indeed, he is a simple rules for the width of the bed: when you are slept on your side, you should put your hands in a comfortable way with slightly increased cooks. Helena Prokopova, Chairman of the Association of the Bourrelers and Decorators, who has been assembled for many years in the healthy sleep and mobilian heromic and teach it in specialized schools.
For a bed to two places, each needs his own sum and matlas, so attention during the purchase to select the height of the matlas.
Unless it will remain you only to mount the sum of different heights and this is not realize on all bed frameworks.
Mouse masses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, resort mats at least 15 cm, of which shall contain for the form and action tissue at least three centimeters.
"On to touch or sit down on the matles you must not feel the resorts," says Helena Prokopova.
Each matles requests a well-determined type to summon.
The somming bed, when the matlas and the summer are united as wedding sisters, has nothing to do in bedrooms.
The masses were very bad; we shouldn't laver, what is done today.
And since the night is normally transpired from 0.2 to 0.75 the sweet is clear that after 5/7 years, the matlas starts to remember a great (and thick) Tamis.
Thus, specialists refuse to claim for a lifetime of 25 years for a master or a life guarantee.
But it's her.
For this reason, a experience counsel from the salers: for a 120/140cm mats, resign, for the revaluation of the mats, the hygiene or the lavage, but instead add a protective mats that you can easily remove and laver.
And even if in today it is often used to manufacture revestitions with glusher closed all over, it is that after opening there are two parties (for the lavage and size of the laver machine is very important!) Unless the manipulation for the big models (and for one person) becomes when a struggle between light weight and a weight weight on a ring.
Do you have a strike floor in your bed instead of summer?
No one!
Maximum for a bed for visitors for one night.
However, equip the plate (if there is no) of availation troops and use resort mats with a minimum height of 15cm with sacket resorts (Germany Taschenfederken) and a swimming pocket.
A polyurethane mats should not be part of this type's bed.
For single lamders with 14/18 lamps, latex maths or sandwichs (possibly the combination of latex and coco), they are the ideal but it will always be better for you to have more mats with lamps, 28 and above, where the lamps are dubbed in the bottom of the kings and so it is possible to regulate strictness.
For several positions there is no need to take resort masses because it does not respond to position changes.
On the side of the rigidity of the lamps, you can also install what is called a sleeve.
This is a special connection of the lamps that allows to make pressure even to switch the lamp so that the sleeper's skin "integre" well.
For men who have "the shoes as large as the dawn", it's really important.
This is already considered by the masses manufacturers that for the "maculins" have started to use a smooth area at the level of the floors.
But they also think about women - they're offering them a more slightly surface at the level of the hams.
For the most difficult customer there are somms for families or platforms with what is called a multi-force suspension.
The pressure is designed in more points and declines the pressure.
But of course, attention, while you use a bad ear (grand and air swimming) on good mats and sums, the "more" was gone.
The basic rule is a very simple ear: the listener must support the head and its points only to reach the edges, so that the muscles of the ears can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that Scandinaves prefer.
When it is extended on the side, the earler must put at level (with the sleeve of the sleeve or the smuggle area in the matlas) the height of the edges.
Modern masses have something more common with the first balls and herbs.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also biomatala.
The first materials based on oil, from which polyurethane is made, are replaced by natural oils, such as soya oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use soja.
"The Bio qualified for maths means that the heart is made on the basis of natural products", explains Petr Vasicek of the Tropico Plus company.
Natural materials are also used for matlas revestments; one of the first ones was the true alone.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop forest or lavande parfums.
There are differences between men and women.
While the extract of boolean plants so that the revestment of the matles absorpte the heat and refrigerate the body, "refroidit" the man, the "heating" revestigation of women.
The red pearl extract accelerates the blood movement and therefore is warm for the weak sex.
Current preferences?
The matles made from cold mouss (this has more porcs with a cellular structure, so more respiratory than standard polyurethane and more elasticity.
The combination of different strikes of cold moulds gives polyzones that know exactly where the head is found, the low of the dust and the feet.
You will pay a quality mats from 7000 corones and more.
Those who are characterized by their health parameters are less than TVA and are taken as health instruments.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex has reached the first place.
Economize for matlas and summar is not simple.
It may be time to have special actions in the framework of manufacturers or producers for the price of one single.
For example, the Magniflex company that offers Duofreeze masses with the memory Mouse couched in refrigeration for 11990 corones.
Of course, you can take the second free.
The era of the glass or viscoles with a open cell structure and a large wide range has been started with the Temppur material at a "comic" rythm.
This began as a material for the NASA because the astronauts were subject to the starting of the major load factors.
The Temple blends the heat and drys, on the other hand, to the cold.
So it is perfectly adapted to the warm human body and distributes a optimal pressure.
It is ideal for this toward the pain of sleep and for an increase in comfort during sleep.
Viscolelastic muscles are used not only for masses but also for health products, such as special skins for feet that highlight the feet and the venenous system.
Czech manufacturers, for example, use EucathermC or Twinsaver mouse or the same type.
People are increasingly requested by parents who want to monitor their children.
The fear of their children brings more people to think about monitoring them through a GPS.
The system, set at the beginning to search for cars, can also be used to track the movement of people and help for some cases, such as the small Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is now as large as a box of alluests but will be soon from the size of a clock.
The case of the small Anicka embraced a lot of people and began to search for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to worry about their private life.
"We strive to tell everyone that it is not spionship but only another way to reduce the probability that there is another tragedy," says Peter Pilin of the macro Weil society, who is one of the trace equipment suppliers in the Czech market.
"I acknowledged that there may be cases of bad employment of such devices, such as put it into the shooting of a person who isn't knowing, but I have not yet met such cases."
"The majority of people are customers who actually buy the product for security reasons, adds Pilin.
He said the children should always know what goals it is used for and how to use it in the case of emergency.
The psychologist for kids, Dana Bockova, attracts the attention that if the child does not want to put on him something of this kind, he's going to be disappointed.
"And even the smallest can show a great creativeness when it is to go out out of something when they do not want to be under control."
"The portable phones, which can be cut as these trace devices, have already brought their parents to long wait", says Bockova.
According to it, the fact that this type of ability can help in case of aggression is very discussable.
"If it is a prepared rat, the author will do everything so that the child has no electronic device that could locate it."
"This is the phone.
"When they're going to develop trace devices, they (the criminals) will look for them too because the sale will be supported by a public campaign."
"In such cases, criminals will always be advanced on the police," says psychologist.
It acknowledges as well as such devices can help when a pedophile is not prepared.
According to Robert Cech of the RC Monitoring company, who offers trail services for both cars and people, claims that this type of device may help, even if it is destroyed in the case of aggression.
"The device may be parametered so that it is in regular emissions after a determinated period."
"In the case the device is destroyed, it remains the last position of the person concerned."
'The chered devices also have an inclinometer that immediately signals the position of the person who slowed and found in long-term position without movement," says Cech.
According to the portable telephones that are equipped with a navigation system, they can propose a comparable service after training with a special prologic.
The problem of the current trace systems is that it is a similar device to those which are carried out in pendentry of the size of an alluminate bottle or the smallest phone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to the Macro Weil company Pilina, this is why tests are currently conducted to make devices that are similar to common numerical clocks.
"This will be the advantage that the possible aggressor will not recognise the trace device."
"But he will take account of it after a certain time, which will give the police a little more time," he adds.
If the tracking device is developed under the form of bracelet or pendentry, it will always use the same technology as cars.
This is a combination of acquiring systems from a GPS position (which is used in autonavigation) and a portable phone function that warns the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many shoes that it could make the tour of the Czech Republic with, but it can have only two years.
The army purchased 445 km of stones used for explosives.
Last year, the Defense Minister has purchased 224 km.
The army has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the life period of shoes is up to two to four years.
The army purchased shoes to the STV Group anonymous company for 40 million corones.
The main state was given as a reason for the purchase of a large amount of DNES shooting shooting to MF DNES that soldiers are using 60 km per year.
According to the reserve calculations made by the army pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES has contacted, it is that even the generals, the officers with orders, secrets or household staff should have an exemption for explosives each year.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, army commander does not be exceptional.
Only for argumenting the annual consumption of the army of 60 km of detonants shoes.
This distance corresponds to 25 000 explosions.
And even if it was true, the army reserves could be supported for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals, it is sufficient to more than 2 m of detoning corners, as the experts say, it means that the army with its new purchase has assured - with the consumption of special units and genia - of reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
Even though the soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade have recently been complained to the Minister vandra that they have not almost munitions for their powder weapons and that the slaughter meetings are limited because of money needs.
We're not talking about the lack of body lingery.
"And I don't take my head if they buy in our house so much detoning shoes."
"This is their decision and they really know what they do."
"For us the army is a good customer we're working as commercians to be satisfied", says the director of STV Group Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, the porter of the Ministry of Defence, argus about the purchase of hundreds of miles of shoes that the army will be reserved for 10 years.
However, Jan Decky of STV Group was only four years of life of the detoning shoes and the police and army pyrotechnicians of only two years.
"If they are perfectly engaged in the deposits, it may even go to four years," said one of them who do not want to be published in respect of the military criticism.
The past life period, each munition must be tested to see if it remains integrity and does not threaten soldiers' life.
However, these tests are not free and are still costing money.
The other argument of the Ministry is a rabat due to the quantity of 445 km of detonants.
"They cost 60% less than the delivery of the last year of 245 km," states the Pejsek speaker, which is the interpretation of the opinion of buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Only to compare: Annual consumption of pyrotechnicians that neutralize the munitions of the Second World War or after the Soviet Army, is not exceeding 1500 meters.
And the police always orders the amount of munitions necessary to be used before the end of their life.
This has been established for reasons for pyrotechnician security and for more slightly obtaining the types of more modern and more reliable shoes.
the Defence Ministry has today great problems for the neutralization of ten tons of munitions from the Varsovia Pact when the strong Czech Republic of 2 hundred thousand men were prepared to move, heading on the Rhin.
What's expected in a few years of this Czech army that MF DNES has contacted: neutralizing hundreds of miles of old stones that she buys today "a good market".
To this day, I benefit from contacts I have received thanks to the competitions.
The sale under franchise of his hotel was well helped Lukas Pytloun for the place of winner of the best individual entrepreneur.
The winner of the best individual entrepreneur for the last year was Lukas Pytloun, a 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His adventure to success is like in a film.
Lucas Pytloun liked to travel.
And in the foreign, he realized that in Liberec he missed a quality hosting site to a reasonable price.
From his economy on what he had winned when he worked for the foreign and with the help of a banking loan he purchased a small building of 5 apartments to half demoli.
It was a courageous action when he was still studied in the first threeth year of higher studies.
"The relationship between quality and price of a accommodation in our region has given me the desire to do something," said Lucas Pytloun.
It started lounging the first apartment rebuilding for foreign workers.
He re-invested the benefit in the building that he transformed in pension with 54 beds.
Since that moment, his entrepreneur's action allowed him to open in Libérec 4 pensions, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of about 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable among them was until recently the four stars of Pytloun design hotel.
This year he arrived another identical quality.
"We just come to sign a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our concept of franchise and other candidates to the Francis of the Pytloun hotels have been shown", the number 1 of the entrepreneurs of the past year.
"And for the sale of the license for the operation of a large-scale hotel the victory in the course of the entrepreneur's year has well served, adds Pitloun with appreciation.
The victory brought to him more popularity and to be known in Liberec and its surroundings.
"The people acknowledged me in the streets, often welcomed me and, I have to say, that it was very pleasant," remembers him.
It recommends the participation in this concours to all those who are trying to do something.
It is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says he uses his contacts and knowledge until now that he wouldn't have been able to get another way.
"Before those I met with the competition I began to maintain regular trade relations.
According to him, the success-related rename has also affected employees.
And there's about 70.
"I observe their homes in particular the loyalty and the pride of being involved in something that has been generally recognised."
"This is not, and from far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work together.
"All my name is put forward," said Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I want my successor a better year than the one we had in Farmet.
The euphory of the victory was slowly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the objective of the winner Farmet has the worst moments behind me.
The one who came to search for the price in Slovansky for the first place of the competition for the year's company organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky's owner of the Farmet company.
The jury rewarded the efforts he transformed a workshop in Ceska Skalice in a strong number of businesses of 100 million corones.
"I can say that the reward has not only encouraged my collaborators and have increased our confidence in the fight against competition," says today the winning of the competition of the last year.
At the beginning of the history of Farmet society there was the desire to do something of use.
And so when the state suggested to the father of Karel Zdrasky to lodge the small workshop as a compensation after the confiscation of goods by the communists, he did not hesitate long, rejected a carrière in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with a few chairs in the development of his father for the manufacture of plastic bathrooms.
Not very long after they began to specialize themselves in vegetable oil presss.
It has become the largest manufacturer of automatic presss in Central Europe after 10-8 years.
The company was even known in the non-specialized public after the success of the competition through media.
"Don't only our customers have been really better known about the Farmet mark but also the foreign partners who began to realize that they cooperate with a company who had the greatest success in their country of origin," says Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year wasn't passing in Farmet only in the euphory of the winning.
The company's evaluation was made from the 2008 economic results and in 2009.
And just in 2009, this was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
More than the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, companies were obliged to stop their investment projects and start to limit their purchase of new materials and technologies.
"We did not obviously miss this situation."
"The numbers of business have lost 40 percent, and we should limit our production and even license," Karel Zdarsky explains.
A viable society must know that a time in time must be taken unpopulary measures.
But they managed the situation correctly and maintained beneficiary results even if they were less than those they had before the crisis.
However, in Farmet, they continued without commitment to invest in research and development.
"We have built with donations a training and research centre, strengthened the submission of the company in international exposure salons and won the main rewards in national exposures," said Zdarsky.
Everything lets us think that the crisis is behind them.
The numbers of affairs are back and with them also the number of employees.
"A new winner I want this pleasant feeling of the victory but in a calm atmosphere," said Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation which deletes the insensitive regulations.
The year's absurdity investigation is for the fourth time a part of the business clan.
Some absurde regulations have been removed.
The little glorious winner of this year of the Absurdity Survey was the obligation to provide in the document offices that officials can get online.
More than a third of the 4000 voters voted for this.
For example, the social business administration requested a extract paper from the trade register while the official could obtain it in two mouse clicks.
This changes through the investigation.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer ask for the extradition of the trade register for insurance payment controls", said Jana Buranova, a speaker of the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
Against all regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must fill in the Czech Republic and remove those who are assured is the sense of this concours of the year's absurdness.
This investigation is still this year for the fourth time a part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has a larger popularity.
If the last year 3000 voters have occurred, at least 4000 voters have made their vote.
And that is not wonderful, there are the most legal obligations in our country that are only frozen the company, and that is, more.
"We may be at the number of documents to be filled for fiscal statements in the first places in the world," says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Employers of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurship is a proclaimed goal of all governments in the past few years.
In comparison with the whole world, the situation in Czech Republic does not improve all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is at the 74th place for the conditions for the company, it is 8 places more than the last year.
The support of the year's absurdity was established for the first time in 2006 and continued each year according to the same scenario.
Any who can take note of the administrative and bureaucratic absurdities each year from April to September at the end of September, last time before the concours closure.
To take account of the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the competitor chooses seven candidates for the "antiprix" and let the public vote in October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurd and on www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdity that has received the largest number of voices is declared winner.
As long as the last investigation of the last year, it is a hundred, or more precisely 105 regulations and decrees that have lost their sense of existence.
The comments are sent by entrepreneurs, but also the professional units and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, therefore, among the names are the obligation to keep the authors and fast ways paid the pieces, or the entrepreneurs with twenty employees have two offices and two toilets every two years.
the list of seven proposals is published on the concours site.
The proclamation of the concours, which is always starting at the beginning of November on the Place Venceslas in Prague, is a part of a event that regularly participates in the personalities of political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, Director of the Association for Small and Middle Businesss of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kuzel, President of the Czech Republic's Trade Chamber, attended the competitive moment.
'Economic prosperity cannot work when the State puts acts in the legs of entrepreneurs, and therefore my goal is to remove at least three decades of paragraphs today that are just to compromise the company' said Martin Kokurek, the Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to remove absurd dectes is not a sword sword in the water.
In 2007, what did not like people was the obligation of entrepreneurs to declare three days before the office for the individual undertaking where the company was found, the intention of go to an exhibition or pelerage.
This obligation was deleted with the promulgation of the Act on the individual undertaking.
The second most completed obligation in 2007, which was to declare a service trip for foreign employee over 30 days, was deleted by the Act on what the green map is called.
And it's all right until the third session of the competition.
The Absurdity of 2009 has been the decree for physiotherapeutes to have a great view in their office, a refrigerator and two automatic balances.
This was changed by order of the Ministry of Health in the last year the obligation to have a refrigerator has been deleted.
A new category rewards the socially responsibilities.
The ecological, humanitarian, training or sportive projects are evaluated.
The newness of this year of Hospodarske Noviny concours, which has already been for five years, is the category called the Responsable Field of 2010.
This competitive is the support for the reasonable and fair enterprises.
"We want to support companies that monitor the impact of their company on the environment and take socially responsible activity", says Patrick Bartholdy, the regional telephone manager, the strong Vodaphone, which is the guarantee and promoter of this competition, as in the case of competition for the revolt of the year.
For this first year of this sub-category concours of the 2010 fixed Vodaphone, companies who have not been successful with a long-term goal for the company were registered.
The adventure of each of them is rich of inspirations and an independent article would be edited.
Although the subject of their company is different from one another can consider their support and prevision activities as the designator of their efforts.
For one of the cases, it refers to persons with disabilities and personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the 14 finalists for the whole Czech Republic, for example, there is no example the company of pragmatic prologicials and Netera who supports the creation of informal sports teams from their employees who then participate in a number of tournaments in various sports disciplines.
Another firm example of the Pardubice region is the Isolit-Bravo company who has been 17 years of the main contribution to the donation fund that sponsorizes disabled children.
In order to care for employees with health problems, the old publishing factory of Potbrad, which is employed by more than 70 per cent and which, for this reason, has obtained the firm Responsable for the Central Boheme region and which was third in the region in the support of the Vodaphone Task Force of the year.
In Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, who wins to have introduced accumulated worktimes and even reduced up to 35 hours per week and, without proportional decrease in payment.
The jury also deferred the title to him because it purchases priority to the Czech manufacturers, supports a distinct activity in the nearly and concerns the environment.
"We strive to recycle the best possible so that our business activities and our administration have the less impact on the environment", explains Miles Ryznarova, the executive leadership of the company.
the responsible company IT Login of the Usti Region also thinks about the health of its employees and has established them for each portable computer a chair and a ergonomic clavier, encourages their homework and uses local protected plant services for its actions.
"We also support the foundation The man in the shadow that helps the local Rome community," said Ondrej Search the representative of the society.
The latter is also, for its activities, a company of Lavage and cleaning in the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the retraiting insurance of its employees under the form of bonus above standards.
"We contribute to food, transport, qualifications and loishers from our society," said Joseph Strapac of the Bruntal Czasch construction company, winner for the region of Moravie-Silesia.
It was automatically registered in the relevant company category, all regional finalists for the support of the Vodaphone Task Force of the year, which had responded to the joint questionnaire in the document for registration and sent it to the organizer before August 15.
The badly filled or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were removed from the concours by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the firms in license had not answered to questions, they couldn't participate in the concours of the Responsable, but were not disqualificated by the "principal competition" the Vodaphone year company."
"Independent registrations are not possible because it is a subcategory of the main concours of the Field of the year", explains Karel Goldman from the Organizing Agency Bison & Rose.
In the Earth Fund in Plzen, the police held arrests during public concours
In the Earth Fund building in Plzen, the anti-corruption police has conducted arrests in recent days.
Detectives have led to the local entrepreneur and traded in real estate Lubos.
This was striving to handle just a public appeal for the regulation of a refund request so that the proposed field was obtained by a determinated candidate.
That should be paid to Lubos G. a half million corones.
"For the moment, I can only confirm that the police continues a person for a crime in the context of an appeal of offers and a public concours." Pravo reported the head of the Plzen Antonie Zelena Park, who knows that it is prohibited to explain more explanations because the investigation is now understood.
Police officers released this 46-year-old entrepreneur in freedom after 24 hours.
In order to know how it could affect public competition, it can only be shown in respect of so few official information.
On a question of Pravo, the Lubomira Territories Fund stated that the police had actually been arrested in Plzen on a separate workplace and, so, during the public competition.
"He was a customer and in no case of a employee, it was specified.
The public competition according to Cerna was a real name "Applause to propose land transfer rights according to the Land Law" and is placed when a number of candidates of law are manifested.
"They propose, in the context of the call, a higher value of their refund rights which must be regulated before the value of the field is announced."
" According to the proposed rights of a purchaser classification is established, and the Territories Fund then transfers the field to the person who has proposed the highest rights", explained the Fund ' s talking port.
Lubos G. had, clearly, information on those who were inscribed to the call and as it is also a beneficiary person because he had purchased a large number of refund rights, had proposed candidates to do not participate in the competition.
And he was uncertainly engaged in the fact that he was getting away.
What would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his interpulsion.
Lubos G. had broadly above standards in the FdT ( Terrains Funds).
He figured in the case of the former FdT Vaclav Sankot, who was continued to criminally editing fields for which the decision to establish a construction was already established.
Just Lubos G. had, for example, obtained fields for the construction of public communications, specifically in place and where the access to the industrial area of Borske Pole was to be built.
Afterwards he exchanged it with the matrix for a building in the historical center of the city whose value is very far.
The matrix was obliged to accept, since, unless it was risked to put the construction in danger by a field blocking.
The households will pay an additional of a hundred corones monthly for the accommodation.
The households will have to pay a supplement not only for all types of energy, but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places will also increase.
The families will therefore have to shoot from January to a hundred crowns monthly more than now.
The electricity increases from 4.6 per cent, the gas of almost 2 per cent higher, in some places you will have to pay up to a tenth more water supply and in many places the central heating supply will also be more cheap.
The increase of electricity should be used for apartment households for more than 100 crowns annually than currently.
However, all suppliers have reduced electricity prices because of the sensitive development to encourage the manufacture of renewable energy, including photovoltaic pillars.
Gas increased moderately but of course at the time when people have the most necessary to heat and therefore have the largest consumption.
So there can also be hundreds of corones in more.
Although electricity and gas increase in the whole Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating is different from town in town.
These are mainly the largest communities that plan to increase prices.
For example, the households in Pardubice or Hradec Kingoce derived from January for the central heating almost 50 krones per month, Libérec’s families perpetrated more than 1000 krones annually.
For the people of Prague, there is an increase of 9 per cent for water and sanitation in the case where the city increases infrastructure loans.
If the loans do not change the pragoists will be an additional of 6.8 per cent.
The price in Prague will be part of the lowest comparison with the whole country.
In Northern Boheme, where prices are already part of the highest, water and sanitation increased by 7.4 per cent.
The prices of loans will, for example, increase sensitively in 450 000 apartments from January to the end of the regulation.
For example, the CPI Byty company who has Usti nad Labem about 2500 apartments has decided to increase up to 100%.
Those who will not agree with the new increase of loans will be translated before courts by society.
Regular loans paying people in about 300 000 apartments could increase the next year of 10 per cent.
Czech children are sweet to the rhum and the fernet. The bird is no longer mode and acts quietly.
Ferrenet, rhum, vodka and exceptionally also the best whisky mark is stolen to parents.
These are drinks that bring most often those who are saooulening, who have not yet 15 years of age, among the hands of the doctor.
Children who are in the hospital for recycling do not exemption.
This results from the experience of doctors who meet cases similar to the admissions of hospital children.
"Bills or wines are no longer mode, because there is time to be saúl."
"The tendency is really to strong alcohols," says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Chief of the Horovice Hospital Hospital in Central Boheme.
"When they succeeded to shut a pape bottle in the moon, it's a wisky swimming time but it's the fernet and vodka that prevail.
"The vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juices and so do not feel it", explains the head of the Department.
Eva Jurinova, a portal of the Motol Hospital, also gives him right.
"In general, it's rhum or fernet."
"This is today the alcohol to mode, in particular in primary schools."
"In some cases, it was slavery they returned from the house," added Jurinova.
According to the Pelikan Division Chief, seeking children from 30 to 14 years of age to hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol where he spent ten years just in a pediatrist where the ambulances brought up large schools completely swimming around.
"A young girl was hospitalized so four times
"He accompanied his 12-year career when it was administered with 3.5 per thousand of alcohol in blood with more than a mixture with extasy", describes the doctor of this specially important case.
"He was at the Holesovice Exhibitions Park at a party."
"What is interesting is that it is not strange to the mother that his daughter is abstaining 48 hours," said the Director of the Department.
It is just the desinsineration of parents, or their tolerance outside the common face, because their rejections are the main cause of the development of child alcoholism.
The specialists, however, are not talking about dependance, in its strict sense, for children.
"Another alcoholic vocabulary is heard a chronic dependence in alcohol for several years with all phenomena that develops it, but it is not found at children."
"These who use the recurrence-repeat, it is instead a significantly deceived social-familial back-up", explained the Pelikan Department Chief.
According to Jurinova's parl, about 40 children were hospitalized this year until mid-11 in the illness of pediatrie in Motol.
It is not included in statistics only cases with gravity intoxication that require hospitalization.
The children who are after emergency care brought home by their parents or by the police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children who sit and drink a drink after the school, he exists according to Pelikan's three seasonal vagues with which they can be counted: the day of the sisters, the Holy Sylvestre and the end of the school year.
"If they drink even after bad results or on the other hand they celebrate the start of holidays."
"I've certainly lived at the day of the sisters, a 7 children's admission from one piece," said Pélikan.
The child who had been passing the night in the hospital under medical control is paradoxally in better position than the one who has returned to him and suffers the "wood ring" next day.
The headbreaks of the morning caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrient elements that the body needs.
"They are better lotis because they pass a great evening then wake up and nothing makes them bad."
"They are only surprised from the place where they are,," adds Pélikan, who knows that in time this makes the good humor of patients at least with the note to pay for their care.
The transport by ambulance and the hospitalization on intensive care bed may go up to tens of thousands of corones.
"After time, I applied this as an educational means by accounting to these children how much their costs had and that they could pass all the summer in college work to repay one night," added Pélikan.
However, according to him, health insurance companies in their regression management, which should be recovered from parents' care charges, do not treat the cases of ill-children.
Two L-159 flights are first in foreign hands in Spain.
Two aircraft L-159 from five in all, against which the Defence Minister has changed aircraft house C-295M, have set out march for Seville in Spain where the manufacturer of Casa-EADS was settled.
It's the first time that devices of this type become the property of someone else than the Czech Army.
However, they have been in the foreign area of exercises or demonstration flights.
This is biplace versions of the L-159T1, which were until now in service in the Czech Army and were in the state of flight.
Lestroys remaining devices are monoplay versions of L-159.
These stations are now at Aero Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the strong Omnipol - took into account the last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the Department of Defence, Vodochody’s physical department is Unknown for the moment.
The L-159 Monoplaces planned for exchange have been taken on aircrafts stored for a long time without that is caused by additional charges or investments for the Ministry of Defence."
"The L-159 T1 biplaces were changed in the state," said Pravo Pejsek.
He played that the army would not stay without biplace because the Ministry signed in May 2009 with Aero Vodochody a 200 million corones value for the transformation of four monoplace L-159 unused in two biplaces.
The army took the first machine in July, the second was planned to deliver to the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS, aircrafts were forced to be introduced in the equipment of certain countries of the Alliance.
"The contract is clearly indicated that those who take into account L-159 are EADS and that they will serve for the training of NATO countries pilots."
"This is why the case of the one who takes into account the way to achieve this", said Pejsek.
Hospodarske noviny announced, some time ago, that Spanish army is not interested in L-159.
The exchange of 5 L-159 for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion corones has been completed last year by the Government of Mirac Topomanek.
The Defence Ministry has not started calls and contacted EADS directly.
the defence direction argued, while the exchange ensures future exports from L-159 to the foreign.
The Czech Army purchased the Vodochody Aéro 72 devices and uses only 24, they want to sell the rest.
The Casa Aviation purchase will probably have legal implications.
However, the European Commission has complained against the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice as aircrafts had to be chosen in the framework of an invitation to the European scale and, in any case, contacting directly a manufacturer.
The army has already delivered three Casa aircrafts, and the last should arrive on Prague Kbely's airport in two weeks.
A longer index than the annul is a low-risk sign of cancer
Mans who have the longest index than the annul are exposed to a less risk of having prostate cancer.
It is the surprising conclusion of a mercredied study by the British Cancer magazine.
This may depend on the level of the mood hormone the stereo.
"Our conclusions show that the relative length of the dog serves simple risk testing for prostate cancer, in particular for men 60 years ago," declared the co-auteur of the Ros Eeles study, Professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
The duty could thus help to determine what men should be subjected to the test of prostate cancer, including by combinating with the genetic risk or other aggressive factors such as family health care, adds Eeles.
During the 1994-2009 period, she followed colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the students were the index of the right hand more short than the annul.
For them, as for the 19% of those who had the dogs of the same length, the same probability was found as a prostate cancer.
However, in the case of those who had the longest index than the annual risk was 33 per cent, for men to 60 years ago the risk reduction has reached 87 per cent.
The long report of the two quoted dents, formed during the prenatal period, shows, in particular, the different levels of sexual hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterius.
Unless textsterrone corresponds a longer index.
Recent research showed that it is just the textsteron that helps the development of prostate cancer.
Profesor Vacla Paces, renamed Czech genetician and former President of the Scientific Academy, said for CTK it is aware of this study, but it seems not to be that the relationship between density and cancer is "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under the snow, the D1 and D5 authors are closed.
Czech as most of Europe is this Thursday morning, which is covered by nest.
On the roads and throats, most of the time of the compact snow, the swimming worked all night in many places.
The D5 car is closed between the 89th and the 93th km direction of Rozvadov because of several trucks and car accidents and the D1-hour D1 to Brno in the direction of Prague was the same sort.
The Central Automobile Club Dispatcher (UAMK) told it to the information
At the 91th kilometer, a truck was attacked, two large weights had been perished, the accident has been blessed.
several cars were also found in the store.
The problems are also on the D1 road from 185 km from Prague.
Two trucks have percuted there
The drivers should be out right after Brino at the 190th kilometer or go to Brino and then enter the 182th kilometer to Kyvalka.
A car file of several kilometers has been formed in this place.
Equally on the D11 car, there's an accident, and that's just at Prague's arrival.
In Prague there is a neighborhood of several centimeters, the thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
Car files are created, for example, in Prosek, Sterboholska Street is also broken.
The most safe transport means is the metro.
The tramways, for example, are late on the line between the Place Charles (Kalove Namesti) and the Peace Place (Namesti Miru).
At eight hours of the morning, the main state of Prague's crisis must still be gathered.
Railways and airports also face problems.
The Czech iceways had to be removed because of the neighbouring of 7 speed connections.
The lines for example in Prague in Kingupy or a lot of Prague in Beroun have problems
The travellers should control the current situation.
Ruzyne airport was closed from Tuesday, 11 a.m. in the night until 5 p.m.
The majority of the roads in South Moravia is already robust but renewing monitoring.
On the route of Vyskov, three lake routes are impratory, on the road of Brno it begins to have swimming places and on the road of Blansko the chains are obliged to pass some ways of communication in higher places.
The Vyskov region was part of the most touched places.
To date the ass are closed: Rusinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and Saratice-Milesovice
In order to clean them, it may be necessary to send nuts and swimming feeds.
We can't evaluate when they're gonna be rolled.
On the road of Hodonin, the prudence is strict in the white carpaths region.
On roads that are, in relation to the protection of nature, entered only by the aspersion of invariable products, there is also a swimming cloud of 5 centimeters of black warning CTK.
In Czech, it was dropped between two and 10 cm of snow; it was the highest in the northern Boheme, with often up to 18 cm.
In the Moravian-Silesia region, it was dropped up to 15 cm of snow.
The eruption was progressively disappeared in Czechia.
Americans have a new "intelligent weapons"
The American Army sent a new "intelligent weapons" in Afghanistan only known under code XM-25.
Generals believe that this new automatic shooting will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and "change the game" to their benefits.
The new weapon is like a super precise canon.
His projectiles are guided by laser with a precision of a few metres.
The 25 mm special calibre ammunition developed for this shock and contains a high-scale explosive, actually functions as small grenades.
We can programmate munitions in such a way that they will explose on the target contact but also at any point of their balistic trail.
So it can be used against a enemy who hides behind a barrier, a wall or a shooting.
It isn't still protected from the top and when it falls over a mortar rain of a steel rain, it can also put it out of battle.
According to Richard Audette, who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new gun is the first weapons of infantry which uses the "intelligent technology".
"The soldier is mainly serving it in such a way as he finds the target, sent him a laser radiate that determines the distance, thus obtains a specific view point, according to which he corrects his viewed site and supports the detention.
"That you've seen at 543 metres."
"When you press the detention, the weapon is loaded and shooted at the distance of 543 metres more or less than 1,2,3 m, Audette stated.
400 displaced jobs
The Fujitsu Group delocates Bad Homburg's subsidiary to Francfort.
The next year, in July, 400 collaborators will transfer to Astro Park their workplace that is currently at the Mareinbader Place building in the Bad Homburg region.
The Japanese Fujitsu group delocalizes Bad Homburg's succursale succursale in Francfort.
As he stated, the specialized genital in the manufacturing and maintenance of computers, the next year in July, the place of work of 400 men and women, located until now on the Marienbader place of the city of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, a huge complex of offices situated on the Lyoner Street of the Niederrad Quartier of Francfort.
A footnote portal of Fujitsu explained that at the mid-term, the group should group 100 other jobs still displaced until now in the region.
The location offer was extremely attractive. In addition, the open air offices of Astro Park are better agreed with the work mode of collaborators.
In Bad Homburg also, Fujitsu was just a localist.
The Director-General, Bernd Wagner, stated: "Frankfurt-Niederrad is a primary location with a remarkable infrastructure."
It claims that the airport connection is just a great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new movement of an important company within the region succeeded last night the joy of winners and caused losses.
The director of the Francfort municipality's economic affairs, Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a planetary actor was conquired.
It's a "extraordinary profession of faith in the place of implantation".
Fujitsu corresponds to the city and its implantation is an important edge for Niederrad.
The master of Bad Homburg, Mr. Michael Korwisi (the Greens), regrets the decision of Fujitsu.
The direction has soon informed the municipality of this intention.
"He will say that we have proposed our help to this company," said Mr. Korwisi.
However, friendships couldn't change the difficulties of the computer manufacturer faced the owner of the Marienbader building.
Finally, economic reasons would have been determined.
It is now to avoid that such an exceptional place remains uncertain for a long time.
"I've hoped that the owner and bathing of the building will be cooperative."
10 years ago, the building of the Place of the Hotel de Ville, used until now by the Fujitsu company and the "very request" nearby, as well as the rest of the buildings of the Marienbad Place, was part of the project of counter-building of the temperature station.
Through a joint project of municipality and a private project developer, a new entry of the city was created between the car and the city Hotel, which causes many critics, not only because of the impressioning design of surfaces that served in a parking area, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the manufacturer of computers for travel distribution systems, Amadeus and Fujitsu, manufacturer of computers still associated with Siemens, moved to buildings.
In 2006, the German Francfort specialized group of Immobilien-Chancen ransomed the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the real estate Morgan Stanley. One year later, these buildings were returned to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate SA investments based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu group, where the seat is located in Tokyo, is considered the third largest provider of IT products in the world.
For example, it provides computers and servers to the undertaking and also ensures the essential service.
His succursale established in the Rhin-Main region is one of the most important ones in Germany: Fujitsu is surely more employees in Munich.
The succursale, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to install in Frankfurt-Nederrad. The other branches presented on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, 7000 square meters were taken in the Astro Park building.
This twenty-year-old complex, whose name remembers its plan in the form of stars, opens among others the seat of the Confederation of the electronic and electronic industry.
Server Exploration by Amazon - Menaces against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks tries more difficult.
The Amazon Internet Services provider issued the specialized website in the revelation of confidential documents from its servers.
This may be cached by political pressures after the publications of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, appears to be in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks website is always more powerful.
The Wikileaks cyber-activist group has no longer access to its host until now in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
During that time, the Emperor American Senator, Joe любrman, called the other countries and companies to Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, which is searched for Interpol, probably resides in Great Britain, according to the information published by newspapers.
"Whileaks excluded the Amazon server."
"Feliness of expression to the country of freedom" stated merger (local time) the cyber-activists originating of revelations through the social Twitter network.
Before before, the cyber company, Amazon, had deleted the Wikileaks documents from his servers.
After the publication of the secret diplomatic notes, the active cyber-activists had been requested to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in order to achieve the largest access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues his revelations: "Forbidable, our dollars are now expenditure for people in Europe."
When the freedom of expression poses a problem in Amazon, "they should stop selling books".
The CNN TV chain, quoted by Mr. Amarmann, reported that Amazon prohibited Wikileaks to use his servers after the investigation conducted by Senator Joe Madrman's collaborators.
The President of the Senate Committee for the Protection of the Territory had threatened the Amazon site to launch a boycott against him, reported the British Journal "The Guardian".
"I would wish Amazon take this measure early in respect of previous publications by Wikileaks of the classified information," said the Senator.
Similarly, Mr. Liebermann called the other countries to refuse the use of servers through the platform.
"Whileaks acts illegally, monstruous and unclean. This makes our national security in danger and threatens our lives around the world," says a communication from the independent senator.
"Another undertaking knows of his responsibilities, that she is American or Foreign, should not help Wikileaks to disseminate the content of the shoot documents."
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, is searched for Sweden's authorities because it is suspected of violence, figures on the list of people searched for Interpol.
According to the information published by the London newspaper "The Independent", Australian of 39 years lived in Britain and Scotland Yard is exactly known where it is found.
Cyber-activist has constantly qualified orchestrates by its delegators the progress made against Sweden.
The Wikileaks' parl, Christinn Hrafnsson, declared London that threats were pronounced against the site.
"The calls were even launched for the murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange was particularly afraid for his security, said Hrafnsson.
That's why the Wikileaks founder continues to hide.
Hrafnsson expressly responded to the statements made in North America.
In America, the former Republic of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, requested that the root of the revelations made by Wikileaks continue and executed for trajection.
In Canada, Mr. Stehen Harper's Governing Body adviser stated that Mr. Assange should "be killed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a drone".
During that time, a pollegia was cut between the white house and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, a chairman of the United States President, Barack Obama, qualified "ridiculous and absurde" the fact that Mr. assange requested the demission of the State Secretariat Hilary Clinton if it was responsible for the order given to the diplomas, and recently disseminated, to be delivered to sponsoring activities.
"I don't know exactly why we need to take care of the opinion of a owner of a website", says Mr. Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and interests in this country are much more important than the confirmations of a website."
The United States government is now completely testing the protection of its databases.
According to a white house communiqué, Mr. Russell Travers, Adjunct Director of the Centre of Anti-Terrorism, was appointed responsible for combating refugees.
Mr. Travers is responsible for establishing the necessary structural reforms after dissemination of diplomatic cable by Wikileaks.
The White House also has the will of verifying the ways by which all exchange administration and protects information.
In addition, the United States government announced that he wanted to take care of dissidents and military security if they were never threatened by the Wikileaks revelations.
"We've done everything to contact them," stated Philip Crowley's headquarters of the Department of State.
"We are ready to protect them if it is necessary."
The university of Glass
In Bologne's "Gelato University", the glass confissors are prepared at the best seasons of the year.
The starting course of three days towards the future glass has been very successful and has touched visitors from all the world.
In fact, where's all the glass coming?
Glacier and glass machine.
The glass, that is, in Germany, the glass container somewhat demoted, produces the cream according to all rules of Italian manufacturing glass.
The glass turbine includes the ice cream of the fried vitrine using a spatule, disposed of it in the garage and then starts to sell it.
To know, we don't need to go to Anzola della Emilia in the province of Bologne.
But anyone wants to know more about the ice can not avoid "Gelato-University" of the strong Italian Carpigiani.
The manufacturer of ice manufacturer founded in 2003 so that the ice creams of its machines would answer all the high Italian ideals.
The starting course of three days towards the future glass was very successful and has touched visitors from all over the world.
It also offers special courses on the ice of chocolate and expansion over a few days. Similarly, practical meetings are organized in the private glass.
In full crisis of the quarentaine, a number of people dream of a new carriage, others can simply do their desire slowly on the ice.
This time, these are 40 participants from 19 countries of all continents from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, professor of artic education from California, is a fever of the Slow Food movement. He wants to propose a European quality product to the industrial glass country.
Anke from Berlin is a business manager and she wants, after a few years, to take some unique things from this trial work for nerves.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a glass in Cairo.
A man from Malte and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian household woman came because his children worship the Italian glass creams.
Master Luciano Ferrari explains first to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect glass.
It is determined not only the good savior, but also the sweet sweet and the good convergence.
However, Luciano is not forgotten during the training of the Cyril on the gate of national superstructuring and, in general, "Itlandic glass is just the best: and then she keeps a sacred dose of romantism."
The first step in the manufacture looks very simple.
Luciano sets basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilists in a large medium that smoke up to 85 degrees through an electronic program, then immediately refrigerated to four degrees.
He then opens a machine installed robin: it is a pastorized white base crystal, based on all kinds of milk glass.
The former is soon questionnaire: Is it possible to manufacture glass by using only natural substances without stabilizer?
How can free course be given to personal satisfaction of experimentation?
Mr. Luciano guards the fact that it is to be wrong by the spirit of time.
Those who say only ices "fabricted from natural ingredients," may have been used, despite this use of stabilistors: most often a natural product, for example, the grain of grain obtained from the tissue tissue.
Of course it is possible to manufacture glass without using stabilizer, only to sell it within a period of 24 hours, except to shoot it and the customer will raise nothing else than glass grains.
Some changes in the base mass are allowed.
This becomes more tragic with the aromas.
The Master Luciano sets the difference between the ingredients that it is acquired in the supermarket fruit or confission rail.
Furthermore, there are powders and pants.
"the suppliers will all try to refile you with aromatised dozens of aromatised ingredients."
"All time, you should just try."
Be in the sorbed receipts of fruit with sugar and feed fruit.
It is in the ice creams made from the white base mass that, adding eggs become a yellow and represents, when it adds cacao powder, the base of all possible deserts to chocolate.
Now, all the participants in the course must pass to the use of glass machines.
Luciano invites you in time to manufacture four types of glass: the vanilla, the chocolate, the moka and the noise with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less than vanille aroma or other natural ingredients.
The various types of glass to fruit are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more cleans of fruits: from the point of view of the guest, it is not absolutely better.
The ice to the noises does not forcely conduce the sweet, when it consists in most of the noises.
The kiwi glass, very popular, is made from the group which uses more fruits, less water and a fewer stabilizers.
"Only a balanced melange correctly retains the gust of a ice," says Luciano.
The manufacture of the glass is a calculation exercise: if it is used for fishing cleaning with a lot of sugar, the amount of sugar must be reduced in the basic receipt.
A sugar supplement is required for citron ice.
Luciano presents a device with which he determines the sugar content of the various types of fruit (we will serve it to measure Oechsle's degree in the wheat).
Unfortunately, the tables facilitate calculations.
The manufacture of the glass no longer requires, as soon as physical intervention.
This is not only the automatic manufacturing machine of the base mass that helps.
There is also a device in which the glass mixed is also available to make it sweet and returned to negative temperatures.
Despite all automatizations, slight panes are not excluded.
Brazilian Gustavo was barboiled from the feet of the head to the feet, and thus cut out his studies chairs when the control of the measuring bowl flew him away.
The Master Luciano is viewed that "the same risk is to happen at each course: it's just a question of time".
Controllers in a ambiguous position
According to some sources, the European Food Safety Authority experienced the culture of genetically modified plants has undergone to the European Food Safety Authority.
This accused is now formulated by the Testbiotech Group, which is considered as an independent institution for the evaluation of the biotech impacts.
"This sound as a theory of conspiration, but we're well-designed," said Monday at Munich M. Christoph Then, Director of Testibiatech.
Some information shows that the President of the Efsa Group of Experts for genetically modified plants, Mr. Harry Kuiper, and other Efsa experts are under contract with the Ilsi Press Group.
This is financed by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has cooperated decisively in the preparation of the Efsa test requirements for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a situation of interest conflict, according to the critics made by Mr. Ten.
The proposed requirements are textually corresponding to the positions taken by the Ilsi Press Group and thus support the brand of the industry which, on the ground, would be controlled by the authorities installed in Italy.
This is the second time that Testbiotech declares a conflict of interest.
A high-ranking director of the Efsa has recently joined the Swiss Agricultural Group Singenta, which has changed in camps.
Not long ago, even the Central Germany Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) showed the existence of personal relations between the European Union's control authority and industrial lobby, which has deteriored the suspicion of both the German Federal Agency for the Environment and European Deputy.
However, Ephsa does not admit the existence of no conflict of interest.
A view indicates that all reliable data are exploited, including those of the industry as they are a good professional quality.
There is no prohibition to experts working for the Efsa account to contact this activity sector.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the International Institute for Life Sciences (International Life Sciences Institute, Ilsi) based on the United States.
This organization is considered as a neutral forum that groups experts, inter alia in the field of science, industry and policy, in order to assess the risks of biotechnology without being a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then denied the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any test of food in animals and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We want to know what is, for example, the effects of the maize genetically changed causes to the field," said Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins and not all the genetically modified plant, which does not allow reliable results.
"If you don't find the risks, how can you discover them?" asked Mr. Then on your accused.
This is also the point of view by Mrs Angelica Hilbeck.
This research has been done since 1994 in the field of genetics and currently works at Zurich's polytechnical school.
In this region, as in the United States, and now in Europe, the industry is trying to increase the influence or disregard critical sciences.
This is why there are still researchers that are not related to society.
According to the company's opinion, critical studies would not be published.
Ms. Hilbeck claims that the industry controls security research.
Hold on! We got a Black Hawk down.
Uli Gsell was looking for it, about 400 pounds.
Wednesday afternoon, she was in front of Stuttgart's car with her tube at dose.
There was a manif.
He wasn't.
The story is known: In September, the scavators came and began to demobilize a large part of the northern ail.
Stuttgart's world was no longer the same: several thousands of people have shown against the S21 project, the transformation of Stuttgart's central car in a subterranean car that would cost several billion.
A large part of the farm was ruined when the manifestations decreased on the stop of construction work.
Brished in 6000, 7000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (the coquillier calcaire) of Crailsheim, a tender and larger pave built badly between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor in Eastfildern.
He's been looking for some fragments.
"The stones are licks."
"They don't have to disappear."
He said with enthusiasm: "A modest and good market rock, simple and earthly."
He stated that when he disappointed it to the skin, he felt the smoker of smoke.
He doesn't even know what he'll do from this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell too.
Stuttgart's stone traces lead to an old deposit of ammunitions of the French army in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his stone imperial.
This 44-year-old man makes the trade of old stones.
He purchased all the stones of the democracy occurred in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were conquest or if they're missing in the discharge," he states in his office situated in a hot, which was once a guard position.
He tells that he was subject to insults and threats when the newspapers reported that he had purchased the rest of the northern ail to the democracy company in September.
But he has negotiated all day with the opposers of the S21 project.
And he explained that he couldn't do anything to oppose democracy.
And if it happened, then the most reasonable thing would continue to use stones.
About 200 opposites of the S21 project were then imported one of the weighted stone parallelepied in average 80 kilograms, with the value between 6,50 and 14 euros.
Some guard as to remember in everything by hopeing that they can also make it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had 500 tonnes, 25 complete loads of a truck.
About half of the forest is still covered in the forest, the rest has been sold for a long time.
owners of gardens, landscape gardens, Particulars.
They came from all parts and carried everything that could enter into the coffee and the ribs.
These steel stones of Stuttgart have been transformed for a long time in "Mauerle" or in limits of herbs plates.
"In fact, this stone is nothing private," said Mr. Rongen.
"in the summer this political component."
He enters his whole car, makes the tour of his wide empire of 20 hectares.
He has done legal studies that he has abandoned, and later he has undertaken to study the biology before he was interested in the information and to become a carriage.
And a stone amateur.
The store is 40000 tonnes.
He loved the treasure all over in Germany.
IL claims he is the largest market of old stones.
He's relaxing.
Sculpted sand stones with art are put on the nest.
"After, they were part of the Marianbridge bridge to Dresde."
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, tell him with entusiasm.
"My favorite stone."
He takes the road that goes through the forest.
He shows a tas of the dog: Red Peter, before, part of the car of Karlsruhe's car.
And so soon.
Little travery.
The paralllepipede was a part of the tribe of Stuttgart.
In the snow of stones and stories, the travertin of Cannstatt from the police prefecture, the red grain from the Holy Blasien Cathedral, the tube from the Heilbronn Hospital.
What a job, what a great effort!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that the stones were sculpted in the hand and moved by means of simple palains and charretts slaughtered by bowls, he becomes absolutely respectful.
"It would be a scandale if such a patrimonie was put into part."
He has not become rich, even less rich.
But this career is now employed by 14 people. In addition, stones, a sculptor, a forgeron, a drinker and a garden were installed in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's gratifying," states the recycle of waste.
Nevertheless, he must get to Cologne.
There are stones to save.
Trust of talents to conquer high potentials
The compound knows a life-friendy.
16 students are bosculated to buy small bread at the saumon, tomate skin and white-managers.
The technical university of Braunschweig and the Volkswagen car manufacturer invited students in design and mechanical genius to a workshop.
In the context of a kind of ideas, they must talk about the future's car with VW designers and, through, know the solid Volkswagen.
Today, many enterprises do not have to go to the body to the competition to make better brains and to join themselves, such as Volkswagen, in a multiform cooperation with universities.
Their mission: to recognise the most affordable diplomas as far as possible in the amphitheatres before the latter arrive on the employment market and to be cut by others.
And since universities do not publish statements on performance of their students, it is tried to make exceptional talents in practice projects and to fidelize them.
On the second day of the workshop organized at the Technical University of Brauschweig, the Amadou motor group has talents.
A young lady of the staff service shares the styles, bonbons and cards including the Volkswagen logo.
She speaks of the calendar of professional stages and jobs students to youth talents; she shows their ways to access the group's pregnancy.
It's Nico Selle of the Braunschweig Technology University that is responsible for the project launched with Volkswagen.
For him, there are recital advantages for both parties: "Studes are in contact with this industrial sector and winning experience."
"When the Volkswagen group, he can know students, look closer to the serious candidates and appreciate those who enter into the online as a collaborator."
According to M. Selle, such cooperation is inhabited.
What's again, it's the oppressive with which students are looking for.
"Another time, the focus was made on the professional project,” said Mr. Selle.
The struggle for the competition of new diplomas will become more intense.
In the goods of the sector, businesses can no longer recruit their collaborators by performing a tri on a candidate cirry.
But they must benefit from their reliability and, in particular, cut the high-qualified hand.
This is especially the diplomates of engineering subsidies that are in a excellent position to be negotiated.
According to the association of German technicians, more than 40,000 engineers have remained unclean in October.
And according to VDI's previsions, the empty Engineering positions will still grow.
Roman Dykta's heading to talents for the account of KPMG, audit office, accounting expertise and advice.
It organizes costly events for the recruitment of talents, such as the crossing course of KPMG-Race, a type of rallye-papier where competitioners need to find their way through GPS coordinated.
The company will thus send eight promising students in the next year so that the United States will so come.
Participants can accessively visit KPMG's branches and know the company.
The person who must participate is decided to advance after two selection procedures.
Only the creation of many candidates will take place for the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the means used to search for high potential in universities are more important.
"We want to escape the lot thanks to the crossing course."
"For us, a simple crocier was too little."
For the talent chaster, Mr. Dykta, the account seems to be there.
"Together, we have remained in contact with all people who have taken part of the last year to a similar action."
"Child of them are on the point of finishing their studies and want to address their requests to our company immediately." He states.
Out of the direct adjustment carried out in the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises act in a very classical way by participating in professional fires where they are delivered to brain chase.
"We are trying to reach diplomas by participating in professional salons."
"For example, at the sun-based technologie Hall," Mrs. Sitha Stübe, director of Human Resources at Solarworld, manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
This company is installed in Bonn employed by about 1500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stube has known the problem with the reception.
Currently, 35 posts are placed on the company's website.
"In this moment, it's very difficult to get vacant posts."
"That cost costs and takes a lot of time," is it?
Another way to establish contact is to pass through university teachers.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, for example, the University of Fribourg.
"Professional teachers indicate that the student has the opportunity to perform vocational stages or to write his project of finish at our home."
Average advertising campaigns are announced in the Solar Specialists.
This is why the company is trying to make its advertising by employing other qualities: personalized ambience, plate heritage and easy communication.
"A great group cannot do this," supports Mrs. Stübe, Chief of Personal.
For a long time the money has no longer played the main role in employment search.
Flexible working hours, child guard or good promotion opportunities are the other determinant factors.
According to a study conducted by the Institute Great Place to Work, Solarworld operates the 55th place among the 100 best employees in Germany.
The institution is a annual honor table of German employers.
In this regard, it interviews collaborators on their degree of satisfaction in respect of their work and its context while considering the framework conditions of employees.
The Chief of Personal Ms. Stube hopes that this placement will enable the company's image to be improved by employees.
"I think that candidates are addressed primarily to external assessments on potential employer," says it.
Wolf Reiner Dutch Academy Warler (Deutscher Employer Branding Academy, DEBA) advises the companies who want to build a good reputation as employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Warler, this means mostly to take internal measures.
"The best means for a employee to become attractive is to pass through his own collaborators," he states.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, namely the creation of the employer's mark image within its own effectiveness.
"co-operators are satisfied with the best messagers."
When they are treated well with their employees and identified with the company, they only make the advertising of their employer at their friends and knowledge.
"It's like we played in an orchester," says Mr. Warler.
Obama with a fresh to the new oil forge
There will be no new oil forecasts in the Mexican golf along the Florida coast of the south-east state of the United States during the coming years.
The Government of Washington proclaimed an prohibition Equivalent prohibition, thus definitively cancelled its initial plans.
Even along the Atlantic coast, new forecasts remain forbidden now.
The secretariat at the Interior Ken Salazar made this Monday advertising.
This is the explosion, in April, of the "Deep Water Horison" forecast platform, which is due to this strict ban, which must remain in force at least for the next five years.
In the case of this accident, which costs the life of 11 employees and led to the largest environmental disaster of the United States, President Barack Obama, who was subject to the pressure of the opposition and the activity sector, had indicated that he was willing to authorize the realization of new forests in the eastern part of the Mexico Golf.
Participants of this solution thus want to reduce the dependence of the United States in respect of foreign countries in terms of oil supply.
The question of knowing the responsibilities of the devastating black margin in the golf is not, until this day, definitely resolved.
The British oil group, which is compared to applications for several billions, is located in the centre of accused accusations.
A investigation committee established by Obama should submit its current conclusions in December.
In October, the secretariat at the Internal Ken Salazar had taken the glass of the decreed forecast after the explosion of the platform.
Following this decision, various oil groups had immediately submitted requests for new forage projects.
With more strict control measures and severe security consignments, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new disaster.
The competent supervisory authority, which has been discredited after many corruption accused, is currently subject to deep reforms.
Similarly, Mr. Obama announced that they would eliminate fiscal winners from gas and oil groups.
The actors of this sector are now publicly maintaining the fact that the density of food in the golf would be clearly lower than that until now.
"The Government's goal is to make a fresh growth in the gas and oil sector" according to the result of a current examination carried out in the sector by the BDO Audit Office before the mercredied forge prohibition.
Moreover, American Energy Alliance regrets the incertitude that characterizes this sector: "It is not aware of what will change exactly with regulation."
Investments granted in new support projects have been reported to new order, detrimental growth.
The Ogoni country is sec
The water that flows in the rivers is burn oil; it gives a similar ear to that in the origin station: because of a fleet, billions of green oil litres destroyed the Ogoni country in Nigeria.
Men live from flight, corruption and oil raffinage.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Do not smell," launchs the ecological warrior to journalists to calm them: "You are still enough of oil in front of the water lens."
The Nigerian of 37 years has tried to photograph a young man swimming water to the swimming water, as well as the sweet fat that around it: This scene seems almost beautiful in the water flat to the color of the skin.
It can't be seen that the sub-sol restricts breast oil snakes.
On the river of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom tells her that she collected grains by seals all here.
But within the time the calm waters have completely tariving.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil jailed by a oleoduc that was explosed in the marble.
Fishermen in the small neighbourhood of Bodo must now ride for six hours to reach fishing water: The Ogoni country located in the heart of the Delta del Niger is considered as one of the most polluted regions in the world.
All the extensive expansion of the ravages slows at the eye when the swimming shoes are passed through water courses.
Instead of a clear water, the motor ship feed a swimming water. Whoever puts his hand to remove all oil recovery.
The small roots of the manrove emerge from the ground as religious batons. The isolated palms are tragicly painting their palms.
It is just looking for bird clouds, as normally meets in the humid areas: Since the motor is stopped, a fantastic silence is cut on this paradise of an ancient paradise, which is like a service station by the hot.
"What happens here is a war against the environment," Mr. Celestine Akpobari says of a tragic air: "Our life is characterized by a permanent danger in health."
The comparison of wars is done.
The region where the Ogoni lives is a battle camp for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first European operators have been here; the first resistance was organized in 1980 by the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. This was later executed. In 1993, the Shell Group had to interrupte its production activities in this region because they were very dangerous for its employees.
Today, return to the Ogoni country is banned to this company: while more than 2 million black gold bars are daily pomped by over 5000 pounds of forecast and 7000 kilometers of olive oil throughout the Delta region, three times large as Switzerland, the Ogoni oil fields are inexplosive because the situation is too instable for this oil group.
All the hundreds of meters strike into the waters of the steel sculptures as weird sculptures: It is very affectedly designated by "Nature's trees" the heads of foreage horses.
They have up to 50 years, most of them are rolled by corrosion until the retreat.
Akpobari believes that a forgery head of this nature slows time in skin, because a constant green oil floor in the water.
According to the expert estimates, more than two billion litres have been on the ecosystem in 50 years: each year, the amount of oil is equal to that in the sea when the super-ocean "Exxon Valdez" accident was 21 years ago along the Alaska, one of the largest environmental disasters in the history of humanity.
Who must take the responsibility of the persistent environmental pollution? The answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell Group, the saotage and the syphony of oleodics are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution. Environmentalists consider the explosions of forecast heads and perfored olive oil as the main causes.
In 2008, the American researcher Richard Steiner repressed the Shell Group to apply the Nigerian mainly less strict security standards than all over the world: only the cost of conduct failure is "too much higher than allies".
Some forms embark on a place that looks like a abandoned workshop, full of cambous and installed on the free air: they are completely nuddled and covered by cambouts to the coast.
A skin fire under one of the many tons that soon connected to the toilets, soon without reasons on the site must be recurred: a small clandestine raffine.
We're chaining the bruto oil in the tsunami for a few hours, explaining Michael, the team chief.
In the first time, the essence in a receipt passes through tubes, then, at the extremeness of the driving of heroin goats, and it is finally obtained from the diesel.
This is how Michael and his four collaborators are produced daily four pieces of Ceil of 300 litres: "This reports us $34,000 Naira," about $22.
Delta's inhabitants were part of the chronic fuel penis in the largest oil producer in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one raffinery.
Illicit raffiners can sell to a less cost than the ridiculously low of EUR 40 centimeters per litre of Diesel: because they purchase their first material freely.
It is offered by the "protectors" which put the oil network around the country of the Ogoni. According to experts, the country lost at least 16 million litres of oil in all the Niger Delta.
Only a small substantial part of the first provisionly undergoing material is illegally cleaned: the networks of organized crime that also contain members of the high-range politicians and militarys, load the lion part in tankers and the world market brain.
The warrior Akpobari considers that the debate on the question of knowing whether environmental disaster should be allocated or instead of subversive activities to the population or the laxist production mode is purely academic.
"If oil companies weren't seen as intruces and if the foundations of the fishermen's life were not so destructed, there would have no Sabotage or illegal flights and raffineries."
But in the meantime, the relationships of the Ogoni, especially in view of Shell, were so deteriorate that it was no longer question than the retreat of the group. "That may be that operators have other nationalities, such as Chineses, will be better revealed."
So Michael becomes nervous.
"It's a great time you're degusting," announces the oil's open robust.
"The soldiers may appear at any time."
If illegal raffiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be the subject of an arrest, but, at least, they will offer them to the best.
Even soldiers, especially from the northern country, hear benefits like all the Nigerians of the first material.
"In any point of view, this fichu thing took down our country well low", regrets Akpori.
The investigators discover the construction deficiencies in the A380 reactors
A380 expressly suffers a great security problem.
Reviewing a device that has performed an emergency atterration, the investigators have found a possible construction lack that can lead to "desastrophy of the reactor".
The Qantas airline wants to complain to the reactor manufacturer.
In November, the airbus passengers belonging to Quantas had apparently been more likely: During the investigation that she carried out, the Australian air security authority realized that the reactors of some A380 devices had a serious security problem, and it maintained a possible deficit of construction.
This potential deficiency could cause serious consequences: it can cause fatigue crystals and escapes at the level of oil conduction, which is indicated in a position taken this Thursday by the ATSB administration.
She could lead to "the catastrophic deficiency of reactors".
Reactors manufactured Rolls-Royce and equipped 20 aircrafts of the A380 series.
The Airbus of Quantas company, which was urged on November 4 in Singapore, is among them.
The Australian airline has now undertaken judicial progress against the English reactor manufacturer.
She has issued a judicial complaint to an Australian Federal Court whose seat is in Sydney, which gives him the opportunity to take other legal measures against society.
The Director of Quantas, Mr. Alan Cœdès, stated that his company would claim interest-free damages in relation to the incident occurred early November.
Parts have been distracted and the portion surface was damaged during the motor fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, it's the oil inflammation that is originating decades.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced in the world.
Australian investigators announced that other security tests will be carried out on superjumbos that are also equipped with reactors in question.
Security recommendations are the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, Mr. Martin Dolan's speaking door.
The security problem is considered sufficiently important to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency shuttle of his aircraft, the airline Quantas had reserved the entire A380 fleet for a week.
Singapore Airlines temporaryly realized three of its 11 A380.
The Airhansa company has replaced the A380 reactor with caution.
The aircraft at two floors is the largest online aircraft in the world.
The neighbouring fall over the whole territory causes a chaos in transportation
Germany's all white copper: On a night, the nest was slept in almost all the country.
The chaos is dominated on all roads, trains and aircrafts are immobilized.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
The winter makes swimming in Germany: By glass temperatures, almost all the Republic is sneaking in the Tuesday night, which leads to the chaos in many places.
In the north and eastern, the neighbouring cover reaches 15 centimeters per place.
The circulation is strongly limited on several authorisations and on many roads.
On the national A7 in Flensburg, winter service staff worked permanently, but they couldn't come out of the nest that was left to accumulate.
Furthermore, raw violence has swimmed the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office of Maritime Navigation and Hydrographic Navigation (DSH) expected that the marine race was the Baltic Coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels that can reach 1.2 m above normally.
The neighborhoods on the authors and the federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxe.
This is why the Meteomedia Meteomedia Warning Center announced the weakest warning level was announced in Switzerland: in fact it is the highest level.
By places, there was 30 centimeters of fresh neighborhood that the strong winds and cost dispersed.
several cars and cars have remained in the night.
Even in the country of Saxe-Anhalt, police authorities have announced serious disorders on roads.
On the A2 car, the snow and the wind interrupted the movement and caused legs.
In Thuringe, neighbors touched the authors A4 and A9.
According to the German Bahn, there were serious perturbations in the train traffic in Saxe, Saxe-Anhalt, Thuringe and the north of Bavière.
The main problems are: the snow on the iron roads, the trees dropped on the fertile roads, the caterings or the destroyed snakes.
In Saxe, interregional Leipzig-Nuremberg was to break.
In Sallfeld, Thuringe, a ICE train on destination of Munich had to interrupte his journey.
The pompiers and paramedicals had to supply the 165 passengers of the train in captures, food and drinks.
Near winds swimmed the roads.
The neighbouring Chauchers have led many flight cancellations in the main airports of Germany.
According to a standard port and flight information, some cancels are already announced in Munich.
A Fraport's talking port indicates that 40 flights have already been cancelled in Francfort on the Main.
The winter service and ensures a permanent service.
It is true that passengers in the airport are not much more, despite that at least 400 beds have been placed there.
Until midnight, accidents were produced on many roads.
On the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost life during a collision with a train at a level.
The train driver was slightly blessed.
Because of the neighbors present on the roads, a similar accident was not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was awarded at a level passenger because the vehicle was immobilised there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were blessed in the train, so the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until morning.
Furthermore, a 30-year-old woman died when his car took tonne on a shocking shock in Aucciburg.
However, meteorologists announce a good news: Nest will always be sweet and swimming, but it will turn to swimming in cases of raw lighters.
But the wind's going to fail.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by violent and fast winds.
However, it is very cold, at least 15 degrees per place.
German Bank is looking for a buyer for its jumelles tours.
The German Bank is trying to separate its emblem: According to the information reported by journals, this financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings situated in the Francfort seat.
This building could report up to 500 million euros.
The German Bank has just been shocking the group's headquarters: the juvenile tours in the businessquarter have been modernized; while waiting, bankers had to return to their former service location.
Dorénavant, the financial group clearly seeks to recover renewal costs and is looking for a buyer for its two buildings, such as the Financial Times Germany newspaper.
This speaker has not indicated the reasons for the sale planned.
He said "we are more interesting to take care of the buildings or to sell them, and to restore them again in post-local location."
This is how the largest financial institution in Germany has already ceased its seat, a few days later.
It was only in the medium of 2007 that the bank had purchased the juvenile tours for a amount of 272 million euros with own fund holders, and then reabled them.
Transformations for energy optimising have, according to certain indications, involved about 200 million euros.
Of course, a sale would report a lot of money to the bank.
According to the information provided by the newspaper, experts in this activity sector consider the value of the tours rebapted between "All green" and about 500 million euros.
According to the speaker, it is not known now whether the buildings will be re-vended to a fund belonging to the bank or an independent investor.
Thousands of people smile the minors who died.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people had a thought for the less mines that were declared dead after several explosions occurred in a mine.
The body was not yet able to get back because the security situation of the skin was still being precautive.
Two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 minors whose age was between 17 and 62 years were seen under the ground.
A survey had been introduced in the cut, but no trace of survivors was found.
Because of the strong concentration of toxic gas and other explosions that have followed, no assistance team was able to fall in the mine for security reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration considered that minors had no chance to survive.
Until the body couldn't be remounted.
Today, parents and friends organized a party in the memory of the dead.
Thousands of people were gathered under a sunlight in Greymouth, south of the Neo-Zelanda island.
They watched two minutes of silence.
In the memory of the 29-minor, 29 tables were installed on which the names, casts and lamps could be seen.
The personal photos and effects, including the clothes and the surf plates, were also placed.
The dragons were made in front of all the public buildings of the country.
The Prime Minister of New Zealand John Key declared the participants to the Memorial Festival that New Zealand had feeded the hope that the minors would return to the surface.
"But they never returned home."
Mr. Lawrey Drew, whose son Zen was assured in the lands, stated that it could not be resigned to accept the death of his son as long as he had not seen his rest.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the parents of the victims, several foreign diplomates took part in the Memorial Festival.
In the first explosion of 19 November, minors from South Africa and British were also trained.
The securits began to escape a fire within the carbon mine of the southern island of New Zealand.
The police prefect Gary Knowles explained to journalists that when explosive gas mass are moved, the brushing temperatures inside the mine start to low down.
Go to hell, warrier!
Is Splatter film an artificial movie?
Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the old man by his movie "Walhalla Rising", episode of the fighter.
In what public, the Danish realist Nicolas Winding Refn can you think about "Walhalla Rising"?
A warrior Viking (Mads Mikkelsen) has only an eye is made prisoner; he is free of his boreau and, with almost supernatural force, removes his adversarys after each other. This seems ideal for young men's spectacles to find a bloody action, just because our hero uses brutal murder methods. When he is a bad humor, he shoots the intents of his enemies without expecting that they are dead.
On the other hand, until the end of the movie, the booking does not say any word on his true name. Even the other characters, at least, are able to escape by one or two words a poor agony cris.
Instead, we are not saying anything and we are celebrating in the unbelievablely beautiful mountain landscape of Scotia, which represents the decor of the Vikings universe, about thousand years ago.
It would be ideal more mature cinema's with interest in existingism and excellent travellings.
When a movie sees several target groups, it is damaged that they are excluded mutually.
The realizer Winding Refn is considered, since the "Pusher", its trilogia regarding the fat and full of style drug trafficking as a kind of Denmark, but it refuses to bring a little more humor to the dominant current or to introduce a little less brutality in art and test cinema.
The majority of the sympathists of the art cinema must test the horrible face of the brain that swallows around and intents.
Action movies Amateurs die, when the guard is shocked, for reasons that it can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries in a ship to destination of Jerusalem; they are slaughtered for an eternity by calm and brume before the equipage arrives in America and continues to be slaughtered.
It is not then surprising that "Walhalla Rising" had found no film distributor in Germany and that there is only a DVD format.
This is especially because of the wonderful images of the poor that meant a certain attention, but also because the image of a palpitant movie, in time to another, is hiding behind a pretensive and bloody appearance.
It is not a dialogue in this movie, nor a coherent action, everything is ambience, a faithful dream transformed into movie.
The spectrum can't escape it.
Ren gives him a moment of detention and slowly cut the gorge with glass images and a luxury sound band, but especially with unselfish hate that shoes from the heart of the persons.
Only a young blond boy, who is loyal to the sides of the guard, keeps a certain innocence, and all others are souled by anger.
More than all, the warning hero whose mobiles are never known, but who come from hell at any time to fight enemy and temporaryly allies by transforming themselves into war, may be sent from the devil itself.
It represents the abuse, but maybe nothing for those who are in any way.
"Walhalla Rising" is a enemmatic film that can be hated or admired, which finally has the acting, enthusiasm and admiration.
A traumatically experience.
Misterious landscape work
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications regarding a nuclear programme developed by Syria.
However, this country refuses to take position on this subject, with less than being submitted to the Agency's controls.
In the night of 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four F-15 I Israeli chair planes attacked a mysterious building in the Syrian territory.
It is located on the river of the Euphrates; the largest city nearby is 30 kilometers (30 km) away: Dair as-Sur.
His name is found in the IAEA documents, since it is questioned of the reactor that Syria has built it appears with the help of the North Korea in a stone paralelepide, which is dissimpulled in a valle marked by the absence of electric path.
According to a letter from the United States Information Services, the current reactor, known under the name of the neighborhood, El-Kibar, would be able to produce plutonium, which would allow atomic weapons to produce.
However, this technique is valid since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation video that includes fluid satellite images.
Through the computer's animation, it indicated the probable location of each component of the reactor before the destruction of the central, which represents a miniature of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon Nuclear Central.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the building located nearby, or inside it.
It seems that the reactor was on the point of serving, but it was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, more than three years after Israeli bombing, there are more information available than at the time, and even, with the time the mystery is increasingly disappeared.
The former President of the United States George W. Bush recently revealed in his memories before this attack, the CIA was certain that Syria had built a reactor to the Kibar, but had few indexes shown by this country developed "a active nuclear weapons programme".
Some information agents in Europe prefer to be more careful about this and only talk about a 'reactor', even if they consider the CIA' presentation as "plauable".
He lacks evidence to them, as well as to IAEA.
Questioned on the way he assures that it has been issued with a nuclear reactor, a high-ranging diploma of the United Nations was only given a Latin response by claiming that IAEA had " sufficient documents to address questions".
The Syrians certainly removed the decombres of the "unused military building" and processed with a methodic planning of the field.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts conducted by the former Inspector, Ole Heinonen, has found the Kibar of uranium traces produced by men.
Furthermore, IAEA received a Member State of the satellite images of commercial providers that showed the time that had followed the attack directly. It seems that these are more slightly than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous commander, perhaps Israel, has obtained them in exclusiveness.
It is therefore impossible for IAEA to establish their authenticity in an objective manner.
Syria has always assured that it had never implemented a secret atomic programme and that it had not built a reactor.
Damas supports the uranium found on the site from Israel's weapons.
But IAEA rejected this argument after the analysis of particules as a questionnaire.
Since that time, ladies refused any discussion about this, as well as about satellite images.
Furthermore, Syrians do not allow controllers to perform a second inspection on the El-Kibar site and refused access to the decommission of the bomb destroyed building.
But even Israel keeps an obstinated silence.
Reaffirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister at the time of the attack, recently said: "We will never make any comments on this subject."
This is as well as the investigation on this case has been long since June 2008 without being achieved by a result and that it "develops a serious problem of credibility of the Agency", as recognizes a Western high-rang diploma in service to the IAEA seat in Vienna, finally a serious violation of the Nuclear Weapons Prohibition Treaty.
In order to achieve progress, the IAEA must clarify the existence of the three other installations that must have "functional report" with the reactor presumer.
Until now, the inspectors have no indication of what installations it is here, nor what their function is or what they are suspected to contain.
According to the information published by the Southdeutsche Journal, they are also known in the IAEA respectively under the names of Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security (International Science and International Security Institute) identified these locations and discovered the satellite images near Masyaf, which would be very likely one of the suspected objects.
It is possible to be found in a military or directly side of that; this is exactly the reason why Syria refuses the access of the three sites to IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, Syrians claim that the inspection group was actually a spy that would be sent by the IAEA to sponsor military installations.
Actually, it is an information provided by the United States secret agents that attracted the attention of nuclear inspectors.
IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have made ships between the three sites and the stone paralelepide for transporting substances.
A Western highrang diploma said to Vienna that at least one of the installations could "serve to the production of fuel".
There would not be "no indications regarding sensitive activities", such as the enrichment and retraction of the uranium; processes that are essential for the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor works certainly thanks to uranium not enriched.
However, there are rigorous hypotheses regarding the following fundamental issues: from which the uranium would have been coming and where the plutonium was later separated for the manufacture of the bomb.
It is ignored if records, which could hide high value tracks, were stored in the three sites.
When the hundreds of land loading trucks are lost, no one will have information on the store place.
For IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria has examined the mining of al-Tibni salt in 1998, situated only a few miles from El-Kibar, on the other side of the Eurorate, to see whether it can agree to the stocking of radioactive waste.
Recently analyzing satellite photos taken for the famous magazine Jane's Intelligence Review, Mr. Robert Kelley established a link between those and the reactor concerned.
Satellite photos, however, show that Syria has undertaken landscape works in the three suspect sites and moved with great containers when IAEA began to demand access to these places.
It is possible to be a coincidence, but it has not contributed to escape suspicion.
In the diplomatic environments, he said that IAEA had been developed a plan on inspections to be carried out for a number of months, and that plan should allow Syria to keep possible military secrets. Only the time it shows how much interest the inspectors were in this case.
At that time, Damas has also relyed on this proposal.
For a year ago, if western diplomates in Vienna had not been reported about the destruction of the reactor, the emergency would not be signaled for this case, for example, Glyn Davies, the U.S. Ambassador, who has been known for a few months, which is known under the name of the special inspections, one of the most powerful means of the Atomic Agency to carry out its controls.
The Director of IAEA, Mr. Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has certainly already spoken of "a option to which I am open for the future", but he still endorses.
This means a huge risk: there is, on the one hand, a majority of the IAEA Governors Council and a great number of 35 countries represented there have no desire to see the situation to know a scale.
On the other hand, as the diploma who gives it to think, "If they find nothing at the end."
Love in war time
It's bad since Angelina Jolie did his beginning as a realist.
She wrote the scenario itself: it's a love history between a woman originating in Bosnia and a serving man.
We don't know any more about this story, but that's enough to cause males.
A continuing ruler indicates that the woman, a musulman, has fallen lovely from her Serb bourreau during the war of Yugoslavia.
The Bosnian Women Federations immediately protested. In response, some round sequences planned in Sarajevo were moved in Hungary in the last minute.
Among the time, the film is turned to Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests are still continued in Bosnia.
According to the information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the war victims' organization addressed a correspondance to Angelina Jolie through the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (HCR) and requested to meet the actor.
She is not diplomatic. A few weeks ago, she proposed these women to hold a meeting with them in Hungary, but they declined this offer.
"The meeting must stay in Bosnia", says Hasecic.
There were no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie's scenario said enough about his attitude toward the victims.
The Guardian reports that the Hasecic organization then recommended the United Nations High Commissioner to remove the quality of ambassador of good will in Angelina Jolie.
But what kind of scenario Jolie wrote?
The Bosnian Ministry of Cultural, who received copies from his scenario, granted a touring authorisation to Sarajevo, but it is not known why it was not then arrived, despite this authorisation.
The young author itself ensures that it does not continue political objectives with her film, that it has made many efforts to know the Yugoslav conflict, and supports that it wants to carry out the terrible consequences of the war and to give the opportunity to all parties concerned to express themselves.
However, it remains vacuous about the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the circle movie on the Net. It is quite different: Love were well known before the beginning of the war. He reiterates when the woman, a bosnic muslim, was deported in the Serbia concentration camp where man works as a gardien.
This is also a great difference with the version "A victim of violence is loved by his boreau".
That Jolie's movie began well before the war, of course.
The pressure on it, so Jolie, is "injust and based on wrong information".
Now, only Hollywood's fanatics can offer peace: By putting this scenario illegally in the Net, as well as other previously.
Let's go!

The experts of the Economic and Social Research Institute indicate that 100,000 Irish will immediately leave their country.
They even prescribed a number of 200,000 migrants from 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4,5 million people.
If these predictions are achieved, it will be a currency of migration comparable to that of Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom during which the Irishes played a great assence, the chagrin now takes the whole place.
However, the economic crisis is particularly affected by the young Irish, well-formed, who have not yet known just times of happiness.
Labour loss and social decline appeared absurd in the years of economic boom.

Since six months, Sean O'Donovan knows what means being based on another.
As there was no more to do in Ireland for this 29-year engineer, he now worked with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction and Germany sector.
A mode house just comes from land in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other Hannovre or Berlin projects.
In the meantime, O'Donovan is only rarely visiting her national country, because he participates in an additional workplace, in order to be able to repay the contracted credit to build his home in the country of the country.
"The situation is already a little dignity," he claims by franking his home's floor for the first time after a long time.
"I win the money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I haven't seen almost more."
He shoots a smile breathing through the cold rooms.

Four years ago, O'Donovan purchased the house in common with his sister for a amount of EUR 380,000, financed to 100% by credit.
"That were moments of fool, without doubt, the money was easy," he stated.
Does it be afraid to see everything out because of credit?
O'Donovan thinks a moment, heat the tea and says, "I have no kids to teach and I'm young; even everything goes through, I can get back to zero."
The Engineer of the building does not like the laughing that he often hears these last days.

"And awesome, it seems to be the same worried."

Democratic routine
Democracy support in Latin America continues to increase, as well as the private business.
Crime has become a greater concern than the unemployment.
Brazil is seen as more affected by the United States in a major part of the region.
There are some conclusions of the last Latinobarometer analysis taken in 18 countries and published in exclusively by The Economist.
Since the review has been regularly carried out since 1995, it follows attitude changes in the region.
Two related elements refer to the results of the review of this year, carried out in September and at the beginning of October.
The first is the sufficiently unpleasant humor in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Democracy support has significantly increased in several countries on the nearby South America Pacific (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached a average of 6 per cent per year since 2002, democracy support has been at least 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent in 2005.
It has also increased in Mexico, where the economy has been reduced after a strong decline in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two smallest countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which makes a decrease in the regional average (see table 2).
Some 44 per cent of the respondents in the region were satisfied with the way their country ' s democracy operated in practice; this is the same number as the last year but with a strong increase in 25 per cent in 2001 (graph 3)
Some 34% said they trusted in their country's parliament and 45% in their governments, the same as the last year in two cases; but in 2003, they increased strongly (comparedly 17% and 24%).
10 years ago, the economic problems in Latin America have increased democracy support.
If this has been good during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many American countries have not been subjected to a short recession and have been a strong reprise.
In addition, a social security network has contributed to the protection of poor people.
(The Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the percentage of Latin Americans living in poverty has only increased in 2009 only slightly and has re-educated this year, to 32 per cent.)
But the humor is significantly different from one country to another (see graph. 4).
The good economic performances of Brazil and the popularity of his sorting President, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, are translated by a largely shared sense of progress
What is more rare in Mexico and Central America where recession has been worse and violent crimes have been aggressive.
It is only the second time since the analysis began only more respondents through Latin America in its whole have mentioned the crime instead of unemployment as the most important problem for their countries (see table 5).
About 31 per cent of them say that their own or their neighbourhood has been victim of a criminal act during the past year; however, this number has been decreased by 38 per cent in the last year and is the most lowest since 1995.
A more robust economic performance reflects in the increase in private enterprise support and the market economy: about 71% of the respondents in the region say that the private undertakings are essential for development, against 56% in 2007 (see Graph 6).
Some 58% believe that market economy is the only system that will make their developing countries, against 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the respondents in Venezuela are this opinion (and 80% support the private undertaking); even if their left President, Hugo Chavez, exemption of many private enterprises.
Brazil is the largest dominant in the region, mentioned by 19% of the persons asked (before 18% the last year), followed by the United States (9%, changed by the last year) and Venezuela (9%, at least 11% since the last year)
But the United States are considered as the most influential country of respondents in Mexico and most of the Central America, while Venezuela played this distinction in Equator, Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A cut-off vote
No one was expected to have perfect general elections in Haiti on 28 November.
But it was well worse than foreigners who wanted to help the narrow and pulled country into fear.
Selective boxes and a new voter, vocational vocational vocational pillars, saccaged vote offices and intimidations
The vote offices were opening late night.
Many of the Hatians, including many who were moved after the year of January, were wrong in the neighbor to find where to vote.
Some of them finished to leave.
A twenty-five candidate to the presidency, including several presumed favorites, rejected fraud and claimed the cancellation of the election.
Protections, sometimes violent, have explosed through the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the high official in Haiti of the United Nations, considers the event as “a full choice in a well-related way”.
Observers of the United States and the Caribbean Community expressed clearly that they did not believe that these irregularities, such as seriously, were necessaryly invalidated.
In other words, the spectacle continues.
The election authority, whose opponents are rewarded to René Preval, who is impopulary President, and his candidate, Jude Celestin, must announce the preliminary results on December 7th.
The second tour expected is planned for January.
Every hope in the election is not lost.
The two candidates of the opposition, Michel Martelly, was a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former woman, took off their initial call to say no vote.
But there may be problems if Mr. Celestin, who has little or not perceptible support in elections, is declared by the election authority as reaching the second tour.
With a cholera epidemic that makes rare, and more than 1 million survivors in the seismo that still live in the teeth, it was afraid that the participation would be.
In the darkness, many Haitians wanted to vote, but they were prevented to do this because of the disorganization.
About 250 000 identification cards, required to vote, were not yet distributed little time before the election.
It's important.
Donors see the election of a popular and legal government as a major step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, it's clear, the Haitians do it themselves.
The foot point to the center
The weeks after being suddenly alive, Cristina Fernández, President of Argentina, benefited from a public sympathy vague that improved its 20 points of approval rate, over 50%; it is its highest level since it was elected in 2007.
However, transforming this into a second mandate for the election of the next year could depend on the choice of Mrs Fernández, apparently in a deluge that it would leave or not the inconsistence of her defunt husband, predecessor and former political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And in this regard, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage the economic policy, even after his wife was chairman, had the habit of elaborating budgets that were subject to tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to expend the additional income.
The Government of Ms Fernández lost its majority in the Congress last year on paper.
But the opposition was divided, and the situation was decreased after the death of Mr. Kirchner from a heart attack on October 27.
Some of the dissident members of the perronist movement have been raised to Mrs Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (which a parliamentary struck one of his couples and where others accused the corruption government), the Congress did not approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to discuss me," said the President.
Today, the 2010 budget will be implemented in the next year and let the President further a larger handling margin to expenditure in will.
The overflow economy is wide: it is likely to grow about 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is now 11,1%, but many private estimates and the salary returns of the unions are nearly 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took his functions in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic effective, made a priority for growth and poverty reduction, rather than inflation control.
He refused to treat with the IMF, he stripped the private sector and cleaned the INDEC, the Statistics Office, which made false statistics on official inflation.
Ms. Fernández, can you now modify these policies?
She called for conversations between private enterprises and trade leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit the increases of payment in the next year to 18%.
The economy has been stimulated by high world prices of agricultural exports in Argentina.
However, inflation has declined the growth shock following a strong evaluation in 2002.
This may be the reason why Mrs Fernández shows the signs to want to restore the financial relations of Argentina to the rest of the world.
This year, the Government concluded an agreement with the binding persons who rejected the forced restructuring of the debt for which Argentina did not resolve its expectations in 2001.
Now, Ms. Fernández seems to be able to go to an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it deserves $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners always stressed the fact that this could not involve monitoring by the IMF, as it is cotume.
But last month, Amado Boudu, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund would provide a "technological assistance" to provide a new consumption price index, which is like an inheritance of INDEC.
It is not clear if Ms. Fernández wants to remain in the policy beyond the end of his mandate, now that her husband is no longer in his sides.
If it is done, she needs to win the support of the Middle Class, among which Kirchnerism is very preached.
When the Argentinas will return from their summer holidays in Mars, the sympathy vague for it will be flown.
If she wants to win another election, she should decide to repeal or not, without ridicule, many policies of her husband.
A half horra for China
The Thai electioners are directed to a kind of closer Union with the continent.
What do Taiwan think of his grand brother located on the other side of the detroit?
More than 7.5 million elections were presented on 27 November, or 70 per cent of the admissible persons, to elect barriers and municipal advisers in five urban districts, in the context of what is considered as a general assessment of the President, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma itself has become a substitute for feelings regarding the continent, which have had been linked to innovative business, including a partial free exchange package, in the largest reorganization of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. My succeeded test, but it's all right.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) had reported three of the five masters, he failed to report the majority of the voices.
Instead of that, the Democratic Democratic Party (DPP), which was thought of the full independence of Taiwan, reported about 50 per cent of all votes for KMT of 45 per cent.
If it was a president, Mr. Ma would be difficult.
Since it has been elected two years ago, the vote part of his party has fallen about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP has touched elections, even with KMT in municipal advice.
The event declared most of the main subjects of Taiwan's elections, including camping trucks and mass assembly dragons with girls who had a minimum maintenance.
An obligatory mystery murder has also been pursued.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, KMT's honourable President, took an election tour for a candidate from KMT at the election board.
A man of the people shooted on the young Mr. Lien, cleanly through the face, wounded him and killed a passenger.
Weirdly, it was not determined if the slaughter wanted to do badly to Mr. Lien or to resolve a dispute with the candidate.
In any way, Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, murdered with consequences on the election by directing the suspect on the PDP and turning the elections to the KMT.
Maybe the largest winner of elections was China.
It was shocked to find out how much the question of the continental party itself was absent.
Instead, candidates played with public housing plans and employment.
Taiwan normally played its independence in fact and hate the Chinese military threat.
As a result, KMT has tended to avoid stopping its links to the Pekin Government.
But this time, the DPP also abstend of attracting the anti-China.
It is the answer to a new conscience that Chinese enterprises are essential to the economic survival of Taiwan.
Mr. Ma, for his part, reaffirmed whether his Chinese policy was acceptable for the majority of Thailand.
It can be expected that the Peking Government continues to provide trade facilities, in accordance with its strategy to return to Taiwan.
China did not lose time to send a negotiator to Taiwan to organize a Summit on Investment Protection and Medical Cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see a political integration; but let's begin.
It will be better to wait for this after the presidential election of 2012.
The PPP has been regenerated in any way.
Two years ago, he was worried: his former chief Chen Shui-Bit was sent to prison after corruption accused.
President, from 2000 to 2008, was a provocator for explicit independence.
However, a new generation of moderates has been under the direction of Mrs Tsai and the PDP implemented to address professionals and young people.
Mrs. Tsai was welcomed as a candidate to the Presidency, such as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is in doing his best to show that he can also join with Pekin.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for a expert panel to act as a contact point between the DPP and China, provided that their entrepreneurs could have been held without pre-conditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Thai public that his party presents a "alternative deal of trust" regarding the rapid approach by Mr. Ma about China.
Mr. Chen seems to be exacerbated by this change.
In a declaration published from its cell, he stated that the candidates of the PDP would have achieved better results if they insisted on the fact that Taiwan is a different country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, to not cut the Presidency.
Even without the intervention of Mr. Chen, the PDP will be bad to choose between its potential candidates.
KMT must make itself introspection.
The evaluations of Mr. Ma have been low; despite the verbal economic growth, KMT candidates did not want to camp with him.
It seems to be in majority due to the unemployment and the expansion of the feast between rich and poor.
A KMT's talking port says that his office and its local antennes will be remaned.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan's support for approach is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanians see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a editor editor, "the point of not return is already passing."
Names to Grammy Awards: Jazz Esperanza Spalding's song is a surprise selected in the category "Best New Artist"
Effect on the request of a President, and people are required to know it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist collected by President Obama to take place during his Nobel Prize Ceremony in Peace in 2009, marked one of the surprises of Grammy Awards this year with a great envergment appointment in the category of the "more new artist".
Where Spalding is a very known figure on the jazz scene since 2008, "Esperanza", the appointment remains a little mysterious but is compatible with the Rules of Grammy Awards that a artist should not get out of more than three albums before the recording of this artist.
His ambitious album of 2010, "Chamber Music Society", certainly marked a step forward and, given its lowly launching vocal style, his fabulous pop and funk hand and its Latin influences, is possible to draw at least one line pointed in Spalding with regard to Norah Jones' s successful success in 2003, the most closest equivalent for the electorals of the Grammy Awards, taking into account jazz productions in this category in the past years.
On the other hand, the electors of the Grammy Awards just honored Vijay Iyer Trio's title in the "instrumental album" category, a slipper on a shore that was a record that was one of the primary favorites last year.
Among these yesterdays, "Moody 4B" of Veterinary Saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" of the clavier John Beasley will be in competition.
Thrombone Shorty, favorable to the rain voice of the New Orleans and invitation often to "Treme" of HBO, was honored in the contemporary jazz category; which also slowly slows to a certain fusion with Stanley Clarke's albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Sekretariat of Darcy James Argue, aware of the stampank, gained a few well-known appreciations in the great category; in competitive with the rich chamber-jazz of Billy Childs Ensemble and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose "Pathways" album of his octet was a beautiful example of the democratic hand of this bassist as a group leader.
Name of Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey leading to classic categories
Classical appointments for the 53th Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers of the whole world.
Hence, "Deus Ex Macina" of Michael Daugherty, for the plan and the orchestre, with five "you"; and "Dreamhouse" of Steve Mackey, an electric orchestral work, with three "you".
Among the names who have linked with South California, there is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for its symphony No.4, "Los Angeles", a work commanded by the Philharmonic Orchestre of Los Angeles and opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto of the composer based on Los Angeles, Avner Dorman, is also in license for a reward.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories covering orchester, office, chocolate and solitary records.
A category for the classic producer of the year sets five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The classic album names are the Symphonies No.3 and 4 of Bruckner of the Royal Orchestre of Concert Gebouw; "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" by Steven Mackey of Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrifum - the art of Castrati" puts various artists; and the "Requiem" of Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the class of the opera, the names are "Lulu" of Berg of the Royal Opera House, "Marc Antonio and Cleopatra" of the Ars Lyrica Houston; "Amor de Loin" of Kajaja Sariaho by German Symphonia-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wander" of Rodion Shchedrin of the Orchestra and the Chaosur of the Mariinsky; and "Ivanhoe" of Arthur Sullivan of the National Orchestra of Wales BBC.
Composers that are placed for the Grammy Awards for the contemporary composition Part for the Symphony No.4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionally Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
The Part's Symphony No.4 was first in the Disney Hall in January 2009 in an execution registered by the Philharmonic Orchestre of Los Angeles, directed by Esa-Pecca Salonen.
The work of about 30 minutes is named "Los Angeles" and is sent to the ex-magnant Michael Khodorkovski oil in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was appointed for its solitary instrumental performance with a orchestra.
The Composer of Los Angeles said he had written the work of 15 minutes specially for the interpretation to the mandoline Avi Avital, who played the concert with the Metropolis Ensemble in New York.
"I wrote it using sounds in the Middle East and a large number of North African gammes and rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The Head of Orchestra Peter Boulez, 85 years of age, received a appointment in the category of orchester performances, to have directed Chicago's symphonic Orchestre in a record of Stravinsky's works.
Among the instrumental solists who received a appointment, the pilotists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; the organizer Paul Jacobs, the violonist Julia Fischer and Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year there are only names of vocalists; these are Anne Sofie Van Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonov, Vivica Generales and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classical melang category, Jessye Norman received a appointment for his record "Racines: my life, my song"
The project of the Themecula mosque provides approval of the planning committee.
A project of mosaics in Temecula received an unilateral support from the local planning committee after over five hours of public witnessing, often patienced.
The critics were taken on the project by claiming that it promoted both terrorism and trafficking employees.
But the Commissioners took place on Wednesday night that the new religious center respected the local laws and that it would be strictly impressioning.
"Book of good people came to support him: Christians, Jews, Bahaii, you mentioned it," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Centre of Tempecula Valley, taking the word on Thursday morning.
"I'm proud of it as American citizen."
"This shows that justice supports him."
"The opposition is really minimum," he added.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The meeting began at 18.00 p.m. and was until almost midnight with the most people in the centre at the time of words nearly divide, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper website.
"There is no more than America," wrote a intervenant.
"This is a other planet of songs with Mrs. Freety's dead in the swimming planet."
"Amerika's gone."
The planned Islamic centres also protested in other parts of the country, including the Ground Zero, place of the attacks of 11 September 2001 in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush condemned violence in the Themecola Valley.
Its 135-familitarity congregation has been unconcerned in the Riverside count for years but she wanted a larger and better space than the trap that she has paid on a shared property with a water filtering system manufacturer.
The new mosque of 24.943 feet cornered to the Mediterranean style would be composed of two miners and would be 43 feet high.
It would take a 4.32 hectares site on the Nicolas road about 2 miles east of Chaparral.
Opponents may still call against this project to the municipal Council.
An arsenic microb that tolerates is the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or otherwise.
The discovery of a strange bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of its nutritive elements, extends the field to find new forms of life on Earth and may be outside.
While researchers have discovered the inhabited bacteria here on Earth, they say that this shows that life is more than major elements that have been considered essential.
"This body has a double capacity."
"He can be developed or with fosfor, or with arsenic."
"This is why she is very special, even if she is far away from being a really "extrême life form", commented Paul Davies C. W. from the University of State of Arizona, co-auteur of the report in the daily online edition of the Science Journal.
Six major elements have been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, acid, oxygen, fosfor and sulphur.
But researchers found that the bacteria, found in the Mono Lake in California, is able to continue to develop after they replaced the arsenic phosphore.
"We ask what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. of the University of Arizona, co-auteur of the report.
The discovery is important in life research outside the Earth because researchers must be able to recognise life, know what life seems to be, said Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the advertising of a press conference to discuss, which has not disseminated the details of the wheel, generated speculations on the Internet that the report could disseminate the discovery of a foreign life.
That wasn't the case.
The discovery "to show that, in other global environments, organs could be able to use other elements to act in biochimie and that the whole "standard" of elements, which we consider absolutely necessary for life, could not be set", commented Charles Cockell, Professor at the Planet and Space Science Institute, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of an element to another in fundamental biochimie and biochemical structure", added Cockell.
It wasn't a fortified discovery.
Felisa Wolf-Simon from the NASA Astrologue Institute, who directed the study, chose the Mono lake because it has high arsenic levels.
Arsenic and phosphor are chemically similar, so it showed that a microbe exposed to both substances could be able to replace one to another.
"The arsenic is mainly toxic because its chemical behavior is really like the fosfor."
"The organizations are therefore hard to distinguish these elements separately."
"But the arsenic is sufficiently different so that it does not work exactly as the fosfor; it's cut inside and, in some way, goes the work of our biochimical machine", explained Anbar.
The researchers collected the bacteria known under the name of GFAJ-1 and exposed it to growing arsenic concentrations which it could adapt and grow.
The microbe is better believed with the fosphore but the fact that it can live with the arsenic at place highlights the possibility that an arsenic life form can naturally occur, or otherwise on Earth or on another planet or the moon where the arsenic is more frequent.
Jamie S. Foster, adjunctor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that the arsenic could be replaced by the phosphore was not new, but nothing has never shown that it could walk.
The arsenic was more frequent at the beginning of the earth's existence, she says; so the researchers expressed the hypothesis that the first forms of life could use it.
This suggests that there may be other ways to form life, not only the way life on Earth was formed at the beginning", said Foster, who was not part of the Wolf-Simon research team.
The research was financed by the NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Institute.
The last two flying exposure dogs were found in Compton
The other two exhibition dogs on four flights outside a motel in Bellflower have been found, the sheriffs of Los Angeles' comte announced it on Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two akitas and two gallous borokes - lost march when someone shooted the Chevrolet Express truck in which they passed the night outside a Belfluer Motel 6, announced the authorities.
Two dogs were recovered after midday, and the other two were found at the end of Monday evening, said to Steve Whithmore, the talking door of the sheriff's secret department of Los Angeles.
"The good news is that the dogs are good," says Whitmore.
"They are in good forms."
"They have been returned to their legal owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs were found, in which neighbors were and what circumstances their discovery were.
"A survey is undertaken."
"We don't want to say it," Whitmore said.
"We follow the orders."
Dog owners, Christina Rickard and David Peek, were not able to be joined to provide a jeudi comment.
They have been gathered afternoon with their two Akitas in a refugee for animals of the comte located in Downey.
Sheriff adjoints found the truck and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akatis - Trace, a 3-year-old woman, and Didi, a woman of 10 months - were healthy and except, announced the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and Peek had planned to show regional competitions this week, for the account of Japanese dog owners, were lost until their Monday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend in the context of the "ACC/Echanuba" National Championship of Long Beach, where they were able to present Trace.
Other dogs were expected to participate in the competitions of other tests scheduled in the previous days of the "AKC/EKANuba" exposure, said Peek at the mercredi Times.
South California is one of the stops of the canine exposure tour of almost one month of the couple.
Wednesday night, Peek and Rickard checked in the motel.
They often stay in the words and keep their truck outside, just next to the window of their room.
They brought three other dogs - a chiot Boxer, a parson Russell territory and a bretone epan - who remained with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the Corgis, the more widespread wheel, in the car rental where he would be more fed.
They have a little open the windows so that the dogs can have the air free.
Peek and Rickard reported the truck flight at 6 o'clock.
Peek said they would offer a reward to every person who could lead them to the corgis, with a micropuce implanted to identify them.
It is not clear if a reward was granted on Thursday.
The lion is ready to roll again, the restructuring of MGM is expected to be more than the end of the court’s final blue
After 18 months of turbulence and incertitude, MGM finally obtained the green fire to restart zero.
A Federal Court of New York's Facilities officially lodged the "pre-packed" plan by creditors whose debt $5 billion would be discarded; opening the way to the diverting company, with 86 years of existence, to concentrate its efforts on production and distribution of films and television emissions.
With the Tuesday decision that the plan was satisfied with the requirements of the United States Faility Code, no legal barrier remains before the MGM to be fleet under the whole of Entertainment Spyglass Foundationrs, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, which will become the general directors of what will be an allocated study.
The staff will be returned to about 320 to 400 at the start.
MGM will not effectively escape Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase will not complete a $500 million credit facility for the financing of new MGM operations and productions.
It is currently distributed under the license by the Investment Bank, which is at its own $75 million, and should be financed at the mid-December.
The study restructuring process began in May 2009 when the Moelis & Co. Investment Bank was undertaken to advise the guidance on how to finance its finances because it had not been the way to pay interests to $3,3 million per year.
In August, the Director-General Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former PDG of Enron, and a renowned expert for his work at Crispy Kreme Duughnuts.
The attempts of Moelis and Cooper to solve the financial difficulties of MGM and to satisfy more than 140 research creditors have taken much more time than planned.
After several months of discussion, the parties agreed to put the company in sale at the end of 2009.
Nevertheless, the sale in shops had a few employees among whom no one was ready to pay the amount of more than 2 billion of creditors to the search.
At the spring of this year, the MGM team had started to work on a restructuring plan which, after months of internal dealings and discussions, was finally approved by creditors at the end of October.
When the MGM is officially out of the failite in the next weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies receive prizes of several million dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., who has already obtained $1.2 million, will receive a payment of 9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, who gathered $375,000 per month for their business leadership services, will receive a "success premium" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum are able to re-establish MGM's production, which has not been out of only one film this year, and to put a yearly list of seven or eight films that would be out from 2012.
They also intend to co-financiate two films based on the Hobbit, with Warner Bros
The study must conclude a different loan between $265,000 and $275 million to finance its part in these two films, which must be performed by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who has about 18% of MGM debt, tried to make a fusion of the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies have not reached an agreement.
Tech games to maintain your gift budget in balance
Although the main candidate for the most wonderful game this year is the IPAD, maybe, by the Microsoft video game system, Kinect, the two can make a significant break in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of a iPad, you can buy five BMX wheels to 99$ and that a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 perles classic cordes, or about 48 Play-Doh boxes.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national players - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" We and Walesale Club of BJ - to see the electronic games I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that the Moore Law has developed, the technological game of this year is likely to have more strength; but costing the same price at least, compared to the last year.
In addition, while there are generally less new games associated with websites, two of the most known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin have more offers.
And the buttons games are in increase, as well as reloadable piles games.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Wes, except if other indication.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13 $ for 3 years and more) are sweet games in the size of an Indian cook that sing a note when you press them on the bridge.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second allows to compose a song.
If you buy several, they'll sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you start supporting, you can't stop.
To combine dance song, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and more) is the best choice.
Inspirating the Elmo Live technology of the past year, the 14-pound animator pupe plays a role tour games like Simon Says and can play the lunar dance thanks to his innovating legs with the locking of the roues.
Childs who escape the game uses Mickey as dance instructor while their parents have a lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you will remember Alphie, one of the first informed educational games.
It is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for 3 years and more), with a double shuttle full of questionnaire game cards designed to convert a car ball in a session with self-coortion and a switch class.
If you are missing when your child holds your smartphone, here are three autonomy alternatives.
The VTech Mobigo (60 dollars, for 3 to 8 years) is the least cherous and easier to use, with a qvaly keyboard, although games do not educate as the Explore Leapster (70 dollars, for 3 to 12 years) is the first larger revision of the Leapster game, with a most recent and lighter screen.
No version is compatible with the old cards.
Fisher-Price iXL (90 $, for 3 to 7 years) uses a iTunes type system to offer games and electronic books and is entitled to SD map that allows family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (30$, Hasbro, for eight years and more) is a set of five more painted blocks than a allute box, each with its LED screen.
The objective is to form words by placing online blocks before the time is gone, it is ideal for an imprisoned orthographic concours.
Moreover, games have a kind of online connection.
Only based on their presence in game shops, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penuin.
To buy your child a online company animal from the Kunuin Club, for example, you can get a Penuin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5 for 6 to 12 years) which includes a marked part of a hidden code.
When you get the online code, your child receives enough credits to the Club Penuin store for two items on the selection.
It can act as routine pains or a companion animal played Puffle.
Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and more) is the last micro-robots with skin buttons.
The beast false moves rapidly on 12 vibrating silicone pants in allergic directions.
It's funny to make a block labyrinth to see if it can find its way through.

Advertising a more double side in the order maintenance in China
Tang Shenbin was a place in the city as a city sergeant at the training by severely inspecting her nervous burdens, electing down the orders with a military authority.
He wanted the women of Changguan, who are responsible for the public order in China, feared and misrepressed for their arbitrary punishment and for violence, to transmit a certain impression to a set of spectators.
"Thank right!"
"It's a sweet!"
Show them, said, "What are the beautiful girls like!"
Four girls who had been ill with white gants, clothes and identical olive color pants, were fixed to your guard.
Four of black shoes at house, aligned to the rule.
Four heads perfectly curated because of the sum of hair attached by a blue and white neck.
"Personally, I think they have a medium-sized appearance," said Mr. Tang, with disappointment.
"The models are nice."
More than one government has tried to raise the image of Chinese urban inspectors.

Xindu, a urban district of 680.000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose to make a great image operation.
Since 2003, the district complemented its street police in the urban environment of 13 women, specially chosen for their appearance, gallery and young age.
The idea is to give the police a more sweet, more women.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson could have difficulties to touch the view of this subterranean band of China
And for the reason, the critics will say.
In contrast to the police, these officers are only allowed to comply with municipal orders with amendments or other administrative sanctions.
But Chinese media are disappointing the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, the Inspectors of the province of Hubei slaughtered a observer after he used his portable phone to film them with a protest against discharge of wastes.
Last year, a training manual for Pekin inspectors, cut off and set online, describes how to win the crimers effectively without employing blood.

"Chengguan marked the government," issued last year, China Daily, a national publication, after a second poll on tactics.
The newspaper claimed a "complete cleaning".
The sceptics say that the approach is far away.
After an advertising in October to find eight new women's recruits, a editionary, held in The Beijing Evening News, asked whether women had real tasks, or if they were just a tourist funeral.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district advertising required women, age from 18 to 22, to have a beautiful silhouette and "five traces of the face in the good order".
They shall have a higher size than the average of 1,6 metres or 5 feet, 2 (1 °2) pounds.
Return to 26 years is binding.
The officers said that the work was physically too punishable for women over 25 years.
"This is their image that is important," said a certain district officer in Rednet.com, a almost government website.
"Before, the external qualitys of candidates will determine whether they agree; it is the size, weight, face traces, etc."
Then the temperature and the "inner qualitys" come.
The women of Chengguan are like flower vagues, he said, "Besides being vases, they will have other responsibility.
Zheng Lihua, Adjunct Director of the City District Management Office, does not adhere to this description.
But he noted that higher requirements were the standard in many Chinese employment offers for both sex.
This is the case of the requirement for the order of vision trading.
This means good topic is a subject of debate among the Chineses.
Of course, persons with disabled or set should not require.
"We can't let a person who boss or a boss come to serve here," said Mr. Zheng.
"He wouldn't give a good image."
Liu Yi, who patchs on the Baoguang place near a monastery, is a 22-year-old and has the games cut down with a totally unclosed mouth.

Xu Yang, his colleague to the 21-year-old boys, said: "We are working to present the image of the city."
They did not oppose their mandate to be limited, because they eat more carriage ambitions than simply to cut solders in the rule where they should be limited to their activities.

The agents describe their functions instead of a monotone than a shock.
"It's nearly the same thing every day," Huang Jing, 20 years old, said, who studied the marketing after the work.
"Grande routine."
One of the reasons is that women's agents do not have the power of their male homologs to confidence the goods of the sellers.
They can only threaten to signal contraventioners to their male superiors.
This aims to protect the Sudan public exhibitions against bureaucracy which are common in the whole of China.

Prosecutors will not infiltrate Senator Ensign
Prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice highlighted the criminal accused of Senator John Ensign, a case linked to an assistant of an old campaign and its efforts to obtain a lobbying work for the husband of the woman, announced mercy of the senator's lawyers.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Republic of Nevada, which was considered a possible Republican candidate to the President of 2012 until the scandale around its case does not make the major national titles last year and smell his career.
The office of Mr. Ensign stated that he was very happy by the decision, resulting from an investigation of one year.
The Senator could still be exposed to disciplinary measures taken by the Ethics Senator.
The lawyers of Mr. Ensign said that the Ministry of Justice had "informed that Senator Ensign had no object of investigation and that he did not intend to keep any accused against him in this case."
The Ministry of Justice abstends comment on this subject.
The advertising came as a kind of surprise for many external ethical lawyers to the Ministry of Justice, according to which there would be significant evidence that Mr. Ensign would conspirate to violate federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, emails and other documents, first reported in New York Times in October 2009, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain a lucrative lobbying work to win Mr. Hampton's silence and his wife Cynthia, about the case of Senator with her.
Mrs. Hampton served as a treasury for a Ensign campaign once.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of other political funds to find work for Mr. Hampton, and then he defended their rights after their commitment to make Mr. Hampton lobbying for them, in accordance with documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been a co-operator of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited for a year by the law of lobbying with his former employer or Senate in its entirety.
Ethic experts supported that the inhabited agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, seemed to be in contradiction with the prohibition of the turning door of lobbying.
According to the proof made public, "this seems to have a primary evidence of a committee to violate and substantial violation of the ruling door law," said Stanley Brand, a lawyer of Washington, who specializes in the defence of clients of a government investigation.
While the judge of the Ministry refused to explain the reasons made by the decision in Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethnic lawyers said that the Ministry seemed to merit political progress after a number of high-level reverses intact by its section of public integrity, including the last year decisions to abandon the progress against the former Senator Ted Stevens accused of continuity.
Federal Prosecutors clearly feared to take arms, said Melanie Sloan, the General Director of Citizens' responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a group of defenders who received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This is basically said high-ranking government officials can now take the laws not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, the principal lawyer of Mr. Ensign, declared in a interview that he had received a phone call from a lawyer of the Ministry of Justice and a follower on the next morning, saying that the Ministry did not seek guilty against his customer.
Mr. Ensign's lawyer team had cooperated with the advocates to try to convince them that the Senator, as its office reaffirmed, "he acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had done at the parking.
"I am not able to enter into the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice, except to say that we think they have taken the right decision," he said.
Last month the Federal Electoral Commission decided to abandon an investigation following an independent complaint by the Ethics Group, supporting that the payment of $96,000 by the parents of Mr. Ensign in Hamptons violated the federal election law.
The election committee stated that it had not enough evidence to prove that money was all except a gift.
NV Energy, a major company of Nevada who has supported the Senator for a long time, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton to find the lobbying work.
A email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, the Head of the Office of Mr. Ensign, John Lopez, communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he "marteled" the Ministry of Interior on a question in question.
Mr. Ensign also participated in a dinner with Mr. Hampton and another customer of Nevada, Aligiant Air, and requested the transport secretariat to establish a meeting on behalf of the airline company after having launched Mr. Hampton's lobbying.
When the news of the case had been on the surface last year, Mr. Ensign was accused of his electors and dismissed from his headquarter in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign said two weeks ago he intended to spend a third mandate to the Senate.
By announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his port, Jennifer Cooper, said that the Senator hoped that the Ethics Committee would soon follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and put an end to his investigation.
Senator Ensign is pleased to continue his work in behalf of the people of Nevada, said.
Cheshire's call will point to Twitter
One half twenty of them were being shocked away in the random of the hearing room.
They sent every minute from the horrible witness reports via Twitter.
At the end, defence said that there were more than 140 000 messages on the case of violence and children attached to their bed in a house that was fired.
Thursday, the largely follow-up procedure by Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family, in the Connecticut, should take place at a official end where the judge would imply the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But the lawyers of Mr. Hayes have already posted elements to the court who forgot appeal arguments that may be taken to the courts for years.
What is caused, it is that the intense reports on the process - as well as the generalized and extended use of Twitter journalists - have created a " circle atmosphere ", a very slowly and immediate saturation with fire details that the jury has been badly influenced by the passions of the public.
The request could encourage judges to discuss the question of whether new technologies require new rules in the hearing rooms.
"I have experienced this process; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in the hearing rooms leads to the rights of the person to a fair process," said Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer of Mr. Hayes, lawyer.
The judge, John C. Bleue of the Supreme Court of State, laidly rejected the revendications in the court's last week, claiming that the media were "speakly controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been anointed by the passion.
But this seems not to be the last word on the question.
Appeal courses have been acknowledged for decades that the medianc case cover may highlight issues on the equivalence of a proceeding.
In a sentence of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States cancelled the condemnation of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murderer of his wife, supporting in his decision that there was a " carnaval atmosphere in the prosecution " because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for television emissions and the film "Firgitive".
Some lawyers said that the courts of appeal to review Mr. Hayes' condemnation may be curious in view of the argument that new rules could be needed to manage the means of communication of the hearing rooms, which are immaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of the new media" in the processes of great envergure, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at the Stanford law school who studied the death penalty to the Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitraryly applied.
Professor Donohue claims that some call judges could be intrigued by the idea that the limitation of the immediate communication from hearing rooms could allow more fair proceedings.
The Twitter case is only one of many other lawyers described by Mr. Hayes' lawyers, which may be discussed for years; which delays the execution.
The lawyers of the defence also argued that Mr. Hayes had suffered a prejudice when the Blue judge refused to allow them to test the responses of the potential jury by showing to them macabre photos of criminal scenes in the selection of the jury.
Some Jews declared having been horrified by victims photos, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and his daughters, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old.
The defence lawyers argued that they will also contest the constitutionality of death penalty and that they will support that the judge has injustly excluded one of the jury, which had been critical before the lawyers, and that he has abusely put the pressure for a verdict by taking the inhabitable decision to bring the jury to debate at a weekend.
The Jews have not been sequent.
But their arguments on the effect of the media coverage of the process could be the largest source of interest.
They noted in a contest against the great last month that the case dominated the media scene in the Connecticut and that it was discussed during the election campaign by candidates to the Governor and the United States Senate.
They maintained that the computer media stopped attracting the flags of the case's feelings.
"The daily bousculade of media, cameras and journalists in front of the palace of justice," the lawyers wrote, "is nothing like what has been seen before here in New Haven, and maybe even at the national level."
They focus on the coverage of the Twitter system is discussed.
In the interviews, some journalists said that the claim that the new instances were more incentive than the communications received slowly was a ludistic view that would approve the policy of the Court on the Medio-Mediac coverage of the future proceedings.
However, some lawyers said that the call courses were often affected by the arguments that social and technological changes needed to be adapted by the courts.
The lawyers of Mr. Hayes emphasize this return.
In their record, they refer to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966 which had reversed the condemnation of Dr. Sheppard due to the mediatic coverage of the proceedings and explained that they would call for new rules for new media.
"This business," they wrote, "represented by Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21th century. "
Can citizenship draw closer to the climate?
After a campaign marked by the investigation and negativeness, a minimum civility was educated in Washington this week.
Is this a front sign of true bipartite cooperation to the front or an illusory moment before the rapid return to the partisan fight in the capital?
The Monday Meeting between President Obama and the leaders of the Congress did not have any consideration on the major issues that should be addressed during the "boitful canard" session.
But of course there was at least a political debate on the differences of both parties, as well as on the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, instead of another episode where each camp wanted to mark points. empty note point.
The Public Meeting of the Committee on the Deficit of the President has been also civilized, despite the political differences that remain among members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created a mutual respect transcendend the ideological fossure, but which still shares members.
It is sufficient to declare that a new era of cooperation has occurred.
The two parties are now in a period of mutual testing and testing in order to obtain signs of cooperation and commitment, trying to evaluate the limits of the public view and the patience of the electioners for a renewed party war.
This is why the Monday Meeting and the post-commentary comments of participants have declared a minimum requirement or accused.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicns are too deep and too deep to suggest a rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
As regards fiscality, expenditure, health care or rights, both parties remain at thousands of distance.
However, the election of November had modified Washington at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things changed on your own," said Pete Wehner, a official of Bush administration, now next to the Centre of Ethics and Public Policy.
"It is inevitable after the elections.
The elections are subject to partisan passions, and then they slow down.
That's good."
On some questions, including those on the agenda of the "boitful canard" session, the Republicans and Democrats have a choice only to find a solution.
Bush tax reductions will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of this.
The two parties want to find a way to maintain a part or the whole, permanent or temporary manner.
Similarly, a commitment is expectable to extend unemployment allocations, not only because the Republicns could not allow to give the impression that they are in favour of rich tax reductions, while rejecting unemployed unemployment compensations.
After the Tuesday meeting at the White House, more optimism plans on a possible agreement on issues addressed during the "boitful canard" session with the ratification of the New START pact.
But William Galston from the Brookings Institute warned that a frustrative cooperation on the most pressing problems of the "Lame Duck" session would not be forced towards a better agreement between the two parties when the 112th meeting will meet in Janvier.
Instead of that, he said, a period of disadvantage is likely or inevitable.
"And when things to be done will be done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the conflicts," he said.
Wehner also expressed its widely shared scepticism that civility would lead to real cooperation.
"I consider the majority of what happens between today and 2012 as a preview or shadow boxing compared to the 2012 main event, he said.
The reasons for this are closely related to the composition of the new Republicn majority in the Chamber and the electors present in the tea that contributed to its creation.
However, the Republicn leaders are aware of the dangers if they are too far, they know that they must try to be the higher of their promises to reduce public expenditure and to abolish the new health care law.
These partisan positions are already clear in the first responses to the recommendations of the Deficit Committee which includes reforming the tax code and increased taxes, reducing the age of retrait and reducing expenditure.
Co-presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles chose one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, according to them, imposed the issue of the public agenda in a way that could not be ignored.
But they need 14 votes to the Commission, composed of 18 members, to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they had been ill to achieve the number.
The largest resistance remains among the elections of the group; this suggests that there are tax issues, at least today, few reasons or compromise will.
Galston prescribes two stages in the battles between the White House and the Republicns of the Congress.
The first year will come in the form of partisan combats, since the Republics respond to Obama on budget, taxes and health care; to be followed by a period of larger bipartite cooperation.
What would the cause of change?
The public opinion.
It is widely proved that, despite the partisan spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans always want to see the two parties to work together.
If the confrontation leads to an impasse, as in 1995, the two parties will be carefully observed by the public's reaction.
Whoever will be judged in loss must change the head and find compromises.
However, it would be a optimistic point of view.
The partisan spirit and polarization are now greater than they were in the middle of the 1990s and it seems that there was a larger ideological difference between Obama and the Republic of the Congress that there wasn't then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the warriors of the two parties see 2010 as a simple forecast to a more resulting election in 2012.
In view of this reality, civility exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But there will be much more efforts from both parties to find an agreement field on issues that are still divided.
American documentation distributed describe Moscow as a corruption hair
The city's control is among the hands of a "Kleptocracy" and has passed up to Kremlin a part of the pots-devine and the protector money that she collected, reported the U.S. Ambassador in Russia in a note in February.
The Federal Security Service and the Federal Police and the Security Service are able to explain the high costs of life in Moscow, said it.
They collect money not only of legal companies but also of organized criminal groups.
Each bureaucracy couch - what the first Minister Vladimir Poutine called the "vertical of power" - takes its part while the money goes to the top of the scale.
The service note, sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted by Wikileaks on his website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been exhausted.
She was edited while Iouri Loujkov was still Moscow's master; and he is largely responsible for corruption.
He was condemned in October by President Dmitri Medvedev, but since then there were few cleaning tracks.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who has a first plan-building company, have always denied corruption accusions over the years; and he won several cases on these accused.
In September, he declared what follows to a Russian television chain when he was questioned about a documentary suggesting that he was corrupted, "It's crazy, it's to get away, it's nothing."
The Russians believe that their society is corrupted, according to the reviews.
But it is unhappy to find information reported in a ambassade account; and it is innocent to admit that it would be to diplomates of a foreign country to do it.
The direct link between the Government of the city of Moscow and criminality led some people to the appointment of "disfunctional" and to state that the government was more functioning as a cliptocracy than a government, according to the ambassador's note.
" Criminal elements are played by a " krysha " (term used in the criminal world/the mafia that means literally " toit " or protect) that pass through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) and the procurement office, as well as through the entire bureaucracy of the Government of the city of Moscow.
"The analysts to identify a three-level structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is on the top."
The FSB, MVD and the Milices are on the second level.
"Infine, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lower level. "
"This is an inefficient system in which criminal groups are a vide in certain areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report shows that the FSB increases the money of the largest enterprises and that the police targets the smaller.
One source, he said, "explicated that the company owners in Moscow understood that it was preferable to obtain the protection of MVD and FSB (approximately than organized crime groups) because not only they have more weapons, means and power than criminal groups but they are also protected by law. "
"This is the reason why the application for protection by criminal gangs is not so higher."
The note notes that, although the collection of money is extended, the protection itself may be inequalizer; even those who pay sometimes are subject to a arrest.
Those who don't pay quickly see their business closed under a pretext or another.
Medvedev several times said the fight against corruption, but he admitted the little progress.
The ambassaded's note transmits men's status, likely to be filled with money, until Kremlin.
"On its fight against corruption, Medvev depends on officecrats," said in a recent interview of Gueorgui Satarov, director of the "think tank Indem" in Moscow.
"But he is part of this bureaucracy."
"There is not part of a political class because it is not in Russia."
Without the policy, without opposition, without separation of powers, did it say, corruption is inevitable.
According to India, corruption costs would increase, at the whole level of Russia, more than 300 billion dollars per year.
The country has been classified in a recent study of corruption over the overall perception by the non-governmental Transparency International (the countries are at least the most corrupted).
The dissemination of the note of the American Ambassador, which was done only last night, Moscow's hour, will certainly rejoice in the Russian government; although Loujkov could be burned, in a certain measure, for the Moscow's failures, this could be the opportunity for the Cremlin to show that it is in resolving the problem.
Interviewed by Larry King by Larry King, Poutine expressed the hypothesis that the WikiLeaks documents could be a manufacture and reacted with angry in the proposals that the United States diplomates had released by Batman and approaching Robin's Medveev.
"The problem is the fact that this is our interaction, an important factor of internal policy in this country, says it.
"But to be honest with you, we wouldn't suspect that it would be done with such an arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to ethics."
The old fighters of the Red Khmers obliged to face the past
In an unexpected class room with beton walls of bad quality, the secondary school director of Anlong Veng called the man who built it, the last Chief of the Red Khmers, Ta Mok.
Everyone here loves Ta Mok.
"He was a good leader, and he was worried about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, aged 42.
Renounced as the "boocher" for his brutality, when he was at the head of the red Khmers, this commander remains popular in this isolated basket of former Khmers red in the northwest of Cambodia where he built hospitals, pumps and other infrastructures; and where thousands of old soldiers of the organization are still living today.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Khmers turned to the government, long-term loyality was finally transferred to Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims to be publicly faced with people who participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school manual that, for the first time, teaches the history of the Red Khmers to the children of his former soldiers.
And, in July, a Cambodian court, together with the United Nations, announced his first sentence on a former members of the Red Khmers, sentenced at 35 years of prison, the former head of the famous tristely torture centre of Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, who was better known under the name of "Duch".
Before this development of the situation, anxiety increased in the older fighters of the Red Khmers of Anlong Veng; compliance with the reconciliation efforts and their willingness to reintegre themselves into the Cambodian society.
"The elderly Khmers are red, but they are able to do anything", said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodge Documentation Centre, an independent body that brings research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Red Khmers was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"The situation generates divisions within the families."
Under the rule of the Red Khmers in Cambodia, 1975 to 1979, about 1,7 million people have been executed or died of hunger, disease or excession.
When the Vietnamians invaded and turned the Government of Pol-United States in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army went to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that has been long until the last movement was held in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary directed the guerrilla of their base situated in the west mountains of Cambodia and Jungle, Ta Mok prepared a suite in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-90s, after a peace agreement by the United Nations led to the first democratic elections of the country in 1993, large groups of red fighters Khmers began to defect the Government, culminating with the Ing Sary capitions in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who was headed, was captured by the government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a prison of Phnom Penh in 2006 waiting for his case.
Without their benefits, most of the older red khmers struggled in black poor, commonly in the rural regions of Cambodia, and many of those who remain notalgical of the movement.
Although some red election officers maintained their local leadership positions in exchange of weapons, it is not qualified farmers for low degree and file.
"The people have enjoyed very little follow-up after the capture," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and the reconciliation that organizes public forums in the whole Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are inscribed by the Utopic ideology of the regime."
"They have been higher in a framework where businesses are a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, joined the Red Khmers as adolescents in 1974, struggled in the jungle around Anlong Veng before installing in 1998 as a poor riz cultivator.
"The life under the Red Khmers was good," he said.
"That Mok eats everybody."
But now, life is difficult because we need to be subjected to our own needs."
The current Red Khmers Court also caused concerns here.
The court should, at the beginning of the next year, take the judgment of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another red old minister Ieng Thirith.
The court ' s mandate is to judge the senior leaders and the main leaders of the crime but did not say if he continues beyond these four cases.
There would be more to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The last media speculations turned to Im Chaem, aged 64, former district head in the province of Banteay Meanchey under the regime of the Red Khmers in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told the researchers of the Cambodia documentation Centre that she had supervised the construction of the Trapeang Thma barge, a project where thousands of forced workers would have found death.
Recently, during a tourned night, Im Chaem returned to work in the field near his wood house on pilots, on a land road outside Anlong Veng.
While the sun had long shadows on the deceased herbe, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past in the red Khmers.
If the court called her, she said, she would refuse to go.
"The Cambodge is in peace and stable," she says.
"If there are more progress, there will be war."
The Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defeated the Red Khmers in 1978, also warned several times that instability would happen if the court continued several suspects; although experts and historicals respond.
"The Cambodge must grow a troop and enter the past, he said.
But face the past is everything that Cambodia must do to go forward, says Youk Chhang, from the documentation center.
"The reconciliation in terms of khmer is to reconnect the cassed pieces," he says.
"We have to put these pieces together so we can understand."
The center produced the first manual approved by the Government on the Red Khmers, "A history of the Democratic Kampachea, composed of 75 pages."
He distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as an additional to the historic manuscripts of the Ministry of Education, designed for high schools, containing less than four pages on the Red Khmers.
As in the majority of Cambodia, young Anlong Veng knows only a few details about the Red Khmers, despite the cities' links to the regime.
Touch Valeak, a 19-year-old student at Anlong Veng's high school, said that the new manual helped students to understand a significant part of their history.
But his parents reacted with scepticism when he returned with the home book to study.
"My family rejected many parts of the manual and the court," he said.
"They are misfunded because they do not know exactly how many people will continue the court."
Such resistance made the complex and difficult reconciliation process, said Sok Leang.
But public forums, manuals and courts start to have an impact, he said.
However, the Red Khmers keep a powerful attraction here.
In the mountains of Dangrek, a path invaded by the bad herbs and swimming with plastic skins, leading to a rectangle of black sugar, covered by a roofed tube.
The body of Pol Pot was burned here on a pneumonia after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, a 31-year-old phone salesman on road board, said that she didn't know much about the man who was burned in this place.
"But he has a great spirit, and many people go there to pray, she says.
It was the birthday of Nuom Sothea, and later, she planned to walk to the last place of Pol Pot's rest where she would leave a dead bananas in hope of bringing chance.
Belarus accepts the refusal of its military quality uranium stock
The Government of Belarus announced merry that he would leave its high-rich uranium stock, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this decision is included in the framework of a surprising victory of President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials throughout the world.
The agreement was published in a joint communication published after the Hillary Rodham Clinton State Secretariat met here the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Belarus, Sergei Martynov, on the basis of a security sum.
The United States has tried to convince Belarus for years to reject the high-risk uranium and seemed to have left the horizon in the past spring.
But the american responsibilities reported at Washington Post that some classified operations were carried out with Belarus in the last two months to eliminate 187 military quality uranium books from a Belarus's research centre.
This opened the way to a mercy agreement to eliminate the rest of the material of approximately 500 books, according to a official who declared the condition of the anonymate because of the sensitivity of the question.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of the 47 countries' Nuclear Security Summit, organized at the Obama initiative; where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was useful to offer an invitation to the former Soviet Republic in 2012.
"I'm really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the Nuclear Security Summit 2012."
"It proves that this process works", said Ken Luongo, Chairman of the World Security Partnership, a group of nuclear security promotion.
Clinton qualified the agreement "the very significant, important step" carried out by Belarus.
Obama was engaged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in the coming four years.
Since then, the United States government has helped six countries to switch out all their high-rich uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A twenty-five country did it under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Bielorrusian President Alexandre Lokkachenko said that the nation would never resign to its uranium.
"We have maintained high-rich uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the military uranium and uranium lowly enriched," said Mr. Lokkachenko.
"This is our product... we won't manufacture salt bombs, and we won't sell it to anyone."
"We'll use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus approached the United States for a few months ago; however, demonstrating the interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate the uranium of Belarus, in October, was particularly complicated because the material was slightly radiated, reported to the responsibilities.
It was carried out on a special train that passed over 300 miles to a Russian installation to be stored and eliminated, reported responsibilities.
The second operation was finished Monday and was carried out by aviation, according to the responsibilities.
The United States Government has spent 13 million dollars in its efforts, mostly to replace Belarus's research installations with low-rich uranium; inadequate for weapons.
"A coordination and a minute organization have been implemented to strengthen confidence"; leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, Andrew Beneiawski, who was responsible for the Department of Energy specialized in the Reduction of the World Menace.
According to the estimates of James Martin Nonproliferation Studies, Belarus had at least 88 military uranium uranium books, as well as hundreds of high-risk uranium kilometers this year.
Belarus is trying to remove its stocks from 2012, according to a joint statement.
The relationships between Belarus and the United States have been endured for years, mainly due to the duration of human rights by Loukachenko.
But the merger declaration would suggest a potential renewment.
"The United States and Belarus welcomed the progress on these world security issues, recognized that a increased respect for the democracy and human rights in Belarus remained essential to improve bilateral relations; and that are essential to the country ' s progress and its citizens '.
The government has not issued any objection to the CIA flights
The government has not issued any objection to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners in the direction of Guantanamo through the Spanish territory, according to a telegram of the United States Ambassador in Madrid.
This is shown by the filtered documents by Wikileaks at the daily El País, which adds that the first vice-President of the Government of this era, Maria Teresa Fernández de la Vega, requested that the Spanish executive should be informed to "to demonstrate that they were experiencing adequate monitoring on foreign aircrafts that were through Spain".
In June 2006, following a report of the Council of Europe that accused of compliance with human rights practices to a twenty-five country, among which Spain held a meeting between the former North American Embassy Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "surprised the Government of Zapatero outside the game" and stressed that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objection on intellectual flights above the Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid "to take them to the depourvue," reports Aguirre in a cable.
The titler of the Foreign Minister of this era, Miguel Angel Moratinos, reported to the Ambassador that the Spanish Executive "to give the lowest possible profile, even if, as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had limited influence capacity".
At its tour, in January 2007, the Prosecutor Vicente Gonzalez sent to the Ambassador the fact that he would not block the initiative of the judge to request the declaration of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Department of Defence on the Flights of the CIA.
"The reports do not contain any offensive element, no sensitive information", explained the Ambassador after talking to the supplier.
The United States even showed their concern for the "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German Prosecutors" more than for the declared information of CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will comply with our efforts to maintain the discretional case between Governments", regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007, during a lunch between the U.S. Ambassador and the Minister of Internal, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "if the Spanish judges are slightly sweet of their independence and do what they are considered appropriate," he gave instructions to his collaborators "for avoiding the comments of a flamed rehetoric, trying to reduce the temperature".
The Ambassador also expresses its concern for the action of the PP in this case.
"In spite of its pro-American general orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take part of any indication that the Government of Zapatero has tolerated or delibredly ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the Government of the United States, " it states.
The partnership that was passing to older people was in the network of "acceptable" to be mother
The young girl talked about the child when she was dead and she had a blog, "That's Gallian error"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With that surname she used since she was small, communicated with a cousin and at least one of the friends; the two origins of Noia, the village of the Coruña whose origin is.

And then she talks about a mobile message she just received, "I want you to return this month or you give me a address to send you the child."
She claims, "If it don't please, he leaves the kid with my mother, and I'll take it when I come back," she swears.
In May, she talks about the return to her village, "This week I'm going to go, but I'll stay there until 19, because on 20 I have to present me to a job post to not lose it."
She explains that if everything was okay, she would have taken her old man with her.

In July, there's another post.
When she's the tape, it's supposed that the child, who had arrived in the island on the 1st of that month, and he was supposed to have been killed on 10, died.
"Cesar is satisfied with one side, but he's not from another."
"He's with me and this place please a little, but from another he's going to school almost every day."
She's talking about a move to Majorque.

The last man who lived with her, guarded, declares his regret to feel guilty.
He doesn't want to think that everything happened so she didn't tell her the fact that she was the celibatory mother.

The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that she did not remember how the facts occurred, "and she did not have the intention to make a illness to the minor."

Defence and prosecutor requested psychiatric trials.
The members of the People ' s Party would win 4 seats in the Congress and the CSP would lose 9
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in Leida, Tarragona and Barcelona municipalities.
After the significant increase in votes and deputy registered in the last autonomy elections, the Catalan PP has already mentioned generally because, even if there are progress or not, the perspectives are more positive than the number of votes that this training is obtained in these sectors normally that it receives in the catalans.
Thus, the catalan populations reached 610.473 votes to the generals of 2008, while in 2006, have reached 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC reached 384.091 votes.
If this tendency has been maintained, desired by a decline of the PSC votes and the fidelization of the PP elector, the analysts of this training have calculated that, if there were general elections, the PPP could pass from 8 to 12 Members in the Congress while the UN would also win four (a 10) and the PSC would lose not less than 9 Members (e.g. at 25).
These calculations would indicate that the catalan place is essential for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the population, ERC would lose a deputy - there would now have three - while the ICV would keep a deputy or win one.
But if the election agenda remains, you would be the next one for the municipal committees in May 2011, where the populations may also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemonia in the four capitals of the province and in their relief to the General Council of Barcelona, one of the highest budgets - 661 million euros for 2011-.
As nationalists and people agree that PSC could lose the maries of Barcelona, Tarragona, Léida and Gerona, where socialists would not obtain the majority of their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
In view of the Deputy Republic, it would not be fantastic that this training lose its representation in the capital of Barcelona - it is necessary to get 5% of the votes.
The PP increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Leida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they managed with the PP before the current socialist master Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Leeida, the PP recorded only a difference of 500 votes with PSC, including the master, Angel Ross, remained very good relationships with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they found themselves several times.
People also registered progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
The PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalogne and aims to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passports in Al Qaida
Besides the seven detented in Barcelona, Thailand there were three
The seven Pakistanians and the Nigerians detained by the General Commissioner of the Police Information Commissioner of Barcelona were a jihadist cell that, leading from Thailand, facilitated passports to various Al Qaida groups, including "The Tigress for the Liberation of the Terre Tamil" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the last author of Bombay's arrests that died 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has given great importance to these investigations, as a result of the fact that "campai operation" has "excellent deficit" the Al Qaida's falsification device at international level and "for example, its operational capacity".
The investigators calculate that in the two years of the cell, in which it was active in Catalogne, has sent thousands of passeports to Thailand, or they were false and then distributed to groups who integrated the Criminal Galaxie Al Qaida so that their "contacts" could cross the European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is the only one that the Jihadist network had been operating in Europe, so that the investigations participated in other European police units, including the Thai services, in the territory of the European Union, could have had the following days of similar cuts to that registered in the mardi night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakist Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Sitikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Batutunde Agunbiade), in Thailand, have been launched another, with the capture of the Pakistanians Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Syrian Thaïan Syriana Kijbuming.
They were those who directed from Bangkok the cell in Spain and other European countries.
The catalan network, a part of which was shocked in 2009, was mainly flewing to tourists the passports that satisfy the conditions marked by the "World Islamic Front".
The documents should be named by young men from 25 to 45 years of age, with a validity of several years and without stamped visa.
The investigators point out that until now no details have been found that connects the detentors in Catalogne with the Force of Bombay, even though the author of this attack, "Laskar and Thailand," were one of the receiving groups of passeports flying in Spain and then false in Thailand.
However, there is a need to remember that a few days before the attack was made, Catalogne sent it through a transfer agency of thousands of dollars that have been "inverted" to purchase mobile cards that were used after the integrity of the "command" who killed 106 people.
The police's employed a lot of documentation.
PP requests Mas to suspend tax compliance
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity last night to exhibit in Artur but its conditions to support its investment as President of the Generalitat, which are identical to those exposed during the campaign and which reiterates to give priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philoso-sowriter adventures as the economic compliance that the nationalist leader wants to address to half of its mandate.
The Chairman of the Catalan Peoples has arrived with Artur Mas with the safeness that has reached 18 Members to the elections last Sunday, more than enough to do, since the candidate of Cyrus requires at least one of the trainings that will perform oppositions in the vote of investment.
On a possible basis with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists want to keep in the Congress during general elections, but, at the time, the conversations that Mas has today with the rest of political leaders are catalane key.
And with regard to the President of the PP, to support an investment "eject all sovereign and independent speech", and the economic complexity, similar to that of the Basque country, which the leader wishes to even submit to the referendum.
The two leaders were in common to improve the political device of a very exaggerated autonomic administration and the elimination of the tax for successes and donations.
More details of the Mas's investment negotiations will take place from the PC, Jord Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he was already meeting with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition -, Joan Herrera (ICV) and he will today be with Joan Puigcerkos (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laport (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric claims that the dead have not been due to the "free of measures"
Olot's owners do not remove the possibility that their nurses have killed more than 11 older people in the night.
Geriatric La Caritat d'Olot (Gerone) responsibilities offered last night a press conference to emphasize the damages caused by the institution by the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilme, the nurse who killed at least nine old people who were responsible for the interval he had worked.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, was presented with the lawyer of the centre, Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be the one to be able to execute the accused against the responsible" for the deaths, but "the legal and responsibilities are obliged to take the processual situation of civil responsibilities".
In addition to the social discreditation that the entity could suffer to have not detected at time the criminal activity of the night illness, the great threat for the Caritat now takes the form of an important compensation that the legal representatives of the victims' parents have already calculated.
Joan Vila Dilmé announced that the first crime dated August 2009 and that from that day he did not stop killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight body - old patients of the geriatric - that in many cases no doctor had been able to explore the deceased, but, given the age and pathology of patients, formality had been held by phone.
Caritat, through its director, denied categorically this situation and said that "the lack of measures could not have been at any time the cause of what happened".
The lawyer of La Caritat acknowledged that "in this case there is only a index of imprisonment from any other person who is not accused of it."
The person already baptized as "The Angel of the Dead" announced 11 murderers before and detailed that he had made the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and half later he killed a second grandmother.
In that case he died by injecting him a overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he had made with a mix of sedative pillars.
The Director of La Caritat said that it is complicated to control the access of the centre to the doctors.
Insulin injections and sedative cocktail were the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that infected it, in his desire to highlight internal suffering, used to kill them.
But laboratory analysis will clarify whether Vila has not lied by saying that he had seen for his first victims a less cruel death or instead he burned them into the inside by giveing them back as he already admitted that he had done with the three women he killed in the range 12 - 17 October.
The Charitat does not believe the statements of the night nurse, no longer the number of murderers declared, they do not eliminate the possibility that the number is larger and justify their attitude by the various versions given by Vila in his visits to the First Instance Court and the lack of logicalness in the change of the way to kill after having successfully made eight murderers.
That is why they say that they will remain at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of facts.
ECB threats
Investor's reacted brushly last night to the threat to Trichet's yesterday, which warned that "the markets must not underestimate our reaction capacity".
The different devices closed to force, and the actions of the European banks were more than 5%.
However, we do not have to underestimate the ECB's ability to be misunderstanding and the euro has registered an increment, which is a concernable sign.
What has happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market, which is the same as it runs, it restores, but motivated by short and very speculative position closures.
The institutional investor will late lose fear.
A month ago, the ECB has mentioned us today to remove liquidity measures, and it must be retracted tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
Federal Bank requested the end of the public debt purchase plan because of its inefficiency and elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures and only allowing unlimited access for the week.
After the Irish crisis, we hope that the current liquidity measures are extended, at least until March, and they maintain the sale of quarterly inquiry on unlimited access to the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We hope that we will continue with the purchase programme and that it is even the signal of intensifying.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will turn the excellent market reaction last year and if they continue to be slow to remove liquidity measures, which God helps us!
Similarly, during the month meeting of May, in which they claimed that they had not even considered the purchase of obligations, and they collapsed the markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and continuous.
In May, he announced the Monday and Monday Bazooka that he had already purchased a lot by providing a new shock on the market.
Last year, the trade in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury has issued only 500 million to 5,28% compared to 750 million to 4,81% of the previous lowest.
At the same time, Portugal's types decreased 30 basic points in the whole curve, and clearly reflecting a market feeling change after Trichet's words.
In Ireland, the numbers of the troop of Alied and the Bank of Ireland were published.
The estimated figures represent a short term of 10,000 million and 15,000 potential and have a deadline until February to obtain private capital or will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with stress tests, the numbers are subject to the Assistant Assistance Plan and help to reduce incertitude.
However, on Thursday, the Government must receive the parliamentary approval of its new budget, and there is no sufficient support, so Iceland remains in a home of incertitude.
Angela Merkel modified the tone of his speech to leave the tension before the next Summit of the Heads of State and Government on December 14 in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that shows that we are a Union and that we interpret all the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present last night the plan of action adopted by the Council of Ministers.
Reform of pensions, transparency in autonomy communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment, sounds for investors as Vivaldi's four seasons.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish Bourse has been 4.5%, the double than the rest of the European bounces.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Spain Bank was rapid and radical and we benefit from the surprising effect.
Today there is a key enforcement of a three-year obligation that will be benefited by the Trichet effect, so we hope that it will be resolved with a strong request and helpful to dismiss doubts about our refinance capacity.
For Spain to ask for an Assistant Plan would be an auto-immoration.
They would give us a liquidity line that we don't need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million in liquidity available, the trial compared to March, very cherished types and cut the access to daily markets.
However, the strategy must continue to be the one of the wife of César, "other than being it, to be it."
We can get out of it!
The President of Eulen will respond to Vega Sicilia's counsel requested by his sons
The pestilence does not remain in the open conflict within the Alvarez family, the owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will contest, since he considers "no law", the Judiciary of El Enebro next 16, requested by five of his seven sons in which they will try to make their majority valuation and avoid management bodies of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Alvarez and his sons Jesus David and María José grant their legal batteries for their new chapter for control of one part of the group.
The founder of the larger business maintenance services for companies seems not to be disposed to be able to be presented in the directional organs of El Enebro.
He was excluded from his Governing Board by five of his seven sons who were appointed by the Administrators in the assembly of the shareholders of January 18, which was registered in the Trade and Society Registration.
The Judiciary of El Enebro for the next 16th, convocated by the Court of Commercial No. 2 of Madrid, again opened the tonner box within the Alvarez family.
The remedie to establish the assembly is, until the conflict is solved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convocation of the Assembly.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Paul, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is qualified by David Alvarez as a "desperate recourse for the applicants of his five sons to try, through a procedural argument, clearly violating the Law and abuseing the law, validing and correcting the radically null assembly on January 18th," according to its official doors.
This argument will be the basis that, once the assembly is in place, be contested by considering that it is "no full right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a silence, have already tried without success that the magistrate calls an assembly in June.
The sons of David Alvarez controlled 100% of the capital in El Enebro, a heritage and title company of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
However, the founder of the service group requires the expenditure of 51% of the capital, according to the family protocols.
This case is the substantial question that the judge must decide after the hearing on the application of contestion for which there is no signed date.
Red Bull triomphe in F1 with a secret weapons of Siemens
A software creates real time-time improvements.
Since Red Bull entered the World of Formula 1 in 2004, his history in this universe speed selection was marked by surprise and success.
At the first time, nobody took into account the options of a new eye that came to arrive, despite the falling trajector of the last seasons, last November, at the last stage of the Championnat, they all triomphed the Ferrari Triomphe of Fernando Alonso.
Without down the ability as a champion pilot, Germany Sebastien Vette, not yet the ability of the Renault engine that propulses his car, in the form 1 world is talking about the legend of "secret weapons" which the multinational Siemens company has put into the hands of Red Bull to transform it into a winning team.
This is in fact a powerful process simulation software that the German company has started on the market in 2007 with very distant goals of high automobilistic competitiveness.
Named PLM, this powerful IT instrument was used to create mount chains of the manufacturers of the whole world, energy stations, high-specific instruments.
The objective is to reproduce the product or process faithfully before building it really, avoiding defects and costs.
PLM facilitated the development of Canon photo devices, Sukhoi aircraft or most famous Nissan vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for the industrial division of Siemens, explains the fact that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 has allowed Red Bull to create and execute "in few hours, almost real time", the changes, changes and improvements detected during courses and tests.
Russwurm explains that the ears of 1992 had a average of 10 technicians in their teams that were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on vehicles in each season.
In the Red Bull team today works 180 young high-qualification professionals, which, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyzes and designs any kind of changes on balls.
The leader of Siemens explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all the elements of the Red Bull balls except the engine, which is exclusively responsible for Renault.
Materials, fuel, airlines and security elements are amended.
Changes may pass from the virtual reality of the simulator at the reality less than 24 hours through advanced production systems by laser and high technology autoclaves.
As the unique limitation of this technological perfection is the amount of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can expend as limited each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull installed the high technology plant to create and produce its bottles in a 50 km from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are limited.
All that happens here is considered "top secret".
Personal for this duty of 580 people, including two pilots, Vettel champion and Mark Webber.
The hero of the Red Bull Form 1, of course, is the recent Sebastian Vetell Champion.
Among the largely technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has made its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists whose activity is inevitable and norm norm.
The technician director, Steve Nevey, claims that five years ago, could be said that R+D's progress in the case of cycle cars was 50% of the winners and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed, and technology represents 85% of success, while pilots have 15% of the added value.
Nevey states that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by the information, as "that are unprevisible gladiators".
HP will install in two years 20 private shops with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugured his first exclusive shop in Barcelona in collaboration with his partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of 20 trade networks between 80 and 100 meters from which multinational multinational plans to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will account for this initiative with the 16 areas already presented in multimarket centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Court English.
The Vice-President of Spain, Helena Herrero, gave, for example, the restored store situated on the Great Vía de Barcelona, property of Pont Reyes, with which it has been 30 years to cooperate.
The North American Group has prepared a plan to establish 200 mark sell points in Europe in 2013, including 20 Spanish institutions.
The first open was that of Bucarest (Romania) and Belgrado (Serbia) last week, which was the third of Barcelona.
Gerero did not want to find out the next possible shops, even though she admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
Personal HM systems managed that shopping philosophy will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The Advisory and Advisory Group of North Americans is concerned with the design of the exclusive shopping mobile (with products that can be touched in an interactive manner), which will have an identical image in Europe.
In addition, HP covers the training of the institutions staff.
Helena Herrero refused that it is a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive trade network aims to improve the service offered to customers and KMUs in purchase, assistance, post-vended and even packing.
Barcelona's store includes a space with a world-wide pilot pilot program that meets the potential problems of HP's computer equipment in guarantee.
A online service connected with a technical center situated in Maustricht (Hollande).
"And in 10 minutes we can solve problems that may often take even two days."
"This system is specially designed for the MPEs and users, as large companies have already contracted technical assistance services", noted yesterday Helena Herrero.
Sabadell pais on "boot" a million customers to his rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, the Delegated Administrator of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a hard year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
In spite of this, it is expected that the interest margins will be shocked, which will be tried to pay partly with increments of the committees and the credit price.
Sabadell waits for three years to capture a million private customers, his task to be done.
Saadell has found a way to operate for the next three years and has so far been able to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will take a new director plan in 2011, which will hold a three-year-old ability.
The goal, instead of surviving the public subsidies of FROB, is to win a market account through the caption of a million new customers - 700,000 if those who could get out of the bank, their great task to be done, since until now the bank has managed more SMEs and companies than the particular customer.
This year he captured 250,000 private customers and 500,000 companies.
The market account for individuals is 3,5%, while it exceeds 10% in companies.
Another basis for the 2011-2013 plan is the productivity balance, or that is the same, of austerity, with the reduction of costs as objective, which will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the year.
Many banks are now obliged to fix objectives and to make them public, since the financial crisis has deployed all plans of the global banking sector.
Saadell, in fact, will finish this year its Optima Plan, established four years ago, even though the plan was initially for three years, but the market situation has determined its extending for a more year.
The customers who let them escape the boxes of smuggles will be its main goal.
During a small dinner organized by APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "faciliate and transcendental year".
In fact, the executive thinks that the outcome of the crisis in Spain will be "slow".
Furthermore, in two or three years, it will be "slightly difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental for the survival of the bank business, insisted.
And even if it thinks that the passive war - which penalises margins - is reduced, the risk prices paid for banks and casses for its emissions to obtain liquidity are already moved to the credit price to compensate the loss of margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a factor of credit pressure."
"We have not cut the robin, but the differentials are higher," said Guardiola.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of diversity - see CincoDías from 22 and 27 November.
He also admitted that the tendency of the banking sector now " is to increase the committees", but "there is a competitive framework".
The director plan of Sabadell is based on organic growth even if, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of corporate operations.
It's not just that he ensures that in Spain "we will demand larger sizes".
"That will move next year," he assured.
He argued that capital needs are "enormely increased" and some Spanish financial entity could enter into red numbers.
And it indicates that the FROB can replace the market in the fund capture in the case of new recapitulations.
After assured that Sabadell can survive to the temporary market closure, he reduced the importance of some bankers already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
It notes that it cannot be issued, but, in contrast to what happened in June, it can be obtained from short-term financing through rest, which has reached the crisis.
CECA rejects the possibility of a second vague of fusions between boxes
The Director-General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected last night the possibility of a new vague of fusions of spring chaises and reiterated the speed with which the sector restructuring was implemented.
When the switch-concentration process began, there were several entities that ensured that they would not be involved in this first phase and that they were reserved for the second phase.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation Caisses de Espargnes (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected the possibility of production of this new operating vague.
"I think that most of the fusions have been carried out, it is not possible to say that the incorporation of Cajasol in the Cívica Group is a second stage, which are adjustments."
"The majority has been completely carried out; it is possible that 17 goes to 13 or 14, but all the great processes have been performed under the whole of the Spanish Bank, which has also cooperated much in this operation," said the Chief.
In statements during a small dinner of the Aragon Directors and Executives Association (ADEA), Olavarrieta expressed that the concentration process was "to the largest possible speed and we must be very satisfied in the way that it takes place within the past, not now, in business plans with the Spain Bank," he emphasized.
"The overflow of 45 falls with a average of 28.500 million of assets at 17.500 million is an inequalizer process in the history, reduced the number of entities by 62 per cent to be larger to be in accordance with Bale," said it.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "this has a number of plenty-friendly views on the lenner of the process" which shows "a lack of severeness and sense" because "as the Spanish Bank has been remembering that the period must be respected before the end of the year."
The Director-General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the most strict financial system of all Europe and "probably" of the world and assigned to people who doubtfully put him a "no-knowledge".
The leader said that given the current economic conjuncture, "We can remain very calm" with the situation of financial entities and channels, a system that began a "extremely important" concentration process and "we can be the most powerful speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector had taken a good deal of stress tests that the ECB had performed in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to stay in the euro, but he has established the conditions for the whole Union.
Market tensions caused a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new adjustment methods, which vary with tax reductions for SMEs, the regulation of private placement or removal of EUR 426 unemployed people without professional contribution to the privatisation of 49% of the AENA, the Bajas and El Prat Airport management and 30% of the State Lotteries.
On the other hand, the Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of the former President Felipe González, joined the critics of the lucky chairman Angela Merkel in respect of his responsibilities to delay the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It must be mentioned that Merkel's position is not a mistake in its communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction of the euro's difficult redetermination process.
And there, Germany has a radically new vision of what must be its future, which is shocking with maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
The European Resistances, in Germany, start on the three possible outcomes of the crisis.
The first, a strong, integrated euro by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would leave the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the Mark, even though now it seems to be the fiction science, with a very favourable course of view, is nearly 50% of the population.
The third, a new design of the euro, in line with the German proposals for a greater macro-economic control, budgetary rigorous, amendments to countries that transgress them, possible payment suspensions of one of them and expansion in the private sector of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it is so long as it defines itself, therefore, there is no place for apologists.
First, in 2009, when both FMI and the European Commission encouraged the deficit, the German Government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between the fact that Germany thought that we should do (Financies and Stabilities Plans) and what its European partners, including France, practiced.
The second part of the Central-European country was when Merkel had difficultly longed the decision to save Greece.
Since that moment, it was a ferotic criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public view and public opinion were against Greece's retirement.
Finally, at the end of October, Merkel reaffirms a clear position by requesting the reform of the Union treaties to make possible recovery of a country and obliging private prêters to support a part of the cost.
This position was interpreted as an anti-European, since it has prevented the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although a little edulcorated, has been adopted and, the following months, we should be assisted in the reform process of the Union that could make these measures possible from 2013.
Germany brought a red line that she doesn't believe.
And she said to us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which the euro may not be too agreed, from that date the former operation of the euro would have been completed.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, where countries that transgress the rules will be severely sanctified, they may be obliged to be declared in the stopping of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also support a part of the costs.
Germany notes that we need to follow a severe growth course with high levels of earning and investment, consumption moderation, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive outer loans.
A alternative based on debt and construction, with huge payment balances, such as that who has presided Spanish growth in the years of the tree, will not simply be tolerated.
The movement is clear.
And it wouldn't be worse to not hear him.
It is not only to reduce public deficit by 3% in 2013.
What we ask is much harder.
And what he must not be done in these circumstances is to mislead us.
I hope that the current turbulences will reach a greater tranquility to us.
And that we can enter the opportunity that we have given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero also heard of this form and its double statement (the promised reforms after the Sabbath Meeting with the great businesses and the announcement of new measures) suggested that, despite the critics of Merkel, it was opened the way to the thesis that the order should be put to the house.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is here, and they do not seem to move it.
And among the possibilities that it is considered, it is not possible to exclude a too serious monetary area of countries.
And in that case, Germany can always tell us that she had warned us.
Legislative sport and fraud
The Russians similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate insensibility but not the will to escape a sanction.
The expulsion in principle by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the meeting of 23 November against Ajax in the Championship League has made a lot of incredible in the anti-sport character of such conduct and if the two players should be sanctified by the EUFA.
As we know, a few minutes before finishing the match (which their team was clearly winned), the two players delibly lost the time when they made mistakes to determine the arbitre to show them the second yellow card.
So, as Real Madrid will be the leader of his group, the two players will carry out regulatory sanctions during the next match of the browsing match against August and can pass without cards to the next stage.
Finally, the EUFA Disciplinary Committee sanctified two matches the trainer of the team, José Mourinho and various are economic to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances such as that or similar is not a new practice, or rather often in the world of football.
She is so slow that she is part of the ethos, non-write rules, but followed by this sport.
A part of the debate appeared in the reported case should be the fact that this has been a protagonist team of the Real Madrid entity (which shows the nobleness and honor and in past occasions condemned an amendment to his players for similar acts) and the orchestrated dramatization, it seems to be, by Mourinho, that adds an episode more to his dilatated history of historic and provocator technician.
In any case, the debate demands whether this type of conduct does not expressly prohibit sport principles, i.e., if, with these actions, it is a law fraud; for indeed, they are respective action with the sportive regulation, but they seem to elect its sense.
The question is to consider the type of damage they cause sportive mind.
One of the goods that include sportive mind is the physical integrity of the opposite players, a aspect that has not been put in danger with these actions, i.e. there has no violence.
Another of these goods that are made allusion with the correct game is to avoid that the team of infractor players benefits injustly from the opposite team, which is not the case anymore.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of the Real Madrid players is that it does not acknowledge that it is normally characterized as tricky or fraud of the law, as its violation of the rules has not been made in cached to try to avoid sanction, but their actions were exactly tried to be the most clearest possible to receive the punishment of the arbitre.
They waited and accepted the sanction voluntary.
Another question is the type of advantage that the offenders obtain the intentionally examined mistakes.
This seems to be necessary to observe that there is not a situation of rival disappointment and there is no advantage in the same match, since of course the result of the action is supposed to leave their own team with less players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next match, because the club couldn't account on these players.
Of course the advantage is the fact that players will start the next phase of the Champions Liga without cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, because the team could be eliminated fully and, with this action, the players perform a sanction match and pass to the second cycle of cards, where the suspension due to the cumulation of cards is produced with a less than the first cycle.
So, seriously, it is not so clear that this is a advantage.
Finally, these actions are not contrary to the sportive spirit, which is even part of the adoption of strategic decisions that promote the maximum benefit of what the rules are allowed.
In our case, players did not act to avoid the application of sanctions (this would actually be a clear case of law fraud), but otherwise they have chosen the moment in which they were subject to it.
They took a strategic decision without delaying punishment or leaveing it.
Even though the border between genia and fraud of the law is spread, in this case I think there was a clear case of genius.
It seems to me that it appears because of two factors: there have been two self-explosions and because of how to transmit the guideline to cause them.
The bad caused by sport principles by these actions is not as ethical.
Offensive offers to capture Christmas dinners for groups in BCN
The calendar dictatorship focuses on the reserves for 16 and 17 days this year.
There is a proliferation of self-finances by employees who want to cost between 20 and 30 euros.
As the tour and lottery, when the December also comes back to the dinner of groups before the Christmas, which continue to be the oxygen ballon for restaurants and funeral of Barcelona, but who because of the crisis, you have been adjusted in an offensive price to capture the majority customer: almost everybody wants to cost between 20 and 30 euros in dinner or dinner, coincidences of businessmen and associations of the interviewed sector.
To complete the accountability, the calendar of this year (such as the night of the Holy Sylvestre) focused on the requests in the week of 13 December, with the result of a dinner reserve for the days of pic (17 and 17) and almost nothing previous week.
Since 2008, the origin of difficult times, there are many companies who have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many employees organize them by paying their own pockets.
Everything is the assembly, they ask all battle prices, confirms the President of Gremi de Restauracio de Barcelona, Gaidade Farràs.
The representative of the patronale is now not to predict how to celebrate this month.
"The people think much before booking."
"They want to get out, but they pay much attention to prices," he said.
The case will be well "for those who give good quality to good price and with good service", he adds, and recalls that customers tend to go down with the crisis, so that the tranch around 25 euros has become major in the request.
In a study in various centre institutions, the collection of applications for the night of 17 is observed.
The Soteras Group states that there is a true boom of applications for this Friday, with the intention of expending less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their conjunction menus, with full forms from 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another powerful group, Andilana, with 16 buildings in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Funda and others), has suggested the particularity of the calendar, even since the beginning of November.
"We made it impossible to maintain the same prices in the past year, with menus for all sweet from 19.95 to 30 euros," they detailed.
AN Group, which includes El Mussoli, Attic, Ququ and a total of 23 locals, remains optimistic after detecting a shore of the facturation since the second half and goods, although conquests, business perspectives for Christmas.
Sources of the group indicate that 18 will also be a hyperactive day at the level of friends groups who are famous in advance of the festivals.
To their six group menus, they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predicted 10% more than the last year, instead of demanding more details, such as the catalan wine produced according to the champenoise method.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies, calling again their employees and feeling that the volume of groups has increased a little.
From the Facasarm patronat (including entities such as the Bars Association, Restaurants and Divertimento of Barcelona), its vice-president Enric Gomá, trusts in the possibility to start see the tunnel's end and supports that the reservations are "animated", even though customers are "regoverned".
This is true, hope in respect of festivals has not slowed, unfortunately from whom it pays, it indicates.
The Pakistani nuclear programme generates a great concern in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons to "approximate rhythm than any other country".
Wikileaks filters confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondance between the American Embassy in Pakistan and the Department of State filtered by the Wikileaks port confirms the great concerns caused by the Pakistanian nuclear programme in Washington.
In addition to the clear and wise details offered on the content of the discussions and thoughts of North America's diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, documents show that cooperation between the two countries in the field of nuclear security instead of increasing, "decreas" and that the unable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "to a faster rythm than any other countries of the world".
The particularity of Pakistani nuclear programme - the fact that weapons are not assembled, but they are employed by components to make their destruction difficult in the case of attack - is one of the main causes of concern in Washington.
This is also the embassy in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, listed in a report before visiting the former National Security Adviser, James Jones: "The nearness of certain nuclear installations of the territory under the Taliban attack, the dispersion of nuclear materials with the short and vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials".
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is considered, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferant and a reason to maintain the guard.
"Pakistan has a personnel with strict religious credibility to protect nuclear installations; given the decline of educational and cultural levels, the extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in nuclear or missile programmes," said the experts Yuri Korolev, Russian Foreign Minister, during a meeting with its American homologs.
The new documentation filtered by the Julian Assange port is the increasingly reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the elimination of Pakistani nuclear weapons production.
A post of the Embassy in May, who qualified as "favorable" communication with Pakistan, supports the following: "Transparency is often unreasonable; help offers remain without answer or are eliminated."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a official of the National Intelligence for South Asia, notes that "in spite of the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rythm than any other country of the world".
The Ambassador Patterson also requested to Washington, during a visit from the army leader, General Ashfaq Kayani, to understand "very clearly" to the responsible that "the Pakistan Army must end with the tactic support for terrorist groups".
To Wikileaks' Head chasse
Obama will number a high responsible for the fight against terrorists to avoid new infiltrations.
Interpol emits a red alarm to follow the movements and place in Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complex labyrinth where it is difficult to make sure about the facts.
Last night Interpol issued a red alarm to "locate and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, it is not a traditional arrest order.
Moreover, it is not new, except the date of 20 November.
And it has nothing to do with the last filtering of more than a million diplomatic documents in the United States, but with sexual abuse accused that Australia faces in Sweden.
Moreover, the lawyer of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, ensures that "the police knows where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
On 20 of the international police body in Lyon (France) stated that Sweden was requested, but he did not publicly until yesterday, after receiving the authorisation of the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 Interpol countries received the instruction of identifying or localizing Assange "to obtain its provisional arrest and extradition."
Even though Interpol cannot give the order of arrest of a person affected by a red alarm, many of the Member States, in accordance with the statements of the organization, consider red calls a way free for arrest - that the national police body must achieve -, especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, such as the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is considered.
The movement was unreasoned to the lawyers of Assange, who later published a letter that denunced the founder of Wikileaks of 39 years of age to respond video-conference to Sweden's authorities.
They also recall that Assange has requested and obtained the permission to leave Sweden from the procurement of his case, which is compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, the Head of the Security of Stalin.
"That seems to be a chase, not a legal persecution," denunces the missile.
While the world looks for him - and in Australia his mother defends the innocence of her son -- Assange continues to be found in an unknown place, but he does not fight.
On Monday, he granted an interview to the director of the Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the secretariat of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that it was responsible for having orders to the United Nations diplomates that they are escaped by violenting the international treaties signed by the United States, it should be displaced," he said.
His opinion was inflicted by the Press Secretariat, Robert Gibbs, who was qualified as "ridiculous and absurded" the request for demission.
"I'm not sure why the opinion of a guy with a web page should interest us," he said for the CNN.
Obama himself was responsible for the fighting against terrorists, Rusell Travers, to prevent new document flying.
The test of President Barack Obama's talking port to reduce the importance of Assange is contrasting with the views of the conservators and comments today.
Peter King, the congressist who was presiding from January the National Security Committee in the Bassess Chamber, asked the Department of the State to study the possibility of include Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confidence its funds and to continue to any person who provides contributions or assistance".
Moreover, Tom Flanagan, an advisor of Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to return to his statements after saying that Assange would "slaughter".
"Obama should transform it into goal and use a aircraft or something similar."
A person who didn't ask for apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist Minister, former Governor of Arkansas and possible candidate to the presidency.
"Whoever is in the Government who filtered information is a tragic fault and all that is not a execution would be a too favorable punishment," he said for Fox.
Puigcercuss is looking for peace in ERC with eye clinds at Carod adeptes
The Republican leader will allow the party to vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes more executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcerkos seems to have found the receipt to solve the first internal revolt within the CER, without the north because of the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The President of the Party is aware of the fact that his threat of demission is not sufficient for the adventures of the former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now too diluted that his mentor and that it cannot be absolutely able to give him to his head-in-law that he had with other evident courses.
That's why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new critics with eye clinds that allow him to blind up to municipal elections.
To begin, Puigcerkos announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisers will be able to declare on its continuity in secret.
By voting balls, not upstairs.
If the carodists want to vehicle a certain vote of criminalization to the President, they will be able to make it without fear for the resurrections.
In fact, the head of ranks wants to avoid the image of division and the submission to his person.
In several interviews, he argued that it would not consider to be ratified with half of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "to the Bulgaria" would not be good.
The closest persons in Carod require a little more than putting his position at the disposal of war, a geste that is not valuable when Puigcercos controls the maximum body between the congress.
But since they do not have sufficient majority to force displacements, they will try to accept a road sheet until May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that the direction will submit to the vote of the National Council on 18th.
Its intention is to support Puigcerkos in exchange of the promise of the programmer for the 2011 automn, which leaders considered a safe fact.
The ERC leader announced that "polyphony" affects the stability and that its goal is to make it possible for all the organizations to lay his room in the family.
In this line, the article that the current adviser Josep Huguet signed in his symptomatic blog.
In view of the ideology of Puigcerkos, the title of Innovacio thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange of various objectives" is like it was done.
And he counted five, which he stressed two.
First, "recompensing" the executive to represent at least 90% of the war, i.e., including new figures from the admissible Carod sector.
The second may be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that EC liquid once for all the assembly as a operational mechanism.
He thus defends a reform of the status that allows the realization of the congress through delegates elected by suffix.
Finding with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession of the Puigcerkos team, which has already cut in this sense in the last two congress.
Indeed, the 2008 Conclusion was responsible for revising the model of the assembly in a specific Status Reform Congress.
This meeting remains unexpected, since the internal margin of the last few years did not recommend to address this issue.
Now, without critical sectors in this way, the time could be good to recover and close it forever.

China maintains the objectives of reduced steel gas
The representative of this country in COP16 has ensured that its country has made huge efforts to reduce the carbon flow and has maintained its offer to reduce 40 to 45 per cent of its greenhouse gas emissions until 2020.
China maintained its offer to reduce 40 to 45 per cent of its greenhouse gas emissions before 2020, assured Su Wei, representative of that country to the COP16.
In its first public appearance in the 16th Conference of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei has assured that its country had made huge efforts to reduce the carbon flow and convert its industry.
In fact, in the past four years, his country invested $245 million in efforts to reduce the emission of greenhouse gas.
However, he clearly mentioned that China would not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community in this area.
He noted that the Chinese strategy for climate change is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity construction; construction of institutions and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all these areas, including approval, last year, of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the objectives addressed to the reduction in the greenhouse gases, explained.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, the federal authorities were coordinated with governments and local authorities to achieve energy split goals, effective energy use and emission reduction.
Furthermore, there are various multiannual plans in the course of or end, both financed by the Chinese Government and by the governments of other countries.
For example, it mentioned the Efficiency Energy Utilisation Programme, which was implemented over the past five years and received investment from the United Nations (United Nations), Government and private initiative.
There is also a provincial project for climate change, another for changes in incandescence lamps by economic lamps and another attractive and adjustment.
At the same table, Martin Krol, scientific adviser of the Government of this country in terms of climate change, ensured that China's efforts have been greater than what is thought.
For example, it was exposed that the per capita of steel gas in China is three tons per person, while it is 100 tonnes in the United States; China is responsible for 9 per cent of historical contributions in pollution.
Similarly, it has made unforeseen efforts in energy use, how to increase energy efficiency in the past five years and expected to make another similar to 2020.
Legal Explosion of Spino: César Nava
The National Director of the PAN has detailed that the former panist leader had the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is right.
The National Chief of PAN, César Nava Vázquez provided that the explosion of Manuel Espino Barienstos was legal and that the former panist leader had the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is right.
In the previous interview at Gabino Cué Monteagudo's protest as the Governor of the State, he said that, in any case, Espino's expulsion is a local decision adopted.
"This is an autonomy decision of the Sonra Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to address, where appropriate, by complaining to the National Council Order Commission, so that it is a decision taken within a competent authority," he noted.
On the other hand, he cleared that it was not the time to think about 2012 and there was never on the negotiation table an Alliance for the Presidential Chairmanship.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that national action would be stronger after the internal elections of the next 4 and 5 December where a successor should be elected.
"Cela (a alliance in 2012) is an aspect which has never been on the negotiation table at least for the time, which was an approach to local elections that have succeeded and achieved its goal", said it.
The Panist leader said that the PAN was supported by 71 years of Dialogue, because "in the internal competition does not fear us; on the other hand, "we saved it and make us stronger", he stated.
He said that, uncertainly, the Sanharian Council would choose the best leader/a whose National Action needs for the next three years, so he would give the "to the person determined by the Council".
"I'm fully calm and open, I'd be proud of leave the Presidency office of the party to any of the five."
He planned to reflect on the next discussion by the Party on the previous elections of 4 July, although "that's not yet the time to think about 2012."
"For the time it is to join the Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he pointed out that the three Governments who are taking alliances in Oaxaca, Publa and Sinaloa will be the dragon and will be a reason for observing in all the country, so that there were “more hopes for them, and I am sure that Gabino will be at the height of expectations”.
When the priests were asked to consider the priests of the six years of old President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortar when they were asked on the criticism of PRI against President Felipe Calderon for his four years of government.
"If the PRI think that the Governments of Zedillo and Salinas have been better than the Fox and Calderon; they start to defend them; they're out of 'good'," he said.
He stated that the Deputy of the Federal Executive may make expressions such as those he has done in his National Audit, since there is no ball in the country and less than the censure.
Obama promises the law for non-paper students
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, you call Senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twitte the American President in the social network.
President Barack Obama was meeting today in the national mobilization to support the Lei Dream Act, to legalize students without paper, with a message in his personal account of the Twitter social network.
"If you are agreed with the adoption of the Dream Act, calls upon your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twitty Obama said.
The short message continues to open a cybernetic link with a more comprehensive document that requests the public to contact senators immediately, as the vote to legislation is imminent.
"As a vote we hope soon, now it is the time to listen to your voice," he reports.
The message was released after the 42 Republic Senators threatened to block any legislation if the expansion of tax reductions in Bush was extended and the financing of the Government.
A such blocking, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republic Senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START Treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned on the Republic of the Dream Act and other projects, the presidential port Robert Gibbs said that it is confident that once the fiscal problem is solved, we will be able to fix an allocation for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We are all agreed that this fiscal problem must be resolved before the end of the year..."
"I think we can obtain agreement at a given moment and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The leader of the most democratic majority of Senate Harry Reid announced that he would ask for a "clusure vote" for the Dream Act, reason why the initiative to legalize students without papers could be voted from the next Thursday in the Senate, even though the most likely would be the next week.
The Senatorial Version of the Dream Act or the American Rewes Act would be legally equivalent to 800 000 young people who had arrived to the United States before the age of 16, they remained in this country in the past five years and were accepted by a higher education institution or by the Army.
But partisans need 60 votes to approve the initiative, because they need the contribution of a large number of Republicns, in moments where the participant organizations of the Protagonist project have an intense lobbying to ensure the approval of the Law.
Democrats, most of which supports the Dream Act, have 58 places.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson de Nebraska said he would vote against and only one Republican expressed his support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why the Dream Act partys require the vote of several Republicans if other democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the shortest Republicans there are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and Senator, George Lemieux, from Florida, who complemented his mandate Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch, of Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but claimed that they would not be supported in another case.
Another Republicn who supported it, John McCain, has not defined its post until now.
Although the Representative Chamber has a different version, analysts agree that the largest obstacles in the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With literatures you'll get the doigt on the beach
The second stage of the Language's Pairs was a step in which participants set up the narration
"Sex in the language, I understand it, but... does it on the plage? what do you hope of me?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the language Plains, a cycle that celebrates the Spanish literature, which this time used the subtitle of his question (when another round table was given to the Sexe in the language, explained).
The doigt on the plage"... we put in the embarras," launched slightly the argentian writer to the public, most of the young people who were meeting at the International Eve of the Book of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this modelled table by Marisol Shultz and participated in Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text described in Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz has defined after a great story, with Luisa in the first person as a protagonist who knows what the "play" is, she will be from a doctor to another without obtaining an answer, only tracks in the same narrative fil.
From infection she seems convinced: "Patience is not my strong, she may be my plague."
At the end, after a frustrated approach to the traumatolog that cut him the suffix in the midst, but who explains that the plague is not a scientific term; it is the psychalist that reveals the mystery: "The plague is what is actually open, the symbolic is the cycling."
The sophisticated protagonist understood and concludes: "On the plague, I only could know that it is open in reality and that it is not existing," but convinces that the joy and the pleasances of the language must be very linked between them.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with the two.
Nicaraguaian Sergio Ramírez also exhibited a slight narration that he referred to the Inventation, where the dog on the beach is not named but at a given time is found.
With the touchs of magic reality, he spoke of an enormous famous who touched clouds, made back people who went away or repaird the verses that a damoiselle had lost, a narration that came to talk to the America then, the great news that had had since the beginning of his own chronics and quoted in Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticizes the excellence of the concurrent capitals' narration.
"Cervaants who invented us all (the writers) were shocked by false witnesses that appeared in the stories presented as real, but in another way we would never have contained the history of America with a imagination that had missed even the pudeur."
Nevertheless, he stressed, "the fools and mentors have the best imagination," and here the reality convergent with lies, there is no longer known what part of narration belongs to a band or another, where the fiction literature reaches its support.
This is actually called the 'Carvantes' tradition.
"It's thanks to his heritage we're what we're talking about."
In his tour, the writer Mayra Montyero announced and applauded the variety of interpretations caused by FIL's invitation with its round table The need to be on the plage.
The Cuban-Portugal has put it on the great plague of social violence through its country - and the Latin America shared - to conflicts of trafficking and sale of drugs.
"I think that the good literature, the good poesie the good songs refers to a taxi commitment that isn't certainly premedity," she stated, after pointing out that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment between the author and the readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of this last.
The evening has been finished with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, who also stressed "he must be on the plage of the employee."
He considered that in a world that lives in great speed also in terms of intellectual habits and the control of consciences that turns to the advantage of dogmatics, "we have a small none and behind each negativeness there is a small yi".
"To be the masters of our own feelings and to be the masters of the reality, we must abuse: and nourish many times means putting the dense on the plague and depressing the people who feel very commodes thinking of loading, white and black, in established ideas and unnecessary ideas, and also striving the powers that prefer a world in white and black," he said, invited to restore the sense of writing.
Roman at the chass of his first title
Ruben Omar Romano had three defects in the ends he had high and down in his cart, but he reached three times the decisive series.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end, there are more than two different styles that are compared, marked by their technicians, which are among them a contrast marked by the results.
Ruben Omar Romano had three defects in the ends, he had high and down in his carriage, but he has reached three times the decisive series, even though until now he has not put in the thousand and that is why this opportunity is very special for him.
Argentina ended with comfort with the sub-champion medaille, he remained a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive ends.
The Holy Strategy arrived at its first end as an entrepreneur in the Open Tower 2002 Tour, when he held the rains of Morelia with which he lost with a global result of 4-2 against Toluca; afterward, in the 2003 class, it also arrived in a decisive dual and again lost with the global result of 3-1 and that was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the Vicentary Tournoi 2010, Rubén again suffered a reverse, since his team did an equal match of 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of game, but in the series of penalties he obtained a benefit for 3-1 with two opportunities to obtain the title and finally three of his players slowed up 11 metres and suffered the salt on the result of 4-3.
Rubén lost two ends with the Red Diablos and one with Monterrey, his rival at the tournee, therefore he did not want to have the same sort, he tried to throw off the efficiency so that he can celebrate for the first time a title, even though he claims that the institution is more important for him.
"I want to be champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, not for a passion I have, and therefore I will obtain the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," commented the timor when the one asked him what would be his weak points at the end.
He remembers very much of the last end, of which he asserts that he has learned much, "The only lesson we can believe is that until the arbitre does not shrink the end, we can't celebrate, we are prepared in the line, because the players are also, the last time, with two penalities to take us ready to run and I believe that this is a lesson, before the end of the match can't be feeded."
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which is not worried about it, because he trusted in his players: "We are never trying to reach the series of penalties, are trying to end in the regular period, but sometimes it is not to prepare us, the previous tour has been prepared, unfortunately the destiny made us a bad tour, sometimes emotions or anxiety to keep the title between our hands, he has missed us, that has served us as the slaughter for this end and we hope that there is no more in this situation."
Romano now has the opportunity to not be a sub-champion technician and enjoy the glory offered by the titles for the first time.
The European Union changes the rules for the obtaining of visa
The persons must go to the Service Centers for Visa's Prosecutors before their interview in the Consulting Section, and the waiting time will be reduced.
From 10 January 2011 the process of treatment of visa to the Embassy and Consulats of the United States will change.
With the new procedure, most of the applicants should be presented to the Service Centres for Visa Prosecutors (ASC) before their interview in the Consulting Section.
The ASC staff will take the biometric information of the applicant, which will be revised by the Consulting Section before the interview.
The new procedure will provide some benefits for the aspirants, including the following:
The total cost to handle the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to obtain you, another payment for the processing of the visa and another to make the service free of the document.
The aspirant will carry out a single payment that covers the three services.
The current tariff will remain the same: $140 for a tourist visa, $ 150 in the case of a requested visa (including visa for temporary workers) and $390 for trade and investor visa.
Persons who want to renew their visa shall not be presented in an interview with the Consulting Representative, they will only be presented to the ASC nearest where they will present documents and will be taken.
Because biometric information will be taken in the ASC, the applicants who want to make you second to be interviewed in the Consulting Section will remain less time than previously.

NASA will announce the discovery of extraterrestreat life
The United States Space Agency referred the press to present tomorrow a discovery that will have the impact on the search of living in space.
The National Aerospace Administration (NASA) of the United States will communicate tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestreat life.
The discovery will be presented in a press conference tomorrow, at 13:00 p.m. at the NASA seat at Washington for astrobiology experts, science that studys the origin, evolution, distribution and future life in the universe.
When she mentioned the press, NASA assured that she would present the impact on the research of the outer life", which caused speculations from the experts of other countries.
The discovery could show the theory that there are similar creatures to us and in hostile environments that were thought to be inhabited and put on the table the possibility of become intelligent as humans if their conditions of life are improved.
It seems to be talking about a microbe discovered under the Mono Lake at the Yosemite National Park in California, which lives in a environment that it was thought to be too ventilative for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenix.
In any way, the creature uses the arsenic as a way of life and this capacity makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our available atmosphere.
According to astronoms, if these bodies use arsenics in their metabolism, it proves that "there is another form of life, a second life form, different from what we know."
Space Agency will communicate the real part of the discovery in the morning press conference, Thursday.
The conference will participate in the geobiology Pamela Conrad, which studys the possibility of life on Mars; and Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studied Titan (the largest satellite of Saturne), will be the prospect that its chemical is similar to the Earth.
PRD Germe, PT, Convergence and Opposite Block Pattern
With reforms at the Organic Law of the Congress, the arrival of the 'bipartism' is possible, it is condemned.
The 60th year was going to be installed when the Congress was an opposite block of PRD, PT, Convergence, and Jesus Manuel Pattern Montalvo, which declared independently and the four questions were: the arrival of 'bipartism' in the Chambers.
Before the 60th legislation session, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergence; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, PRD; and Montalvo Patron, "confronted the reform of the Organic Law, as it excluded,
With this reform, they reiterated the 'bipartism' because there are now two people, of the same number of parties, who control the Congress.
These four deputy, at the counterparty of Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, were the only ones to vote against the Director of the PANist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca as a vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo noted that with these institutional reforms it is the political marginality of PRI and PAN.
He said that the following days they would speak to the representatives of PAN and PRI to amend the scheme from a political will and if they do not have it, they will again be observed by the two parties and so will end the opposite coalition.
"Until this is happening (the opposite coalition), it is what I look, because we are excluded, from any decision, they don't even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergence, said that with PRD, PT and Patron there are conciliations and that is why they are a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, continued, that the Congress, after being monopolistical or now "duopolistical".
"This is not the spirit of the reform of the law that there is an eternal bipartism in the Congress."
To begin, this group starts with 5 legislators and now they speak to other colleagues to be more much, the Convergent has enlarged.
Hezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from PT, explained that the Congress is now transformed into a 'busin' between two, making allusion to PAN and PRI.
"After there was only one party, now they divide him between two."
Pattern Montalvo requested to respect the personality of the deputy to give him his place to the negotiations tables.
"If they do not leave by cupular agreements outside 5 which will probably be 9 Members, now at the five we see, separated in different fractions, we decided to join us to find a place in the negotiation table, which is the problem that, in the reform they have made, we are outside and we are not agreed with this reform."
$200 million more for the "provision"
Mazatlan's Majery pays another cheque to the owner questionnaire of the electric material company.
Another cheque of approximately 200 thousand weights for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazullos has been issued by the Mayori.
With this, the amount paid this second half-year to the owner of the electric material company is 1 million 200 000 weight.
According to the Municipe's transparency page, this last number 9258447 was issued on 16 November for the amount of 200 000 144.56 weight, in concept of "contamination of suppliers".
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had said that the Commonity would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the State Supplement Audit to sell a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total of the debt and therefore how many cheques will still be issued for Camacho Palazullos.
"We haven't purchased anything, we just pay what we need to him, like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last Czechs were "reapered" the last quarter of the year: on 24 September, 2 on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and last on 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet published in the Public Journal of the State, according to the provisions of the Act when an undertaking is questioned by ASE, to avoid that other Governments use its services, the Treasury has assured that they did not use its services again.
All this, after the 25th July, had published a review of the cheques that the Mayor issued to its providers, revealing that in March 2008 - July 2010, in the trinity of the Mair Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the Municipe paid by Camacho Palazullos more than 10 million weight, over 42 Cheques.
He also performed transactions with Jumapam, enhancing cheques of more than 3 million weight.
Tourism sites must be treated
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist because of the bad conditions of the Sánchez Taboada tour in Mazatlan.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a cross of the Sánchez Taboada round, the tourist sector Mazatlan asked the authorities to pay attention to the areas and sites that are in bad conditions and design a bad picture of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, Chairman of the Zona Dorada Trade Association, recalled that they had several times requested the image of the destination to be careful and new activities should replace the other that tourists find bad.
He said that the bad state of the streets and troops has affected because tourists are walking and seeing the disorder and avoiding trade nearby.
"Political people know that it means shut up a company a day and they don't know the happiness they were lost, but they did not work for so long and without adequate planning."
The hotel José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist was exposed to the lack of prevention and maintenance from the Mayori.
"The municipality must take his responsibility and avoid that this happens again, how to do it, so through a preventive holding and not only to do the corrective," he said.
"We want to play a own city, because not only because of the fact that this is a tourist area, we must enter it, but as people who have a own place to live and Mayor must change their strategy to keep the city well."
There are other sites that are denied and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venado de Mazatlan.
"Today, because the tourist comes, this is not only depending on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that is self-reserved in its beaches, boulevards, maintains permanent tourist attractions," he said.
"We have not given them the attention that we need and that kind of facts emphasizes something that is noted for all, the maintenance is necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, in the secretariat of Tourist Promotion, stated that the recovery of the tourist sites of Mazatlan is urgent because they are not used correctly and designed a bad image.
He spoke of a series of locations that must be online together with the municipality and be a priority to have the updating city, clean, ordered, and that it is attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Nevertheless, Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural sites and sites that should be ordered first, clean and put online to make them attractive to their ability to add to the inventary we have to make the promotion of this destination."
IP request for results at the Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of CCE, proposed that Members take the great responsibility to be an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations against them.
Mazatlan's business sector requires a generous and free working legislation between the parties and the Government Executive, since Sinaloa is convulsed and faces major problems.
Lastly, 60-year legislation was established by seven political forces, 19 members of PRI, 13 PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of the PT, one of Convergence and one of the PVEM, in total 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations that the new integrates of the Government Congress are a pure and commitment to society and the various sectors that need a responsible legislative work and that the same models of partiality or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos, President of CCE, proposed that Members take the great responsibility to be an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations against them.
"We hope that Members really exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties, because the cotume is that they are doing pacts to ensure their own interests and they are transformed into a carnaval mass of governants and leaders of the parliamentary fractions."
That is why I ask them to ensure their commitment to establish the necessary points that the current Governor makes progress.
"We shall ensure that they work with society and sectors, especially because the people of Sinaloa have given them their trust in the previous elections.
José Ramón Manguar Sánchez, Chairman of the Hotels Tres Islands, considered that one of the major provocations of the 40 popular representatives was to push and add forces to the economic growth of the State, since now the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important is that they have economic growth, that they generate stimulations for investment and infrastructure, and that will in a way stimulate the generation of jobs."
With regard to tourist activity, he asked that the new legislators give him the importance that it had in the government budget to consolidate the Government Tourism Secretariat.
"I understood that it is the Second Secretariat of the State with a lower budget and it is uncompatible as an important economic and generator of debts and investments and which is directly revalued with the agro-industrial."
In addition to the need to classify resources to detoning tourist projects that help to ensure the State and update the Alcohol Act that previous legislation could not be resolved.
We're looking for a king magic
Poupes, cars and bicyclettes, including other games, are the desire of the family Coronado Valenzuela.
For their parents, the next day of the King Mages will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, because their home is formed by no longer than 12 people and a horse.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, Maria Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose the hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will bring them the games and clothes they want so much.
The family lives in a humble house of Colonia Salvador Allend and lives daily because their father has no stability job.
"It's very difficult for us, because my husband has no job, but we sell mandarins and patates... and the afternoon I'm going to make the 'speaks' to sell in the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little.
Adelaida, a four-year-old age, wants a bicyclet or a bicyclet, and his sister Isabel, three-year-old, would like a Barbie poppy.
On his tour, José Alfredo, a 10-year-old years, has been able to have a 'track' monster and for his little brother Jesus, 8 months, suggests size clothes for a year.
"He said to me (Josea Alfredo), "I would like to have this monster," but I said to him, "I'll see, my son," because he was very nice," remembers Citemana.
For the largest children, who were at school, clothes and shoes, would be the ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11 years old, shooted the size 12; Isaiah, 10 years old, shooted 10, while Miguel, 8 years old, shooted the size eight.
José Juan, 14 years old, needs a couple of sport chains, so a couple of the size five or half six would help it.
If you want to help realize the dream of the family Coronado Valenzuela, you can participate in the Cherche Roi Mage campaign by giving a game or money to the Reception of the Northwest.
14 Drug traffickers arrested
A ten of searches were carried out in Estonia, mercredi, in the context of the demantling of a cannabis production network and sale.
Fourty persons were arrested and were faced with several charges.
Searchs were carried out in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in drug production places.
"Around 750 cannabis plants, four pounds of hashich, money and equipment that served for the production have been introduced", stated Louis-Philip Ruel, the Kebec Sürety Portal.
In all, 11 men and three women were arrested, with the two presumed leaders of the network, two men of Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons had to compare to Sherbrooke's justice palace within the hours after their arrest.
They could face accusations of cannabis production, ownership in order to make it traffic, compliment and service flight, among others.
These surveys took place after a long-term helicopter investigation, which has long-term over a year.
"This is the information received from the public that allowed us to proceed to these arrests," said Mr. Ruel.
Some 70 police officers of the Quebec Regional Investigation Module for Investigation, Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphremagog Police Board took part in this police operation.
Indonesian migration may continue without problems
The draft conservator law that, according to the Government, should resolve the problem of the ships of illegal migrants, it is obvious to be struggled while the three opposition partys knew mercy that they could not support it.
"I'm strongly supported on the Charter."
"I'm on my side with a party who created the granite under your feet," said the Liberal Chief Michael Ignatiff, while he was rounded by deputy after the weekly meeting of the chalks.
Liberals claim that the proposed legislation project, which would allow to hold up until one year from a ship that was identified as a transporter of illegal immigrants, would be violated by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom.
The chief of the Quebecois Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also stated that it could not support the draft law, because it is taking it to the bad target.
"We are opposed and it seems to be against all the parties of the opposition, then we will see what the government will do," said Mr. Duceppe.
The NPD ' s Immigration Critics, Olivia Chow, rejected the criticism that his party did not want to be sufficiently firm with regard to illegal immigrants.
"The neo-democrats are agreed to take measures against citizens' passengers and this is what we do through another law project, Mrs Chow," said.
"We do not support the draft conservator law because it takes them to refugees and imprisons children for at least one year," explained Ms. Chow.
The Minister of Immigration, Jason Kenney, accused the opposite parties to play policy and to ignore the will of Canadians.
"The Canadians say massively to Members that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations aiming at Canada and treating the country as a paillasson."
"They are waiting for Canada to take strong measures," reacted Minister Kenney.
The Government has not announced a vote of confidence on its draft law, which would be able to carry out the country to elections that agreed with its rejection.
However, a conservator said to the QMI Agency that the Government would ask for a vote that each deputy who will be opposed will then explain to his elections.
The new unit does not make an unilaterality
Despite the possibility of the creation of a permanent unit to combat corruption and confusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to ask for the creation of a public investigation commission on the subject.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea has not been given last year: Quebec had consulted the Department of Investigation in New York since last January.
The metropole has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, the Monday advertising was surprised by more than one.
It should be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on the Québec Police Services on 29 October last, this measure has never been discussed, despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
There was no longer need to be the wrong criticism on public security, Stefane Bergeron, who qualified this advertising of "lapine out of a chapeau" and of "blocked solution on the side of a table".
The Minister Dutil responded to those who feared that political power has too much influence on the possible future unit.
"You're going to see the result when we're going to announce it, it's glad to confirm."
"We are aware of this problem."
For the Chairman of the CSQ, Rejean Parent, nothing can replace a public investigation.
"Mr. Charest does not want to create this investigation committee, more people think like you and me that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a investigation committee is Jean Charest's demission," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethical and governance at the National Public Administration School.
In order to get out of this impasse, it suggests Quebec to give a special mandate to the general certificator to investigate the collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the general certificator", he stops.
He also believes that Quebec could give the checker the same powers as a Commissioner, which allows him to oblige people to witness.
The creation of a permanent shuttle is not the only project in the Charest government cards.
Québec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to be better adapted to this type of crime.
This request would be from the prosecutor of the Marteau Operation, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the law is not explicit in such investigations.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his colleague of Justice, Rob Nicholson, is presently thinking of some amendments related to this dossier.
In the 2001 Printemps Operation, which violated the motard groups, even if the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 persons were arrested.
Ottawa later adopted the gangsterism Act.
High monitoring ships
several water courses remain under high monitoring because of the strong precipitations that have been attacked in several regions of the province since march.
A terrain swimming arrived after midday, in Shawinigan, Maurice.
Two houses have been evacuated preventively.
Tonight, another shock would be produced in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road was shocked.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, strong precipitations were shocked in several regions, or 40 to 70 billion rain.
From 20 to 40 billion additional rain were expected from this Thursday night, according to the regions.
The sectors in the northern river and the Outaouan Valley were the most touched.
They could receive up to 100 mm of rain.
As these precipitations must be added to the source of snow already accumulated in certain sectors, it is feared that several water courses are discovered.
Advertising warnings have been issued on Monday night by the Quebec Civil Security for the Uareau and Achigan Rivers in Lanaudière.
The North Rivers, in Saint-Jerome, in the Laurents, and in the Czeen, in Lotbinaire, were the object of inondation vessels and remained under control.
In the Lanaudière region, the strong precipitations cut some lakes in Saint-Julian, Saint-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was imported because of the strong rains.
Ten residues had to be evacuated by preventive measure.
In Outaoeen, the discharge of certain lakes had been closed by several ways, including in the municipality of Mansfield and Pontefract.
Civil security remains on a foot of warning and monitoring the nearby situation, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Quebec Cross Prevision Center has for its merry of the warnings of strong crude for several rivers, including Maskinonge, Assomption, Uareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially infringed
Whatbec Stephane Dupont's radio animator took part in the Canadian Radio Standards Council (CCNR) for debated proposals on social assistance and Haitians as well as on its largest language.
The CCNR believes that Mr. Dupont and his CHOI team had the right to express their views, but some proposals contained "incomprehensive information on the social assistance, the unfairly negative representations of Haitians and the largest language that did not correspond to emissions that were distributed during the day".
The Council also concluded that a debate on the suicide, including the dissemination of the name of two individuals who were suicide, did not interfere the radiodiffusion codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints on comments during emissions distributed between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made after a complaint from the Common Force of Quebec Assistant Social Persons.
The group regretted that the emission amounts mentioned were inexact.
Animators must present solid information instead of tromper.
With regard to the suicide, an animator Stefane Dupont had estimated that the suicide is a gesture of lack.
The majority of the members of the Committee concluded that the revised message was that the suicide should not be considered as a solution to the problems of life.
"The majority of the Committee believes that the episodes involving "Duphan the Middle" have addressed a delicate and appropriate subject."
There has therefore been no blemise reserved in his place.
The last dispute was reported on statements followed by the earthquake in Haiti.
Stephane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort were then delivered to a mediatic face that had caused many reactions.
The CHOI animator stated that he had done no gift to help the Haitians because it was not able to know with certainty that the necessary people really receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abuse, but that their cumulative effects are an unfairly negative representation of the Haitians.
"I've already cleaned my suspension of three days above."
"My file is empty for a year and half," said the animator.
In all decisions, the Committee denied gross language distribution.
In each case, the CHOI-FM radiodiffusioner cooperated "out of its obligation".
The consequences are minimum for the station which, inter alia, should announce these decisions once during the greatest hearing hours for a period of three days.
A king of the Kung-fu in Montreal
Montreales of Algerian Heritage Nacereddine Zemmal has a extremely special journey.
The attraction that exceeds in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai box mounts on the Tatamis and the rings of the world to search for new challenges.
"I started to practice martial arts like Kig-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algerije, explained Zemmal, installed in the metholol since 2008 to evolution in professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for battles, because for those who do not love the present land game in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, he who works as a security agent and as the UPS company has just delivered bad news to his rivals, bringing two gold medals to the World Amateur Championship of the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23 to 30 October, in Edimburgh, Scotia.
"I reported the categories of kickboxing full contact and Thai box, did he explain."
"Actually, I'm ready to go to China for the San Shue World Coupe."
"The fighters who ended among the first four at the last championship of the world in each category were invited."
"I brought the bronze in 2009 to Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished the eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I concluded the tournament at the fifth rang, while I arrived third to Toronto in 2009, he added."
"What is interesting is that I have progressed in every competition."
"To this rythm, I'll be first this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a disciplinary from China where the poing and foot cuts are allowed, as well as the soil projections are.
The woods are originally launched on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most known pugilist of this form of fight is the Vietnamian American origin Cung Le, well recognized in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has to consider only one event in his career, he will certainly answer his presence at the Super King of Sanda, the Super Bowl of the Kig-fu.
"This competition is the most releved and most prestigious in China, explained the gaillard sympathy."
"It's a little the equivalent of the Lumpine Stade (the largest stage of Thailand)."
"It was a super experience."
Zemmal returned his first battle in half-final of his category (80 kg) before the end was lost.
"He who wins me was a real pro, he analyzed."
" There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of half-final are at the end of their category."
"And, the winners of each category are faced to coron a single champion, the king of the king-fu."
450 million in contracts without offers
Hydro-Québec granted a grade of $450 million in Engineering fixed contracts for Eastman-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In the heart of this over 100 contracts, it is a consortium of strong BPR, Dessau, SM and Axor, which has obtained the most important project management, for a sum of $295 million without offers.
This consortium called Energy Management was formed in 2004 in conjunction with the choice of Hydro-Québec to provide its responsibility to the private sector to manage this important hydro-electric project of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, Consortium Energy Administration decreased the lucrative contract without calling for public offers.
For the Quebeco Party, the use of business consortiums poses a serious ethical problem that risks the eradication of competition and causes a increase in prices.
"This is the new way to make confusion and shoot competition."
"It is, that people, instead of doing this secretly, now make it openly", said the sinner Sylvain Samard in press conference yesterday.
Before the morning, Mr. Simard highlighted the question to the National Assembly because he said it is difficult to see how public interest can be served in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, nor strictly that there had been a collusion for this contract.
"I begin to have my trip," she painted, supporting that the PQ had been "malhonnest" and had "a lack of rigour."
She said "It would be less than things" that the PQ apologize.
Consortium formula is a common practice in the whole world.
It is normally a limited alliance in time that allows two or several companies to group their respective experts in order to respond to an appeal for a complex project.
The Eastman project includes a high level of complexity accounting for the extent of work.
The channel is in progress and must be scanned until 2012.
However, the contract was allocated without the game of competition; there was negotiations.
So the formula of consortiums is no longer an exception to Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As the last week the Dever revealed, the formula of consortiums in the Advisory Genesis sector was subject to an investigation to the government.
A rapid overflow of the Quebec business register allows to number more than 200 consortiums, some of which seem to be permanent.
For example, the strong Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are decades, brings to a single moral person, or Dessau.
As regards the Consortium Energy Generation, the minister of Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the Baie James responded to special handling dynamics and that Hydro-Québec reacted in particular in the 1970s."
The great patron of the Eastman Project, Real Report, of the Baie James Energy Society (SEBJ), explained the fact that the project management contract was granted gracely.
"If you're going to call for offers and there are few employees, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices, either you take people in that market and you say, we're going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"But the idea is that it's not the price that is important, it's the competence of people," said Mr. Laport.
This contract granted to Consortium Energy Generation is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebecois Party.
The contracts were granted by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastman-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, the Dever had 109 advisory genital contracts between 2002 and March 2010 to firm or subsidiary, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin had 22 contracts, Genevar reached 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without taking account of its participation in energy generation.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They totalize $449,783,344, including the amount of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has left to hear that the four firms composing the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor) are "now known to the Quebec Liberal Party".
The Minister of Norway left that the PQ is also linked to those "financing" to the "financing" before clarifying that it was its leaders instead.
Responsible consumer bar - The "Green" label does not imply confidence
More green, but frankly sceptic.
Whatbecois consumer is very little confidence to the actors of sustainable development, but also to equipped marks and ecological certificates to guide their choices.
Pis, even if it spends in a mediatic universe where messages for a more pullable consumption are made, he lacks a credible lack of information, which he qualificates even ships to his commitment, indicates the Barometer of responsible consumption, whose first reading has been delivered yesterday.
Even though they have increased the consumption of products that are socially responsible in 2010, Québecois seems to give very little credit to those who are trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say they do not believe the environmental commitment of enterprises as the green publicity of companies, reveals the measure tool developed by the Sherbrooke Office of the responsible consumption of the University.
Another notes that the half of consumers doubt the fiability of official certificates on the equitable products, but also the credibility of products and brands that are equipped as co-responsible, indicates the Barometer.
At the same time, the discussion of the politicians on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecois.
However, the information on responsible consumption seems to be primari to stimulate this bread of animal consumption currently by near-third of Quebecois consumers.
Indeed, the white and doubtful nature of the information would be 46% of consumers.
It is the second ship identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
Furthermore, a third of the Québeco is also unfair to the performance of green products or services that are looking for to put them into their hands.
On another note, consumers were near to half in 2010 to change their habits and especially changed marks of one or more products to respond to their conviction.
The Barometer indicates that by a higher than 61 per cent, they also encouraging buyers in their neighbourhood and entitled the purchase of food products cultivated in their region.
More green and responsible - the accounting consumption index reached 64 to a maximum of 100 for this year -, the Quebec Consumer Homo likes to be presented as the king of the recycling that seeks to reduce its environmental impairment by worried about animal protection.
However, his social and ecological conscience seems to remain outside its car, states the Barometer: in 2010, at least 28% of the Quebecois have indicated that the transport was commonly used, or have predicted the co-co-commerce to defend their green interests.
The walk and the vessel were also supported by 39.1% of the participants to this wide behavioral investigation, which came to take his first click.
A loan of the State for eXcentris purchase
The Quebec Government, which was requested to be financially engaged in the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Angus Society and the Parallele, agrees to cooperate, but only with a loan.
The Angus Development Society and the Parallele, who expected a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to save Daniel Langlois the eXcentris cinematographic complex on the St. Laurent bolevard, did not obtain what they claim.
The Government accepts to participate in the dossier, but at its own conditions.
Before the awaited donation, the Quebec Government proposes a loan which would be less than initial expectations, which could be a viable solution to advantageous conditions, at least the view of the sources of State offices.
A first plan of action and a request of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last early, but the applications have already been revised at low level.
A proposal and action plan was sent to the Minister of St-Pierre by the President of the Culturel Development Society (SODEC), François Macerola, who pilots the eXcentris file.
He has reached a last report over a decade of days.
But the counter-proposal of the office was reached at the Sunday SODEC.
The Parallèle and Angus have responded to it until 31 December.
It seems, however, that the hypothesis of the gift of the State should really be discarded.
Remember that the Québec ownership of cinema and cineparks was opposed to a direct investment from the State to support the purchase of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture has not to finance real estate projects, which did not for other cinema rooms.
But several environmental stakeholders claimed that there was a substantial economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the Cean's Master, had ten years of braking the author cinema in his complex places after funding his own construction, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Council.
The lack of rooms for independent films is creating in Montreal, and eXcentris had been fidelizing his customer.
The Angus Society and the Parallele, with their head Christian Yaccarini, pilots, on their side, a private financing campaign, expecting to collect $7,000 to shoot the purchase.
Since the spring 2009, one of the three screens, La Parallele, continues to spread eXcentris films.
The goal of future purchasers is to reopen the three rooms next February 27 by designing the very beautiful movie of Xavier Beauvous Mans and gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not remember the Dever and is ignored what he and his group think of proposals at the lowest time.
The swimming snake on a complex Canada...
The new American diplomatic cable dismissed by WikiLeaks highlights what the United States consider as the complex of Canadian infliriacy towards the Americans, but they also touch the sense of suicide to Canada.
Thus, the American diplomates noted that each Canadian elector had no Canadian-American relations with voted and believed that the visit of President Obama helped the Conservant Government to adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, located on the public site yesterday, offer more cruel details than the substantial content of the dent.
A cable dated 22 September 2008, or in full federal election campaign, reports to the United States as not part of the chairs discussed by the political leaders.
In the greatest surprise of the American Ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations to this situation.
"A complex of Canadian inferry may almost inherently the Canadian political leaders to speak internally in the daily places instead of bringing this election to the United States (e.g. at the 1988 free exchange campaign) " , he wrote.
Thus, the United States concludes, "the eligible provision of this election: all represent, but potentially too threatening to speak it."
The Ambassador is, at least, the "assert-silence" that both countries have an intensive political and economic relationship.
"Logically, it is estimated that the capacity of a candidate, a party and more than a party head to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that the electioners have in mind by voters."
On 22 January 2009, Terry Breese was sent to Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama at his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your travel will help to ensure the survival of the government at the starting vote of trust on the federal budget in February, in which Canada will show its first deficit over a decade because of a relief plan from 30 to 40 billion dollars", wrote Mr. Breese.
No part was mentioned that the Government had to extend the Parliament before Christmas to avoid being turned into coalition and that the opposition partys made their conditional survival to the quality of the proposed relaxing plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by the Ambassador Wilkins, prevents Washington of a more negative image than the dramatic series distributed to CBC return from the United States.
The Ambassador is concerned about the Border emissions, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which we observe few references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or the "No-Fly-List".
Another cable reports that Hillary Clinton asked his French homolog Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome certain prisoners in Guantánamo.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but on the basis of "case per case".
At the end of the meeting, he wrote, "He sent a paper to the State secretariat about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old musulman of Canadian origin."
"The secretariat accepted revision of the folder."
Let us finally note that the spirits flee on the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a very closest adviser from Stephen Harper, declared on the CBC waves that the responsibilities of this massive fleet should be "assaulted".
He did Mike Huckabee's echo in the United States.
A global plan to renew lighting
In Cancún, the United Nations proposed last night a plan to renew household, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to obtain a reduction in steel gas (GES) which corresponds almost to the third of the additional reductions that must be achieved to stabilize the global climate of 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the gap of large concrete projects that the United Nations hope to adopt in Cancún to compensate the absence of binding commitments to reduce by industrialized countries.
According to the last reported plan, if the incandescent ampulations that are still monopolising the market were replaced by fluocompact ampulations or, better, by electrical diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), the essential 1,8 billion tonnes of GES embedded on the planet to clarify humans would be avoided.
The lighting is responsible for 8% of the global emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the global car park.
In Copenhagen, last year, the major emission countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and other, including Canada, have been undertaken in voluntary reduction plans that should take over the global GES emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, it should be undertaken from this 5 Gt further to stable from 2020 the increase of the climate to 2 degrees of centigrates in order to avoid that it becomes not controlled.
In incandescence ampulations, 95% of the energy is dissized in the form of heat and the rest, or 5%, produced from light.
With fluocompact ampulations, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and the new smuggles to the DE, this need for two times again is reduced.
Fluocompact ampoules are averaged from 6000 to 10 000 hours.
The new MP, as the manufacturer Philips launched this week - this company also participated in the United Nations study - have a life hope of 25 000 hours and consumed less than 80% of energy than an uncandent manufacturer, which gives an idea of the economy possible with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
All these new ampules can also work with reheostats, more to make very little heat.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Many specialists have shown reserves for fluocompact ampulations because they contain mercury and that they must be removed as dangerous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, except if manufacturers put consignments into place.
However, the report indicates that the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluocompact ampoule, but instead the carbon temperatures, which emit many mercury to produce gaseous electricity in incandescenced ampulations.
Only in the United States these centrals are expenditure of 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the benefits of each country through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would thus spend a billion dollars per year for electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, or equivalent to 3.5 temperatures, which would cost 2.5 billion.
The Coast of Ivoire waits in nervousness for the advertising of the electoral results
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, requested the presidential election results, after the expiration of the deadlines.
"The secretariat-General stressed the need for the independent election committee to purchase its work and to announce the provisional outcomes without more time, stressed a chair door of the head of the United Nations."
"He calls upon all Ivoire parties and institutions to make evidence of responsibility and abstention of any initiative until the announcement of the provisional results."
Despite the pressures exerted by some foreign governments, the election committee left the mid-minute day without publishing the results, three days after the Sunday election.
About 40 minutes before the end of the period, the President of the ECI stated the television that the Committee "continues to work" to announce the results.
The calls have been multiplied in the world so that the CEI finally proclaims the name of the winner of the second tour between Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo camp has taken account of the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of "fraudle" votes in the north, held by the former Rebellion of the New Forces (FN) since the fall of September 2002.
Pascal Afi N'Guessan, head of the Ivoire president's campaign, stated that the NF electors' inhibition handworks in the north of the country had disappointed the parties from the President who came to vote.
Any election could be canceled if the complaints made by Gbagbo are reserved by the Constitutional Council.
But the opposites of Gbagbo believe that the highest court of the country is not neutral because it is directed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a nearby Gbagbo political alliance.
Alassane Ouattara, a Northern man who has all linked with the former rebels, tried "inacceptable" the delay in the results announcement and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go until the victory return.
His allies argued that Gbagbo blocked the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that he would take complaint to the Constitutional Council, after preventing the election committee to disseminate the results, would be illegal.
The second tour of the presidency, Sunday, was to run the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country remained known in two years.
The United Nations warned the Ivoire political class that it could be responsible for events of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished the first tour on 31 October, with 38% of votes against 32% in Alassane Ouattara, who received the public support of the former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first tour).
The unemployment rate was stable in France at the 3rd quarter
The unemployment rate in France in terms of the International Labour Office (ITB) remained stable to 9,3% in mettropole (9.7% in terms of other sea departments), showing the corrected data of the periodic variations published by Insee.
The number of unemployed employees is 2.631 million in metropole.
The data of the second quarter were confirmed by 9,3% of the active population in metrosole and 9,7% with the DOM.
In a year, the unemployment rate is increased in 0.1 points.
More widely, 3.4 million people in France did not work at the third quarter but wanted to work, if they were or not available in the two weeks to work and to search for or not a job.
The situation of young people present on the labour market has still been degraded, with a new increase in the unemployment rate, at 24.2% in metrosol (+ 0.9 points for three months, +0.5 points for one year) and 25% including DOMs.
In the third quarter, 637.000 young people from 15 to 24 years were employed in terms of ICT.
The seniors have known a slight increase in the unemployment, 6.4% in mettropole (+0.2 points for three months and one year), or 482.000 people in 50 years or more, and 6.6% with WTO.
Only 25-49 years have benefited from unemployment stability in the third quarter, to 8,3% in metrosol (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points per year) and 8.8% in the whole of France.
Insees have not published more monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a polemic on its calculation method.
Eurostat, the EU Statistics Agency, continued to do it instead and announced a rate of 9.8% for France (including WTO) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guerini reviewed and placed in detention
Alexandre Guerini, 53-year-old leader of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS President of the General Council of Bouches du Rhône, was investigated and carried out at the Luynes' arrest house, near Aix-en-Provence in a fraudulent public market investigation.
Alexandre Guerini has been investigated for abuse of social goods, distortion of public funds and goods, receipt, active corruption, infringement trafficking and munitions detention, indicates its lawyer.
"Alexaler Guerini is fighting and wants to explain about all the questions that the magistrate will put him, and not fantasies."
"It's easy to continue for a multitude of reprehensible leaders, it's another thing to prove them", said the AFP's lawyer Florence Rault, before hearing his customer.
Mr. Guerini, the strong man's brother of the PS at the department, Jean-Noël Guerini, held through his lawyers to pass to the judge before his hearing a record to explain.
One of his neighbors, Philippe Rapezzi, has also been reviewed on Monday night and erupted.
According to his lawyer, Me Lucien Simon, his client never did anything else than to make the demissions he had to handle.
As regards the assignment of markets or the destination of the funds related to their operation, he never knew it, said Me Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Services of Australia's Aglomation, was conducted in a mercrediary review for the detriment of public and compliance funds, and left free under judicial control with prohibition to meet the protagonists of the dossier.
"My customer has made explanations to the facts that he has been reproduced."
"The Master Instructeur noted that it was free", said his lawyer, Me Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons were under review and released free in Monday night, with a judicial control for two of them, reported the Advocate Prosecutor of the Republic of Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadyakian, adjoint Director of Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), is continued to be "related infringement and passive corruption".
Two officials of the Abugnana's aglomeration, Michele Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been examined one for "distortion and distortion of public goods by a person responsible for a public service mission," the other for "co-operation of public funds".
Finally, the company of Alexanndre Guerini, Jeannie Peretti, was under review for "abusing of social goods".
Among those who were faced with Mr. Guerini figured in Stefan Brunnengo-Girard, recently erupted in a parallel case of fraudulent public markets touching the Corse.
The investigators suspiciously sustain their companies to have served to white up the money of the big banditism.
The investigation is conducted in the context of several open judicial information on April X, 2009 after anonymous emails, for frauds presumed in the passation of public markets, especially in the waste filial.
From near the source of the investigation, investigations focus on the conditions of assignment and operation of a la Ciatat discharge, which collects Abugnan waste and certain towns of the city of the Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss: Elisea exaggerated the mediation of Syria
Over ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the type of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was arrested in Iran for "espioning", took place in France, put the diplomacy in warning, and increased the deterioration of relations between Paris and Texas.
All under the attentive view of the United States diplomates.
American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le World reveal some below this crisis.
They describe how Eliseo explained his strategy to the Americans, to give them advice for the treatment of their own "topics" crisis in Iran (a small group of randons).
They show how French responsibilities tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the French youth had not been struck against the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and searched for the American justice for the traffic of materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they put the way the French Presidency tried to handle the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, there was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram issued on August 12, 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage cases".
François Richier's advisor for strategic affairs, composed of the Director of the Quae d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, is involved with the American diploma Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain to him the French method.
They advise the Americans to do so so to repatriate their own power-residents in Iran.
"Feats of the sound," they say, "more without stop" in the media the word "right of the fundamental man", "innocence", "immediate license".
It is necessary to shut the Iranian regime, sensitive to his image.
"Do more than the Iranians ask you not to do it."
Because, past the attempts to discuss through discrete channels, "the silence will do nothing", the Iranians are "master in diligent handworks".
Mr. Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is "a family iranian tactic: taking oppositions for political changing."
He announces that the release of prison in Clotilde Reiss (which will take place on August 16, when it refugees to the embassy of France) "incentives the payment to Iranians of a large amount of money" (230 000 euros of warranty).
And it knows that Elisea anticipates other opposition crisis, a phenomenon that "augmented".
The Iranians could "in a near future to stop another of some 800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is out of prison for twelve days, but remains blocked in Iran.
A information is distributed: Ironic Majid Kakavand, whose United States claims the extradition for an illegal traffic of electronic material to Iran, is released free to Paris on a judge decision.
The U.S. Ambassade, as many observers, asked about this robust coincidence.
For Washington, which touchs Iranian nationals' material purchasing networks for the nuclear programme, Majid Khakavand's expansion is a bad news.
Has France accepted a marketing?
The release of Iran against the French?
When a new meeting with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4th, François Richier ensures that this is not the case.
The Elisea, said, did not only "returned completely by the decision of the judge," but tried to oppose it.
" There have been living exchanges between the French presidency and the guard of the shoes" (on the time, Michele Alliot-Marie), "but the French government cannot return to the decision," he observes.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "strict" monitoring of French information services.
Elisée's advisor consists of a phone number and then reports the American diplomat that Iran is now located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian Embassy.
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, Elisée does not have its efforts by means of communications and "features" organized in the media to believe that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" role and "influence" of "meditor".
Americans observe this non-Ironic activity, and noted that the manipulation brings its fruits because several printing articles affect the French official version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 called the 'blitz' mediatic of French officials.
The ambassaded in Paris is requested on the basis of the “gratitude” expressed to Mr. Assad.
"Depending on their full loan statements, the French officials recognize privately that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have really done."
The document then discusses the reasons that the Ellisée has put to pay in this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts "in order to validate Sarkozy's open policy in Syria," he analyzes.
A policy launched in 2008, "when, by many critical voices in France and foreigner as premature and immédiate."
"Exercising the Syrian role," Paris is trying to "to demonstrate Syria what loans it can affect by playing a constructive role in the region".
The goal is also to "seed grain of discussion between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. Ambassador knows the good source.
On August 11, François Richier trusted him: "We're sure we don't know whether the Syrians did anything."
"But we've always thanked them."
"It should, at least, be confusion in Iran."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it to Elysée.
In a communication, he thanks the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role for the release of our companion."
No online games for young Koreans last minute
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "Cendrillon" which will prohibit adolescents to play online games after minute by blocking their access, reported government responsibilities.
A legislation project will be submitted to the Parliament in December to request online game companies to block access to these games after minute, to youths under 16 years of age, reported representatives of the Ministry of Cultural and Family.
"Boost kids play these games all night and then have difficult to study school and have a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep", stated the APP Jo Rin, the ministerial responsible for the draft legislation.
Online games will be re-accessed at 6 a.m. morning.
The companys will have a year to prepare for the implementation of the law, whether it is specific.
The Government also intends to ask companies to limit the daily access time to these games for young people whose requests the parents has added the responsibility.
It will also provide people who recruit free software that enable the past time on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected countries" and newspapers regularly report on different facts related to intensive Internet use.
The country is also the uncertain champion of the global online game competitions.
In November, South Korea had reported four gold medals to the Cyber Games World, faced 58 other nations.
Worldwide 2018-2022: Fifth designates organizer countries
In full turn, because of corruption suspicion, the Executive Committee of Fifa designates the World Coupe countries, 2018 and 2022, a political choice where the influence struggles and lobbying risks to take steps on technical criteria.
One thing is safe, the 2018 edition of the Kingdom Competition of Fifa will take place in Europe, traditional discipline (4 candidates: English, Russia, Spain and Portugal, Netherlands and Belgium).
The 2022 will be more exotic, the International Federation hoped to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its implantation in the United States or in the extreme East (Japana, South Korea).
The list of personalities of delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the eve of the Qatar, Belgian and Dutch government heads, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) provides the measurement of economic and political commitments of a worldwide.
Thus, collisions treaties risk to duration up to the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between candidates.
According to the Fifa's evaluation report, English, Spanish (2018) and American (2022) files have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be very serious for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
Sunday Times, as a result of the revelations that had been made to the corruption of two members of the EC (Reinald Temparii and Amos Adamu), could thus have destroyed the chances of her country, with the football that did not welcome the World only once, in 1966.
The BBC delivered a kitchen, Monday, by disseminating a documentary that covers three influence members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Liou.
What to miscontent Fifa and put the English responsibilities in the embarrass, which started in a intense lobbying in the last few weeks with David Cameron in the first line.
The Head of Government hopes to revise the success of his predecessor Tony Blair, who had received the organization of the JO-2012 organizations in London in 2005.
Does this intense activity suffice to cut the slaughter of the UK at the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the two Spanish-Portugal lacks a lack of shoes with its already prepared towns, its expertise (Mondial-82 in Spain, OJ-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its culture.
But the dark economic and financial perspectives of the two countries could deteriorate their ambitions.
The evental resurrections against the Englishs and the doubts about the solvability of Spain and Portugal only make Russian cotton increased, even though the lacunes of its file (stads, hotels, transportation).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Poutine decided not to take up the movement to Zurich and condemned a "fair competitive competitiveness in the preparation of the vote" in an unfair allusion to the accused of the English press against the members of the EC.
"On the coppers, we're trying to compromise," Mr. Poutine launched.
For 2022, the United States, strong from 1994 experience, appear as logical favorites.
The first world economic power, headquarters of the Fifa's main sponsors, seems to have a long step in Japan and South Korea, which separately built a very beautiful project.
However, these new candidates appear to be prematured for two countries who have co-organized the test in 2002.
Another threat: The octroy of the World World-2026 to China, arduamente desired by Fifa, which would actually cause Asian chances for 2022.
With the Qatar, who came out of the great game by proposing future cities, and Australia, Fifa would continue its expansion towards new conceptions, but these two countries have more risks than certainty.
Australia, such as Japan and Korea, could also deteriorate the weakness of TV rights (for the timely decay) by European countries, the nervous of the war for Fifa.
Second mandate: evidence
De Gaulle had really been sweet.
Mitterrand had believed he was shocking.
Valery Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not have less hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is less than they.
A mandate to Eliseo calls another.
So the current head of the State will be candidate in 2012.
But obviousness does not make good home with the part of mystery attached to the presidential function.
So it must be done as if the doubt was always existing.
In a sense as in the other.
In 2006, even without faith, the friends of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third mandate was not excluded.
On November 15, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy would claim that he would take his decision "whoever part of 2011."
That he speaks before the UMP parliamentars, on Tuesday night at the Elisée, the perspective of "two mandates" has therefore seen a little febrility.
Was it the official advertising of his candidate?
We were far away.
The Chair was only reminded that the 2008 Constitutional Revision was limited to two numbers of five.
He made a test, not an advertising.
It's not the first time he vows the President, on the tone of the humor, at such meetings.
"As worse, or best, you've been still seven years old with me," he started them in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Do not believe I do not think at the next stage."
His proposal beforewards do not make it more candidate than older; they do not make it less.
If they succeed in comments, that's a double reason.
The acceleration of the switch to the PS, on the one hand.
But this is not the entry in Segolene Royal that put Nicolas Sarkozy to declare.
This is in contrast because its candidate in 2012 is obviously that many of the PS claims a more premature struggle in order than planned.
The bad analysis, on the other hand.
The right electors would first prefer the candidate of François Filon to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UNPU above," immediately and carefully reacted the development of the Prime Minister.
"If he believes the fault possible, he will not be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He'll always think he can win", corrects Alain Juppee, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: The ECB forced to maintain its State title purchases
The last meeting of the European Central Bank's Governing Council (ECB) should be the opportunity to clarify the criteria for the outcome of crisis or at least proclaim the stop of a good number of non-conventional operations of monetary policy which must be completed at the end of the year.
The crisis of the European sovereign debt obliges, the Francfort Emission Institute will certainly not be able to be too perpetual to increase the situation today on European obligatory markets.
Political costs would be even higher.
Last night, at a press conference, Christine Lagarde, Minister of Finance, welcomed the active role played by the ECB to the resolution of the debt crisis in Europe.
She did not want to say if it was estimated that the Central Bank had to do more, for example, by increased its sovereignty purchasing programme.
"I reserve my reflection to my European partners (...) "
The older, in Brussels during his hearing by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, has not shown disappointment about its intentions, with satisfaction to indicate that the secondary market purchase programme "swift" would continue and that "We will see what we will decide" at the meeting of this Jubilee.
Only certainty: the ECB will maintain its main management rate to 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, the purchase of the Treasury's obligations by the ECB has doubled the last week about EUR 1.35 billion.
And, according to the indicators of market operators, it would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese titles last night.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have purchased 67 billion euros since May 2010.
Among the market operators, the advances of the purchase continue (see page 29).
Economists do not even expect a significant change in cap.
If the ECB's credit operations have already lost, this last case is still to unlimited liquidity allocations according to generic conditions and for the periods of one week to three months.
Economists are expected today to extend this device for a few months.
"I can't imagine that she changes significantly its program."
"If it would take the risk to cause new short-term tensions", says Michael Schubert, economicist of the Commerzbank.
"A progressive outcome announced during the first quarter of 2011 appears to be more likely," warned Norbert Bröms, economicist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the context of its public debt market interventions, "the ECB should hold up a volume of purchase of these obligations to abolish an air market," adds Norbert Brms.
In view of the importance of the European bank exposure to the euro area's sovereign debt markets, the emission institution has no choice than to maintain its presence on the market.
"All prices must be replaced by the lack of market investors and act in such a way to prevent the packing of income paid by the most fragile States," said a major binding manager last night.
Because if interest rates are turned, States will be more generous to reduce their endlessness, except to stabilize it.
The euro savings are at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government makes the two rounds
After a week of concern for Italy, the situation was a little extensive, yesterday, with the reflux of the binding rates for 10 years.
A return to precarious calm.
On the outcome of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the Presidents of the region heard Julio Tremonti qualifying the situation of "indecryptable" and waiting for a "unexpected weekend" which then dismissed.
In any case, the difference with the German long rates reached the record of 210 basic points, and the price of contracts against the risk of faillite (CDS) was involved to 263 points, involving a certain consent in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that the distance with the German rates was more than 400 basic points in Spain.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, declared "freely worried" by "market turbulences" and by a possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that she is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
It is clear that its problem is the absence of growth and the anaemia of fiscal revenues that goes with, driving to the State, the risk of no longer covering its financing needs.
Brussels' last previsions were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1 per cent in 2011 and to 1.4 per cent in 2012, while the current review budget at the Senat table was 1.3 per cent and 2 per cent.
In these conditions, the European Commission calculates the public deficit will still represent 4,3% of the GDP the next year (of 3,9% planned by the government) and 3,5% in 2012 (only 2,7%).
The roll of a new budget collection that could be placed after the feasts, for a amount of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new authenticity measures should be taken," the Commissioner considers economic affairs, Olli Rehn.
For the time, Italy receives support from international institutions.
"The fundamentals of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we repeat it for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian Administrator to the International Monetary Fund in the FMI.
" There is no problem in the immediate, or on the short or long term, because, despite its major debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), it is less than those requested to other countries," says Pier Carlo Patroan, an economic leader of the OCDE.
It remains the issue of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a census movement in the Chamber of Members, following which advanced elections could be organized at the end of March.
It would then be opened a short period for decision-making in case of serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening anti-crisis devices
Christine Lagarde still marched it last night in a press conference in Paris: "The Europeans, I believe that we have still shown it Sunday and night, are obviously solid, determined, engaged in defending their currency and their monetary zone."
Despite any relative detention, the last detention on the rates of European State obligations brought water to the moulin of governments and the ECB.
But we can't even talk about a start of normalization.
The Standard & Poor's Rating Agency announced that it could deteriorate the debt note of Portugal, the most seen target today by speculating.
"Comme in May there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, especially on banking systems," he believes the economics of Exane BNP Paribas.
More than "political time is much slow than market time".
Conscious of this heat and the dangers that it is raised, the European countries intensify the discussions to strengthen already existing anti-crisis devices.
The informal consultations between the Ministers of Finance most directly concerned and, more widely, with their G20 partners will be good train.
This is also a view to meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin of the beginning of the next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
At the menu, the type of non-conventional measures to support the euro area countries in the market collision (see above).
As regards the European Financial Stabilities Fund (FESF), its executive Director Klaus Regling began march in Singapore to inform the extreme and eastern investors of crisis developments in Europe.
If the objective of these visits is not to funds, it will certainly prepare the field.
The first EDF title emissions are planned in the next month.
Last, a official representative of the United States has granted the Reuters Agency that the United States will support a possible increase in the funds mobilized by a direct commitment to the IMF.
Countries who are on the first hand, Portugal and Spain learn to adopt structural reforms, including in the field of the organization of the labour market.
Reforms that are added to more closer austerity measures.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different way from Greece and Ireland.
One and the other are priced to avoid demanding international assistance before the establishment of their own budget correctives and to decide on the necessary structural reforms to retain sustainable confidence.
In addition to European funds, finally, are on the options available to accelerate the standardization process of sovereign obligations.
On November 24, Axel Weber had the first advanced idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not be able to give the hand to the portfolio.
Barclays Capital Economists, actor of all the first market plan of the European Sovereign Debt Debt, believe that an area of approximately 100 billion euros would be sufficient, "of preference" in the form of direct liquidity injection.
The vehicle exists: this is the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, which is now covered by 60 billion euros.
An advisory that has every opportunity to be carefully reviewed in European capitals.
Overall if the market conditions were employed.
Nest and green: 24 Divisions in Oversight of Orange
Neglected episodes also generate difficulties in circulation, including on the secondary network in Britain, and risks to defeat certain economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now monitored because of the risk of nest and nest.
The Eure, the Eure and Loir, the Two Swedish and the Vienna, added to the 20 Divisions already in Orange Monitoring, 18 from Thursday after midday and two, Dordogne and Gironde, later in the night.
According to Meteo France, neighborhoods affect the north of the Gironde and the Charentes, and he weakly shine on the island of France.
The neighborhoods from 2 to 5 cm, pontually from 7 to 10 cm are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of the Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou, and the regions of the Netherlands-Norwegian regions, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
Neglected episodes are sufficiently notable to generate difficulties in circulation and to defeat certain economic activities, predicts Meteo France.
In the Coasts of Armar, several departments were prohibited to weight more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannition and Saint-Brieuc-Loudeac axis.
The transportation of the secondary network in Britain is very difficult according to the gendarmes that recommend to take its vehicle only if necessary and the movement of certain TER cars has been suspended for the day.
School transportation was prohibited for Thursday in Picardie.
No specific measure was considered on Wednesday night to restrict the movement of weight.
Preference "invites all cars to the most carefulness of the roads and to adapt their conduct accordingly".
The Civil Aviation Directorate (DGAC) requested the airlines to cancel 25% of their flights on the Paris airport and 10% to Orly because of the neighborhoods to come.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their company.
In Great Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh, Scotia, is closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial skies
Since the debate around the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France slaughtered, billions plot.
In the debate at least.
In particular, there are 23 billion for the Grand Paris Metro that must build the Grand Paris Society.
In order to start this SGP, the State announced a capital of EUR 4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, this sum will then allow the SGP to make markets a part of the financing of its double bottle.
Today, we are finally arrived at the first additives.
The 2010 Rectificative Finance Act of Finance, which was reviewed in the Committee on Finance of the National Assembly this morning, contains the arrangements planned to find the start of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and increased tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, read in the text of the draft law, article 15, is "in the benefit of the public establishment of the Grand Paris Society".
It is digited: "The product of this tax is of EUR 117 million per year".
The second is a re-enhanced tax on offices that already exists "to modernize it, to increase the product and to affect this increase to the Grand Paris Society".
How much would this report?
Mystery.
This is not encrypted in the text.
We're far from 4 billion.
"It is specified that these tax resources are added to the $4 billion of capital funds that will be mobilized by the State and delivered to the Grand Paris Society at the flight and measure of the project," may be read in the explanation of reasons.
The SGP does not find this shocking system.
"After the income is created (the two taxes, ndlr), you can cover the studies for three years then cut into 4 billion after, it will be explained."
"This will be registered in the budget and shooted at the flight and measure."
The SGP believes that the four billion will begin to be registered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the promised 4 billion are still to the absent subscribed, is a risk to cause a poorly affected parliamentary debate.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Hackers Vendors and Spyes in Diligence
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it appears to be a scandale appearing, a scandale that appears as a scandale just before the hypocrisis that controls the relationships between States, citizens and presss.
On the other hand, it announces deep changes at the international level, and provides a future dominated by the rebellion.
But let's go on the order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file constituted by a secret service (something nation) is only composed of press cuts.
The American "extraordinary" revelations on the sexual habits of Berlusconi only make reports about what can be read in any daily newspaper (except those who Berlusconi is owner), and the Khadafi's loading profile has been long for sketch-cabaret artists.
The rule that secret records should not be composed of only newly known is essential to the dynamic of secret services and not only in this century.
If you go into a library dedicated to hisocratic publications, you will see that each book repeated (to the Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, Templates or Rose-Croix) is exactly what was already written in previous books.
And this is not only because the author of ocult texts does not like to do inedual research (not know where to search for news about the unixist), but because those who want to go to the ocultism believe only to what they already know, and who reiterates what they have already learned.
It's the mechanism of success by Dan Brown.
Ideal for secret files.
The informator is worthy, and strict (or with a limited spirit) the chief of secret services (if I may, if I know, editor in Liberation), which do not retain as true as what it recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the American Ambassador in Rome sent to the State Department was the same as the newsweek's previous week.
So why have the revelations about these files so much sounded?
On the one hand, they say that any qualified person already knows that the embassy, at least since the end of the Second World War, have, at least, been able to call or take a flight to dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small representation exercises, were transformed into a sponsoring centre.
Any spectrum of research films knows this very well, and it's just by hypocrisy that it seems to be ignored.
However, the fact that it repeats it is publicly violating the duty of hypocrisis, and it serves to put the American diplomacy under a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that a hacker could capture the most powerful secrets of the world's world's most powerful secrets brings an unnecessary cut in the press of the State Division.
So the scandale does not put the victims as well as the "boreal".
But let's come to the deep nature of what happened.
So, at Olwell’s time, we could design all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy was completely adverse since it was possible to control every movement through the phone, every transaction performed, the visited hotel, the buried car and so on, the citizens became the victim of the power’s eyes.
But when it is shown, as soon now, that even the secrets of the power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control report stops to be an unidirectional and become circulated.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least hacker - chosen as a citizen's venerator - can know all the secrets of the power.
How can a power that no longer has the possibility of maintaining its secrets can he keep?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said, that a real secret is a empty secret (and empty secret will never be declared); it is also true that all knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually a vide secret, because relevant of the public domain; but revealing, as WikiLeaks did, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets mean to remove him all powers.
WikiLeaks did nothing wrong in Sarkozy or Merkel, but made too big in Clinton and Obama.
What will the consequences of this blessed blessure be inflicted to a very powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future, States will not be able to put any reserved information on the internet, and that would return to the publisher on a show covered around the street.
But it is also obvious that with current technologies, it is only to expect to maintain confidential reports by phone.
Not much easier than finding whether and when a State leader moved into a flight and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and preserved reports be maintained in the future?
I know that for this moment, my predict is from science-fiction and therefore it is romantic, but I am obliged to imagine government agents who move discretely in diligences to uncontrolled itinerators, not only to providers of messages learned by heart, or, at least, to hide the rare information written in the House of a chassure.
The information will be stored in unique copy in key shots closed: on the ground, the Watergate's sponsoring attempt has been less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology is now advanced in crabe, that is, to recule.
A century after the unfilled telegraph revolutionated communications, the Internet rebuild a child's telegraph (telephonics).
The videocasts (analogue) allowed cinema researchers to explore a film passing before and back and discover all the secrets of the mount, while now CDs (numbers) were only allowed to save a chapter, i.e. by macro-portion.
With the high speed trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while in the aircraft, and the movements that it includes, there are three hours and half.
It is therefore not extraordinary that the communication policy and techniques return to horse vehicles.
A last observation.
Another time the press tried to understand what happened in the secret of the embassy.
Now, these are the embassy who call for confidential information to the press.
Climate: how France accepts its promises of financing
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to consider the compliance of rapidly disbloked financing promises (the fast start or early funding) carried out by the developed countries.
And the large French torches are revealed.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries were committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has promised 7.2 billion euros in three years and France 1,26 billion euros (e.g. 420 million per year).
In the opening of the COP16, the EU made a great game to convince its partners in the reality of its commitment to fast funding: detailed report on the action of its Member States, press conference, large side event, distribution of brochures...
Transparency is worthy and appreciated by its fair value: developing countries and civil society would like that all developed countries have the same level of accuracy.
The EU announces that 2,2 billion euros had been deployed in 2010, with the right way to respect its commitment of 7,2 billion in 2012.
But when we look at it in detail, things are more complicated.
This money must be, according to Copenhagen's Copenhagen Agreement, "new and additional" to ensure that additional efforts are made without being detrimentaled by the public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what means "new and additional".
While the European Commission has proposed a harmonisation, some Member States of which France has blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the best reference to it.
For example, the European Commission considered a reference in 2009: international financing is maintained and adds 150 million per three years under the rapid start of financing.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or in terms of public development aid.
On the contrary, France believes that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 are "new and additional."
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous years or at the global level of public development aid.
Concretely, the total amount of France's support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decreasing), which aims at respecting its commitment to "new and additional financing" ...
Another crucial element, the distribution between donations and loans.
There is no rules and everyone chooses its calculation mode.
Some, like France, believed that 1 € was equated to 1€ given.
Of course, this is difficultly justified: efforts are not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are rewardable (which projects related to the acceleration of emissions on more efficient technologies), it is necessary to present an euro that will be recovered as an euro equivalent to the amount of the EUR given... However, it should not be counted on the basis of its commitments only on the payment costs for the asset (see the equivalent of an interest rate).
However, France has to make such reasons: it "respect" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% of the loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of the donations (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to check yourself.
It is the only Union country to use as much as the loan.
Germany requires 46 per cent, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in other words) comply with their commitments with 100 per cent of donations.
On the other hand, when the very large majority of the European Union sets 1€ to satisfy its commitment, France is only 10 cents and considers that the efforts are comparable.
Nice password tour!
In its rapid financing, France works a double scroquency: one part on the development of action in time and on the reality of the financial effort.
With only 36.1 million euros, it is possible to believe that it costs 420 million "new and additional" in coherence with its promises.
The management of the Ministry of Finance (for it seems to be Bercy who had done the arbitrage) could have a dual negative impact, both within the EU (for the other Member States would continue to give if it is sufficient to provide ?) and in negotiations as developing countries are not completely ...
The chapter of pre-financing is only a small, relatively short-term issue in terms of all climate discussions.
But it could be a swimming grain more in the machine that is the UNFCCC.
We hope that it's not the case.
Whatever it is, it is essential to get lessons from this first year of pre-financing.
First, France could announce a change in its accounting mode for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and equity with the other countries of the European Union.
However, in particular, France could advance the discussions on long-term fundings (other crucial chapter currently discussed): it will not be avoided by the issue of "additionality" or the mode of accounting of loans.
France could change its position to become too progressist on these commitments as it is on others.
The hope is therefore about the new Minister of Environment, Ms. Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising advertisement on the rapid start of France and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would be a nature to increase the level of international confidence necessary to progress in discussions.
Child-in-child Pesticides Warning
A 10-year-old child in a day of 81 different chemical substances, according to a study published this mercredi of the Generations Futures Association (ex-Move for the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which provides that its results "no significant statistical value in view of the low number of analyzed samples, but are illustrative of the treated problem," acquired the foods generally consumed in four feeds and an incapacity in a day by a child of a decade of years, in the Western and Paris supermarkets.
These types of food, including official recommendations - five fresh fruits and fruits, three milk products and 1.5 litres per day, as well as friandises, have been examined by laboratorys to search for chemicals, pesticides, milk metals and other pollutants.
The asylum balance is suitable: 81 chemical substances whose 42 are classified cancer cancer and five cancer-classified substances, as well as 37 substances that may act as endocrinic disorders (PE), according to studies from several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"If, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, it is well viewed in our survey that the reality of the exposure of consumers to contaminants is possiblely concerned with cancer and/or PE", notes the association.
For the small dinner, the bohr and the tea in milk contain only ones more than one ten possible cancer residues and three addicts such as some cancers, as well as near a twenty-first of residues that may be cutting the hormonal system.
The poom, which was imported from Brazil, as set by the study, presents traces of six chemical substances which are still banned in France.
Even something for the green tissue of Kenya, including the dinner, where the study has detected traces of a powerful insekticidate prohibited in the EU.
Furthermore, the shocked steak, the box shock, and even the bread bag and the sweet gamb were truffed of pesticides and other chemical substances.
The analysis showed the presence of nitrates and cloroforms in the robine water.
For the dinner, the saumon steak was the most "rich" with 34 detected chemical residues and even the examination of the plastic asylum used to defeat the food to the microwave was not exempted.
The final risk for the consumer of this "contamination cocktails" is probably underestimated, according to the study.
The European Ecology-The Greens Association (EE-LV) proposed "face to the emergency of the situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop "the increase in civilization diseases".
In July, a European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) studied 365 different pesticides identified in the fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
