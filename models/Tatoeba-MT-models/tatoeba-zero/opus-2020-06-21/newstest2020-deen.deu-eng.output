More than two months after his establishment by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the ports of the city Bandar Abbas on Friday, which showed that the ship observation data of Refiniv was moved and left the Iranian port. The target port was given by Port Rashid in the United Arab Emirates.
Indeed, the tanker was already released by the Iranian government on Monday, but first he remained in Iranian waters, and from the Riederi it was called to wait for an official decision from Teheran.
The "Stena Impero" was introduced on July 19, by the Iranian Revolution Gardens in the Hormuz Sea Strategy, in order to have disfellowshipped security provisions, but it was noted that Iran reacted to the strict, interim establishment of an Iranian oil tanker before the Great Britain.
The street of Hormuz is one of the most important marine streets of the world. It connects the Persian Golf with the Indian Ocean. A majority of the global oil exports is cut by the sea. The swimming in the region had fallen in the past months. The trade ship was entered into the conflict between the United States and Iran.

Musk seeks to reach the extradition record
Teslas Quartal may be ready to record. Despite the extraction tree, there were last losses at the electronic autoconcert.
New York.Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given its electronic car concerts with the view of new record numbers. "We have the opportunity to reach our first quarter with 100,000 delivery", wrote Musk in a email from the Branch Blog "Electric".
The question is strong, so that Tesla could benefit 110000 orders, it continued to write in Musks rounds. The challenge is to bring the cars to the customers. Thus Tesla should offer as far as much as possible.
In the second quarter, Tesla had produced 95000 cars and thus reached its best value for almost four months.
Musk needs records to achieve its high objectives. 2019 he wants to deliver totally from 360000 to 400000 cars. This requires six-year-old numbers. Especially the most favorable Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here the profit rates are low. Despite the boom losses.
Resolved rat: For this reason we can't kit yourself
A kind of brems in the big brain prevents people to kit themselves. This was found by scientists of Humboldt University in Berlin using experiences on rats, how they shared on Thursday Monday. In this way, progress has been achieved in the question, why children are so strongly fighting against the kitchen only to demand more.
Finally, it has also shown why only the nearness of a kitchen hand has dissolved before the driving laugh. This lies on a deep shock in the big brain that already solved the laugh at the expectation of the kitchen.
According to the information, previous research showed that rats react with "Laken" in the ultra-scale area when they are kitchened by people. This "lake" is indicated by the part of the big brain whose central processing of the haptic authorisation is given.
Laugh is under pressure during self-training
Before it has been found that the brain between self-training and treatment can be different from other people, so people can't kitchen themselves. The Berlin researchers now find the experts to the rats that the laughing as well as the activity of the area of the big ceremonium during self-training, it is also likely if the lives themselves are put. During the care and the kitchen by the scientists were to laugh the activity in the hair and the impuls.
But pass the self-training and conducting by others at the same time, it also stressed the laugh. This pointed out that the brain of therats could not be between self-training and other conduct. The new knowledge closed that people could not kitchen themselves because self-training activates a brake in the big brain.
The rats were also trained to kiss themselves. In order to make this initiative in the experiment at times, they showed the conduction or shock stars. This ambivalence is equal to the behaviour of children. The environmentality of the kitzeln is a behavior reaction that is equal to rats and people.
Catastrophe used: Big Brand removed in French chemistry
The big bridge in a chemistry as specially dangerous in the northern French city of Rouen has been removed. This shared the prefectures of the Normandia of the news agent AFP on Friday. The fire was broken on Thursday night.

Mahnmal at the advisory of Oslo and Utöya is enthusiasmed

They recall the Roses that thousands of people were in the days and weeks after the appeals before the Dom in Oslo.

Iran has a British tanker free
The United Nations general debate did not have a solution in the Iran conflict, but now there is a less problem, but the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" was able to shoot again in the sea, and it could be a puzzle in the Iranian president Ruhani's peace plan.
The British oil tank "Stena Impero" held since mid- July on the street of Hormus in Iran is back into international waters. After released by Iranian authorities, the ship is on the way to Dubai, as the Rideri Stena Bulk reported.
The "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas and now the crew runs for medical investigations to Dubai, Reedereichef Erik Hånell. On the midday, the ship left the Iranian waters. "That's finished," he said to the Swedish television advisor SVT.
The Foreign Minister in London described the establishment of the ship as illegal. "This is part of a template of attempts to threaten the freedom of the sea. We work with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," said in a communication on Friday.
The Iranian Revolution Gardens had established the tanker on 19 July under the provision of having been abolished by the rule of the sea law in the Persian Golf. Seven of the 23 employees were already released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crowd members were in the same way, said Hånell. They would have been professionally able to join their families in the last ten weeks.
The British government smile behind the establishment of the "Stena Impero" a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar, where the beginning of July was a supertank with oil from Iran, which was intended to be put to the chain. The delivery was sent to the authorities against the EU sanctions against the Syrian War. The reference to the ship was received from the United States.
The Iran was finally released by the "Adrian Darya-1" in August, which was about a smooth business to be freed by the "Stena Impero", as London was oldly returned.
The street of Hormus is one of the most important seaways in the world. It is connected to the Persian Golf with the Indian Ocean. A majority of the world's oil exports is disappeared through the sea. In the past months the distances in the region were slowed. The trade ship was entered into the conflict between the United States and Iran.
Among the shocks between Teheran and Washington, the Atom Stretch of both countries. Americans will want to build nuclear weapons, and the Iranians returned to it. The United States were in 2018, in the Allegation of the International Atom Agreement which prevented the Iran in the construction of a atomic bomb and compliance with their political and economic isolation. Since then the US government sets the leadership in Teheran with massive economic organizations against the country to strike up a strict and other areas. The Iran is opposed to the pressure.
With regard to the fight on the "Stena Impero" and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Golf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the United States works for a coalition for military protection of trade ships in the region.
The Iranian President Hassan Ruhani had presented a UN Volunteer Assembly in New York a plan for security and peace on the street of Hormus, which would like to ensure that the Persian Golf coalition will be able to be able to ensure, together with the Arab Golf States and without foreign protection forces for the security of the shipping vessels in the Persian Golf.
Independence is a better future with its Protectionist Economic Policy.
In view of the criminal rights associated with the American President Donald Trump against Chinese producers, foreign producers in the People's Republic, it is obliged to redistribute. Financial chiefs of Asian trade warfare who are intended to make their production from China in a other country call India in an investigation of UBS as one of the preferentious alternatives. This is not only to do with the uncertainty of the Chinese-American trade wars.
But now India has been divided into Trumps focus. From the ski house of swimmingly referred to as "the Queen of Zölds", the United States has deleted the trade benefits for 2000 products in the first June. The U.S. regards high-interface rights and demands better market access for farmers, mobile phones, smilitures, motor leaders and others.
On the world map of trade wars, the Riberians with India are freely a side view. The world's largest democracy is also viewed by the security policy. Delhi and Washington bind the concern about China's powers in the Southern Ocean. In this background, an uncertainly seal of American Criminal Rights against India. In India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has arrived as a second five-year-old office, would therefore be safe.
The problem is, however, in another place: The imperially encouraging those that open markets accelerated the economic development, in the Socialist Republic of India, has been a serious position. The reformers aimed mainly on the bureaucratic Irish Irish, which has always been able to slowly undertaken any enterprises' spirit in the multinational state. Companions now receive rapid construction permits for buildings. They benefit from an improved energy and transport infrastructure and the conditions of the insolvency and concursion law to ensure that companies are able to liquidate high schools.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rakings, and in the first five-mode years of economic optics, in India, many have been able to improve, but it does not apply to trade policy, but to protect little international competitive enterprises against foreign providers, the national conservative government has created even new pains.
In the west, the model of the Nimbus of the energy reformers renewed its country economically radially. However, this impression is not debt to the state that the Carismmatic Prime Minister is only to know what vocabulary of the Western Managers would like. In the Kern, the "India Prime" advocate never depended on a Protectionist Economic Policy, which prevents that Indian companys are forced to solve an accronistic exhibition and that they would be satisfied for the global competition.
Adoption of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
The former French president Jacques Chirac will be introduced in Paris in the next week. The previous head of the State will be allowed on Monday at the Friedhof Montparnasse in the south of the French capital, reported the AFP Agency in vocational training to the Chiracs family. The location will be held in a close family circle. To Sunday, a public pleasant in Paris Invalidandom, as well as the media reports.
The competitors are aimed at: Dabo is the first home herd of the leastathletik-WM
The world's skin was a long time in the exciting Khalifa International Station. In the first time of the men, over 5000 meters from Aruba, Jonathan Busby was shocking dangerously. He could still be able to keep on the goal 300 meters before the goal, walking in unreasonable standing as Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau switched him and supported the last half stadium rounds in the goal. The forces were still rich in both ways to stop the goal with the weapons of the weapons.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same", said Dabo after the rain in Mixed area, when he had completely unexpectedly expected the attention of the collected journalists to himself. The shooting would never want to speak about his heritage. Finally he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he noticed that this would be difficult, he only wanted to help a suffering partner. And without all he would be proud to represent his country that was invited to the WM from the world's group. In normal circumstances he couldn't be able to start.
He did that at the night with a lot more intensive than he had thought about it. Because this herdent will be remembered. At the time, Dabo left his competitive busby, even volunteerly over the latest place - the other five minutes after the Ethioopian Selemon Barega, who wins this course. On the end, it was nothing to do, because the only busby reached with much help has been disqualified by the end of the World Lightline Association.
It was Dabo who lived in Portugal and studied there in Lisbon to set up a personal best time at the WM in Doha, which was often official data with 18:10.87 minutes, but he himself was deceived: "I wanted to walk 17:55 minutes. I was just a minute in 18 minutes."
Million machines: Egyptians are for wild Protest Day
In Egypt, the security measures have been strengthened in advance of possible governance critical protests. In the centre of Kairo, a strengthened police presentation was observed on Friday. several U-Bahn stations remained closed, locked roads to the central Tahrir plate.
In recent days, the police had strengthened their road controls, and the phones of footgrounds were in part searching on news and photos related to the protests.
Opposite of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, it was in Kairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura to protest with hundreds of participants. They protested against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critical corruption and misconduct. An open protest against the political leadership has not been given it for many years in Egypt. The Egyptian manufacturer, who lived in the Spanish exil, and shooting players Mohammed Ali, who had the demonstrations with videoboats on Facebook, has not given it for the present free day to a "millionary mars" central plans in the country. Alit is called a revolution for "V revolution".
The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) continued to have more than 1.570 prisons. The Egyptian Centre for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the Human Rights Organization (HRW) organization of Human Rights Watch (HRW) said more than 2.000 prisons. Independently, these figures were not first confirmed. The Government confirmed and not commented the numbers.
Volunteers
Many people were "weakly arrested" only because they were "fake to time on the wrong place" shared with HRW in vocational lawyers. The laws against the arrests are worthy according to details of their applicants of "distribution of false information" to membership in a "terroristic association". In Kairo, Alexandria and other cities, they asked for security forces in Uniform, but also in civil clothes, after HRW instructions.
HRW also criticized the centre in the North African country. Then the government blocks Kairo websites and online services to connect further protests against Sisi.
Online managers: Senders should be able to ship back
For online shoppingers, many lost packages are lost. About 20 million return countries so on the moon. But there is a alternative.
The Financial Ministry has shown online departments such as Amazon and Zalando a way how they can sell returned products instead of destroying them.
Although the companies could not be released from the transfer tax to Sachspends, the Ministry explained a question of the Green Day Group which reported the newspapers of the Funke Media Group on Friday. However, the handlers could apply the market value of the non-produced returns so low that they should not pay any or a few reimbursement taxes.
Scientists at the Bamberg University had identified that the federal citizens return to their sixth package on the Internet. Return four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - would then land in the mould. They would be funded by the company after the current legal situation, as the financial authorities evaluates the debts as a transfer to the tax.
The Green Fraction Chef Katrin viewing Eckardt requested the Financial Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify that companies can evaluate non-producing products in accordance with commercial products and expenditure to common organizations. The companies should not be allowed to be punished for costs, not only for online, but also for other businesses from the model load to the construction market.
Banksy expense for auction: There was never a better time to sell this furniture
The known work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", is to be improved first.
The Banksys work is understood by the "Reformation of the oldest parliamentary democracy of the world in the foundation made by animals and stages".
The work was first issued in the Museum of Bristol in Southern England, where Banksy lives. In this year, the artist had re-exhibited the event, as well as the original Brexit date on March 29, which was called the previous "Fragestune" named "Devolved Parliament" (delegated Parliament).
The image could change the owner for a million amounts.
Lastly, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had received a hard slaughter with the opposition in the midday after the first meeting of the subcontinent after a Johnson's resignation of a slaughter suspended by the Supreme Court. Johnson would also like to comply with the two-fold brexit already moved on October 31, as well as without agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, is in the Brexit debate. In Dover, in South England, he called a man who is a man who is a man who destroys a star of the European fleet. The work is seeing thousands of Lkw-fabrics and other visitors in the UK.
Brexit-debates are like a "spacing in the park"
The intense attacks of the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit's enemy in Parliament are not involved in a climate of hate. In comparison to the election campaign before the Brexit Referendum 2016, the current contraverse is a "spacegang in the park" said Dominic Cummings on Friday at a book presentation. "We will enjoy this. We will come out (of the EU) and we will win".
Johnson had a hard attack in the parliament in the past days and predicted them, among others, "training" to the people, and accused that he could put the Members in danger because they could be a goal of murder threats, he did as "humbug".
Cummings said that the only way to make peace again is that, if the Members would finally respect the decision of the United Kingdom for the outcome from the EU, it should not be surprised that people have been covered that Britain had not yet been out of the EU three years after the referencedum.
In view of the exciting smiling, even the Bishops of the English Church were to retain. "We should talk to each other with respect," he said in a statement. "and we should also listen."
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan requests one entry in Kaschmir
With a emotional appeal, the President of Pakistan, Iran Khan, again requested the United Nations to re-interrupte the Cashmir Conflict.
On the other hand, if a renewed war between the Pakistan and India, most likely, Khan said on Friday at the Un-General debate in New York. "When this is bad, you hope the best, but prepare to the worst." The United Nations had a responsibility for Kashmir. "If you should prevent this."
Independence from the British colonial rule in 1947, India and Pakistan have led three wars to the shared region of Cashmir. The two of the nuclear powers have dominated a part of Cashmir, another part of China. At the beginning of August the Indian Cashmir regions had decreased the autonomy status of the Indian Cashmir region and thus increased the spendings in the relative to Pakistan.
Not even a flash water
The demonstrators in Cairo demand the slaughter of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
With the present protests in Egypt, the government reacts with a hard hand, and it can shoot the population with a heavy munition, and more than 2000 prisoners are shocked in prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners that were already placed there. Protests were never in danger. However, since General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi was captured in 2013, the State apparatus makes everything to avoid a scenario as in Arab early times.
But one of the Protest 2011 solving was the bad economic situation. Poorness, perspectiveness and feeling to be switched by the own government, spend millions on the street. And this is a problem that the regime of el-Sisi does not get in the griff, even as hard it is against opposers.
Today, every third in Egypt lives under the poverty limit. Since 2016 the currency has lost more than half of its values, the inflation rate is ten percent. Those in the Supermarket want to buy a flash water must decide whom he finances: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. Lastly, it is not only responsible for the submission, but also for the largest economic actor. The military buildings, houses, football stadiums, produce food and many more. This was already before it. With the authorities have a lot of experience, the dilemma in the Supermarks is an alte market. It will always be critical if a large part of the population has a weakness of water.
Twiv tests in the terminal: BER-Chef: No "showstopper" more for main city flights
Two months has been tested whether the complex installations are working in the BER frame protection. The operators are satisfied with the loop, but the TV is not yet completed at the BER.

Hundreds of electric cable misses are still to be enhanced; the Tüv wants to examine it until February. "In order to create the conditions for the adoption of the aircraft, it must continue to be intensely worked in the processing of the missiles," said in a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said, in many cases it goes for lack of evidence, less about new cable. There is no deliverance for all the cable trails in which the cable trails are covered. The airport chief expects that these are present until the end of the year.
Furthermore, the burning protection works not satisfied with the transfer to the train station under the terminal. The problems of the project had been conducted in a further crisis three years ago. This time is about smoking smoking smoking in a flight as a slower so that the smoking is not extended. 36 engines should therefore be discussed. This is the beginning of the year to give new attempts to smoke.
Problems with burning protection and other trees and planning errors have been delayed by the opening of the airport for years. The costs have been operated since the beginning of 2006 from two billion to about 6,5 billion euros for the opening of the next year.
Because the passenger numbers in Berlin have been significantly increased, the responsible plans for the construction of the airport, and it should take place at a summer session of the Supervisory Board on October 18, as the President of Bretschneider announced.
The airport company now searches for two new business leaders. Finance Chef Heike Fölster changes the year's end to the German Bahn, Personal Chef Manfred Bobke-for Camen comes in rent in the next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She put the airport finances on firm feet.

The research project is the largest type of this in German space, shared the University Clinic Hamburg Eppendorf (UKE) on Friday. The Queen Foundation promotes the project with 12,5 million euros. From Switzerland, the High-Birgsklinik Davos, which belongs to the Foundation, and participates in the University’s Spital Zürich.
Overweight, smoking and unreal food includes the essential impacting risk factors for cardiac cycle diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the comparison between genes and external effects is not sufficiently known. Now the scientists want to compare the complete overcome of 8000 healthy people with the UKE of 1000 former patients.
Currently, more than 4000 of about 20,000 human genes pertinent were known in any possible changes of DNA - likened mutations - known by the clinic. Each year, some 200 adds.
The aim of the five-year project is to develop new options in terms of precaution, recognition and treatment of heart rhythmus disorders, heart weakness and heart infection. The data could also benefit from other people's diseases, such as Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University's heart and illness centre.
The Chairman of the Cowne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kuhne (82), also stressed the vast will to use the data to investigate other diseases. The Clinic of the Fundation in Davos has been treated up until all all all. Now, on the site, a centre for cardiovascular precision Medicine will be created for bioinformatics. To establish his commitments, the logistics in Switzerland has been organized in Hamburg three years ago and was very thankful to the open heart of the cardiovascular precision.
The biographics of healthy participants are from Hamburger, who also constituted at the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 probands, the largest local health study of the world is, according to the specifications of the clinical clinic, which is strict to protect the data of anonymized, the scientists. It goes to a petabyte (1000 Territories) to data, said Holger Moch from the University's university pital Zurich.
The heritage of a person today can be decrypted within 24 hours, and the clean expert costs are at EUR 1300. The first gene sequence of the world, which was published in 2001, has also costed several hundreds of millions of euros. The study will begin on October 1, the end of the year 2020 will be analyzed by all 9000 samples.
Nigerian police releases hundreds of mistreated boys
In Nigeria, the police freed more than 300 murdered and misused boys from a coran school. After the instructions of the people, the security forces in the northern Kaduna city and discovered the victims in part as the police speaker Jacobu Sabo reported. "The victims were mistracted. Some of them gave their teachers to be enforced," said Sabo.
The kids were maintained under the front of teaching in the Korean and being "excepted". Indeed, their teachers were maintained under "the most delicate and inhuman conditions", said Sabo. For hundreds of students, including nine years of age, were in a small room.
The Coran School showed the details for about ten years. The authorities would have taken note of repeated irregularities in the institution. The parents had shown themselves shocked when they were taught about the situations in the Coran School, said Sabo. They hadn't opened anything from the suffering of their children. The employer and six employees were arrested according to the police.
In the most Muslim Northern Nigerians, there are many private coran schools. They replace the often lack of State institutions. People in the region suffered by a common attack of armed bands. According to the information of the United Nations Refugee Help work in the past 10 months, over 40,000 people cross the borders in the neighbouring Niger.

World flight selection: Additional forecasts to Messiss and Klopps Kür
football "not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe
With a gala in Mayland, the World Fussball Association Fifa is the best player, the best player and the best trainer of the year. For Lionel Messi, it is the sixth food and record.
After Nicaragua's captain explained that he never agreed to the World Fussballer Wheel, other countries have come to the Fifa. Egyptians have not been evaluated - with a curious foundation.
In the past years, many of the Fifa has proved that the WM's dubical plans of their President Gianni Children, the general behaviour of different corrupt functioners, and the Fif-World Flower's WM has not yet been suspected to go unprotected - if you think that the stimulated national trainer and national membership capitals of membership are often in a way of sympathy because, according to an objective assessment, it is not possible.
But after Nicaragua's captain had not agreed, he has now added further independences: Egyptians claim that the votes of the National Train Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. In fact they are in the official and publicly advisable vote overview.
The Fifa regrets that "the signatures on the electoral forms were not valid and therefore were not valid". The Egyptian association has been contacted several times in order to clarify the situation - without answer.
Sudans Trainer also wondered
In the case of Egypt, the Sudan’s association has not agreed as a result of the election. While the sequence is complete in the case of Egypt, the Sudan's association agreed that Trainer Zdravko Lugarisic has not agreed as finally evaluated: Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three occasions. According to Fifa, the vote was in the exact way, with signs and official stones of the Sudan Association.
In his case, the Nicaragua captain Juan Barrera also said: "Don't agree to the #TheBest2019 Awards. All information on my voice is wrong, thanks."
From the association now, the report: Successful, but it wasn't a purpose. The completed election documents were "unfortunately" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, were identified in a communication of the association. However, in fact, he chose the second captain Manuel Rosaz. "We take the responsibility for the administration error," said in the Communication. Although Rosas and Managers Henry Duartes had agreed for the Messiah, "as it is in the official list of FIFA."
The other cases can check the Fifa in an investigation now, but it stresses that the choices were monitored outside by the PriceWaterhouseCoopers company. As long as Lionel Messi remains the only unrelated winner of the World Fuzzy and Jürgen Klopp World Trainer of the year.
Ukrainian Africa: Ranghohe Republicans speak for official investigation
Two random Republicans have opened themselves to an official investigation against the US Chairpersons and Participant Donald Trump. "I think that the investigation is important," said the Republican Governor of the United States Communist State Vermont, Phil Scott. "If it comes from here, it will be determined by the facts that are determined." He wants to know more about the Whistleblower affairs before being taken action.
Scott said he wasn't surprised by the enthusiasms, and they showed that Trump the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selensky had once again asked in a phone at to investigate the activities of the Democratic Chairman and former Vice-President Joe Biden in Ukraine.
The Republicans have retreated the Trump criticism because of the Whistleblower's affairs, only few have recognized inevitablely. Scott's statements are now a first sign in the Trumps party, and Virginia's moderate Governor had already been applied to the Trump Political policy, about the locking of environmental protection rules and the strengthening of immigration rules.
When other random Republicans, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, also said for the investigation, "It's a deep devastating situation," said Baker. "The right action and responsibility for the Congress is now to investigate the matter and to go on the basis."
Scott and Baker, as a Governor of the United States, formally have no discussion in the anti-trump procedure, which will be decided in the Congress, which is particularly symbolically important. However, the first Senators of the Republic of the United States have also expressed critically about the situation.
The business could be in place in the introduction of an official detention procedure against Trump, which the Democratics in the Representative House have announced an investigation, and they put him on the use of powerful misconduct for the purpose of foreign impact on their own political benefits.
There is no precise schedule for the Office of Representatives, and the majority of democratics in the Representative House could emphasize a so-called impact, but the decision on a real office was made in the Senate where Trumps' Republicans have the majority, and the perspectives of success of such procedures are therefore less, and there is no president of the United States who has been taken up by an Implementation procedure.
Should the shooter at the board of Rackets "Sea Watch"?
Three men were arrested in Vienna, they should have forced and murdered in Libyan refugees.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after she was arrested with the Sea Watch 3 ship and 53 libyan refugees on Borde has not allowed to control the port of Lampedusa. After strong protests and international criticism, also by Austrian Federal President Alexander van der Bellen, her home prison was recovered after a few days from a Italian judiciary.
Now there are new severe forecasts against the rats. So three men who were subjected to torture in libyan refugee pools would be reached in Italy with the "Sea-Watch 3" in Italy. The suspects are being taken in a accompanying camp in Mexico (Switzerland) after migrants had recognised their penners in Italy. "We can't exclude it, but they themselves have no safe information", said "Sea Watch" speaker Ruben New Builders of the German Press Agency.
The police was called by the police in Middle September that the suspects were assaulted, killed and even killed by the North African country. It was Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically discovered and executed, by repeated and permanent physical violence," said at that time in the communication.
NGOs and aid organizations now point out that they can't know exactly who come on to the ships. "We can't scan who are the people. They come without pass," said New Bauer. Folder is one of the main reasons why people run from Libya. So it's probably that the murders are also on the ships. "It's therefore very important that it comes."
Italian former Minister Matteo Salvini requested racket, which was still identified for an illegal immigration aid in Italy.
Musk seeks the extradition record at Tesla
The Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given its electronic auto-concerts with the perspective of new record numbers.
"We have the opportunity to reach our first quarter with 100,000 delivery", Musk wrote in a email issued by the Branchen Blog "Electrec" to Tesla employees.
The question is strong, so that Tesla could use 110,000 orders, it continued to write in Musks rounds. The challenge is to bring the cars to the customer. Thus Tesla should offer as far as many resources as possible.
In the second quarter of Tesla had been delivered well 95,000 cars and thus reached its best value.
Musk needs recursing to achieve its high objectives. 2019 he wants to deliver totally 360,000 to 400,000 cars. This requires six-year-old numbers. In particular, the most favorable Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here the profit rates are low. Despite the boom losses.
US Budget Street: Re-financed only a bridge
The new budget year will be started in the United States on 1 October without a general budget. The Senate has followed the Representative House on Thursday and has decided to transit finance until 21 November.
While the American Congress and President Donald Trump in August have agreed to increase the expenditure limits for the financial year 2020 and 2021, the United States have decided before the new fiscal year started on October 1 October. The Senate has followed the Representative's budget on Thursday and has still taken a transitional financing (Continuation Resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without that decision, on Monday, on Monday, it would be taken to a shutdown, a part of the federal administration.
Shutdown interrupted
The federal management will now be funded at the level and, in accordance with the priorities of the expenditure plans for the end of the financial year 2019, which, since the Congress is not temporaryly able to have some of the 12 expenditure laws that provide the various departments and authorities, it is therefore not possible to benefit from the extensive budget framework for 1.3 Bio. to $1.4.
The Democratics have completed ten of the 12 legislation in the Representative House, but the expenditure laws reflect priorities of the Democratics who have no chance in the senate dominated by the Republics, and also have ten of the 12 expenditure plans, which are less likely to be more or less ready to be less popular.
The Spirits are mainly on the resource allocation for domestic security and border security. In the Senate, the Republicans are trying to obtain $12 billion for the wall construction, one of the great priorities of President Trump. Democratics are struggling to the wall plans and their financing, which are actually for other military buildings and projects. The fight on the wall was already calied and led to a 35-day shutdown in December 2018.
The spirits are divided on the wall construction
It is unexpected to how the parties want to approach this issue. Probably as an agreement to all 12 expenditure laws in the coming seven weeks is a prorogation of transitional financing over 21 November, and a shutdown is not then excluded.
In the context of the continuing incapacity of the Congress, some of the twelve expenditure laws at the time, and the persistent risk of a shutdown wins ideas on the automatization of the process to popularity. Proposal S. 1877 for avoiding Shutdowns, the financing of the Federal Management would automatically continue at the previous year level, joining the relevance of the parliamentarys and retaining their wages until the new annual expenditure plans are proposed.
France allows artistic shipment for lessons and Singles
In France, the artistic movement is also opened for single women and lives in the future: the Paris National Assembly agreed largely with a majority of the laws of the Government, which all women can take an in vitro relief, and should also increase the demand for anonymous seeds.
The presentation also requires the approval of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debates, critics had warned in the right place that in the future can grow a number of "children without father" and the French Bishop Conference is against the renewal.
The new arrangement is the part of a bioethic sequence, which defended the Minister of Health Agnès Buzyn as "Chance" for society. It was the modern family where there are children with only one part of a family or homosexual parents. After their opinion, the costs for artificial experiences for all women of social insurance should be made.
Prohibition with Sperma of all husbands
With a pretty majority of the National Assembly, a amendment should be given to the widows for an artistic exhibition to the sphere of their dead husbands. In Belgium, Spain and Britain, the artificial "post-mort" movement was allowed. In Germany, there were cases where women were complained about the specimen of a murderer. The enemy of the presidency was argued in Paris, and then a so-called child was a "spectacular squecksal".
Many deputy members of the Government party La Republic en Mare (the Republic in the movement, LREM) from President Emmanuel Macron and the deputy of the opposition had, however, expressed themselves on the artistic movement with the sphere of the murdered partner, and they pointed out that a widow will be a "double trauer" if the death of her husband still remained unpleasant.
The initiativers of the current amendment proposed are injustice that a widow can be condemned by the specimen of an unknown person but not with their own partner.
Before now, the artistic freezing in France is only permitted to theeroexual couples that can not be witnessed. They must be married or at least two years. Buzyn has already announced in the summer that the maternality continues to be banned.
In Germany, the art flexibility of all women is theoretically open - for single or lesbian pairs, however, it is often difficult.
Counterpayment for climate: Call for aircraft for Uniteds will be lower
The high schools will be flying much, so the country will like to make an climate allocation there, and the rectors say they had no money for it, but now they are also under pressure.
The high schools should also be limited to flights. Photo: dpa/Julian Strategy Schules
The discussion before the summer breakfast was held on a climate allocation to flights of universities and high schools. After the country recruitment conference skeptically reacted to a corresponding post from the green-free coalition, the plans are now supported from high schools. In a common statement, the doctors of six Baden-Worldberg Universitys and a padagogical high school for compensation of services. This is now the first step of "needly necessary" would also be a broad debate on the admissibility of flights in their opinion.
Russia reiterates North Korean fishermen
According to the secret service FSB, the arrests have been illegally covered in Russian waters. Ten days ago, 161 fishers from North Korea have been arrested, and then there was a shock between border protectors and shipment. The three Russians and a North Korean, the fishermen later injured its serious violations.
The Communist Corea leads to chronic food shortages. The North Korean fishermen were then walking in Russian waters. The Russian coastal wave is rounded by their own information on the protection of their multibiological resources patrouilles.
30,000 thinfish swimming click
In the renewed controls, 30,000 tons of fishes were discovered and invited. In addition, the details were invited after three fishermen and two motor boats and entered Suodka and Posjet at Wladiwostok.
The Russian fisheries advisers did not have issued fanc licenses to the North Koreans this year, and thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been arrested in this year.
The leader of the Russian fishing companies' association in the Province of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently condemned high environmental damages by the North Korean fishermen. They fished closely synthetic networks that were prohibited in Russia, which would also have helped small lives from the sea. In addition, the networks would be simply discharged in the sea where they needed 200 years to be devastated.
Currently only 18.000: US decrease asylum overall
The "greatest nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with the selected police representatives in the white house.
The most rich country of the earth is shocking against protective demanders: As the Foreign Minister in Washington confirms, the upper limit for the legal access of refugees is continued to be deleted. In recent cases, it is important to receive threatened believers and Iraqi asylum.
However, the US government wants to reduce the low-border borders for the adoption of new refugees, but in the year 2020, which is in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, at least 18.000 people, as the US Foreign Minister stated, the limited year is now nearly 300,000 people.
The Government of President Donald Trump has triumphated the reception preparation for protective demanders from all the world in the past few years, and under the operational government of Barack Obama, there were wisely higher boundary limits.
The highlighting level of 18.000 refugees would be the lowest since the United States Refugee Programme in 1980. However, the United States's Ministry was called "the most complete and most strict nation in the history", a formulation which is strongly reminded of the use of the official US President.
A "responsibilities-consciousness" with refugees was intended to declare that refugees can return to their homelands to help them to rebuild there. For his hard course in migration policy, he receives a lot of right from the attendants, but there is also a massive critical.
In order to finance a border, Trump had the national emergency. If there is an temporary link between the current measure and the current internal policy developments in the United States Headquarters, it is unwise. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selensky's assets and a potentially threatening administrative restraint procedure.
The US government wants to concentrate on the inclusion of two groups of refugees in the future: those who are following because of their faith - and Iraqi, who have helped the United States military in the country, and have been in danger, as the Declaration of the Foreign Minister is, which must be included by Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador at least 1500 refugees.
The United States wants to achieve that, in particular, people from this "North Trieck" Mediterranean in other countries asylum, the United States have only concluded with Guatemala and now with El Salvador and Honduras migration agreements in order to register migration to the Southern American border in Mexico.
The Court orders the release of persons from Zoo to
A people-Utan-Women has been registered on the demands of the Argentinan justice from the former Zoo of Buenos Aires in a Headquarter for Humans in the United States. In 1986, the "Sandra" born in Rostocker Zoo, "Sandra" was deemed the rights of a "non-human person", so it was forced to be released. The animal was sent to Dallas, but not as a passenger, but in a fraud room as the lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez declared.
Since the 53 kilograms of serious human economy is not able to adapt the life in the wilderness, it is to live in the future in the free of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 more people and 31 pounds, including "Bubbles", former household of Popster Michael Jackson. "Sandra" is still a 40-day quarentane in the Sedugwick County Zoo in Wichita in Cansas, where it is to be in Florida.
"Sandra" passed after her birth in Rostock a few years in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelenkirchen, before she was entered into Buenos Aires in 1995. The 2014 strict animal protection process on "Sandras" fundamental rights has helped to transform the Zoo of Buenos Aires into an ecopark. To date of 2023, a research and educational centre to maintain the variety of species.
Register for Swiss Extremberg Level: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extreme hill of Dani Arnold is a new husarenit at the nearly 3,000 meters higher skin in the Italian alpen.
Without the network, double land or other tools, the Swiss was the 550 meters high northwave of the big wine in a new record time.
Beat with Jeans, T-shirt and only supported by absolute skin liberty, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the resort. Thus he took the old Bestmark for almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now recorder in Free Solo Speed at four of the six most important European walls.
Nike benefited from new online marketing strategy
The US Sports manufacturer Nike has produced a significant advantage of the trade conflict with China. The net profits increased at $1,4 billion in the past quarter of $1,3 billion (approximately 1,3 billion). This is more than 25 percent in the past period, as the concerts shared on Tuesday. This is mainly the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", with the Adidas Concourn online turns to its customers.
In the three-month period until the end of August, 10.7 billion dollars. The Nike sales paid more than 22 percent in China. This also benefited the Concerts from Beaverton in the United States Body State of Oregon from its approach to directly establish consumers from the Internet or Smartphone Apps.
Financial Chief Andy Campion announced that with strategic investment, Nike will continue to advance the "digit transformation" of the sport manufacturer and build its advantages of competition. The investors reacted with the quarter numbers - the shares of the sport manufacturer were over five percent.
Lifelanges Station prohibition for racism in Italy
For racist comments on football prophecy Juan Jesus by AS Rome, the United Nations from the capital Italian city has linked a long-term stadium ban against a fan. The defendant Jesus was struck by the fan on instagram. Jesus published the private news and asked to take his club to take action. "@officialasroma you already know what you should do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. Stolz to be who I am," wrote the 28th Jorge since 2016 at AS Rom.
The agreement reacted on Thursday afternoon. He reported the fan account at Instagram and the police. Moreover, the Roman attachers should never visit a game of the agreement, wrote the club on Twitter.
The racism is a problem in the Italian football. Normally skandal Italian fans of racist decisions against black players rivalizing. "We cannot have no racism in society or sports. In Italy, the situation has not improved, and it is very serious. You have to identify the responsible identification and cut out of the stages," had Fifa President Gianni Infantino said in the weekend. The exhibition was a racist partner in the real ligation between Atal Bergamo and the AC on Sunday.
However, the Italian authorities have now undertaken 38 randalious fans of Rekordmeister Juventus Turin with stadion bans, and four of them should not be involved for a period of ten years, shared the police. For the exiles, they apply the prohibition of four to seven years.
The fans are associated with run-up investigations against 12 leaders of Ultra fans in the area of Juventus. The twenty-five was designed to play a role among other serious pressures, money weights and private violence. The club had made the investigations with an indication last year.
The Ultra leaders should stood the tickets after Italian media reports behind the black trading. They would have been controlled "military controlled" for the fancourve and have been pressed by Juventus-military workers to come to post-state cards.
Generation Z: Is she really different from Generation Y?
Millenniums are narcistical, generation Z is political - all the years will be considered with strict names. If you look precisely, the marks are full of contradictions. How do you really describe these labels the feeling of young people?
"The Kraps come!", started officially on September 21th, on the Gucheng Sea in Gaochun, with the opening session of 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as it was announced by the Nnjing-Gaochun District Committees.
Gaochun, who is the Southern Exploitant of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental areas. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and is also the Chinese site of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has an environmental view of ideal conditions with a mixing of "30% mountains, 20% water surfaces and 50% fields". The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all conditions to become rich.
In the early 1990s, people in Gaochun have started with the snack of snakes.

Conflict between Iran and USA: Ruhani speaks from the end of the sanctions - Trump against
The Iranian President Hassan Ruhani, after returning from the United Nations Voluntary Assembly, spoke of an appropriate offer of the United States for sanctions, and the United States had not been able to discuss with the Tehran leadership on its official website.
However, the US President Donald Trump was opposed to the Iranian Office colleague on Twitter: "The Irani wanted to put up the sanctions against him so that there is a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani declares the event: the Federal Officer Angela Merkel, the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the French President Emmanuel Macron had been attended in New York and had struggled that a meeting was held. "And America says I have taken sanctions," added Ruhani. The type of criminal measures that should be completed has been held at the debate. "And they have clearly said that we had taken all sanctions."
However, if this prosecution is not acceptable, the criticized Ruhani. In view of the existing criminal measures and "the dismissed atmosphere of the maximum pressure" no one can predict the start of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, Kanzler Angela Merkel met Ruhani in New York and was the hope of the European people to save a nuclear agreement with the Iranian and the Islamic Republic to develop nuclear weapons. President Emmanuel Macron, as Merkel at the United Nations Vulture Assembly, expressed the hope that Ruhani will meet with President Donald Trump with the US.
Black earthquake near Istanbul - Fast 200 Travellers
After the western Turkey was shocked within a short time of two earthquakes, the fear of a catastrophy increased. 34 people were injured at the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the breakfast was nearly 200 afternoon, the Turkish Vice-President Fuat Oktay said on Friday. This increased the concern for a disaster.
14 schools in Istanbul were closed from security reasons, and hundreds of buildings were damaged. The earthquake of 5.8 had been shocked on Thursday, the Marmara region before Istanbul and was dissolved in the millions of meters. Now the government wants to set a Commission to prepare a better country on earthquake.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been prepared sufficiently on beasts, said Ethanbuls Citizens Meister Ekem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the late danger is always ignored. Each year, badly built households - made by the many smaller earthquakes that are regularly shocked by Istanbul.
City planners such as the famous architects Mucella Tekici have been warned for many years that large open areas in the centre have been built as refugees. First on the 20th anniversary of the Goltrek Beach in August, the building chamber of Istanbul warned that estimated a million buildings in Istanbul would not be insurance.
The Epicentrum of the beach from Thursday was located in the maritime sea front of the Silivri district and around seven kilometers deep, as the Afad Protection Authority shared. A smaller neighbouring surrounded a few minutes later for more panics on the streets.
The Istanbulan citizensman Ekem Imamoglu was first not reported on Twitter, lost or damage. TRT showed people cut in panics from the houses. Schools were brought from the Silivri district from security grounds. Some students wined as they were seeing images.
Istanbul is particularly threatened to the earth; under the maritime sea, a section of the so-called Northanatolic disaster is marked by the borders between the Eurasian and the Anatolic Earth Platt. Turkey will always be shocked by earthquakes. One of the most dead was the beast in the nearest of Istanbul in 1999.
For researchers, fear that a earthquake of 7.1 to 7.4 could threaten. But when it comes to the earthquake, it is unexpected. At the earthquake on Thursday, the west of the country and Istanbul again was found.
firms develop emergency plans, private bags, so called Go-Bags with all needy people are ready to be packed next to house doors, and schools contribute to children as they have to be taken when the earth wakes. When the next big beast comes, be unclean.
The Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan said after his return from New York, eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered slightly. The Estonian Citizensman Exem Immoglu followed the developments of the Istanbulan Catastrophe Coordination Center (Acom). After this information, two miners of Moscheen in the area of Acilar and Sariyer.
Warning for neighborhood in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users reported to panics. buildings watched. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone guides were interrupted. It was stronger than the service day, writes a user. The chief of the Turkish red halfmonds, Kerem clinic, warned by Twitter. He called the people to stay closed from buildings that had caused visible damages.
The time of the beast is specified according to official information at 13.59 p.m. only a few minutes after the first beach, there was CNN Turkey's post that was given with a strength of 4.0 on the direction scale.
First, on Thursday, a earthquake of strength 4,6 was shocked by the Turkish maritime region, and it was to see it until Istanbul. The Epicentrum also was located in the Marameer west of the millions of meters, the Afad Protection Authority has already shared on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that was careful for slaughter lines on Tuesday: Pakistan was also taken by a serious earthquake.
For researchers, it can be said that it could come to a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the swimming between the Tekton plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that they will ever be deleted - and massive damages will be caused.
Earth researcher Ersoy calculates that the earthquake is now a warning. If it became more likely, he said to CNN Turk. "This might be the signs of a larger earthquake", he said Ersoy to sender. "Free or later the great beast will come."
Preparing a few weeks ago, the beast also solved great concerns in Istanbul. In Albania it had also given a strong earthquake just a few days ago - it had been 68 injured.

We'll get you out soon, OK?", says a man. The aircraft regreted himself at all flights. Open was opened first if the woman gets a delay.
The Caker Lake: From Kafka inspired: Ian McEwan writes Brexit-Roman

McEwan was quoted with the words: "When the Parliament is closed, the government can not be asked in a critical moment if the Minister is unfairly lied as the Soviet leader, if the Brexite leaders in high positions were to flee the disaster of a No Deal, then a writer must ask what he can do. It's just a answer to write." From McEwan was only a machine in the early year of the Roman "Motors like I" about artistic intelligence.
Cafkas was first published in 1915 by Gregor Samsa, who is waiting for a morning, and seeing "in an unexpected unexpected unfortunate person", is excluded after and after family and society. "Ian McEwan has been struggled before Cafka to describe a world that is the head," said the Diogene Vergag.

This is also the bookings of the Marken Thomas Cook Signatura, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann travels, OGER TOURS, Bucher travels and Air Marin, which are already paid or fully paid. How it is about traveling starting from 1 November 2019, the company stops open. In vote with the insolvency insurance is checked the further step.
Thomas Cook in Germany was in the sweet of the British Mother's Congress and made an insolvency request on the midnight. The company that belongs to the Neckermann travels, view tours and bucher travels in Germany has been employed for about 2000 people.

Based on booking information and without special accounts, the hotels should now receive 50% of the following payments, as a Zurich speaker of the German Presse Agency said. "This applies immediately and under the conditions that Thomas cook travelers of these hotels are immediately not immediately requested or needed to individual payment of hotel accounts."
The insurance reacted to the reports of hotel guests who were able to pay their accommodation on their own place, and some have to put the table more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Reis Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had criticized this.
As many hotels have been involved, on Friday with the insolved traveller, the insurance speaker said. According to details on Thursday, 70 000 Thomas Cook-Pauschalu holidays from Germany were still insured. The Zurich Germany has made a vacation and return to the Thomas-Cook customers.
Insolvency managers want to continue to continue to three Thomas cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
However, the current announced payments to hotels by the Zurich Insurance helps only travellers who are still walking. For Thomas-Cook clients who want to fly in the holidays, it seems bad. On the late Thursday, the company shared all travels to October 31, and also for such bookings that were already paid.
As to travel with starting from 1 November 2019, the company has been opened. In vote with insolvency insurance, the further procedure is tested. In particular, it is responsible for this case also for the insurance of the insurance. The sale of new travels is stopped. dpa.
The company refers to the Surich insurers that can be presented by the company Caera. customers may inform the possibilities of repayment of the travel price and apply their requirements via a webform.
Prince Harry destroyed splengmine in Angola
Prinz Harry continues the commitment of Lady Diana. In Africa he now walks directly on the scenes of his mother.
With a blue slipler protection weight, the British prince Harry in Angola has buried and destroyed a spring mine.
In a camp of the British Halo Trust at the Dirico place on Friday morning, he put the quarter of the TV cameras. In safe removal, the swimming body explosed in the Savanian country without damage. Although only the Halo strip has destroyed over 100,000 decades of blue conflicts in the African country, there are still more than 1000 mining fields that threaten to the population.
On the fifth day of his African trip, Harry wanted to walk directly in the city of Huambo on the shoes of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same splengismester, who first joined his mother, he wanted to turn back to the way she went. The images on which Princess Diana 1997 went through a slightly mining field were going to the world. She also showed support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have since Monday on a ten-day African journey that began in the South African Tourist Pole Capstadt.
Stockende Brexit negotiations: The risk of a No-Deal remains akt
In fact, Primer Boris Johnson was clearly determined: it will not guarantee a third decrease of the Brexit negotiations, but what sentences can be carried out at the polarising Brits from eternal duration. The recent sentence of the Supreme Court in Britain would be as a hamoklelecese over the Blondsshop. His sustainability of Parliament to carry out its Brexit course until the date of arrival has been cancelled. Johnson has always been abolished in the beginning of this week.
Boris Johnson keeps the deal for it
However, the pressure seems not to be spoilable to go to Johnson, and in this way he made it possible for the visit of a hospital and that he supported negotiations in the case of non-classification until the end of October:
You know, we'll hold up the law.
At the same time, however, we are convinced that we will leave the EU at 31 October.
I'm carefully optimistic that it's smelling.
And the time of the Brexit Manufacturers in Brussels is all over six weeks, but the EU and the British Prime Ministers have now most difficult to prevent the end of the European Union to prevent Great Britain without agreements, but the recent discussions have no interruption. A agreement seems more difficult to be present until the end of October. The British Prime Minister does not have the law, it is a renewing date of arrival, but the opposition of the Prime Minister does not bear in mind that Johnson would be in the case of a No-Deal Brex.
U.S.: More death accidents by e-Zube
The number of losses related to the use of e-smoking in the United States has increased to twenty-five. In addition, 805 in this connection, the US Health Authority shared the CDC. A study in the New England Journal of Medicine has already been more than 900 affected, confirmed about 500 of them. The cause for lacking damages is still unexpected. In Europe, there is not a similar increase in losses. The applicants seem to be limited to the users in the United States.
The fear of new protests in Egypt increases
A million times, Mohammed Ali's videos were shared in online networks. The manufacturer and players in Spain calls for a "volks revolution". For the volks revolution today, he called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Egyptian militarys who offer critical corruption and misconduct. Ali is expected to join with a million participants in central places of the country.
In any case, the security authorities are alarmed. In the centre of Kairo, there was already an increased presence of the police. several U-Bahn stations remained closed, locked roads around the central Tahrir plate. In recent days, the police had strengthened their road controls, and the hands of footgrounds were divided on news and photos related to the protesters.
On September 20, the demonstrators also gathered around the Tahrir plate.
Last weekend, it came to protest with hundreds of participants in Kairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura, and such an open protest has not been given in Egypt for years. Successfully reacted to the security forces. According to details of human rights organizations of human rights Watch (HRW) almost 2000 people have been arrested last week. Many of them had been recently arrested - only because they were "for a false time on the wrong place", they shared HRWs with lawyers.
The organization also criticized the centres in the North African country, which blocks the government in Kairo websites and online services to bind further protests against al-Sisi. The General governments the country since 2013, after he had destroyed the elected Islamic president Mohammed Mursi.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs of Grönland-Expedition
The Polarforscher Arved Fuchs was returned on Friday by his Grönland expedition. He was welcomed at his arrival in Hamburg port, including the Skipper Boris Herrmann, Greta Thunberg, with the "Malicia" renjacht over the Atlantics.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs studied and documented the consequences of the earthwarming in the past months on his "Dagmar Aaen" ship on the Coast Islands and Greece.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the Polish researcher. He has waited for years to report the young generation to words. They knew that the earth was warmed for decades. However, many of them were as a planet B.
"What happens on the sea is often found out of publicity", said Fuchs. He and his team wanted the people to inform the effects of the earthwarming and the destruction of the seas. When the expedition was avoided by a droid of Greece and was pesed by microplastics, it was called.
For its "fight for a sustainable and respectful use of the world's sea", the polar researchers from Bad Bramstedt was a great example in the Hamburg climate dinner with the "Seadevcon Maritime Award". "For all those who live in the heart of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great example", said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the prices. "He is a witness of changes that have been given in the arctics in the last decades."
There Spaghetti in Rome: Tourist payments for Nudeln 430 EUR
430 euros for two tears Spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near England in Rome: It seemed to be too much for two Japanese tourists. The account of 80 euro drink payment was included by the two women, but they posted the departure on Facebook, which reacted with slight reactions.
“Their cases are harmful to the view of Rome. We ask the police to ask to ask whether it is a fraud,” asked a speaker of Federation, the association of travel leaders in Rome according to the Roman Day Journal Il Messaggero (Freeday Exhibition).
Soon the reaction of the owners of the restaurant. The Japanese were not only appointed by Spaghetti but also for fresh fish, the local owner justified. However, this is not to take out of the account. A drinking payment from up to 20% of the account was normal, the guest said.
A call in Ukraine, and all it is broken? President Donald Trump, US President, could be faced with the turbulent enthusiasms of the last few days with a official detention procedure, which democracy wants to test the investigation in the Representative House as soon as possible - the speech is from weeks until a decision falls.
At the beginning of the Scandals, the telephone at the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj, the proposal of the Whistleblower, which has finally taken the discussion on national security and the democracy of the United States with its complaints, is monstrous: the President has missed the power of his office to instrumentize the Government of another country to influence the election 2020. He has used the dependance of Ukraine in this way and wants to force them to be actived against a political enemy.
The kernel of this project is also to comply with Selensky's discussions, although it does not return to the complete word. The phonemat of 25 July is only an episode of a much larger history, in which the center is mainly its personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story takes from the view of the public in May 2019 its beginning when the New York Times of Reiseplanes reports in Ukraine. He wants to meet in Kiev with the elected President Selenskys, and the lawyer itself knows that his purposes are very heavy. "We do not take us into a choice that we're missing us in a finding which we have the right," says the newspaper. You can say that it's unlikely, but "daran is nothing illegal."Juliani wants to be followed in Ukraine for the investigations that there is no basis - for this information is very helpful for my people to be helpful for my government.
The lawyer and former New York citizensman seems to have been infected with the right conspiration officials that have been fixed on Trumps' opposition in 2016: Hillary Clinton has conspirated with actors in Ukraine, said the critics at the time to build a case for Russian employees in the United States. However, this project was never serious.
This is exactly the investigation of the Trump on July on the phone with Selensky, which says: The former Vice-President and the current candidates for the Presidency of the Democratics, Joe Biden, have been the U.S. Officer of the Obama Government on the release of the former U.S. General Officer Wyctor Schokin. However, in order to stop the investigation of the guest company, in the Board of Supervisory of his son of Hunter-Biden, the senior Biden has financed the curriculum of his family.
In fact, the end was something different. When Joe Biden requested that the Ukrainian general lawyer should go, the investigations against the gas company were already closed, the shokins were never directly affected. Scokin was also proposed the most corrupted shocks that the US government was not the only western partner who was on his departure. In the overall, the Obama government was even expressly supported the investigations against the company.
Disorders at Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disorders at Instagram and Facebook. In particular, Germany, Britain and Spain are affected. The users report that Facebook has not always been loaded since about 15.30 p.m. Instagram also shows that the error message could not be loaded. Whatsapp seems to be affected by the distortion, even if not even at the same time.
Instagram and co. opening of disorders
It is not the first massive crash in this year. Prepared in March and July the services were deleted for several hours, and as in the previous cases, users also turn back on Twitter to make their bad air.
Polish scientists in Antarctica saved
Three Polandian scientists were saved from the chilean air weapons from the ice of Antarctics. They were with a shooting boat on the road and several miles away from their base, as they paid their engine. They had happiness in unfortunately - less than a hour needing the chilean saving shooter for the discussion.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4 Chile air responsibilities:
"As 9:30, we received the message, for a short time before we started, and a good 20 minutes later, we were over the smoke boat."
From 1977 on King George Island, Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station, 19 scientists worked there. The frozen researchers were safely returned to their research station.
Attention: Smartphone NIE load without cable
Practical but harmful
Indutive technology through Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
As far as several new smartphones have come to the market, supporting cableless downloads and sell themselves very well - all before the new iPhone-11 models, we want to call a study of early July in memory. The free load of mobile devices is extremely practical but not appropriate.
High temperature set to battery
Scientists are warned before the unclean load of Smartphones. This is the expertise of the University of Warwick for the devices that are very harmful. For this reason, there is a clearly larger heat development. A normal phone for cable, the battery is up to three hours on 27 degrees. In cableless loads, the researchers themselves have been measured on the perfect direction of the smartphone on the ladepad. It is still measured over 30 degrees. Like the phone somewhere next to the slipper, the temperature is even higher.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researcher, the temperature is a crucial factor for the stopperability of batteries. This is because each degree plays a role. When loading with higher temperatures, the battery is not only to the capacity but also not so long. The life period is lower. The researchers reason to load the smartphone always by cable. As a battery is still connected to the costs of modern smartphones, the app has a free switch. The app has also the costs for a battery even increased.
Practical
The technology is extremely pleasant:After launching the device on a suitable loadpad - they are already already in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery will be loaded without quiet cable salt and powerful steel flights. As it is for Qi (inductive energy transmission) a global standard, where even apple is very closely, there is little limitations. However, the machine should only apply the researchers in derogation.
Everest-Stau photo: 13 8 thousand in six months
A nepalese mountain increase has reached its own information within only six months 13 of the 14 higher mountains of the world. Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the pitches of the Manaslu in Nepal and thus set a record, shared its expedition event.
The former soldier wants to reach all 14,000 months in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He once made international slaughter lines: from him is a photo of mountain increases that are on the Mount Everest Slange.
The image of the Massenandrang has solved a debate on stronger security measures on the 8848 meters higher mountains and the highest crowd of the earth. In May, 11 clusters died within the last few days.
A problem for Purja may be the relief of the 14th-eighth thousands: China's authorities now learn the Xxabangma Berg in Tibet. As a result, it is called in other bad weathers. In the first week Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wants to talk to China to him.
Four of all elephants on Sri Lanka
Both the dead animals are also a tragic elephant cup, a police speaker shared on Friday. "We thought that the elephants were infected."
The four castles were found in a protective area near the famous and many tourists, and the animals were likely from the police speaker from 15 to 25 years of age. It was ordered a autopsie to determine the cause of death.
At Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed each year. The killers are often farmers whose country had prematured the animals. Similarly, about 50 people of elephants are killed annually. This is usually if the animals are shocked by the villages near their living space.
In Sri Lanka, estimates live only about 7.000 elephants. The death penalty is theoretically.
Conserved British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British Oil Tanker "Stena Impero" left more than two months after his establishment by Iran the port city Bandar Abbas. This gave the Sea Navy Bandar Abbas known according to the news agency IRNA. The Iranian Revolution Gardens had established the tankers under UK Flags on 19 July under the provision to have cut the rule of sea law in the Persian Golf.
Thomas Cook management in the Critics
The competent Economic Committee of the Subcommittee wishes to investigate the role of the traveling Thomas Cook, which is to do as well as the question why the British Government did not like to contribute financially to the surviving companies. "We are interested in supervision in the company as well as in the control of external books", the President Rachel Reeves in London shared. "Openly we have to do it with a very example of management guests."
According to experts, genes are exceededed at dark cancer risk
The role of the gene in the family increased dark cancer risk is obvious to be overlooked. In this conclusion, researchers of the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) Heidelberg in a current study. Other risk factors such as family food habits are likely to be more likely to take more seriously than ever. This has results for calculation of the individual carcinogen risk, highlights the DKFZ knowledge.
Elon Musk allows to increase Tesla actions
This writes Musk on a email from the Branchen Blog "Electric" published on Thursday. The question is strong, so that Tesla 110'000 orders could be used, it continued to write in Musks.
The challenge is to bring the cars rapidly to the customers. Thus Tesla should provide as many resources as possible.
Income information: Teslas shares went with more than six per cent from the trade. So strong the course has not been added for almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered a good 95'000 cars and thus reached its best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high objectives. 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400'000 cars. This requires six-year-old numbers. Especially the most favorable Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here the wine levels are low. Despite the boom's losses.
Will the British government start to Brexit-Get? Johnson back
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson considers whether he is looking for an environment of the last amended legislation against an unregulated Brexit, and he only said on Friday before journalists that his government will hold its right to the right.
The law proposes that the government should ask for a movement of the end of arrival, it should not be achieved by the EU until October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitalization law", which has violated the negotiations with the EU.
The former British Prime Minister John Major had expressed the conviction on Thursday, Johnson could try to "political skane" to implement the law. Johnson could use a procedure strike that changes the entry into force of the law at the time after the EU's exit.
Johnson said he is trying to adopt a treaty with the European Union. "We are certainly convinced to leave the EU on October 31, and the best way is the agreement."
Iran flows clearly Urananship up
Iran's President Hassanś has increased the pressure on the European Contracting Partners in the fight on the saving of the historical Atomic Agreement. "The leaders show the European States inability or lack of availability when it goes on concrete action," said the Thursday, in a press conference at the New York UN Volley Assembly. For the case they did not agree with their promises, he put "widespread steps" away from the agreements of the possible negotiated agreement of 2015.
The conflict on the international agreement on the prevention of an Iranian atomic bomb, which was contrary to normalize Teheran's economic relations. The United States, in 2018, took place from the Agreement with Iran with the "maximal pressure" to a course change in a nahost policy that was an aggressively adverse. The Government of President Donald Trump wants to deal with a new agreement with urgence-related stocks and puts back to the hard sanctions against Teheran.
The International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now used or prepared for the use of Uran at the beginning of September, as well as at least with Uran.
Maybe the Europeans are not ready to put their part in the deal and, therefore, the Iranians left with the costs and the last pressing United States sanctions alone, smoothly, but will also give further discussions, which hopedly have a solution.
Opinion of Iran's development in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after a attack on a major oil plant in Saudi Arabia in the middle of September, the municipality has changed: Germany, France and Britain followed on Monday of the US appreciation that Teheran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Huthi revolts supported by Iran had known to the attack, which was evaluated as a false recognition by the United States. "We have nothing to do to do so," reaffirmed Ms.
"They who are injured these accusities must prove to be a proof of this," said Writer. This would have not yet agreed in the conversation with him during the United Nations General debate. Instead, they would only claim that the rebels in Jemen couldn't execute a attack like this, and in the past days with Federal Kansler Angela Merkel, President of France Emmanuel Macron and the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had met themselves with the Federal Kansler of Angela Merkel, France's President Emmanuel Macron and the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
For possible discussions with President of the United States Trump, the widely sanctions of the United States administration should first be dealt with, he requested the government in Washington to convert to a policy of "dialog and conciliation".
Commits of other stars crossing the sun system
Astronomims currently observe a commit from the deep of the world. This has been before. The committee allows re-designing to other sun systems.
What was just a confusion is now confirmed: a intersystemal host crossed by our sun system. The commit from the depth of the world has been baptized after his discovery on 2I/Borisov and has the interest of astronomies throughout the world.
The largest commit was found on the Crime on August 30, by the amateur astronomen Gennadi Borissow on the Margo Observatory, with a self-building telescope of 65 centimeters of diameters. After observing various observers, they confirmed not only that it was an unknown committee, but also showed that he was not out of our sun system.
2I/Borisov was only the second interstar object which has been viewed in a flow of our sun systems after 1I/'Omuamua of 2017.
2I/Borisov offers the rare opportunity to obtain astronomies from nearly an extraordinary solar system before he disappeared on a nickel. The first observation shows that the interstel committee of which our own systems is different, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of Canars. "The current speed of the committee is about 150,000 miles per hour, which is clearly above the typical speeds of objects that are surrounding the sun," reported about David Farnocchi of the US Railway Authority in a communication.
The comet is also responsible for the appointment and catalogue of the name and categoryization of heavenly bodies. To honor of his discoverers, the inter-screen Swifsters, which were first conducted under the catalogue number C/2019 Q4, of its title 2I/Borisov, which indicates the first part of the name that it is to be the second inter-state object that has been discovered in our solar system.
The astronoms have been happy: On the contrary to 1I/'Omuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been viewed in the flight. Thus, the researchers remain a few months for research. "The object will reach the largest light in the middle of December and then see the largest telescopes until April 2020," explained Farnocchia. "They will only be observed by larger and professional telescopes until October 2020."
several observers have already taken the visitors. Thus a team on Karen Meech from the Hawaii University, who had already led to the characterization of 1I/'Omuamua, has been in a first study the weather diameter of 2 to 16 km. The accommodation of the gemini-observators on Hawaiii shows a significant swif of the committee.
Scientists and researchers of the Astrophysical Institute of Canars (IAC) have already gained a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar Sweefster, which offers a kind of finger of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object distingues committees of our sun systems, and it knows that the composition must be similar," reported the IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation closes that the compositions in other solar systems can be formed by similar processes as in our complement of León, complemented by León Javier Licandro.
The discovery of two inter-screen visitors within only two years shows that these objects can open a new way to investigate certain solar processes in other sun systems, but how often such styps are, however, is still difficult to deal with. One of the next inter-screen visitors may be a planned satellite mission of the European Railway Agency Esa.
The Agency wants to station on a waiting position of 1,5 million miles away from the earth the three-party space "Comet Interceptor" (they, some of the coma-depths). It is like to spend the Esa Science Director Sunther Hasinger on an unrelated, fresh coma from our own solar system, or to a intersystem visitors such as 1I/'Oumumua.
First load on Pekings new Mega-Airport Daxing
Recently before the 70th birthday of the People's Republic, it is so large: At the new Mega airport in the south of the chinese capital is a first passenger machine of China United Airlines, a special honor for Captains and Crew.
Up to 2022, about 45 million flights are to be completed annually, 2025 should be 72 million. Chinese President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of 450 billion projects. The recent Chinese press project will also be called "Seestern" because of its sixth building structure.
The complex has 4 start- and landway trains that will be extended later to seven and are equipped with the world’s largest automatic transport system. A new U-Bahn transports passengers in only 20 minutes in the town of Peking.
During the building, the Chineses were able to learn from Berlin several times. The opening of the building in 2006 - and significantly smaller - the main airport in Germany has been moved to the same time. Nevertheless, in Peking, a first passenger machine was launched for four years.
New surrounding aircraft is to run 2030: In four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in only four and a half hours - the British space Agency UK Space Agency is dreaming. It may be to do this for the over-time flights (Synnergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which developed the company's reaction engines from Oxfordshire, quoted the US Sender CNN. "This is the technology that could finally be edited," said the Senator Graham Turnock. "We are talking about the 2030s for the invasion, and the work is very continuing."
In order to go forward the project, the British Railway Agency wants to cooperate closely with the Australian aircraft. A flight from the main city of New York to Australia is now at about 20 hours. As the only overall aircraft for passenger transport, the Concords of 1976 to the establishment of its operation in 2003, the New York City was discovered and used by three to three and a half hours. In 2000, the United Radio Aviation Office also arrived at the starting of an accident on Paris Airport Charles de Gaulle, which came to the 109 invasions.
"Sabre will make the world more smaller with its high speed-up to-Punkt transport", writes Reaction Engines, among other things on its home page. The sare drive could be used for efficient travellers with a speed of Mach 5 - which means five times as fast as the steel. Additionally, such aircrafts are also available outside the sacred temperature and allows the "five generation of re-useable rail drivers".
Accommodation in Washington: Trump wants to visit anonymous tips in Ukraine
In Ukraine's appeal for possible power-use of the President of the United States, Donald Trump wants to be able to observe places in the white house.
"I want to know who has given the information to the Whistleblower," said Trump on Thursday before the United States Embassy workers at the United Nations in New York. The person concerned is nearly a "a spirit" and has been converted in the past "a little different" than today.
This was assessed as a defence investigation against tipplers. The event was not public, but a number of US media distributed audio media on Friday from the conversation. Democratics responded to the statement of the President.
The Democratics in the United States Representative House had announced preparations for an official detention procedure against Trump, which was mainly based on the written applications of an anonymous secret workers, the serious accusions against the Trump and its government centre, which had been made on large public presss.
In its work, the Whistleblower wants to receive information from several government employees, as the President of the United States "uses the power of its offices", to achieve that another country is infringed by its profits in the United States 2020.
In the centre of the prosecution, a strict telephone between the Trump and the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July has encouraged the Trump to investigate his official colleagues that could harm his political rivals Joe Biden. This is a former business of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine, and its efforts to protect his speech before the Ukrainian justice.
The Whistleblower accused the White House with regard to the Ukrainian Telephone also to the debate: Leaders of government workers would try to keep the exact expression of the conversation under the box. How normally a electronic wording protocol was prepared. This should be published after the discussion on the instruction of lawyers from the White House, but from a common data database, and instead in a specially protected system.
The identity of the instructor is not publicly known. The New York Times reported that it is an employee of the Foreign Secret Service of the CIA.
Trump again questioned the credibility of the source. In a series of Tweets to the subject, the President wrote, among others, that "ashing Whistleblower" has distributed information from the second hand that had been unacceptable, so it may have not been a shock or spione.
As Trump was expressed in New York about those who had to have played the Whistleblower information, but it resolved a record. The President of the U.S. Representative House, Nancy Pelosi, reacted with anxiety and accused complaint, the integrity of the government was more than once.
In the Representative House for months, the various Committees have been conducted in various investigations against Trump and its environment. In view of the Ukrainian proposals, the Democratics are now being investigated with a new view to putting a possible official dealing procedure towards Trump.
"The Whistleblower gave us a driving plan for our investigation," said the head of the Secret Service Committee in the Representative House, Adam ship. Trump shocked ships, a false vision of things before him and reiterates the return of the Chairman. Trump was slaughtered regularly and had already requested the return of the committee for months ago.
More than 300 former US government employees from the security and external policy area, mostly under democratic, but also under the Republic of the United States, have been held in a statement issued on Friday after the possible investigation of the Democratics' investigation.
There is no precise time for the other processers: with the majority of the representative households, democratics could emphasize a so-called execution procedure, but the decision on a real office was made in the Senate where Trumps' Republicans have the majority of them, and the perspectives of success of such procedures are therefore less.
VW Board: jobs are decreased
The VW market plans, in which the production continues, could go to the latter of production in Germany and Europe. This concerns the busing Council of Bus, which will depend on its annual manufacturing costs from 10 billion to 2023 to two billion euros, which will already be allocated to 500 million euros in this year.
A key is the staff costs: 2016 between enterprises and the Employment Council, which is negotiated until 2020, already see the decrease of 14.000 jobs only in Germany. In particular, a workplace can only be reduced if almost the related activities are not needed, and a job insurance is also applicable until 2029.
However, as our newspapers are now produced from operating crystals, jobs in the production, which are not indeed "speaking" on a different way, so on the official course.
In these cases, the Operating Council has no possibility to prevent the redistribution.Indeed, it is uncomfortable to many staff, to take the labour dignity, to worry about a periodic exemption of vehicle vehicles, and to ensure that vehicle production could be delayed after and from Germany and Europe because they are more favorable in other parts of the world. The VW only said: "Alignment of the employment volume is agreed as soon as soon as socially agreed to remove the graphic curve".
The Marke VW wants to standardize the world's production and control new projects centrally. This also aims to reduce costs and accelerate decisions - in particular, is the goal to increase productivity and thus to make the competitiveness. And Andreas Tostmann's production plan said at a management conference in Berlin: "Graduate in unsafe times from Brexit to the threatening trade war between the United States and China, we are well advised to make our crisis."
To this way it has been successful: For example, in this year, for example, the production costs for vehicles would be the first time since 2013 compared to the previous year. Tostmann said that the production period for the Golf 8, which will be presented on 24 October in Wolfburg, should be reduced for 1.1 hours. Exact numbers for the production period call VW not, according to the information of our newspapers it is rounded at the Golf 7
20 hours.
In our region, the steamwork of Wolfsburg is the only VW fabric which is produced in the vehicles. The works of brain swimming and salt guitters are produced. For Wolfsburg, the VW-internal rules apply that there must be 800,000 cars in order to be satisfied with the work. 2018, the extradition in Wolfsburg was only 700,000 vehicles - prescribed by the slightly essential demand and the problems in the revision of the new consumption and gas test process WLTP.
However, as Tostmann's production system has been announced last year, a million cars in Wolfburg have to be rolled "perspectively" in the band, which is intended to make the process of the golf production in the stage work - because the Zwickau work is switching to the location for the e-auto-production.
Furthermore, SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfburg. However, the sales numbers of Golf and Tiguan have recently been developed. Hence, the expectations at the Golf 8. He must now remain all the efforts to build the e-mobility and botter autonomy of the Wolfburgers.

Eberesque and wild Roscania threatened
In Germany, most of them were threatening Ebereschen (Sorbus), said one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency. "The majority are threatened because the populations are small or by the transformation or weakness of their lives."

Rather like sleeves played a key role in recycling nutrients on the ground and are an important food source for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation of many overwhelmed and underestimated species is precarious, kinds that contribute to the decline of the European ecosystem and to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, Director of the European Union of IUCN.

US warning federal government before Huawei
The Head of the United States Communications Commission (FCC), Aiit Pa, warned the federal government to trust in the Chinese network operator Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too large," said the father to the "Handelsblatt" with regard to the construction of the new 5G mobile network.
China has an "national security law", which is obligation to follow the instructions of the security bodies of each company under Chinese law.
The applicable law also prohibites the companies to inform third parties about such requests," says the FCC Chief, which is very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.

While the software is important to keep the devices on the latest position. This software consists of billions of program codes that change with time," said Pa.

The ownerships are inconsistent, and the employee, which is apparently belonging to the company, is not independence from the government," said Pad the "Handelsblatt".

Germany has to invest, even now, as soon as possible,," said Le Maire on Thursday at the presentation of the French budget for the next year.

We should not wait until the economic situation is worse to take the necessary decisions."

Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson no question about Brexit tactics
The British Primer Johnson criticizes the "capitalization law" adopted by Parliament.
Parliament has returned to the British Prime Minister to avoid a chao brex, but the critics are afraid that Boris Johnson can still use a slug, and this is what the Tory politicians say.
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is aware of whether he wants to implement an unregulated brexite - despite the last legislation decided by the Parliament, which should be prevented, just as Johnson said to journalists, his government will hold up the right.
The law proposes that the Government should ask for a movement of the end of arrival, no agreement with the EU should be achieved until October, and Johnson criticizes this as a "capitalization law", which has failed to negotiate the negotiations with the EU.
The former British Prime Minister John Major had expressed the conviction on Thursday that Johnson could try to "political scanners" to implement the law. The First Minister could set a procedure strike that moves the entry into the EU's legislation at the time after the EU's conclusion. Johnson said he tries to adopt a treaty with the European Union. "We are certain to leave the EU on October 31, and the best way is the one with an agreement."
Johnson's chief advisor Dominic Cummings stated that he accepted the political discussions on the Brexit as "Spacing in the park" and showed himself that the aimed EU access was still deemed: "We will enjoy what we will win, we will be (e.g. Red.: emerge from the EU) no concern," said the British newspaper "Telegraph" according to a book view.
Cummings, who led the Brexit Campagne "Vote Leave" during the election campaign before the EU Referendum 2016, now functions as Chief Strategy in the British government Hall Downing Street, which is to shoot the uncompromissable policy that the Primer has led to a slightly outstanding situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" of Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all standed before the camera of Linda McCartney, who became one of the great rock photographers. But it must not always be the great love. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (Tazen) looks a deep in the entire private world of McCartney's family.
Paul McCartney, who was married from 1969 to Lindas, in 1998, was obvious and encouraging when he presented the "The Polaroid Diaries" band in the middle of September in Victoria and Albert Museum in London.
After the Launch event, McCartney wrote at Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is an extraordinary view in the life of an extraordinary family from time before instagram, a party to the richness of LindaMcCartney as an engaging artist and the emergency magie of the polyroid film."
With Linda McCartney, who had studied the art history at the university of Aizona until she found the photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of polyroids have done it, some hundreds of these are now published in the "The Polaroid Diaries".
There are portraits, styles, landscapes, several hasters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interestors from the past 70s until the late 1990s. "He wanted real moments," writes the artist Ekow Eshun in his term. And of course, there is still another one in the middle point: your husband Paul - as you may have never seen him.
When he danced with his daughter Mary on the shoes, he calls in the bathroom with a sweet on the head, or takes unfavorable moon boats. True, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but there was a part of the swimming light on their farm in Southern Greatland or in Scotland also leading a very normal life. So Mary McCartney said to BBC that she had been sleeping as a baby in a bed that had been buried with her father from old cartoffels. And it was not always in the McCartneys.
As little as another media, the Polioraid camera starts the immediate moment. Linda McCartney's inceptions are certainly a family daybook, but they are much more than clean shoes.
It's about the decision click: you've got to know if a great photo happens before you. And then you have to kick it exactly at the right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you can get two seconds later or two seconds ago, it may be a completely different photo." And Linda had the gift to start exactly the right moment. "He knows that she has it," said Paul in the Eshun-Essay.
This is why the light, the composition, the image extraction and the colors, which "The Polaroid Diaries" makes not only a main picture book for Beatles-Fans, but also a great athletic winner, where landscapes have also been affected as distracted pieces. The perfect addition to the new Beatles album "Abbey Road", which has appeared just 50 years ago.
"We're going to buy further oil and gas from Iran."
The Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday, Turkey could not abandon the import of oil and gas from Iran.
We will purchase our earthquake from there," said Erdogan in New York, where he had participated in the United Nations Field Meeting.
However, it was noted that Turkey had problems in the import of Iranic terrestrian imports, as some companies had been "returned to the US drugs".
However, Turkey will "prosecute, particularly in this issue and in many other questions, our relationship with Iran," said the Turkish President, who has repeatedly criticized the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
U.S. is a policy of the "maximal pressure" against the Islamic Republic since its exhibition from the International Atomic Agreement with Iran. According to the United States, an atomic programme in the secret and does not hold the agreement.
Their sanctions have caused Iran's oil exports and a serious economic crisis in Iran. In the past months, the distortions in the Golf region have significantly increased.
US government wants to limit the inclusion of refugees
The United States government wants to be drasticly limited to the registration of refugees, and the United States Foreign Minister declared on Thursday that the annual overwhelming level of a new-auditor program is to be deleted from 30,000 to 18.000 refugees, which corresponds to a total of 40%.
The Foreign Minister stated that the United States would continue to see the support of refugees, but the most important task is to protect and serve the US citizens.
The US government wants to concentrate on the inclusion of two groups of refugees: those who follow their faith - and Iraqi who have helped the United States military in the country, and are in danger, as the Declaration of the Foreign Minister is, which must be included by Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador by a maximum of 1500 refugees.
In the 1980 programme, refugees from UNO camps are selected in the world and newly settled in the United States. The overwhelming level of 18.000 refugees for the budget 2020 would be the lower in the history of the programme. As the current overwhelming level of 30,000 is a depth. When the President of US Donald Trump, Barack Obama, left the white house, was about 85,000.
Help organizations responded to the announced decrease of the top limit. "This is a very tragic day for America," said the Chief of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. The United States would continue to suffer their leading role in protecting the most vulnerable people of the world.
Trump tries to limit immigration into the United States - legally as illegal - strictly. The US government expects its own details for the coming financial year 350,000 asylums. These figures are separated from the new registration program.
Donald Trump - "Come a spot near"
The President of the US Donald Trump has regarded the Whistleblower officers. Whoever has always proposed the informant who offers powerful abuse to him has changed the corresponding instruction "Come close to a split," Trump said, in a recording of a private event on Thursday in New York. This report corresponds to several US media.
Through this, Trump said to workers of the United Nations mission. When he was asked after the person who informed the Whistleblower about struggled operations in the white house, he said: "This comes near." Then the trumpet added: "We know what we did in old times when we were broken? Right. The Spione and Verrat, we made something different than we do now."
The observers referred the last comment on a possible impact on death penalty. Democratics were deeply criticized on the explanations of Trumps and prompted the abuse of the Witnesses, which also tried to undermine a congress survey to a possible official decision-making procedure, writes the Chairmans of the Committee for Foreign Affairs, Secret Services and Oversight in the Representative House.
The Whistleblower proposes the President's complaint to have a misuse of his office in a country in the United States 2020. It is, among others, to conduct his surrounded phone with his Ukrainian official Wolodymyr Selenskyj in the summer: in the conversation, the trumpet closed to him to investigation against his possible democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son in Ukraine. Trumps are able to maintain all the defects.
It's not clear yet who are both the Whistleblower itself and its informants. As the New York Times reports, it should be an analysis at the Whistleblower of the foreign secret service of the CIA.

The Who Cancels Konzert Ab
A US rockband The Who has found a deep end because of an inadequacy of Leadsmenger Roger Daltrey. In the mid-wednesday in Houston, his voice was in the service. At the eighth song, Daltrey said to the public: "I think I should leave it as long as it works."

Location soon set: WeWork allow real estate markets to sit
WeWork was the largest officer in New York.
Within less than years, WeWork increases the small startup to driving force on the most costly real estate markets in the world. But now the company is in the crisis. The shippers need to fear milliarity income.
The crisis of the officer WeWork threatens the balance on the world's largest real estate markets. The company had been able to win for the next weeks and months before the reasons of Adam Newmann to move the planned bridge and to sell girls and values, such as the private board for the leadership forces. The company also reports the British "Financial Times" (Finnish Times) and WeWork had soon taken the end of new advertisements with effects. It is, among other in New York and London's largest midst of offices.

WeWork provides this business in a short-term speed. In the past year, the company carries a loss of $1,6 billion, with an extent of $1,8 billion. In this year only the mileage costs will always be estimated by the allocation of new large lands to assessing $2,5 billion. To limit the loss, the new company has to be limited to the current emergency and the new floor of fleet has fallen into effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork concluded in the past period of up to 15 years with obligations of more than 40 billion dollars, which could not only be a problem for the company itself and its investors, but also for the whole real estate markets.
Calculations from the Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork in Manhatten, one of the most precious real estate markets of the world in the past 24 months, at about 300,000 square quarters of office. Only WeWorks assured that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the newly arrived on the market in this time. Without WeWorks Expansion, the Office Learning in the US-Metropole would be held in this time, as Alpert wrote in the "Business Insider".
In the main city, the balances in the real estate market could also be seen without any further expansion of the aggressive startup. WeWork, among otherwise, is the headmaster, in a year old by the Spain fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros purchased office houses in the center of the Finance Metropolis.
Many employees have developed their real estate for the requirements of WeWork with high investments. Devil WeWork to make their business model soon profitable, the real estate owners should be able to subscribe a part of the expected billion revenue. Access to the - without any switch - reserves of WeWork have not even the long-term meal contracts.

How large the world's access to this Friday after the recording of the night will be, it is relatively unclean. Thunberg itself was good. " Last Friday has been over four million people for the climate. This Friday we do it again," she wrote on Twitter. As long as it had been given in the striking week 683 actions in 170 countries, she complemented.
In particular, in Germany, the past Fridays for Future was very large. A good third of all world demonstrates - around 1,4 million - had been estimated by Fridays for Future in 575 German cities. This time, a list of movements are planned for at least 65 cities. In Metropolians such as Berlin, Hamburg, München and Colonia, but also in smaller communities and cities as Jews in Northern Western and Western countries, people want to go to the climate.
In the age of 15 years of age, Thunberg took place before the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 to demand its country to increase the use of climate protection, and in a short period, the Fridays for Future movement has been made, especially students and students, but also more scientists and other adults.
They are in common calling for more honor to combat the earthquake and the threatening climate disaster from the policy, especially under the Paris climate Agreement, the global warming should be decreased at least 1,5 degrees in comparison with the pre-industrial time.
Thunberg was attended just a month ago after a two-week transatlantic troops with a high-zeater renard in New York, where she had finally participated in climate protectioners and meetings of the United Nations.

New World Climate Protests of Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protections, thousands of people want to go to roads for more climate protection.
The movement of Fridays for Future renewed actions and unions in twelve countries to complete an international climate trail.
In Germany, Protests are planned at least 65 cities, including in Metropolies such as Berlin, Hamburg, München and Köln, but also in smaller communities and cities such as jungles in Northwest-Westfalen or Western country in Sylt. Greta Thunberg will participate in a large accommodation in the Canadian Montreal.
Climate Protests ✔ Who are Thunberg's Intermmanners?
Justice and courage are, even in the 21th century, a world full of wars and fuming manufacturers that warm the climate. As a surpriser, a 16-year-old girl has the powers of this time to hold the spirit before the nase. But what's in there? Is it helping or marketing a climate activist? historical master service or manipulative tactic for himself?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg moves the massas and brings young people to excited themselves to a better climate world. It is historically not seen the first time in Europe that a young man has created a congregation of children and young people to win for himself. In 1212, a child named Nicoleus from the Columbia has felt a corner to make himself a world more fair. Then it has also made a sharp of young people to win to get over the sea, so that the sea is swimming in the nation that is slowly slowly made up to the United States.
But this is about a shadow page? Why is it necessary for a action named "We don't have time" to save the world? Moreover, Greta Thunberg has a rich PR-manager on her side. Nevertheless, her mother has published a book that has sell a lot of selling, thanks to the daughter in the ramp light. An old-selected followers of Greta Thunberg were a little disappointed about the last PR show, or. The travel with the ship was likely also a few follows. This is not found because the action came in the world's media so well-related followers and was a lot of money in the action.
Here the Spirits are divided: is morally proper to the savings of the world financially? Is it still authentical if some people's creatures work together with the World Management Association with the Börsenmakers? What position will lastly be involved in a critical and reflected point of view is always more important in a democraticly practitioned society, because democracy lives from different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it may also be likely from the projects of certain trends to answer critically.
Komet discover: Intersteller guest crossed by our sun system
A foreign comit crosss our sun system at the moment.
The astronomies have confirmed themselves: a foreign comit is crossed in the moment of our sun system - he is only the second of his type.
Garching/Washington - Langes the researchers have just smoothed it, but now they have awareness: one of the other stars crosses our sun system at the moment. He was baptized after his discovery 2I/Borisov and is just employed by world astronomies.
2I/Borisov: comet was discovered by amateur starms on the crim
The inflicted body was discovered by a amateur star named Gennadi Borissow on the crystal. He saw a self-building telescope in heaven and other observations confirmed his first suspect. It is actually a unknown committee that does not stand out of our sun system. He is only the second of his type, which was seen at the flight.
The great opportunity for astronomists is to get closely into an alien sun system. It is obvious that the committee of our own systems, as reports the astrophysical Institute of the Canarys. The committee is clearly intersystemal from the International Astronomic Union (IAC) and is currently moved on a so-called hyperbel train that leads it from our system.
Comet was already seen before the flight - and it can be observed for several months
But before it is so far, the astronomies can look at him immediately. As in contrast to his operational, 2I/Borisov is already seen in his flight, which means that he can be investigated from the earth for many months. "The object will reach the largest light of December and then be seen with a medium-scale telescope," said Davide Farnocchi by the US Railway Author of Nasa. "They will then be watched until October 2020.
The new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Uumumua".
First knowledge of comet 2I/Borisov makes hopes in science
According to the first recognition, the commit is estimated at 2 to 16 kilometres of diameter. At the same time the sky body seems to be similar to our components - as the IAC researcher Julia de León expresses it, the spectrum of the swifster is similar to our. This observation is closely empty that commits can be formed in other solar systems by similar processes as in our, complemented de Leóns College Javier Licandro.
However, the observation is over individual knowledge. That two such objects have been discovered within only two years, allowing a new way to investigate certain processes in other sun systems.
Asteroiden, always employed again, were the researchers. Until recently, a rise asteroide passed to the earth, and she came to dangerously near it.
"Aucunely Competitive": Rachel Johnson is a brother

The murder was clearly coming out of the straight layer, which was "the kind of language."
The Witwer of Cox also criticized the Prime Minister. "It makes me sick if I use this name," he tweeted. The best way to honor them is, if you are suffering and decided for what you believe - unlike what you think. But never should "demonize the other side". He also claimed that a atmosphere was being more likely in the attacks.
A few weeks ago, Boris Johnson was a young brother Jo his office as the Secretary of State and his mandate as a Tory deputy. "I was destroyed in the past months between loyalty to family and national interest – it is an unsolvable shock," founded Johnson.
Johnson's language was also a huge critical in the church. As the "Times" reported, all 118 Bishops and Bishops of the Church of England criticize the language that the "the country is not suitable". In a common statement they explained: "In the last days, the language, both in the debates and outside of the Parliament, is not acceptable. We should speak with respect to each other."

Within the Internet connection, it is always much slower than the supplier, there are different test opportunities.
Those who conclude a Internet contract do not need blindly confidence on the speeds of the suppliers. The customers can check yourself how much it will actually be achieved.
Finally, the previous transfer rates are a part of the contract and should therefore be achieved, explains consumer central Bayers.
As the connection is always slower than the supplier, there are different possibilities of testing. So the methods of the federal network (BnetzA) are measured to the actual data transfer rates and compare the rate agreed in the Treaty.

Influencerin wants Gratis Application: Life ban in Cathay
At first, Jaqueline Ng was certified by Cathay Pacific by email. But when she asked for check-in, she did not stop board - and she should never be able to fly with Cathay again.
Spontan receives an update for the business class - it dreams many flights. Sometimes they have lucky, and the workers at the check-in offer a channel from the Economy class free.

On the flight, the employees Jaqueline rejected an update, although they showed an email in which their Cathay Pacific had a view of an update. The writing wants to receive the infringement of a marketing employee of the airline. However, the airline accused Jaqueline that has been false.
Indeed, Jaqueline tried to get an update for the long trail flight. This time the woman should have shown the same mail, but with another reference number. The workers at the JFK Airport were skeptic: you were able to go to the center. And indeed, the employee whose mail was intended to have distracted the email contact with Jaqueline. This confirmed also the mail system where the messages were not obtained.
The airline employees canceled Jaquelines tickets on the airport and shipped a long-term aircraft ban with Cathay Pacific. For 1.400 US dollar (circa 1.280 euros) they had to buy a new airport to Taiwan.

The business conditions of the airline also indicate that they do not have to pay the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with this, and now enable a lawyer.
