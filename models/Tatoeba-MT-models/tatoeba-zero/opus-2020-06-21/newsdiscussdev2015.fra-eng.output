It looks like it's a typical rumby club.
In an English university, maybe...
Don't see anything with the rumby clubs I know in NZ.
But that doesn't justify anything, right?
Of course not, but the premise that says it's known in the ruby is all of the...
Yes, finally we are not interromping the prayers of the musulmans and we are not cut the nail of someone during the drinking games (except if it is part of the game), but we are effectively cut in black for some nights cast.
I never played a drink game based on Nazi theme.
Yeeha and Ride the Bus suffice.
I left a similar comment on the previous article because the language and the feelings expressed in the first-year-old students' prospect have been sufficiently typical.
That says, this new information leaves me no doubt that they're far far away from myogyan mixtures and the smuggles under the imprisonment of alcohol that are often associated with university rumby teams.
The incident with the Muslim students shows that they try to produce the maximum.
You really don't know anything to the Ruby clubs.
But let's go, why let your damages and your stereotypes hinder the facts?
I think that the LSE Rúbi team is cut from old students from these schools for which the competitive ruby is a tradition.
Otherwise, old kids of the private.
It is very different from those playing in the rumby in NZ, very different attitudes.
So ‘misogyne funerals’ are acceptable?
It seems to be the rouby club of my university, I never saw racist behavior, but the nucleus courses through the campus, the flight, the smuggling of goods and the mixture were all part of the game.
Absolutely not.
I'm sorry I didn't have explained it in my last comment.
You can see it otherwise: you say your own body is partly composed of this ancient water.
I'm going to win in seenity.
ancestral, therefore, also this interstellary cloud (eight, not traditional:)
@lux You haven't read the article: a small half of your stool water has over 4,6 billion years...
Yes, it can be shock when even considering that the fleet of the skin has a medium more than 2,3 billion years, that is not so bad that
A sacred feet of nails to disasters and refrigerators of any pool that predicts the end of the oceans and water resources, while this water has always existed.
An irrefusible evidence that heat has been stopped 20 years ago (see the outstanding work of Serge Ferry financed by Total and Areva).
@manon too: What is a evidence that heat has been stopped?
I don't see the link.
I think Manon Troppo's comment is irone.
Hey, and for the second degree and irony you have what as a signaling?
So you don't understand much about ecological problems.
It is not question for the "katastrophists" as you are saying to worry about the destruction of the ocean, but instead of the reduction of human water reserves (you know the milk water that represents less than 1% of the total water reserves on our planet).
And then more generally, it is not the most threatening climate refrigeration for our species, but especially the reduction of small or not renewable resources (gas, oil, rare metals) which support our more golden life modes.
As regards the study you quote and whom you are doing the generous efforts to quote the source, it is naturally little doubt of the validity of the conclusion.
With regard to the soft water problems, I raise you the French are far from being concerned xD Then you have to stop considering the ecology as a fat dogma, the ozone swimming smell is being slowly referring to you (exhibition of 100% to 2050 at the current rythm).
ecology yes, religiously dogmatic and irrelevant ecology, not thanks.
"And there is no stop to consider ecology as a fat dogma, the ozone shooting shooting is being shocked," Yes, finally it is not like it was a spontaneous movement that would not come from nothing.
@martin: I just want to specify that climate warming is a need for because if we get CO2 too much, our land will be like Venus.
A steel that through the oxygen action will capture the heat without freeting it and which in a swimming circle will accelerate the switch process explicitly.
Have someone seen direct action until now?
Or the less sign indicated that 100,000 good men would come to the ground to plant trees and to do what a green army should be done, what could it be?
You're not me!
In the small brain of Abbott, perhaps send the RAAF to the Middle East is its version of a direct action.
We're going to get back, that's sure.
When are they going to get out of the village's idiot?
The latest revelations that vegetation would consume 16 % of CO2 more than any climate model allows to give priority to replant.
It is not logical, since CO2 is the food of plants that are the most abundant in nature, and it is necessary to preserve the flower throughout the world.
It seems that this scientific fact has never been put on the plate.
Have you seen the green army somewhere?
Don't do anything, good government.
CO2 levels increased from 280 ppm to 400 ppm and the rate is growing, your argument of plant food is only a falling distraction.
And before you start your drink against the Dooms wall, the most abundant grain is not CO2 but nitrogen and sulfur.
The most abundant of biologically generated materials is probably carbon, but it does not mean that it is the most abundant grain, so Silverhead's argument is fatal and worth being ridiculized.
Direct Action is a thick, because nothing can happen again.
The LandCare budget has been severely reduced, and this money is now expendied by the Verte Army.
The problem is that instead of investing the money where it was the most profitable, it is now invested where he will receive the most advertising to bring the liberals to the marginal electors.
Your contribution, on the contrary, deserves the price of ignorance, good champion.
SilverHead, when there are too many CO2 in the air, plants perform less than photosynthesis and contain less nutrients.
That means that animals and people have to eat them in a much greater amount to benefit from their nutritional benefits.
The fact that this deputy is pueral is a clearness.
To date, it has not submitted a academic strict certificate that prevents the discarding of rules of XVIIe.
For this reason, to sanctify him and not Tevenoud, it is incomprehensible for not worldwide, even though the AN Regulation is not a fiscal treaty.
That this lady in the whole case is not to his honor, it appears especially as hisstery.
If Mitterrand had sent all those who pronounced Mitran...
I remember that during the debate on the feminization of the names, the "Academia" was offended: "I'll tell Mrs. the guard or guard of the Sceau" (which has never been busy by a woman).
Awesome machism!
"Political Alliance."
The swimming bag, the back corner of the Republic, the margot of operating tangents, the illusion table, etc...
But the sum of gladiators, people who take real risks, good grace, badly grateful.
Qd the Phallocratic Unit was on the label and parliamentary regulation in turning to the + elementary civility under the false paraplel of good ways, sanctions apply to him "the quality" for its partisan heading and the measuring of the political allies.
The behaviour of this deputy is not normal or worthy of his position.
It is a provocation to speak about him.
As long as he was unknown now, he can now be honoured to be known as it is known for all cancer of a primary class.
The academy of goods and the deputy are sensitive to the pocket...
UP should be able to resolve its internal problems and stop producing skins and skins.
The Academy has good two, especially when it is done to tell him what she doesn't say.
This deputy is a college in full adolescence crisis, which makes a provocation and whose fellow believers are going to, in delegation, see the Principal to cancel colleague hours.
and by defending it on the basis of a text they have not even read!
Women did not even represent 15 per cent of the signatories of the UMP tribe.
Mr. Judge, I call two experts to a few thousands of years separate.
That's why I like to pass time with animals.
The joy they feel when they play is so clear and attractive.
Dogs, dauphins, otaries, horses, they do all stupid things for the simple joy that they buy.
On the contrary, it seems that we had the majority of our 80 years to work, move us and make the shops.
What strange phase we have reached - we are able to multiplie by two of our life periods, but we are going to pass the majority in the native.
How did we get there?
Thanks to the illusion that is anthropomorphism.
The game is a metal communication.
Come on.
It's always a illusion.
Furthermore, the "communication" requires a shared symbol system.
A hard concept for you, maybe?
I think that the concept of inter-specific communication is not compatible with your faith.
That's true.
I can see when a dog wants to play and I can communicate to the dog I would like to play – basic body language.
After that, there is a variance that indicates whether the game is a course, a object to go to search, etc.
It is not difficult and there is no anthropopomorphics – although I agree to the idea that we are seeing a lot of conneries on animals that are in “speaking” while they are just on communicating.
Perhaps the game is not only "utilized" (that may be, or not), it is just something that exists.
For example, David Graeber is the opinion that " there is a principle of game on the basis of any physical reality".
"If he had learned at the school that a woman is not an object, he may not have been violented." Maybe yes, hope makes life...
Thank you for giving you the opportunity to live, to be healthy and today to answer a article when you should drink the information without reacting to you just 15 years ago.
Generally, I am not against ideas, and I would even tend to be sufficiently enthusiasmed by those who seem to be fooled first.
But when we see what many have stood about their school education, especially among the most likely public to make women aggressions on women, my entusiasm does not find the lower start of an abortion point.
"the public is the most likely to get women's aggressions" would like to be a little more.
Or instead, no, it's good, we're understood.
And yes, the reality does not always feel the rock, even though it does not match for your thought schemes.
It is true that the pretty youth of Neuilly and other beautiful neighbors do not listen much in class.
She prefers playing on her iphone6.
Evry's disargented youth too!
If the reactions weren't reacted, Twitter would no longer propose to follow Le Pen and Sarko in the first choice.
I have not learned anything about this at school and I never violated anyone (and it's not in my intentions).
Do I think I'm lucky?
Unless I had parents to teach me some values....
The micro-society of the family is the learning of social life.
How to take the reading of life when we can't read?
Do young socialists go to bathroom schools to teach women's equality?
It would be more effective than make moral mounts on Twitter, but it should be out of beautiful neighbors...
Grow this campaign.
They're null all over, but to give moral lessons, that's the best ones.
Everything looks like a photonic, but I want to see the bread in a head.
There's a blue here on the fact to use his bread.
The article of this week isn't going to be a mole.
It's not the time to make smells around the bread, man!
A little sensitivity!
You have done a double word game with the word "naan" to refer to a grandmother.
60 books for this?
It would not even be filled with a 90-year-old age in a retirement house.
How do we pay more, less in the seat?
Because the quality of experience is not necessarily measured to the weight or number of heats, as the quality of a film or part is not determined by its length.
Yes, I agree with you.
But why should the good food be served in parts that would not even satisfy a mine?
It has no sense, and it's just a delegated policy to buy you more plates.
Of course, it must not be like that.
The Sportsman in Seasalter at least is a very good restaurant where parts and prices are both reasonably high.
You pay more because you've still hungry after several mini plates.
More you pay money, more you have chances of receiving a child's part prepared with art in your seat.
At least they made the effort to put nappes.
So when I want to go to a decent restaurant in York, you're telling me I'd have to go to a restaurant in London...
Maybe you should try one of the many other (excellent) restaurants in York before decided that London is the only place on Earth where you can develop good plates?
Is Manif for everyone only a Catholic and Muslim movement.
Yes, that's good: a kind of assembly of homophobes.
But it's not just that.
There are also athles and humanists who do not want modern systems of "children manufacturing".
A child should not be high in a battery or manufactured by a technological device.
Battery?
From where you get this out of here.
And if you answer any technical intervention in the "fabrication", you must claim the prohibition of the PMA for historical pairs, that would be the worth of coherence.
I also surprised that the manif pretend "for all" was not yet this logical revendication to its attractive catalogue.
It is exact that these are not the only catholics that express: the other religions also, Jews, Muslims, Protestants.
This was put, it is even useful to remember that these different churches were opposed to all the developments of the society: in 1865 (and I am joining G.
Kauffmann) a bishop, Mr. Dupanloup forced himself against the will of the gvt to grant girls to school just as "the family defence".
We are always in the same scheme.
And recently, the same channels have led to the expansion of civilization and family destruction when school became mixed.
This is the credit that you can grant to the positions of these people.
You don't need to be catho to dictate the marketing of winds and kids...
This is in the right line of the decade of Western civilization, more and more contested by others!
For me, freedom stops to the other: Yes, to recognition of homosexual couples who have the right to love both others.
But not tolerate that the child is a mixable object.
And this is also valid for GPA hesters.
I can't just love this guy, nor recognize his results.
If he had a better control of the ballon and knew to avoid smoking stupidity moments, he could be a more popular player.
Furthermore, I am sure that any other attacker, in addition to Heskey, who plays so many matches for England, will cumulate a number of objectives.
Imagine how many targets Peter Crouch would have marked if you had given him more than 42 selection in national team...
I can't be in dealing, at least not Categoricly:) Since this article speaks of the purposes he has marked, I will not talk to other things he brings, especially to ManUtd (which RvP, Mata, Kagawa would not bring or bring anything), but maybe that it would be another reason for which he wins much more often than, we say, Peter Crouch.
Botham77 hoddle1 October 2014 12h48 Recommendation 119 It's in the way to criticize Rooney at this time so you can forgive you too.
This says it is good to take into account that since he signed with Manchester City in August 2011, Aguaero marked 56 goals and makes 23 decisional passes in 93 matches.
At the same time, Wayne Rooney marked 59 goals and makes 32 decisionary passes in 96 matches.
So many people will have to find another apology to take it to our Wazza because its field statistics are excellent.
Moreover, "Wazza" is a good reason to ridiculize it.
I am obliged to ask me whether you really look at the foot or if you think that Peter Crouch A) would take both choices that Rooney and B) would mark as much goals if he had so many selections.
I really don't understand where the criticism of Rooney's capacity as a footballer comes.
The most difficult, it is to be regularly selected in the country's team for 13 years, and to continue...
Are you seriously comparing the football qualitys of Wayne Rooney to Peter Crouch?
Do you do this without blagueing?
There are really people completely on the mass.
Please also note for your government that Rooney has not always been the pre-center machine for English purposes during his carrière in the English team.
Instead of that, he played the previous retirement, the role of Beardsley/Sheringham.
He played behind players such as Michael Owen, Mr. Crouch that we mentioned above, Jermain Defoe, and more recently Daniel Sturridge.
You've forced to write this in blaguing.
In a country where the weapons port is tolerated and in a state where 71 per cent of people have a weapon, I find it totally shyzophrene and paradoxal.
And then those of this school are not just all agreed with the arms port license in the United States!
the use of crayon is always self-suicided.
Stop the kitchen: the girl's 5-year-old.
How many kids play with facial guns at this age at our home?
Is that actually powerful killers for that?
Although the weapons port is in the United States Constitution and it is strongly influenced by the country's culture, I do not believe that the rich children are sensitively different from ours.
It's a little good sense and reason to be guarded.
It's a disarming process!
Come back!
Information about this different fact is insufficient to assess whether this little girl really has, or does not, premits to the gust of the morbide.
Can we get out of the principle that a series killer can't have a weird behaviour at the age of 5 years?
If people need psychiatrists, they're more smooths in this school than students!
That parents get their kids out there: it's in danger!
Completely agreed.
Those who manage this school are clearly ill.
Your reaction is the most relevant.
Alabama is not the most representative state in the United States but is actually part of it.
What incomprehensible country!
His relative youth?
These blue clouds that men have nothing to do with a entrepreneur!
What did Alan Sugar or Richard Branson bring to their career at the beginning?
In their first photos, Lord Sugar had a long sweet snake, and Sir Richard Branson had a rolled sleeve.
I can't come too much because I never looked at that, but it seems like so sweet and without soul.
I don't think it's what he wanted to say.
Maybe it's wrong.
But what's it seems depressing!
You've got me down.
I would have thought that a major knowledge of the English would be an outstanding for business.
I ask what Mr. Bjayou do these days.
Maybe he said “ostracting” would mean "adherence".
That would be logical.
No, I thought that's what he could mean, but ostracing has not always a sense.
In the worst, if all candidates lived as Carmen Miranda and that Sugar had a green cost, it could be advanced that their intention was to obsolete it.
But here, no.
It seems to have been corrected – strange. Maybe the entire phrase has been invented!
It's not strange.
Haha, who knows what he could say?
Really nothing, but someone wanted to quote something...
So yes, the word used in the article was well “ostracting” which would not absolutely mean anything.
The rate of shock in the United States is still low, about 6 per cent.
It has never been seen since 2001.
The prices of the essence are low in all States.
The American economy, with Obama, continues to strengthen.
Who's better?
You have a very short view...
Their economy becomes "soutenable"?
To live at this time, I will say that the United States will approach little exploitation as inequalities become poor.
The political system is literally intended by the financing of election campaigns.
Racial tensions, police violence, mass incarceration are larger that it is not imagined in Europe but Americans keep an unbelievable optimism in the future of their country and their country!
To when?
This is the main question.
A few days ago, the English financial environment said that France was lost.
Now, it's the Americ that's on his roof.
Happy, there will always be the UK to save the world.
Another of these articles that simply forget the essential.
The level of consumption of the American economy is no longer sustainable...
Debts and shops couldn't even give the change...
On the ground of the earth's resources and the growing needs of the rest of the planet.
And strongly the weakest and poorest, a very large majority of citizens, will "beat" or instead die.
I can't blame this Farrage.
Will the Labour finally understand that his cynical and delegated policy importing competenced voters from the foreign is to lose more support in his home?
Maybe I don't think.
Multiculturalism and diversity must continue forward to any price.
LOL was to enjoy our American masters and continued their cold war with Russia.
Honest performance of Labour, Ed Milliband is in the mouse, it plays 617 votes.
How much Clacton 11% for Labour – shocking, really shocking.
Everyone is known more or less than the massive immigration policy of the Blair Government was designed “to strike the nail of the right in diversity”.
The Labour gives the partial election, the Tories lost the partial election in safe seat against lkip = Labour in crisis Have you talked about your fight against reality with a therapy?
I think that it's the same multiculturalism that leads to this return of handle, the ring has been very far since the end of the war, and I think it's going to divide now in the other sense.
Did you talk about your fight against reality with a therapy?
Lol - Security Labour Seat, a difference of 617 votes.
It's depressing Jack, you know, I know, everyone who's not in the deni.
Of course, the Torries saw well worse, but for the Labour, it's a winner in the Pyrrhus.
Search the word "Victoire" in any context, and you will see that when it is used in argumentary way against the word "defeated", it wins the battle!
I agree, Jack, it's a victory, but she's mature.
The Labour had to win at least a few thousands of votes.
If they store a performance like that in a safe seat, can you honestly imagine the majority to return?
Personally, I'm uncertain that wins in 2015 as long as Lib Dems are not here.
Of course you do not understand how our parliamentary democracy works, right?
Yes, I know the glass of Canada, Groenland and the north of Russia slowly.
On the contrary I ask if Venus's alignement and March etc should not be considered too?
Generally, there is a need to see the Earth more "pateous" or malleable that it is imagined.
Is that what?
Some little perplexities.
On the other hand, Wylie speaks of a 'excellently simple mechanism: with the disappearing of the glass that swims on the earthquake, the pressure on the snake is relaxed, what gives/donning (a) a shock to the production of magma (b) while facilitating access to the surface??
In any case, it is the "booth cut" or the facilitation of the access to the soil surface (more or less) localized.
It is difficult to distinguish the cause of the effect and inverse Quant to climate warming, I seem to be prudent instead of focusing on its effects on our environment, which is already quite complex.
Does this volcanism very friendly affect our environment?
Is there no effect on our climate, future, or past warming?
Is Prudence not it anymore?
When complexity is not aware of simplification, let us apply this simple and observe.
Yeah, but also, when he is doing night, we're seeing less good.
Hello, the end of the last glass period has also been accompanied by a stronger systemic activity, including in the "active" mountain chain where on the very English continental parties, Canada, Scandinavia.
Cordialement CB
It is too often ignored that the earthquake flows on the magma and that the only moon passage is to mount or drop from some 30 to 60 cm, which is different, according to its passage to the Zenith, as it does for the oceans.
What gives it that the slowing of the textile plates, as well as the mares, is more or less facilitated by this movent forest, so much more than the pollar calotures are aligned by the source of the glass, which therefore causes a change of land balances to the equator, as the volume of the earth remains constant.
I am glad about this "human" speaking of the Supreme of Nature and his self-declared commander, ridicule by his stupid action on the environment which has created it and which has so separated it, and itself and in this environment.
And all this to remain the top commander of this nature that exceeds it in the organization of its own fishermen, through an inventation that is to find all the ways possible to dominate its next, one of the other, because of the cooperation, the money.
The earthquake is not on the magma, but on the earthquake, which is constituted of solid rock.
I personally find him impossible to look at it.
Pretensive and arrogant.
That remembers me Ascent of Man de Bronowski.
Live the next part.
Beautiful story Wild1
Instead, I remember a totally generous series of 2002 called "Ape-man".
One of the best documentary series I've never seen.
Of course, almost nobody remembers it now.
Don't worry you've never been over the first impression.
Your loss...
"Gleeves, our far away" You should look at this passage again.
Or read about evolution.
Super program Thanks Brian
I'm almost sure that the "Humanity History" documentary has already been performed several times, they are always going to Ethiopia (evidently)
Oh there I don't support this guy, Brian, "air thousands" Cox, who goes to Ethiopia to try to make bike eyes before a brain in a mouth.
And his narration...
It must be hard for you, obliged to look at Coxy.
There may be a group of support for you, so it is.
I agree, everything is presented in a way I can understand.
I loved the program, wonderfully filmed.
Does Marcel Gauchet represent a marxist bossol?
Effectively, it is the individuality that prevails today.
It is therefore necessary to be himself, in itself, therefore not in line.
Of course, but Descartes is also located at the time of individuality event, and its intellectual question expresses this event.
But at that time it is just the prizes that appear, today the individualism structures the whole society, educated or not, cultivated or not, rich or poor...
We're good in the individualism of "mass"!!
Without doing an inexperienced horizon, there is no parent with the carthesian movement to examine what we are receiving to believe, what is believed itself.
More than rebellion, the doubt is fecond.
Fair of Foucault a Revolutionary is an absurdity.
Many xxx library are referring to it and claim it.
His work on psychiatrist has produced a contra-reform!
In presenting the problem at the level of his paranoid name, he blocked any progress and reflection on the reality of the fool.
And I brought the most reductive and reactionary vision: the behaviorism.
The left is absolutely right about this point and being anti-conformist, it is fighting against this decertation.
We call to Marcel left to be a defenseman of the order.
Great idea!
Be beautiful and rebellious, ask for ones...
Black and smells, others.
Besides and robots, you understand the most followers of those who see rebelle in their eyes.
In any case, thanks to his complainant polemics to put this patient and continued humanist under the fire of the newspaper Marcel Gauchet, and, if it is slightly clear.
David Cameron supports the increase in the landscape of the inheritance tax
How many other budget cuts will be needed to pay the social benefits of this rich person?
Dave the robot will well increase its net value once he will not be to power.
Business Councils, allocations, consultation costs, a series of best-sellers written by a negro on the 'serial policy' – it will be 100 £ once it would be passed the weapons left.
Obviously, he doesn't want to have an income on heritage.
Isn't it the same lie as the last election?
And the most rich are those who are certainly very less inheritance taxes thanks to super-payed accounts and tax evasion programs.
This has all the signs of a Empire declining where heritage kills innovation.
It'll be 100 pounds once he'd pass the weapon left.
Whatever.
It will probably propose to increase the floor to 1 million £, which is well depending on what you say it's.
What was your position when the Labour doubled the floor to 6500,000 for the couples?
Do you think that Brown was thinking only of his own heritage, or aren't you just a tribalist without brain?
We haven't chosen it last time, we had a coalition at the place.
You couldn't allow him to blame it only if we had elected it to power.
As the rest of us, "Dave" will not die "normally".
The climate change and the imminent expansion will end it, him and the others of his acabitat.
His “ riches ” will be so unnecessary as that of the others and will not save him, nor his children.
Unable income is a social advantage, especially in a country where government debt exceeded 10,000 000 000 000 000 £.
We must all be imposed to pay the essential services and pay the debt.
I agree with you Exdionys.
I don't say that the doctrine of discipline is unnecessary, of course, I only say that it is insufficient to compensate certain natural "insufficients".
Unreasonable Declaration for the math professor that she was!
How...
Better recruitment and better forming teachers this is a quality approach.
However, the French political class does not know any other approach than quantitative.
There were 2 possible answers, the first would be to select teachers according to their ability to deliver knowledge => reform of recruitment modalities.
In +, she hates children because she doesn't understand them.
Don't understand them, she does not know how to act or react to work well => She is reduced to establish a challenge relationship that makes all suffering in pure loss => should be 1 training with skills to teach.
A work that's learning, surely.
But pedagogy is mainly an art, natural arrangement and vocation before being a technology.
Working on and with human beings is not making car parts.
Pedagogy does not go in equation even when we are a math professed!
"education sciences" cannot compensate a lack of natural attitudes.
What lacks now, just now, is a real vocation in the bcp of those who embrace the professionals
If there are donations, pedagogy (I prefer doactic disciplinary) allows those who have less tendencies to do not wrong.
There are ways to address a more effective issue.
The real unknown today are the students whose 2/3 say to us: Learning does not serve anything I already know what I think.
A Slate article describes well the chaotic situation of this income.
Regretton the Old Standard Schools of Institutors..
She finished at 3 hours of the morning from this week, but she starts at midnight.
If this is found, it is in any way appropriate to its time job.
Oh, I didn't know that, thank you.
It doesn't matter with me!
It's a few years that his emission starts at midnight.
We have this thing called iplair and that allows us to listen to the request emissions when we want it!
The Internet is so amazing, isn't it?
I don't have iPlayer on my phone and with a maximum download speed of 4 MB in me, I can't really listen to radio emissions no longer.
I have a type usb adaptor from my SKY box and which is connected to the Internet but listening to the radio on my TV has seemed too complicated.
Yeah, I think I'm wrong at the time, I had to hear Richard Lester about 3 hours.
Although they were men on Radio 2, they could at least put a woman in their antena time when one of the men is in vacation or sick, it would at least be pleased to people.
They should start off from Jeremy Vine.
His emissions are all sensitively declared in the debate, and it would be better on a chain like LBC.
The lack of DJ women in the day, where no regular animators, from Chris Evans on the morning at Simon May's emission at the return of the job, isn't a woman
That's five emissions.
So what (of these five) is the most likely to be changed.
Shenan knows it very well, but he doesn't say anything - for now.
Steve Wright is the half-detailed one of these times.
Jeremy Vine may be returned to the offices as a real journalist, but dinner keeps all the glass air of a Daily Mail radio.
I think he's quiet, waiting for the current team to be shocked, or it's going to shoot.
I was born in Soisse in 1950!
Too late?
It's normal that these people vote FN.
For 40 years, we have both the same parties that are altered to the power and make the keys of the country to the other as less good as they have not taken it.
The campaigns are very poor, quite poor than the banlieues with the isolation.
We need to make kms to find a cinema, a bar, a gymnase, a theatre.
But as they don't burn, they're not attacking, not handling, they're not interested in political men...
But thank you not talk about a department where you haven't lived.
Yes, Doclocal, they're under men, sociology is good to think about them.
They have the rate of absentism and early alcoholism too high...
The NF prospers on human beasts, inculture and ignorance as they say that there is still a huge potential of growth, they really need to be bad to not have done better...
Today, the NFF is particularly prospered on poverty, fear of daily, the other, and the feeling of no perspective.
But yes, you're right!
That smellful humanity.
Happy there are people like you, intelligent, cult, and erupted to save the honor.
They've been looking for him.
Take the electors for cs...
That's what happens
Who are they?
"forgotten" in fact there is at least less than resources => below the funds.
This is the comment I left on twitter (@priya963) Listen, you can't just "adding and mixing", the women must be integrated in the development process.
What I mean here is that in many developing countries, existing standards are subjected to, such as child guard and social-producing roles.
This allows to recognize that women can work in the economic area and that's super - it's necessary.
But it is not possible without recognizing the fact that women will then have a double floor, i.e. they will be waiting for their work while continuing to play their social-reproductive role.
I'm not convinced to my sister.
Economy and benefits do not recognize gender roles.
The money talks, and if a sex isn't at the height, next!
The benefits are shocking from your life.
What are you doing, what's the advantage and what do you have to offer?
The benefits result in heroism and education of children.
If it was a crime, the companies would listen.
Employers will never employ women from 20 to 45 years of age.
Good say my sister.
It is very difficult that nobody speaks of the unpaid social work in this article.
In some countries, the value of non-employed social work (of the largest part of women) must be equal to 50% of GDP.
The unpaid social work does not receive sufficient support and is sub-valued (not speaking about the fact that men do not do enough), but it enables us to work and to maintain our work.
The unpayed social work is also an important reason for many women are not able to find a real "economic emancipation" outside the home...
Thank you for all your comments - to return to Mskayadee's point, how can we take into account the responsibilities taken by women in a disproportionate manner when women are taking gender integration projects?
A very practical article.
I'm sure he will help many people who have to “cook a case. ”
Tigre is not Russian but Western propaganda.
Chinese are only responsible for the current situation and would be better to sit at the negotiations table.
The right to self-determination and the Russian soldiers are simply employed near the border, planned long-term exercises before the current situation.
In addition, tigre has no anti-air mixture in its possession.
Free the Tigristan!
You made my day!
Oh, yeah, teeth.
He's just coming back to me the same kind of idea.
This is a pretext all found to weaken a few separaters in order to attach China.
If Siberia is in China, China is in Siberia.
It's just time to repair this anomalie.
Why is an article on a tiger, wonderful and real risk of extinction finally transformed into a betely leading article against Poland?
What's he going to do with the fingers?
This isn't a shell on the tiger of Siberia, but a shell on the suites of a Poutine's com operation.
When both media are exposed, it is also exposed to the ironium even to the critical.
The permanent victim retours of the Soviet-Poutinian sympathisant.
Holland had also taken the weight with his chameau without crying to the French anti-France complex.
There our learner Alain Bougrain-Dubourg, Sacred Protector of the Great Russia, was personally and physically involved in the reintroduction of this tiger.
In any case he understanded everything, he's barried...
That Hollande's going back, that's something.
First, it seemed to be a horrible idea.
But, on the basis of the article, it seems that it is both an answer to a real problem - the dark emergency subsidies - and effective.
So it is difficult to find something to be re-redirected.
And if only 53% of this sample was broken before, and 73% afterwards, it is a little empty sense of parentalism.
After all, there's no inconvenience to broke the teeth!
In fact, complaints seem to be related to the fact that they are targeted to the unemployers and that this confirms a negative stereotype.
But if that was exactly, then it is not a justified criticism.
Belinda Smith, from the Canterbury Regional Health Committee, said that the Ministry was concerned about the number of emergency dent subsidies offered by the Working Department and Revenue from the Ministry of Social Development to youth unemployed.
On a mediatic plan, there would be better adapted means to implement it, I think.
But he looked reasonably well thinking.
There is an inconvenience in the fact that the dents are broken.
If you broke them after having wine, it can hurt the emnamel skin.
If your teeth brown is old and strict, it can smell the genius and cause inflammation.
And I remember a emission on the book Guiness of Records where someone tried to cut the dents the most long, and the judges Guiness at the time had been very unconsequent to do this because of the weak effects of a frequent and long-term dent brochure.
' At first, very pleasant.
It seems to be an experimental design.
The simple fact that voluntary for this study will change the habits of participants who knew that the brochure of dents would be studied.
This is why most of the behavioral studies include things such as double swimming, witness groups, etc.
There is no way to reject these results on the programme itself.
In view of the fact that these texts are sent to each youth from social advantages, there are two things different from the test: 1) This is not volunteers, and 2) they do not give information back when they broke or blowing tooths (the results easily wrong by people who give their results in the expectations).
Is there any effects at the epigenetic level?
Studies (Pr Lyonnet) showed that maternal environment (including uterus) could have effects on genetic heritage, not in the genome, but in the expression of genes, and that these heritage trails could be transmitted to the next generation.
Does it affect this phenomenon?
The nidation itself seems like a kind of grain.
There may be consequences, but as long as we do not want to be kidnapped of a perfect clone of itself, is it a problem priority?
I think it's going beyond the reasonable limit.
The desire of maternity and parentity must not be able to go further without possibly addressing the issue of ethical, risk, mother and child.
Not the physician is all powerful, it is not unlimited, and it is unfortunate and painful to accept that all women will not have it, or children they want to have.
It has nothing, absolutely nothing, to see with the tran
But let people, women, others, have their body, their idea of love that can go to risk take and keep your little tests alone, all in your small panel alone.
from their "confidence" this magic sack to have this wonderful moment of pregnancy.
Why would I keep it stable in my coffee-fort if he can still give love.
The current ethriced circumstances make the FRYDMAN carefully on its communication, but if "acceptable" was accepted to reflect, "on" would be acknowledged that it is only the skin and not the genetic material involved.
What will you consider as a argument against: cf here these reactions all men curiosely....
Marjane, every organ don't know anything.
I've been a plasma donor for years, that's not totally known.
I was registered as a slippered snake donor (I never selected because the selection is very strict and it understands both for the recipient and for the donor), that is a real operation.
Now as a man, I would not allow you to judge in a sense or another to take part in this gift, but I will listen to the women to speak.
@Margane: Indeed, this has nothing to deny, and it strengthens the love act that this implies.
Give a king to a member of his family who needs nothing to be renowned, and that's done!
Please, don't have any Messsi v Ronaldo combinations.
It's low.
I agree, we don't need this.
Overall, there's no more competition...
Ronaldo is the best athlette.
Messi is the best footballer.
The sport has become a yoyo club.
They're too good for the Second, but they don't have Liga's standard.
Rivaldo was not part of the winner team.
Thank you for correcting me.
But Rivaldo well played for the Sportvo before going to Barcelona.
Ronaldo that continues to do everything to fight all the goals records of Real Madrid this season to then be able to return to Old Trafford this year with quiet conscience...
I'm worried to believe it.
I think Ronaldo will put a term to his career at Santiago Bernebeu.
I think you want to talk about the stage of the international oil investment company?
I looked at a shit connection so I couldn't tell you great-chose if Valencia was well defended and without ownership, they were worth winning.
I was scared that the field environment was not too fast, but they were well played.
The Paris game in the whole becomes better.
A disgusting punishment claimed but saved just title by Diego.
A chaste environment Mestalla, and it was not to be funny for the Atletic bus to bomb.
That's interesting.
A complete article signed by the young researcher Amandine Marshall, “On the origins of the momization”, but illustrated, is published in the Archeology magazine last September 524.
It is good to have arguments to confirm and give what is being intuitive.
It's not surprising that before making complicated it makes it simple.
All science progresses in small steps.
And "The Organ" of the woman who was preserved to him was?
Awesome!
Hello and thank you for your tickets.
He was like to read me a few years ago that a black boy's mom had been found in the current Libye and that this discovery had opened new horizontales, including geographical and temporary (I think I remember that the mother was a thousand years ago to the known African mothers).
Do you have information about this?
Thank you for the advance.
She earns the reading a little.
It may not be modern contaminations.
Is the desert at the time not far away than now?
Why don't you imagine plants like cannabis swimming to the place where there is only sand now?
We knew the song.
And there is enough that a scientist of Europe confirms it without any evidence, so that it is a scientific truth: the Egyptians and the Africans to eve and today have never invented nothing in their homes.
But the song does not tell us who are the inventors of African inventors in Africa.
If it isn't and always "of his wicked debts".
You should read the article.
This is a article elaborated by neo-liberal market cookies and preaching against the mobility of persons and for the mobility of goods.
I think there are other people at Ebola and on which the Spanish government lies us, not to give up bad images and to protect the tourism.
Today, I would like to believe that tourism is the last of their concerns.
But they could remain silent to avoid a general panic.
I would like to believe the same thing about tourism, but the governments of law in particular (e.g. the Spanish and the United Kingdom) tend to protect business interests instead of people.
Please stop calling your local MP and claiming the lack of transparency.
Although I think that the government here is only a band of connards, good and corrupted, as Madrid is not a very tourist place, I doubt that it is their largest concern.
What are you waiting for?
(Whoever respect and compassion I have for nurse and colleague), because tourism is one of the only things that allow millions of people to keep the head outside the water, I would say, yes, it's important.
If they were absolutely repatriated by missionaries, I don't see why they couldn't send them to a military base and cure them there in a field hospital, rather than in the capital, for example.
Rajoy had the mission to defeat Spanish health services, privated nationalized hospitals, especially in Madrid, which was its power base, until the courts were in the case.
It's nothing just a right-to-legal public relationships supporting Cameron, and I think it's wrong with the next elections.
To be just against Cameron (I know that this is not easy here) socially he is far from his right and would find his place towards the religious crowds of right in America.
Now he must sing the hospital lounges that he had before down to try to achieve his goal that is to protect Spanish tourists.
I'm sorry, but you can't really compare the Tories or any other European party on the Spanish right.
That's cases on the other hand, believe me.
The Spanish government is a lie about almost everything about it.
It's not like someone could accuse you of repairing informed rumors.
So you have tankful evidence to support this idea?
This Watch Tower is called The comments are free.
Thank you, Mr. Suiot.
Without the work at the centre of production and economy with its rights and guarantees, there will be no way out.
Great, but especially fascinating reactions on the forum.
Many TPE patrons seem to read The World to take the time to condemn Pr's proposals.
Let's go on the anti-intelligence of the environmental era.
A Legal Professor at the University of France seems to not be able to know the labour market except if it is Nobel economic price and proposes to completely liberalize it
It was so better before, it was true when Dr. Villermen observed the work of the children of 8 years of age 10 hours per day when the Canuts had been shocked because of a collective convention signed.
Oh, the good old time...
Your reaction is so fascinating by your misconsciousness of the TPE patron house!
His work is not to know the right in all his meal, but to manage and produce.
Four manual amounts inscribed on my juvenile salary ballot, more than 100 more than today!
This is an example, for example, that can be quoted more, which illustrates the permanent flow of contractuals, taxed without measure of consequences, and that extracts the small business.
Your paper would be very useful if you had written it as a experts and not as a Sorbon client.
In order to order the arch-result argument of the French Labour Code in relation to herbete, a serious university would be extended into Swiss texts and would compare the number of official texts, then the comments (the absence of the lasts that means that Swiss laws are more comprehensible than ours).
By comments in a Code, which is working or not, the legality is seen in particular...
And yes, in France, there is still a judge who is responsible for applying the laws when a employee is licensed, for example....
Who's that complicated?
Do you find that the rules of law (legal law, law, conventions, contracts) are in the field of unsuccessable barriers and trade?
What's he doing?
How long is that?

For each article on Ai Weiwei I recently read, you are part of the first three comments of its popularity.
Let's go to something else!
Let's see otherwise, the choice is not missing in the world of art.
If China can produce new artists who are not parts of the Communist Party, the world will be interested.
Yes, GhenisCan is probably a Chinese government troll.
I think that China has produced a lot of contemporary artists.
Those who are Communist Government's doors are not appreciated in Western, and those who are not talking doors are not well connected as Ii Weiwei.
For those among you who think that the art of Ai Weiwei is a kind of fraud, this is what you rate.
Thank you for this, you're coming to ruin my breakfast.
I'm sorry, but it had to be worth exhibiting it (not to make a bad word game).
It's the man who shuts old ceramics and calls it from art, right?
There's the art, and then there's vandalism trying to get attention.

KARSENTY DEMISSION This master is unfair to carry out an electional mandate the extremists of any border (including sionists) must be put to the distance
Philippe Karsenty and his ridiculous theories of the complot, who valued him a number of judicial convictions, are horrible to Israel and to the matrix of Neuilly.
He does not represent either one or another.
Philippe Karsenty took his battle against the truth alone, in marginal.
WHAT RESSEMBLE ASSEMBLE
What do you have to do with the Mayor of Neuilly against Philipe Karsenty, who tried to blame a journalist and his family, and who publicly calls for attacking this urbanist?
Forgiveness of crime?
Don't I find Neuilly on my card?
Is this a new administration that holds these new privileges??
This type requires care, as well as Ulcan Chelli, to do both in the theory of the anti-jude/anti-Israel complex and whose resorts are perfectly identical to those of their most furious detractors.
As many people believe to see in any political decision the hand of the “Senists” (then the sense has tendencies to disappear by their abuse), these two there, as the LDJ or still the CRIF, believe in any critical, even banal, an appeal anti-simism, which is not unremembering the darkest hours of our history, because it is still fecond by the ventricle of my good beast, we believed to return to Russia in the 19th century!).
Noteing that the unbelievablely stupid theories of Karsenty on Charles Enderlin's reporting are still more stupid than those on September 11th.
And God knows that the theories of the Complex on September 11 are of a very crazy beast.
And this type has political responsibilities, which is extremely concerned.
To clarify my analogy with the theory of the complex of 11 September, it is discussed about a cognitive depreciation on the way to discuss the subject.
All overwhelmed by a completely thorough truth, with too much time, spent too much money to spend it, it is insupportable to the adaptation of this theory of dismissing it (e.g. in the case of extreme religions).
A logic and inelectable flee before, the end justifys all the means, even the lie, which is a complex, but likely not to struggle the mission of the questionnaire.
You suggest to make attention and not put everyone in the same cart, but that's what you do for September 11th.
There is still a floor of questions without answers for this event, and Bush/Cheney/Saudians/consorts seem to have not been pressed to answer it.
There are effectively very fair theories, but the official theory is, at least on a few points.
Oh, nothing's funny now...
Health NGOs and public health-care ports are found that the results of the study are widely in favour of their sensibilisation efforts.
And of course they will need more subsidies to follow!!
As the fact of smoking was socially accepted 50 years ago and now it is recognised for what it really is, alcohol will also know its time of judgment where the real damage that it causes in our society will be exposed.
More than waiting that everyone attacks me now...
Well, it's easy to be pleased to say things like "excellent alcohol consumption is grown", but what (a little more) more effort is to give real facts.
I'm sorry if you're considering that as a attack - will you drink a drink and develop?
Better is to risk this instead of putting my mental health in danger by abstending me.
The Government ends the joy when it costs the money.
Here are other alarmist advice based on few reliable statistics.
Two mediums per day is at least a low level of alcohol consumption, and the first quote seems to indicate that it increases the risk of many cancers, but the second means that it is a lower or less dangerous amount.
Maybe the Cancer Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council should be concerted (on one or two drinks, but especially not three) and give us a figure on which they agree - that it is justified or not.
Now, we're going to tax them down, like the smokers!
They do it already - soon this will be the herb!
My father didn't drink and smoke, and cancer brought him to 64 years of age.
So I'll continue to drink my two red bottles on Friday and the same night (and the other nights when my wife is not here).
Why is it that the Cancer Council encourages children to go in places where alcohol is serving is a old modernity that the Cancer Council has delibly ignored.
What's not related to a risk of cancer today?
Requins do not touch cancer - they eat anything but are not good company.
Requins can take cancer to skin cancer.
Charlie Whiting's incompatibility is a recurrent subject for many years.
Remember to run when we can run and reciprocally.
Completely agreed.
Whiting is the Blessed-oui yi of Bernie.
To them two, they destroyed the F1 in security pretext.
We hope it's better than Schumi or at least the worst Wendlinger applies his accident in 1994.
Absolutely agreed with you, but attention to point 1: is not the F1, but the circle authorities who refused to advance the start to do not swear TV dispatch creatures.
Very precisely, +1
I just want to want a quick and fast rebuilt in Jules Bianchi!
Brazil 2003, Europe, 2007, the accidents that failed to occur between depanage grains and f1 were unprecedented warnings.
We knew that one day would happen, and Jacques Lafite, in particular, said it for years.
How can the course organization and the FIA have allowed these hands without safeguarding?
I can't accept that the risks of the workplace or the fault for chance are invoked when the predictable has not been prevented.
Or this accident was it.
It should even be said, that there was a yellow dragon, which does not only mean "interdiction to overcome in the area" but has for the first purpose of signaling a danger.
It's not horrible, it's happily for the family that had to be before the TV.
Even under yellow dragon, pilots will just lift up the feet.
In changed conditions, virginity can be much more slower the next tour and the pilot, believed to arrive with sufficient margin, may even have “slow” speed in comparison with normal rythm.
But well, we're caused in the empty there, as long as the images aren't seen, we'll not be able to give a positioned view.
I don't see too much what this changes.
Does there any blessed ones?
According to the CBC, no damage has been reported.
The CBC showed the information this morning before it happens, and what makes me ask what caused the slaughter.
It is difficult to believe that there are still jobs where 24 hours to hold.
I don't think there are people blessed because Canada is almost empty.
There may be blessed animals such as skins, rats, etc.
I hope it's irone.
Some parts of Vancouver have the strongest population density in North America and Toronto's aglomeration account for at least six million people.
In Saskatchewan's campaign, trains do not disappear as slightly, and these types of train often cross small urban areas.
Almost every Canadian city is passed through a iron road line, and trains are very, very often in a day.
Furthermore, as water courses often follow in areas where there are lakes, rivers or oceans, they also walk in deeply poor places, because people always want to live near the water.
Thus, the whole rail traffic crosses the center of a city because it was a central element of the original construction of the road lines here.
You may have tried to be funny, but there is a great potential for rail disasters in Canada.
Mansbridge made a report about this last night, really shocking.
Of course you did not read the article on the devastation and explosion of a train in a town of Quebec that made 47 dead?
In fact, you have some reason.
The city of Vancouver was a well-known portal city before the fertilizing road.
This says, when the fertile roads were built, they passed through the centre of the established communities because it was the most direct and central road.
Maybe employees of the National Railway Society should be held at the next Conference on dangerous products in Calgary in Canada on 2 and 3 December 2014.
CN employees are long formed in the transport of dangerous products.
This article, as many comments, makes the contrary to the primary religious question: a religion is a revelated truth and for his believers he will not be able to exist other truths.
All the problem is here, and the exeges of the theologists do only strengthen this fact, no matter what is good to talk about the sex of angels?
"God said: That's good - it's bad" > It's not compatible with democracy, it's called the dictature (variant: theocracy).
It's a leader (The Mosaic country but not an importance): "But without religion, how do you want to keep the people?"
In other words: obey to the curse rabbin imam pastor and do your prayers, that will be better!

Yes, that's what Voltaire and others thought, do Robespierer in a certain way trying to build a worship of the Supreme.
But our oligery also has its cults: the euro's strong ( instead of the currency at this time ) or the free market (passively supported by the State when it is to be reflected ) , etc .
Great ideas of religious surgery.
Yes, but especially where there was no distinction between religious and profane.
Where the rational emerges, the religious is at the rider and is expressed in scourge.
The religion is born as the ideological support of the State, and the gods put to the service of ambitions even if it has also brought forms of contestation.
The theology decreased between fidelity in the form of revelation and adaptation to the air of time did not doubt.
Fanatism is often described as a bad interpretation of the "sacred texts".
This does not resist to the consideration of these texts that are made explicitly appeal to the hatred of the wrongman.
This is instead the moderate religious (and happily they are the most) which "discriminate" texts and not only consider what is about humanism and common values in all humanity, acts and different believers.
For me, fanatism is the beast and bad application of passages of the sacred texts out of their context.
Thus, some verses of the Coran calling to kill “infidelity”,“infidelity”,“judea” or “Christians” are incomprehensible and therefore unacceptable if there are no few higher or lower verses that indicate that these executions are just just in cases where the musulmans are attacked, killed, and in the situation of legitimate defence.
on Yves Petit : "" regarding the "foolard" is well a religious prescription that makes today almost ununununity in the "savings".
There are idiots all over there.
The only positive point to take from this is that it has caused a general condemnation.

Isn't you guilty of the same damage as that shown in the clip?
band of Néandertalians superpayed and hypersexualized.

An insult to our intellectuality, that's what he gave us!
If you decoll your eyes of the TV for a moment, you would see that Australia has a rich cultural heritage, starting by paintings in greens and on stones made by its Indian people and that are still a source of inspiration for modern artists today.
And then there is the Opera of Sydney and a national opera company that produced wonderful songers such as Joan Sutherland and Nellie Melba.
The australian cinema produced films like The History of the Kelly Gang, Mad Max and Gallipoli.
The notable Australians includes Errorl Flynn, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Heath Ledger, Geoffrey Rush and Cate Blanchett.
The only thing that causes your intelligence is you and your ignorance.
Russell Crowe is New Zealand, and the Bee Gees were English.
Your intelligence really needs to be insulted!

The almost totality of the 331 deaths since the end of the fire are civilians of Donbas victims of army bombs, due to uncontrolled elements according to Kiev.
The presentation of the hypocritical responsibilities suggested in the article without go to the explicitly appointment of separaters is in the Otanese line of the World that does not hesitate to turn facts and responsibilities to maintain the fault of the neonazis pro-European natives who are courageously faced by Russian wicked ones.

Extract from the long document you quoted on MH17: "This ticket has not absolutely aimed to say that the pro-Donetsk resistants are innocent".
The Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation said that Ukraine is responsible.

From the Ukrainian army (this, unfortunately, lost soldiers almost every day, according to her)?
Of uncontrolled elements (sceptible to say anything)?
WHAT THE ROMANIA!
It's all the way you're going to get Hungary!
And I say that as Roman citizens.
Transylvania, with a woman of Hungary origin, on the other hand.
That says, I can't support the Piturca team, they don't represent me.
Piturca is a member of the established powers that has not stopped denixing the Roman football to the patitic level he has reached now.
They formed a network that produced the "Coperative" before the beginning of the season which team would bring the championnat, which teams would go to Europe, which would be released, and who bled the money to its grace, mainly by sales of players who were well under-stimated.
Gica Popescu, the former captain of Barcelona, did business with the above-mentioned agents, and tried to avoid paying taxes (e.g. a million euros), then paid them, but, apparently, he was not advised by his lawyers, refused to grant his mistakes to the court (which would be awarded without punishment), and therefore took three years and half in prison.
The case also valued the prison to Becali brothers, four owners of the club, Mihai Stoica steaua manager, and Popescu, for infringements related to the football.
George Becali also purses a punishment to have tried to sudow (and after the facts) a team to fight us (CFR Cluj) in the last match of the championnat, to win the title and to return the jackpot of the Championship Liga.
The team he tried to shoot was our neighbors in Cluj, University.
We won 1-0 in their stage, a result that allowed us to be the first Cluj champions while they were released.
I'm always saving this moment.
In the dismissing of this corruption attempt, Piturca, among others, was signed as a witness to a false document that taught that the money that the police had confidened to Cluj was in relation to a field sale.
So this poor man who is not educated, stupid, tricky and mentor does not represent me, and he won't never do it.
Hungarians are only a band of nationalist cretins today.
You could think that after the last time when they cast shoes of the stage and shopping vitrines, and where they marked racist flags on their streets, they couldn't have had tickets this time, but not.

"the idea is absurd that the majority of employees do not search for jobs" LOL (not comment)
Should unemployment generalize the control of unemployed employees starting in 2015?
I hope that in the multitude, fiscal poole, the absolute control of the gouverneurs commonly called ploutocrats, banksters, claptocrats, fiscal escapes, shooting patrons and other malandinians will also be generalized.
Do you know to do a phrase without banksters or ploutocrats?
You look very proud of your jargon every time.
It's really true when we have the class: we are treating the population of legs and without dents
At each new period of unemployment, it is decades and decades of candidates that I address to employees who most often do not even have an accused of receipt, it was automatized.
It is also the total absence of monitoring or support from the Polish Employee.
To conclude that the "socialist" patronym of this government appears to me as an insulto in the memory of Jaurès or Mendeus France.
Have we read here a article of the enclosed canard?
A unemployment can remain a few months without the news of its agency, but it must continue to search for jobs through its own means.
It is learned that controls have been allowed to raise people who had no longer affected unemployment.
We are therefore asked how to do the control of people that we never see.
The sanctions are asked to be a radiation for someone who has no access to employment or unemployment.
And if it can be admitted that this reform will allow more radication, what will it help recruitments.
"A unemployment can remain several months without news of its agency, but it must continue to search for jobs by its own means." Effectively, it's horrible.
The question should be addressed, why are these countries in the EU while the authorities are clearly unable to defend the equal ideas of Europe?
Isn't it like if Spanish or Italian authorities had made great-chose about racism in the foot?
Should we cut them from the EU?
The EU was only economic and should remain.
The purpose is not to be a 'Pension Police'.
EU is a peaceful project.
She has no sense on an economic plan.
This is probably the reason why Great Britain will soon leave the EU: it is the most inequalizer society in Europe.
What equality?
Eastern European teams are constantly having the corrupted mafia arbitraries that is the EUFA.
The best solution would be that the whole East leaves this lucrative organization fore and creates the siena.
At least we'll look at the football.
This anti-racism cross is only a screen to cover injustice and corruption!
No, it's not true.
Monetary and commercial exchanges, instead.
European equality ideas?
So what is wrong with Europe to let the United Kingdom entering?
Uefa should appeal them to have joined Blatter's committee and his men.
This happens all over a few years, and I don't exaggerate.
Shoot from the Guardian two or three days ago:
Should he hope to get rid of small symmetric phrases, just the story of incoming the polemic?
Whatever it is, it is a fact that every small event toward peace there has been, there will be people who have worked to shoot oil on the fire.
The decoration would be to say that the Western States are against a "Palestian State", which they are pro-Israel, and that it only explains that these States have never done anything against the Israeli State.
The decoration was to say that to solve the Israeli-Palestian issue, the Israeli identity state should be actioned against an occupational Israeli-orienter destructor of colonial pressure.
In 1945, instead of creating a Jewish state in Palestine in the detriment of an Arab population that wasn't for nothing in the Shoah, it was more reasonable to guide the Baviera of his German people (which they were guilty of the Shoah) to replace them by the surviving Jews.
It would have been justice, Germans had nothing to claim, and Europe would have maintained millions of educated, entrepreneurs and dynamic inhabitants.
Mr., take the example of Western Sahara colonization...
That Marocco is the colonialist, it's a proof!
But, as for Israel, it must also ask the History, its allies and supports to interview truths.
The colonialism, whatever it is, has never been altruist, we agree.
Then stop your pirates to support Israel as a colonist.
The Gale has been colonized by the Romans but now there is no discrimination between the descendants of the Romans, Gaulos or other.
In Palestinian there is a discrimination on the basis of origins.
Furthermore, the Israeli State is defined as the one of a "judean multitude" whose non-Jewish non-Jewish would not be able to be part of.
The Israeli State discriminates the non-Jewish, from which the content.
Conclusion: To solve the conflict, it is necessary to break with the Jewish and non-Jewish sionism.
In Maghreb, even some people were baptized by the name of their first status by this savior civilization!
Two realities that must stop ignoreing.
First, the European sionist project (counciling Palestine) involved in deposing the Palestinians, so it was an intrinsically anti-Palestian project, so the solution is necessary to break with sionism.
Secondly, sionism is a political ideology.
Uruguay missed from the start.
They will give them what the dogs are ordered.
It should begin its re-administeration by small legs.
I hope he didn't lose the appetite of the game.
There are so many softs, including racial damages and physically hard tacs in the football, but Suarez was sanctified too hard.
I would like to see him returning to England, but it doesn't matter what the purists say.
Yeah, I hate all these molarists.
The football is a contact sport where the balls exist, and therefore, the players will hurt.
The fact of returning his dents into the flesh of an adversary for the advantage has no place in the game.
A rubyman was suspended for 80 matches to have made a similar gesture.
It's now the third time Suarez did it.
If you killed someone at work.
What would be the consequences of you?
I knew someone's going to do it.
If you're dislexic, I'm sorry.
I'm actually slightly dislexic.
I forgive this sarcasm with two balls.
I think he was hot to go back to full teeth.
All of these words games on Suarez are in the course of losing their smiling.
I didn't order the hair.
An essential condition for a good school course is the respect of students of their teachers and school institutions.
This works if parents culminate this respect for their children.
Parents make this more easier respect if they feel respected by teachers and schools of their children.
In the good institutions, those who make progress to their students, parents are considered partners, not as emms.
Who can believe that it is the professor that should do all the jobs (learn, education, respect, limits, living together) It is to the parents to make at least 50% of the table.
But it's definitely simpler to take it to school.
Mystery on parents is not operational.
Nobody really took on them.
Since the action will remain limited.
Instead, the school institution could have a lot of things.
Operational solutions resident.
The actors (proofs, heerarchists and ministerial) should play their role and do not remain touched.
There can be a troop cut off to restart it, not the family.
How do you not talk about education?
It is true that communication courses allow the change.
It seems to be teachers but it is forgotten the first role of the school.
Transmission of knowledge.
And if parents require there, it is that the school ensures their children's education.
What is the Minister who will make up what was called the Public Instruction.
Articles falling: few information, partial and destructive reflections.
Are you really waiting for an intelligent comment from this outside Eastern Banlieu?
It's a beast, it's clear, but I think he's instead of Willoughby, and so North coast...
Sloppy Joe does not understand the numbers.
He refuses to accept the facts.
It's not surprising that we have a budgetary emergency.
Let it fall and the economy will soon wake up.
Hunters Hill, actually.
carefully true
That's it.
A little Aloysius.
His elector is Sydney North's seat.
Effectly a beast of the North coast!!!!
Well, if British BBC televisioners want to compare the neo-conserving governments of our two countries, they would obviously arrive to the conclusion that the two of the Monster Raving Tory Wang-Bangers.
It passes for a grinning, today. :(
Yeah, but his leader regularly leaves him on his hunger.
You would be shiny as if you wake up a morning and realize that you will never have the role of Prime Minister and that all these ill and illicit benefits of life will remain forever outside your port.
Shut Joe.
Very patent.
He tried to present a budget and then abandoned.
At least he's not threatening someone.
Brittany Ferries needs a new boat.
She will well know the commander, without gas turbines - in a remote country and call for State aid.
And as she could do lobbying, no fear of the result.
And as a pool for employment in France which she has nothing to do, she is always ready to shoot when their corporation has losses on markets, especially foreigners...
That's just because their lobbying did not function that the command was cancelled.
If the company had obtained the time or planning for marpol, no doubt that the project would have been achieved.
Open, to know if it's good or not and how BF will comply with the law, although all, it would be nice that "the world" is thinking above!
The Britishtany Ferries company is detained by bretons.
Those who burn the tax centres and securities.
They want State aid.
That they didn't seem to me at least normal.
And even when arms a ship under French metropolitan pavillon is 30% more cher than any other civilized pavillon, yes, it is normal to wait for a shock of the State.
Or then it is condemned to tolerate that the British people monopolize the market.
That's the choice.
Eternal issue of French which considers its maritime façades as tourist destinations, not as activities areas, where people sometimes live different from the average parish.
This difference is paid every day, lack of investments, to spend all short.
One of the reasons for which Britain must find its sovereignty.
That's it and after they will create the bretton pavillon with exclusively composed of clean sweet brettons.
With that, they're sure they're going to make down the costs significantly...
Sure.
Unfortunately, this is what we are expecting from the BBC now.
They have always hated everything about the prog, so it is not surprising that they chose to pass further to Hackett's only career, which has always been closer to the genesis of the 70s than those of the other members of the group.
Hackett was for Genesis what Malcolm Young was for AC/DC.
If you don't understand how important he was for the sound, you really don't understand their music.
To say the truth, they do not say almost the only work of Gabriel no longer.
I don't think that BBC could be accused of "hate all the things relating to the project" because they have come to disseminate a documentary of a hour and half a year on one of the largest prog groups that have never existed.
I have not yet seen the documentary, but it's a film on the Genesis Group, not about the only projects of its members.
With regard to the only Hackett career that would be "be closer to the genesis of the 1970s," I am not agreed.
Hackett has no right to take the road, play a lot of Genesis songs on which he had several degrees of participation and intended to have a loyalty with Genesis that David Gilmour has no right to assemble a lot of demons to half ends and call it a album of Pink Floyd.
Oh, wait...
I think that Steve Hackett asks nothing more than a just representation, but he didn't receive it.
A curiose feeling, the first album of Bank, is absolutely generous, and in fact in the spirit of Genesis of the 70s.
They're passing further to Hackett's cart because, we're honest, she's afraid.
Yes, it's one of the best prog groups, but would the documentary be carried out if they didn't have their business success in the 80s?
I have not always seen the BBC spread a long documentary on groups such as King Crimson and Gentle Giant who have a very interesting story but lacking the popular attraction that Genesis has.
Good comments.
I would even say that the BBC has "all" hated the fact that it has made progressing music in time.
A person with personal interest cries "prejuds": of course.
A little more interview with Jonathan King on the DVD version?
An absolutely wonderful chance.
If death penalty is an attempt to duplicate a horrible act by another horrible act (including sometimes against innocents), then it is a clear success.
There will always be a difference in size between a criminal sentenced to death and those who kill him.
The criminal has made his act since his unreasoned understanding of society and rules.
Those who kill him do it since the vision and the best and wise reflection of a society.
That's what they don't say.
They're indefensible.
Yes, we understanded your point of view, the first time that we had.
This is precisely the difference, Mr LeClos.
There must be a well-specific spirit of the common of the dead to play violence.
That's what the criminal is doing since his understanding was wrong.
But it is also what produces pain, hate, vindicate in the nearby of the innocent victim: a false understanding which will never be able to prevail those who are wisely decisive of the death of others since their healthy and fair reasoning.
But to try to balance the analysis, it could also be said that the death condemned often have experienced a wild violence, which he could play, against people who were sweetly loved, who made it free.
The neighbors of the victims will eventually see their pain with the disappearing of the one who was the barrier, sometimes the torturer, being loved and hateing their nights.
Don't miss their support.
Thanks, Emilio for this reflection I find very just.
It is strong and exciting.
With regard to Marc Asnin, he has proved to be a great intellectuality.
The heart.
That's certainly what I've been reading for many years.
However, it would be believed to read historys of another time, of ancient things, that the barrier of the past would apologize, and then the dates they clic, 2009, 2011, 2012...
I really don't believe Philip Roth is so generous.
Search for the two other "Romisher Romanians" referred here.
Roth, Pynchon and De Lillo are all over.
I thought you'd stopped the white, man.
What's it going to be?
Roth is great, better than De Lillo or Pynchon.
And Roth is uncommonly better than this punishable Below, who received him the price.
Maybe the judges of the Nobel of this year have decided that if we have to have an American lauréat, it could be likely to have a [lenger] racist.
Munro's very good, too.
They are all produced of "geny Romans" as if it was a literary type.
His homosexual Joseph against...
Who were you reading?
How many of DeLillo books have they read?
I never ended under World but a few years later I started reading his other books.
Have you read The Body Artist?
News like "Human moments in World War III" ?
White Noise?
The first lighter, crazy, smaller, and their dialogues are also super.
I don't know if I'll end a day under world.
I just know that if I meet someone who wants to live in the same world as I and have read enough books from DeLillo to reject his writer talent, I can only be afraid that his favorite romanzer is Tony Parsons.
Why would there be a conflict?
It's a simple interest.
It was a trace of humor, "the law", not a request for definition.
Among the text and the spirit, it seems so EVIDENT here that the woman acts in SON only, and not absolutely in the institution which she represented, that the term "conflict" is asked to do it.
For her, there was no conflict.
I hope she'll take very precious!
Well, state services are very practical: or they prevent a dynamic entrepreneur to create the value or have not prevented it from the danger.
After we hear that French employees are not dynamic and are only searching for tranquility.
The unreasonable areas that are built from the day next day when a large construction program will start there, it is classic, and not only on a lower coast.
Look at the alluviales near the rivers.
It was said to us that “of today there is no more injuries thanks to the regulatory bars”.
Now, the retention lakes must be expanded in mounting and crushing the dogs.
But this will be due to state services, of course...
The benefits in the field, all of the promotion?
It's on the ground.
So six million euros.
Is it clearer, there, the interest?
Sort the calculator and you're going to dream to the life you could have been at the place of Mrs Babin, the first adjoint UMP of La Faute on the sea and the former President of the Urbanism Commission, which grants the permissions to build!
The 2 Sarkozysm triumphant mothers are old and immobiliary.
I'm on the left and not all sympathetic with Sarko, but svp, not from low political or low cuts all azimut, we're not there in a shock ball battle.
I wonder if the police who were involved in these recent fusils were also involved in these incidents.
The U.S. police are enduring criminals.
The U.S. is a mercy.
So, what the hell did you see, you?
The U.S. isn't a mercy.
Yes, the American police are driving because of the rakes they had done on the daily.
Of course, no one does never do anything but the police “come to worry because they are racists.”
That's a good apology.
The racism is indefinite in the United States, it is unfortunate that there is a incident like that to force people to see the problem closer.
Your generalization reveals a deep ignorance of the US...
You don't know it here.
Good cops must denich corrupted racists.
Get them!
Calculate it.
This kind of open racism does not exist here.
Is this the first time you participate in a conversation?
This is not a conversation, you're accusing someone to be ignoring while you're obvious that you're not going to know anything - of many sources (US sources) have noticed the perpetual problem that racism is in the United States (that's not the oise speculation).
It is very likely that you undermined the extent of the problem and don't appreciate how much the tension to this matter is at this time.
As a result, the border between public service and private security for power and privileges, which has never been very robust, becomes more notable.
Wall Street finances the NYPD in different ways, where the treatment of Occupy is on the ground.
This is the naiveness of some and the VA's false naiveness and others.
And where do you think that journalists find their information?
On the Internet?
They're going to interrogate the responsibilities, speaking, sustaining confidence.
That the man goes to Elisée really has nothing wonderful.
Then, what you know is recovery, verification, analysis.
And there's a understanding that the sarcolators are worried to do.
@Munstead, our current President has chosen on a vague of antiarcozym on the basis of mounted businesses from any parts (unless no place and no conviction) which seemed to have been concovered by magistrates(2 returned to correctional), two friend journalists from Holland.
If this collusion that is revealed between justice, political, executive, and press that is not supposed to be an organ of power does not shock you, it is that your partial spirit is awesome you!
RV with Holland ...
And of course all this is just coincidence and not scattered!!!!
If you think that only Sarkozy supports are disappointed!
From the extraordinary I could read, the VA article only makes it cut off.
I've even been so ridicule.
For the rest, the world's complaint has little chances to advocate because journalists aren't "astraints" in the secret of the sources, isn't it?
In the closest difference that it seems not to have a conviction between the VA and the power while it seems to have known it between the power and the journalists of the World for an operation against a opponent.
I should not be the only one to wait for an explanation of the World on the ground and on its dangerous relationships.
We are well before a state scandale that would cause the fall of the government involved in any other democracy.
From where this edition to lawyers, who said long on the compliance with the current government.
It's not a matter of left or right, it's worse.
I would think the shoes would be well with the smoke hair!
It's just for the numbers and to reduce salary and to create housing problems, I'm sure that if I was an immigrant of the second generation whose life was pleasant because my parents had come here, I would doubt about the issue of immigration but that's not a reason to oppose controls.
One of the most sensitive people in a BBC employees on immigration was a second generation Sikh, who said that she was in the sense of the number of people who entered and the changes they brought with them, was associated with a Muslim man who wasn't all co-operating, even rejected to give soups simply because of the religion of the lady, he also refused to enter into her place of cult, although she stated that he was not obliged to pray.
** "this said she wasn't PAS at the eye"
As we all know, if we let it do, the United Kingdom will continue to go to the right - whoever puts the limits and contests must be admired even if it is a pub director:) so better for you!
More to the right?
Where are you living?
If this country was more left, he would be communist.
According to you, what did the New Labour who's specially left?
The liberalization of a country, NHS, is the NHS to repeat, massive immigration of immigrants (in their own terms to strike the narrow of the right of Dan), the culture of social benefits, the age of all permissions, the right policy that kills the freedom of expression.
I understand that the Labour is left and not communist, I said that to blague, which I mean, they were socially manipulated a very high percentage of the population to make them dependant on the State.
It's typical of the left, if you want my opinion.
Leave your prepared arguments as much as you want, but what I have requested you, are specific examples of Gauchist Policy, or a left programme defended by the Government of New Labour.
Can you do that?
With all my respect, it's not what you asked, you asked Daniel Johnson what had done with him the New Labour, specially right.
He gave you his opinion, and then you refused to accept it and changed what you ask.
Yeah, it's more the territory of Tim Bell.
So Martin Sorrell, the strongest publisher of the United Kingdom, associates the situation of his parents to the economic migrants who are now in Britain?
What an insulting in their memory!
He had completely reason to do it.
France to France!
We've been fighting in 40 45 to fall into another disctation, that's the money.
We're going to make beautiful economies through these technocrats...
The treaties should be renegored to me.
Are you, renegotions and if the word "democracy" is still a sense in Europe, what should it not be?
The Commission is not thinking of the unfair fiscal competition between countries in respect of companies.
This must be negative quantity.
The Europe is not the solution, it's the problem...
The EU has only a goal, it is to make the rail transport sector fully marketed.
In terms, this means that all panes of the French territory will not be reserved by the rail.
The abandonion of which are already victims of many territories will only be strengthened.
All sacrifices, including the advancement of a country, on behalf of the Liberal Doxa, did not seem to me a good idea.
The EU is a real problem that will have to be treated well a day.
Not all.
Europe is the first institution to have both the will and the means of clarifying the SNCF accounts.
The French State has been dismissed for a long time.
The regions have the impression of paying for nothing, but not the way to comply with their commitments.
Or use public money without gaspillages, it is essential for today when public resources are bound.
And the great needs.
I don't know very well what could be the TER competition!
Is he still a problem with alcohol?
If that's the case, should he not be the loving leader?
It seems to me that you really have not been able to distinguish the problems that were existing during the marriage and that, of course, you are always in the way of being cut off pain and cold now that over five years have been past.
Of course, having an ex-alcoholic alcoholic so close to you and having what seems to be a daily impact on your life is energetic and very difficult.
This says, it would seem to me to love the separation process between your life and the complications you have heritage.
It looks like that is what they do, but that's my enemy.
Because you all live so close to each other and that complications seem likely to persist while new makes the surface, have you reflected on a "flood" plan so that you can make a break between your life and your future?
Financial problems have a negative effect, but with a competenced real estate credit company, a good lawyer and a bit of pressure from the court, they can be resolved.
He's a vindicative and persistent.
Why do not go to a family advisory group to tell the things openly and to provide support to help it re-work and pay food pension.
I think that's the key.
Your life is doing much more than the time you've passed with your ex.
Very good advice.
My counsel, ask the children what they would like to do, even if this means to meet the new woman.
Tell them that you will support their choice whatever it is.
Warn them that he will not hold forth his promises on the contact and ask them to consider how this would make them feel and how they will handle the deception if he does not make you.
Try for them to keep a contact with their father.
If they see you do this for their good, despite your own feeling because of the way he treated you, they will respect you.
They will never stop loveing you and if you do everything you can to facilitate a continued relationship with your father/children, they will be able to thank you when they are greater.
I'm thinking that the children end up by understanding who's fault, if they're letting them see things by themselves.
Go again a little effort you are close to Godwin point.
It has been further, in 30 to 40 years civilization will disappear, the short-term economic interests are too powerful, that is the land pool against the ice pool.
Moreover, with globalization, the country that is made at least social, fiscal, but also environmentally has a competitive advantage, and others are obliged to follow.
All the policies searching is growth, The Crossance.
There would be an international coordination, but from here...
It is not the climatesceptics that produce from C02.
It's all those who swim, who use the climate, who take the aircraft or car, those who have been living in accommodations that must have been built, who purchase industrial products that must have been produced and transported.
It is not the climatesceptics that have demonstrated against the epatox, but the truckers.
No climatesceptic policy is climate and Arnold S consums much more than me.
But nobody says that climatesceptics escape more than CO2 than others.
Environmental Defenders also move to conferences.
It is that individual actions, even if they account, will not be sufficient.
Political actions are also needed (other energy sources, reducing dependence to the car, etc.).
And politicians act in part in the sensitivity of their election.
"I'll be back" is actually a famous prophecy of McArtur made on March 11, 1942 at his start is Philippian.
Terminator has only done the expression again.
But it may be the humor to say that the expression is of Terminator.
"Storage gases are a pollutant" There are 30 definitions of the steel effect, all different.

Bingo du Guardian : How long is it before someone put the mistake to immigration?
I'm putting the fault on the crapules that took all the money.
Do we have Liberia in Texas?
You're Rick Perry and I call my $5.
I put the mistake on the mentors of democrats.
Or democrat scrooks.
Or the mentors of the Labour.
We're wrong, they're responsible.
The movement of populations could be a real aspect of this epidemic.
The asymptomatic or subklinic cases that drive in a car or aircraft for epidemia have to move the infection quickly than they can imagine.
Sex with songs, is it better?
You think it's a virus?
I don't advise you to ask a order for antibiotics.
He contracted Ebola in Liberia.
This nurse contracted the Ebola in Spain.
Mince, actually!
Don't use the word immigration, you're gonna fear the horses!
The United Kingdom depends on immigration to pay all our retreats, to take care of our old people, to hire their hygienic bassins, to enter the 30 000 people who die each year of hypothermia or hungry (not forget your laine and goodness, which allows you to retain, to eat the heat ET to eat this sandwich in the wound).
Don't be so consumed.
The uncontrolled and untested immigration will bring the Ebola into Europe and the rest of the world.
Is that a blague, or isn't it exactly done?
It's more comfortable...
This is how the public money is gathered to allow an incredible minority of individuals to pass good time in space to make gallets and turn back by playing clouds in front of television cameras.
The real television has therefore not invented anything, and the authorities certainly expect that a baby is designed here to flame the world and raise the mediatic cover to the Western reigns in the mothers of tabloids.
It may be that they're recent on the ground to find out that we're bowling here!
On the contrary to what you seem to believe, we are not sent men or women in the space to make galipettes or crowns, but to work.
And these works are very useful for humanity in general.
And that's in all areas.
Many of the things that improve our daily life are made from space research.
So yes, it's the money expenditure usefully.
You can quote only one thing that improves our daily and outcome space research.
It's just a fresh gouffer.
the bill style that functions the point in the air (to write to the plate, for example)
To pay his traders?
To participate in the manufacture of an unnecessary product?
Or how to make more money to investors?
Small, workers for workers don't want to mean anything and represent vacuity even.
Ah, if the last high-tech game.
Furthermore, there are several hundreds of thousands of people who work for that possible.
You know, people who boss what, who are more private businesses, in particular to shop the office at the station.
If you think you're going to buy a plastic gun...
But, and those who do not think to buy plastic weapons now but who have the potential to buy it to the future?
Maybe it's the most dangerous of all.
Not because the sword in plastic was a decoration in a private residence.
A plastic gun in a bank is used to try to mere people to believe that it is a real gun used to commit a crime.
Plastic swords may be kitchen decorations, but nothing else.
A very malhonned article would have made him bad to the author/editor to put a photo of the "sword" in question instead of generic photos of 'plastic swords'?
Or may it be quite curious to ask what you wanted to mean the inscription (when the case) above?
Small typical reporting, it is attracted to the fact that "that's just a sword in plastic" and not on the inspiring jihadi text that is written above.
The sword, a Zulfiqar or Dhu al-Fiqar, is one of the major symbols of Islam shiite.
The Dirani family, on the contrary, is a shiite musulman born in Afghanistan, the terrorist groups that are trying to break the governments in Syria and Iraq are almost exclusively of Sunnites.
If only people stopped rigouring the fact that plastic cottons are unforeseen.
They can be dead in their hands.
Even the small covered that we are given in fast rests can perceive the flesh.
Thank you for this information, so if it's a common decorative object, it justifys the ridicule that the author gives him.
It's not the pain to try to make it a 'ha, ha, a sword in plastic' the facts you have expressed them actually supported his argument.
I saw at the occasion these decorative objects in muslim houses, or paintings on the walls, they never had the threatening appearance, just a other version of a 'Cruz'.
Two Jesus, you're right.
And that's all his sense now...
I saw that guy who looked like being from the Middle East to Kebab Stop and distributed plastic cups every night!
I love the conclusion.
All wonderful new, often technological, are thinking of many people that it is a right and need to benefit it, but they have an immediate and worse cost, a state (subscription, electrical consumption) cost in budgets.
And it is impossible to benefit new technologies from frustration.
For example, call to the Energy Solidarity Pacte, which allows to isolate the house compounds for 1€ symbolic, when it is located in a modest household (work costs are supported by the providers of energy!).
Simply effective but unknown even if more than 3000 houses have been isolated this year!
Interesting this PES.
But I never heard it.
Who can call it and how does that work?
for 60 million consumers, water-economic dust tests and predicts the use of water economy materials on swimming pools and WC.
The study shows that a family of 4 persons can reduce from 30% of its water factory (from 150 m3 to 100 m3) is 50 m3 of water economy each year, while watching the same comfort.
This is not a crisis of the request, it is a system crisis that is not possible to produce enough exceeding (which would then be redistributed as an increase in income in real terms) in order to pay the increase in the expenditure you are classified in the “contracted expenditure” category.
Otherwise, the energy precaution is "just" to the medaille reverse that the economy is no longer growing soon as she wants.
Note that the theory (neo-classical) of the economy is totally unable to respond to such a question, since there is no intrinsic limit to economic growth, and there is no possibility to achieve, more than a decade after decades, the rythm of economic growth.
By its own definition (in physical), energy is what allows to achieve any physical transformation.
Because production is fundamentally transforming, energy is that allows to achieve less economic production (being or service).
And more we want to produce, more energy needs.
This means that any contrary to the increase in energy obtaining (improperly called "producing" of energy), even in the form of an increase in its price, involves production to increase (except to improve energy efficiency, but energetic efficiency is always required by large investments, which are not rewardable if energy is not enough).
In short, there is a very strong link between energy precaution and the fact that it is arrived, or not, to increase the "production" of energy that is not sweet.
And the very officially published data, for example by the International Energy Agency, shows that the situation is only possible in the years and decades that come (IAEA, in these last reports, clearly shows that the conventional oil production pic has been reached in 2008, including oil not cheap.
But oil is the most universal energy form, because of its very strong density of energy, its transport and manipulation and storage facility, its variety of possible uses, etc.)
Three points, good job whatever the performance is.
It was a good performance in Germany and there was nothing back to the things.
Take that France!
Don't vote on 18.
You're a Watch Tower Webmaster?
So it was noticed before: It's good to win.
It's good to win.
In fact, it's good to work the guys.
Although many Englishs love to move Scocias when they are just losing, there is no saying, they bring a little color to the tournaments when they come to qualify at least until they can remove the first tour.
It's still more strict if we play against them ;)
English begins to worry about me.
Because, now that the "dore shidge generation" is removed, they may have a decent team with all these young people.
Ferdinand, D.
Batty, Joe Cole and David Seamen come back to the starting XI, why to change a team that wins?
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, had been really "international class", is David Beckham, a little afflicted, maybe, but I think that if he had a superpower patch like me, he would scratch me completely.
People forget their athlic constitution, otherwise, speaking of an athlical constitution in the sport, Wayne Rooney...?
I never shock Scozias.
I've tended to surprise in observing their warm colors with nostalgia at the end of the evening...
The only English footballer that, in my humble opinion, was really "international class", is David Beckham
Yes, people seem to often forget that he was, at his best hours, a very good player.
It is that Juppe would have been bad to ask $100000 for a conference in South Korea.
And not that he would get them if he asked them...
Do you mean people come to get a good shooting?
For the rest, I would be surprised to learn that B Debre, for example, only sees on his deputy compensations...
I especially ask the question of knowing what it can be told in its conferences.
How to reduce his deficit?
How to return to full job?
I would say no serious conference of a scientific discipline, or any of its scientific levels, even if it is a Nobel price, I will not think to ask a less sum.
Content conferences are most of the free or almost free time.
And I can assure you that these young people work really and that the results presented in their -graduate conferences - are real.
At the time of the research budget restrictions, the reporting of these two figures is constructive.
The researchers conferences are even payable by the lab!!!
It's to say...
Everything's lighting for me.
They look at the sun.
N Sarkozy is a deputy representative of the UNP ethics.
I'm like the impression that we're reproving him to win money?
I'm far from being one of his fans but, that we recall him to have bad (or fraudulently) to manage his campaign OK.
But making conferences seem to be a very legal activity.
To add to Nina's comment, we recall that his movements are supported by the contributors.
Rule No 1 of Epidemiology: isolate.
All American and British flights from Africa would have been suspended last weeks.
Human life is more important than the right policy.
It is present in Spain, GB, Texas and other potential places.
What density of the population infection is that politicians will decide to take the right decision?
So if I want to go from Africa to the United Kingdom, I take the aircraft for Spain, and then I return a Spanish aircraft to the United Kingdom.
If the Ebola comes in the Western Africa, I see all the flights and ships in the direction of the United Kingdom.
We would always need to send goods that say...
What damage is that the panic of international media on Ebola is not more used to talk to less spectacular but more mortal crisis that affect the people of West Africa.
We are all threatened.
In every part of the world, men, women, it is a very tragic newspaper, a very weak title.
I could read each paragraph and replace the word Humans in other contexts (together relevant): Women are the first gifts of care - read - men travel from a community to another, etc.
More intelligent comments would have been made on the ways, reasons and places where we all can contribute to better understanding and interpretation of cultural and social approaches, and the differences in the role of gender that could help Ebola in West Africa.
Come on, let's think about it, and write, don't be pleased to make a sound.
There's a moment for everything.
If you are not able to offer a good analysis and an intelligent opinion, maybe you should just think before writing?
Although I will put the women's genetic mutation on the same rang as the decapitation - a form of terrorism so barbar, his survival rate only makes a different form of torture - say that its temporary suspension is a "light of hope" exceeds the understanding.
In fact, I see that the contributor is Sierra Leone, which can give a certain degree of “validity” to his opinion, but in that case it is obviously not a better perspective than that of a medium activist in the street.
And I believed that the Guardian was being “moving” as a worldwide resource of journalism - which was advanced in the 21th century, delaying its fundamental precedings.
Who, in the editoral team, let me look like that?
For a territorial election or other money does not contain.
I read without delay that the territorial public function increases its effectiveness, and I have never seen the article that gives them the word or try to explain why.
That would be legal, effective.
There will be uncertainly lies and truths, to separate the good grain of evil.
The Court of Accounts is cherish to tell both economic aniversarys.
It's true that they never had anything to handle the people in the Cambon Street.
CTs are not in deficit, they have financing needs that can only relate to and only to investments they do.
The force to use too frozen concepts the press as the World makes the game of all darknessisms.
Debt is beneficial because it finances investment, collective patrimonia
Unfortunately, debt financing is particularly the operational costs...
And as the insurance of officials (for example, to make good rounds-points) is in a growing and incomprehensible load (obligative load until their death, since life work + retrait), these collectivitys are widespread in investments.
It is therefore necessary to remove the status of officer, predominantly at the decline of the funds.
In addition to the financially responsible for the mergers.
This is fabulous, the communities should be accompanied by a decline of common effects, and it is the inverse that has been produced, evidence that accompanying a scale is not effective without suppression of others.
How do you want to correctly manage large territories like cacahuet at the time of the TGV and the car?
The time of the horse where these territories were created is revolutionary, it may be time to react.
They wouldn't prefer to stay in prison, worse inclined, in the administrative toilet, to paralyse him!
Even striking trials, it is not too strong to explain the locking situation in which the Vème state conducted with its provincial men.
This really began with Petain.
Then he continued to go to the series "souffle cuts" which arrived strongly in this regard.
Why are they not going to live in a apartment of 250 million dollars in Monaco above a cinema to leave all this suffering behind them?
Europe is also built on a cemetery, which will be a long and difficult process.
When will these people learn to take care of themselves?
Don't even try the answers of the kind “It's the fault of the whites.”
"responses" not "reply"
I hope it's a sarcasme.
It was in my previous post, where it was not enough obvious.
That's what happens when we're disappointed to be the first.
If it is a sarcasm or not, there is a argument to pass.
It is now agreed that modern Sapian Homo has been evolving northeast Africa about 200 thousand years ago, and for a specially humid period of about 150 thousand years ago they have been able to travel to the north to the Middle East, and the rest (or at least eight thousand years ago) is part of the history.
The current Minister of Defence had said a few months ago that no military hospital would close.
So he lied.
It was uncertainly the only government that seemed to keep the road.
Now, we know that we can't trust him anymore.
Six o'clock!
in 2017: Transformation in a comfortable private hotel for future retreats of the Republic ?
Movement of the floor in Bercy?
Very good decision: Val-de-Grace was a symbol of the past, a doctor for nanites and their families, the care of "Grand V" of a 3-speed doctor.
We're going to get money, and the military will take care of the grip of the last little other...
Do you know that 70% of patients are civilians, all of us?
Londra Watps?
I loved their fans based on Wycombe/Londres.
Like the London and the Welsh?
They left the London past season.
It's just the Wasps now.
A franchise of any other name...
At least they're going to Los Angeles, right?
This changes that a football team uses the field of a ruby club instead of the inverse.
Moreover, the movements outside for Tigers and Saints will be much more easy.
No, it doesn't change anything.
At Stockport County, we had the fault to be purchased by the Sale Sharks, and we finished loving our own stage with them once we found our independence.
I would say the same thing.
The way they emphasized to lead to the field, although they have access to other places, did not benefit us.
I love supporter Coventry City.
Good news doesn't stop.
There is always the possibility of a United Coventry now.
It must be frustrant for a team that has not bad supporters and which was up to the top for more than 30 years, seeing his stage repeated by a ruby club.
I have known the recent problems of CCFC but this must be a good glass.
For my part, I'm not the club ruby, and to be honest, I don't know anyone who does it by some fans of the Watps at work.
Yours and some thousands of other people in the south-East will certainly follow them away or do they now have to support another team?
Good pro home and good vulgarization.
But who's worried about it?
But why do TOUS IT systems are not based on these concepts?
+ because a large masses of pre-existent programs (cobol, java), + because all systems do not need them, + because there is no magic bag +++....
And as most of the computer systems, bugs have no real importance, what is taking into account is being the first on the segment.

But those don't sell it.
Real time has become a key sector in many areas, and few of them who know the immediate details of these processes.
It's 15 years old that I didn't go to an Olive Garden.
The quality-price report slowed.
I'm sorry for those who lose their job, but it's better to close the box.
I would recommend a simpler menu with choices known by popularity.
Reduce costs and prices.
There are already too many sales in our food regimes.
Don't ask Olive Garden not to put a salt in the future.
It seems to be reasonable with Faisons more profits, and not Faisons of healthy plates and the best quality-preciour report.
They take us for pigeons.
Oh, yeah, look at that people didn't have too much grissin.
And then let's do our suppe by someone else, it's better when it's industrial.
Assure that there are plenty of thin salt, that replaces the real ingredients.
We should also add a bit of sodium glutamatics.
The amount of salt you have to add to the water of the skins is delicate, but this significantly enhances the gust of the finished product.
It is not only the gust of the salt, it also affects the way the skins.
The final product is so better.
Without salt, there's no food.
Everyone should try alternatives to the company kitchen.
Is there family restaurants and are they offering sweet plates for reasonable prices?
What happens in the United States is very triste.
A banal accident of the work that turned badly.
A young promiser who learned the volunteer, followed his father's career in prison for murder.
A man slaughtered everything and brutally interrupted this born vote.
That it is sentenced for 10 years of prison seems to be the minimum.
Where are you going?
It's totally agreed!
That humor!
It's obvious and difficult to apologize and blaming as well as...
Effectively, it is difficult to apologize.
That's what I have a certain sympathy for a 15-year-old boy.
During the prosecution, the father of the child complained of never seeing her son but without requesting for forgiveness to the neighbors of the guy he himself killed.
Who's really victim in this story?
What are you coming to mechanize!!!?
The child's father was sentenced for what he did.
With regard to the lost ball connery, the accused and accused, he knew that the balls are dangerous.
The boy hasn't done anything to the accused!
So he pays for the crime he is responsible!
10 years old, it's a little bit in my opinion.
To have the intelligence to shoot this young man to smile?
Effectively, it was a sound!
If the opportunity is present, go in vacation in the Mouse Valley and sleep in the B & B of one of the small viticulers.
It is two times that I do it, wine, landscape and food are excellent.
Furthermore, if you are there for one of the many wine festivals that hold in each community, it's still better.
I'm sorry, Moselle's valle, I've kicked too fast.
It is glad to see that German wine is recognised.
Instead of importance, German vigners traditionally use only one variety of rains, which means that they really need to bow hard to keep a certain quality.
Of course, some young generations are experienced with different roots, such as France, Italy, etc.
There is not only the Moselle region that must be recommended - France, the Palatinat rheenan (Pfalz), Baden pledge to be visited.
A French region of interest is Alessace, which is as a melange between Germany and France.
The wines are the German style (or maybe it's the inverse, bref).
The Germans prefer birds.
Traditionally, they drink the wine after feeding.
Knowing the popularity of seed whites during the feed, they now propose much, and with a very higher alcohol content than their 9 degrees prefered.
But their traditional wines in bottle in the property are so complex, the breather is overall balanced.
Try the Schloss Vollrad spatlese with a homard thermal next time you go to the rest.
Find Hallgarten online to have a good selection.
I used them when I had my restaurant.
The World Atlas of Wine de Hugh Johnston is a good guide, overwhelmed.
I understand that there are new Guardian readers who discover wine, but this is a record of each newspaper on the German wine since the nights.
On the other hand, there is a article on the German vineyards that are in arrival, the new Baden sects that are going to be accompanied with the plates, the red that are amazingly cruel, but especially these aren't the disgusting Liebfraumilch that people drink when they were young (hey, I really don't think that it is still true or evocator, except if I address me to the more than 40 years of age - which, as I say, will already see all this).
Close the Val de Grace would be a huge error and a illustration of the lamentable state in which France's administration is.
A crime against Louis XIV and an epine in the foot of my grandfather and my grandfather who studied it.
In democracy, public health management should be submitted to the vote of the Chamber of Deputy: these ministerial calls that are holding by the barbichet, and these decisions made to be closed, have become insufficient.
Sorbogroin is right.
It should be done as in the Green Soleil: Eutanasie for 70 years.
Moreover, we could return the flesh that will eat our poor (sic) poor active actives because they can't go to the market.
Indeed, find the job to our unemployers, the real job, and you have no more deficit problems!
For older people, it is time to pay a little more because national solidarity is not able to provide...
Assets, in the way of disappearance, will not be able to keep this demographic transition alone...
So from the geriatrie, of course, but to think otherwise than a hospitality model of the 30 glory.
Now, the maximum growth of 1,5% (which is the case for 30 years) for the next 50 years will take us back to the whole model defined after war!
Val de Grace is the symbol of the exception in medical matters in France: a certain rigorous and disciplinary that was known more in the public hospital.
If this symbol falls, we're really wrong.
First, we were wrong because the rest of the hospitals isn't at the height.
The scandal is that the presidents and other elites are able to cure more than in the public hospital.
The solution is to increase public service offer in other hospitals than to keep a doctor at two speeds.
The Val is a French physician pool, and of course it is a symbol.
The closure would be a mistake, a sign of walking more to France's medium-critical.
Without the military status, which must be preserved absolutely.
"The Hospitalization Day Price", a hospital management unit, is decided by the Ministry with local supervision of the Regional Agencys of Hospitalization.
Abomination of our nation continues.
Finally, I mean, obviously, the baby is only one of these economic refugees, he came to Australia to have better paid work than the one he had in his home.
In almost all the world countries, a child born in this country of two non-citizen parents is almost always non-citizen.
Australia is closer than most of the countries by making children born from Australian citizens.
But it is Australia that is criticized because it does not respond to some very high standards, with evident difficult consequences.
Why?
This seems to me to do two weights.
Send Abbott to the Middle East, Pakistan, Sri Lanka to finish all persecutions and violence and wars that flee to the people of their country and forced them to seek their help in Australia.
If he doesn't want people to come through the ship, then the problem that generates this traffic must be resolved.
I don't have to complain anything about life at Sri Lanka today.
Civil war has been 26 years old, tens of thousands of people died from both sides.
That's what happens during civil wars.
However, war ended six years ago, and the country returns to normal.
Everything takes his sense now, nimrod...!
Strange that the British Prime Minister David Cameron did not believe in this small superchief when he was in Sri Lanka with Mr. Abbott...
Cameron condemned war crimes and the maltraction that had yet occurred.
Several European countries have already been suspended from the deportation of Tamouls with ITT-related links, thinking that they would run a risk of torture to their return.
UNHCR reviewed its assistance application assessment guidelines in December 2012, and recommended that those with LTTE links be considered at risk of their return.
The year [2013] saw a number of attacks by buddhist warrants groups against Hindu and Muslims.
The elections for three provincial advice were held in September.
It's too late, boys!
Mr. Nowak, the coco is gone with so many periodics.
In fact, this guy couldn't even get a chance to make it.
He didn't have a health insurance in the States?
So he wouldn't have been given any treatment.
I would like to know who's going to pay for medical expenses during his stay in the hospital.
The city of Dallas may be paid to some lab for the purchase of the body?
In the United States, the rule is paying first, help comes later.
Specially in Texas
Ohhhhhh!!!
There was a few years ago, it was explained that the ebola killed so fast that a large epidemia was impossible (we have all a scientific literature on the question, with models and everything).
Then it was said that the risk of contagion of returned persons was null.
We're smelling more, I'm afraid.
You must read newspapers to believe that a risk may be null.
It can be three weak but not zero.
Finally, it is a scientific realistic, more a virus is rapidly dead (generally) less chance of repaying because the death of the host signs his own death.
The combination of 2 (two transmission and fast death) is sometimes coming from the Spanish influenza.
Open c is the general quarter to save humanity..
There is nothing to obscene to put up a certain brave and true western media, but at the detriment of thousands of other African sicks who do not know the work, nor the brave or the vertus?
Of course, this makes the action of NGOs light and encourages them to help, but the repeating of advertising is a terrible part of it.
The freedom of expression, so loved by the conservators.
The suspension was to keep the doctors under control.
I ask how many doctors have voted for Newman and Abbott, weapons brothers attacking the freedom of expression and the right to the private life of Australia.
I think they had never imagined that their conservators would have taken them out of their rights to the freedom of expression.
I wonder how many doctors have voted for Newman and Abbott,
I think there's one who doesn't do it next time.
Yes, this is exactly what we need at this time, less health professionals are available during potential health crisis.
A heat tour for when the problem really becomes out of control.
There are no longer enough doctors who work around Australia in this way.
The refusal of Tony Abbott to take part in the “guere” against Ebola illustrates his philosophy about medical challenges.
The plan of Joe Hockey for a new Mediterranean Market Fund for Medical Research, which should reach $20 billion from 2020, would probably be only a dark shock for the budget.
Using the pretext of the novel medical research, it will raise $20 billion and transfer these funds as a general income.
I hope that Australian voters will come to see this excellent Russian for what it is.
Tony Abbott is much more intelligent than we don't want to believe.
It explains that the sale of Medibank Private is compensated by the Medical Research Market Fund.
However, it is a loss for sick people, a loss for older people and a loss for low income.
Maybe it's very intelligent, but it's not just.
Finally, the "menger ringer" and his Telstra's market fund were excellent teachers.
If it's not just, then let's show Abbott who is intelligent.
Send it in hell to the next election.
The worst for Nadine is even the “ancient personality, sacred....
I also noted it, sufficiently corrosive as a comment.
If it was only possible to dissuade her to appear a buzz on it constantly..
The worst destiny for a (e) political final career: it is not recognised in the street.
Welcome She has not been recognized in its city of Toul as enough to administer it.
What's the right sense of "provincial" is good!
We live a hatred time, Madam Morano.
I'm certainly against the port of the Burqa, but there's no question.
What this anecdote tells is the purity sarkozism of the state: small medium-sized ministers, a confusion between the government function and the execution function (if Sarkozy could come with his tonfa on each road in order to demonstrate that it is well guarded by the public order), the pregnancy and extraordinaryness of their maximum degree.
I propose that the right to Morano, Sarkozy and all these “ancient personalities” become disappointed to bring fire and instructions, they would thus be able to exercise their self-declared function of judges.
But who's Nadine Romano?
This is in fact the main teaching of the case: even the police have turned the page of Sarkozy, maybe they don't regret it.
It's really necessary to stop before it becomes a genius for him.
I send this agent who ignored Nadine Morano's existence, if I could only do the same...
like bob, for the shooting
Not agree, thanks to her we're strictly ...!
Nadine, if she didn't exist, it should be invented!
It's however easy, she looks like Christine Boutin with a blonde pearl.
On that occasion, N.
Morano was clearly done in the fault, in the lack of the police officer that she had faced with her, and who would certainly have had to multiplie the corbeths and "Yes, of course, Madam, then Madam, tell me in what direction I have to run to enter me without waiting for this hot woman."
"In one of the cases, the Australian Super Hornets left an air attack on a target of Iss when the risk of killing civilians became too important."
Americans aren't bad about this, but I think even when Isis will go over or have already done it, at least somebody counted the body now.
For civilian deaths in the industrial scale, nothing revalises with the Western war machine.
I am not agreed, the sanctions imposed by the United Nations (including non-Western) between the two Iraqi wars would cost millions of Iraqi people, especially children, older people and vulnerable adults.
Most of the anti-governors I knew prefer the sanctions in the defence of the “guerry machine”.
Did you also be the man who prefer the sanctions to order and men on the ground?
Very good comment - the United Nations has acted incredibly hard and inconsidered in the past few years.
The sanctions are generally inefficient and are not able to touch the election - uncertainly a reason for which they have the occasional approval of the Security Council.
You may remember that the insured people have not lost time to mark their main enemy when they saw it in the recent war in Iraq.
It was the United Nations Mission QG attack that they had established at least five days early in Bagdad in 2003.
They shocked this place with strength and two times and I imagine with satisfaction and cold blood.
So brutal and hard this bomb is, I was surprised by the shock of people to know that a United Nations mission has been targeted in this way.
Good notice, I really forgot that.
So add a half million people to the total number of deaths of Western nations (also with recent problems in Ukraine the economic activity was directed to people who intended to hurt).
This does not help your argument only to explode not-reliable statistics.
The only counts even vaguely reliable on the deaths related to sanctions are the children of less than five years and they are even very suspected because Saddam Hussain refused to leave inspectors targets to observe the facts.
It was obviously in his interest that the negative effects of sanctions were exacerbated.
The most reliable believes that the number of additional deaths for this age group is between 2000,000 and 400 000, but no one really knows it.
As regards additional deaths in other age groups, estimates are not better than hypotheses.
Since the number of pre-sanction deaths in less than five years was about 10 times worse than in the United Kingdom, for example, it is possible that the number of post-sanction dead is widely partial to this age group.
Of course, we need to fear it, but also the gift of games in general.
It must be stopped to do as if people were clean minds, that love was all that the children needed, and that we could do with unknown people that nor the parents or the child may never know, without their consequences.
One of our mythes founding is Oedipe, 60% of the French people are from the genealogy.
It's an essential and unprecedented thing to know his origin.
Instead of doing as obvious and useful fanatists arguments, we should explain what serious problems may occur for a child adopted or designed with a gamed donation.
If you realize that the parents you hadn't provided the legs you've done, you could give it, my opinion, because they wouldn't have done any crime.
The latest advanced PMA (e.g. volus grains) are at least debatable as a reasonable GPA.
The true question seems to me: the frustration of the desire of children is justified by these acrobatics and that has nothing to see with marriage for all.
It's just as a point.
Of course, GPA should be afraid, which is what this stupid matter is.
Of course, it's regret that we can't have a child when we want it.
That's a problem I've known with my wife.
However, it is less serious than birthing very disabilized or becomes, contracting a serious disease, losing all its children in an accident, etc.
It's not the worst among all the concerns of life.
It's a frustration among many others.
This doesn't prevent lives.
And we can always care for other children!
In a society that does not support any form of frustration, where children become well consumption, the GPA is unacceptable for me.
Child's desire is not a caprice where we can use the other according to his good desire.
Staliness requires reflection and acceptance.
