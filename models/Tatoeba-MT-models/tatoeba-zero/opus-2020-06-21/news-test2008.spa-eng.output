European inflation has been disrupted in foods
The accelerated inflation, registered in the euro area, should first be the real growth of food prices.
The increase of the prices in November has been higher than expected in the 13 countries of the euro area, registering – after 2.6 per cent of October – an annual inflation of 3,1 per cent - announced the Union Statistics Office in Luxembourg.
Official predictions were only as likely 3 percent - announced the Bloomberg.
The European Central Bank (BCE), unlike the North American, British and Canadian banks, did not cut the basic interest, I pretext that the reduction, together with the increased prices in primary materials and the reduction of the forced park, would cause inflation espiral.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least about two percent.
According to an analyst, the ECB is on the trap 22: "I have to be negotiated" on inflation so that there is no need to be involved in this issue.
Inflation of 3.3 per cent, registered in Germany, slaughtered the record of 12 years, while in Spain increased from 3.6 to 4.1 per cent.
Infringement was disappeared in the euro area as a result of food and energy prices.
The quotes in terms of the skin increased in a 88 per cent and also the sugar quotation has reached its maximum level since 1973.
Similarly, there was much more paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and milk products.
The price of crude oil on the world market increased this year in a 52 percent, reaching the black gold almost $100 by the barrill last month.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will decrease from 2.1 per cent to 2.5 per cent, instead of 2009, there will be a decrease of 1.9 per cent.
According to analysts, annual inflation will be maintained in the next 3 or 4 months around 3 per cent, however, the average annual rate of 2.1 per cent is 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to reduce the type of interest in 2008 two times.
Gallup prescribes a government crisis
After a long stage, the support of the Joven Democrats Alliance was significantly increased, reaching its maximum level since 2002, while Gallup has never experienced a very low level - a 13 percent - in the case of socialists.
The difference in the case of the safe electors of the parties - due to the strongest strength of opposition elections - would mean support of more than two thirds (71 per cent) against support of a fifth part for socialists (20 per cent).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not reach any limit to have a parliamentary scale: their support within the entire population is of two percent.
Among the safe electors, there is one percent more sympathy in both baths.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even in comparison with the lowest point - it has never been so high, 41 per cent of those who have seen particularly badly the country's economic situation, while another 46 per cent believes that the situation is very bad.
The families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pesimists as to change their own economic situation.
As regards the next year, most people have the deterioration of the situation and only a tenth of them are expected to improve.
In December, 71 per cent of the consultants, above any previous survey in Gallup, estimated that the President of the Government was more ill than their functions.
13 per cent of the consultants trusted or very trusted in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Victor Orban has supported 38 per cent of the consultants.
54 percent of the population did not believe absolutely in the Head of Government and 27 percent do not trust in the President of the Democratic Alliance of Youth.
One of the indicators for the configuration of the political situation is that, what proportion of the society thinks that it is possible to control the experiencing discount against the person of the Head of Government without a changing government.
While after the disturbances of October last year, 35 percent estimated that it would be desirable to maintain in the power of the Government and the Head of Government, this proportion is now only 20 percent, while the relative majority (33 per cent) believes that the only solution is the celebration of new elections.
The interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 per cent of the surveys on the question on the participation answered that it would be safely involved and another 20 per cent said that it is likely to be involved.
Comparedly, in "all elections to be held this Sunday" only one 55% of the population, and 15% of the population probably believes their participation. Based on the current intentions of the electors are not doubtful of the result of the popular consultation.
An 74 per cent of the population would disappoint the payment of research rights, 79 per cent of the medical consultation services and 84 per cent of the hospital attention.
If we observe these proportions only between safe participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of the electors would reject the introduction of study rights, payment for medical consultations and hospital attention.
The most precious is the Samaan, the Tesco has quintuplicated its prices
The average increase in the price level of a 16 percent the hypermarkets of Budaers' gold triangle were maintained, with the difference that this year has not been increased by the VAT.
Article of Gazdaság
This year also increased in a average of 16 percent in the Budaers' gold-commerce triangle the normal boat canadian of the Napi newspaper, but in all hypermarkets there was a much higher growth than thousands of HUF.
As in December of the last year the prices in the supermarkets were already "dispared" were, there was no drastic decline in comparison with the high start point.
However, it is obviously agricultor for consumers that what the last year had been able to buy a price very below the nine thousand HUF today, nor for ten thousands.
The Napi canstate in the hypermarkets exceededed at least 91 HUF the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF.
And the highest value canasta was 10,573 HUF.
(in 2003, the canasta costed 6800 HUF.)
The price of the Unicum licor and fishery was almost at the level of the past year, but a strong increase in the swimming powder, nine and snake seed was recorded.
The price of the thick and pane tank followed the data of the Central Statistics Office, although we also found a kilo of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
Competition did not reduce the product price at least 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this shop that the Coca-Cola price of two litres was less than 200 HUF, so that this product, even with the price of the bottle, costed only 257 HUF.
However, in Napi's skin was also the most sweet face, as the cheapest Cora.
According to our calculations, as regards Christmas prices last year, Cora increased with a 15th, while Tesco and also with about 18 percent the prices contained in Napi's canast.
Comparing the values of the slightest canasta in the past year with the cheapest canast of this year, the difference has been 12 percent, while the growth between the cheapest and the facest of this year has been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year, the average price growth was 1206 HUF, so during Christmas last year in prices was the increase in VAT.
Only this process was the detriment of the trade, the supermarkets were visiblely unable to decide on the price margin to be applied for each product and to calculate the effect of consumption price change.
(If the commerciant plans badly the speed of circulation of a product, it may lose a significant benefit in the margin that is adapted to the volume of sales.)
The increase in the price of Napi canasta has reached such extremes as a result of the increase in the VAT, which was the most higher than 1720 HUF at the value registered in 2006, while the difference was just 844 HUF.
This year has not been such extreme, since the highest price of now has been 1630 HUF more than the last year and the cheapest has also increased with 1284 HUF.
Comparing two schedules, a catastrophic growth in prices in less than 20 months was registered, in hypermarkets increased over 30 per cent of the price of the first-needed consumption items.
(But that does not necessarily confirm the numbers of the Central Statistics Office: this office, in the case of some foods of first need, has registered a price increase of more than 30 percent within 12 months.
For example, in addition to the egg, in the case of the egg.)
According to Napi's canast, in this last case this seems almost impossible, since in the price of this product that has been quite precious in the past year compared to the base, in the worst cases only 10 percent of price increase was registered.
According to all indexes, the thin providers have a stronger position than eggs, putting the dramatic increase of prices even to multinationals.
Hyper-markets do not remain in the gold-commerce triangle, regularly speaking of positive results.
According to our experiences collected, most consumers of the three seats are no longer interested in prices.
All products purchase large quantities, bringing food conservated by palettes.
On Thursday morning, in the three shops there were large balls before the boxes because he suddenly increased the number of customers.
However, we have information that the sales volumes are less, and many multinationals are required to investigate because income remains below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in the electronics.
In many hospitals, desinfects
This year in hospitals have been registered several thousands of infections produced first by the indebible application of antibiotics.
The situations of rhetoric hygiene in hospitals, bed harassment and staff overload do not promote infection control - states the head of the Department of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many hospitals, even desinfects are injured.
Not much ago has been diagnosed a contact with MRSA in the Yaspital Hospital Trauma Department.
In an hospitalized man after a serious accident, the presence of the antibiotic resistant bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of contagio occurred in this same hospital at the beginning of the year.
The same patient had to return to the hospital because of the contact with MRSA, and since then there was no significant surgical intervention for the presence of the bacteria in his body.
Up to 10 December of this year have been registered in the National System Nosocomialis Surveillance 1094 cases of hospital infection produced by multiresident agents - said Karolina Böröcz, Head of the Department of the National Epidemiology Center.
This means that all hospitals with security have been recorded this amount of infections produced by multiresident agents, the remainder has no information.
About the two third parts of the infections (683 cases) should be MRSA, i.e. Staphylococcus areus, resistant to mecilin-oxacilin.
A third of human beings lead to the bacteria of Staphylococcus areus (SA) without causeing any disease.
Infections produced by SA (e.g., gargant inflamation, amigdalitis, cutaneous infections, wound infections) react well to antibiotics and are easy treatment.
However, as exagerate or inadequately to antibiotics, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics are transformed in very resistant bacteria to antibiotics and quickly contain in inadequate hospital conditions.
There may be serious hospital infections, such as wounds or septicemia infections in first place to patients with transitional or chronic immunity, patients with deficit body, elderly or less weight.
In view of the hospital director Yanos, there is nothing special in MRSA infection, these infections are cotidian in hospitals.
It should not be confunded with epidemic infection, the MRSA is only outstanding - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not considered.
Force to antibiotics
"These patients are isolated, the nursing staff acts with them in gorge and mask rings and are suitable antibiotics for their treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Hospitalized patients are previously examined to verify the presence of MRSA in their body, but it is not even possible to avoid infection in all cases.
You're not in mode to take samples
It would be possible to prevent the hospital infections of MRSA in most cases, however, the current national hospital circumstances do not promote training and contact with multiresident pathogen agents - says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection is primarily produced in older hospitals and homes, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate MRSA illnesses.
However, in Hungary hospitals it is not moderate to take microbiological samples.
This should also be said that the National Health Case does not finance these medical reviews.
So most of the cases come to public light when the patients’ infections of the MRSA are already produced - said the Hepherd Medical Department of the Epidemiology Center.
The European Union strictly encourages the implementation of antibiotics in human medicine, and there are also national directives to treat patholic infections and tables.
Therapy with antibiotics should be directed, or microbiological reviews should be made to prevent the resistance against medicines, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
The use of microbiological samples is still less frequent in the case of ambulant or basic assistance patients - said Karolina Böröcz.
The desinfects are shocked
Scientific experiences have demonstrated that, in most cases, MRSA is a patient to another through health personnel.
Thus, they play a very important role in the lavage of the hands, the use of legs and mask mass, but in this regard also experience significant losses in hospitals.
The MRSA is counted through boards and the direct contact between people, however, in national hospital circumstances is not always possible to isolate the counted patient.
Furthermore, hospital rooms are often broken, beds are often very together, although to prevent epidemic, patients should be separated at least by a distance of 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately, there are few nurses and many patients who are more likely to be infected in the hospitals of less favourable economic situations.
In view of Carolina Böröcz, where appropriate prevention measures are complemented, less infections of this type are recorded or the contagio of the pathogen agent can be stopped.
Governing Programme against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA is a huge expenditure for the National Infirming Fund, so that in all countries it is fighting against it.
In England, for example, there is a government programme to prevent and reduce MRSA cases.
According to the data provided, MRSA infections show a decrease trend in England.
The European Heart Prevention and Control Center (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multiresident agents (including MRSA) and the hospital infections to these pathogenic agents.
Unit the control of the police commander's alcoholism that caused a dead accident
The periodic official report on the case of the death accident caused by the police commander of the district XXII.
It could be excluded from the possibility that the police's department has been conducted or in a state struggle since then, the police commander of the 21I district, who was atrocelled and caused the death of a transhuman – reported Vienna Attila Morvai, portable of the Capital General Office, after preparing the periodic report on the case.
The experimental report confirmed the outcome of the primary alcohol control that had already found that the former comandant of the police had not consumpted alcoholic drinks before it was taken behind the flight.
The Chief of the Police Office of the District XXII, the March with his special vehicle, doubled the Kossuth Lajos Street of the district XXII, a 55-year-old man who intended to cross the street, but not in the named area for peatones.
(The last fact, i.e., that the peaton did not use the cebble to cross the street, in accordance with the rules of the Transit Code, it is not attentive circumstances, the driver must always cease the step by double.)
The transhuman lost his life after he was hospitalized.
The police leader of the district was dismissed and requested his jubilation, according to the police communication, because he had made the case a lot.
The investigation of the case is responsible for the Budapest Investigation Inspector.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander had worked with the investigation officers.
EUR 400 million more for infrastructures
The Hungarian Minister of Finance Yanos Veres and the Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (BEI) Marta Gajecka signed Tuesday in Budapest three cross-border credit agreements by a total of 400 million euros to finance educational, transport and environmental infrastructures as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (BEI) adopted in 2006 a budget of EUR 300 million to finance the Hungary Environmental Transport and Protection Projects, which will be undertaken by the subsidiary of cohesion funds, which previously had signed a credit contract for a value of 100 million, the contract which finally signed is the use of the remaining 200 million euros.
The EUR 150 million credit contract is also intended to finance the budget of educational projects.
The EIB adopted a total of EUR 300 million for this objective in Hungary, the decision later will be taken when extending the credit contract will be extended.
The parties signed a contract of 50 million euros for innovation, which will mainly be used for the project of innovation and research from the University of Debrecen.
During the conversations, the theme of the construction of the fourth metro line was also covered.
It was agreed that for the time that Hungary ends with the EU the details of the financing of the Metro will return to the subject that if necessary or not change the original contract and how to do it.
According to Yanos Veres, this may happen early in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed 113 projects in Hungary by €8.4 million.
The interest of credits is in line with EURIBOR and the EIB provides a grace period of eight years without engaged in maintaining debt credit.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market - the attention of all Europe is directed to that recent Balkan country.
What, where and those who purchase in the EU's market will soon be carried out?
Analysis of the Re/Max Bulgar Division.
The favorite goal for real estate purchases in Eastern Europe is certainly some Bulgaria, with its cheap apartments of the ski pets and the chalet of the beaches.
The mountain regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most favorable regions, while in the Albena Beachs the "Costa Dorada", the "Costa del Sol", the ancient Sozopol and Nesebar, but more people are still looking for immobile people around Kavarna and Balchik.
According to the analysts of Re/Max in Bulgaria, later or early the country's central area - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will have the interest of real estate promotioners and more people will buy immobile in Russia's particularly cheap area.
The Sofia capital may also be attractive, commercial spaces and offices promise a rapid recovery of investment.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most paradise attractives of golf in Europe, and it could also be a destiny destination during the other two stations, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, precauted investors are already purchasing their purchases, for example in the area of Bansko.
In view of the analysts, those who purchase immune in Bulgaria, are also efforts to change their lives and their way of life.
Most customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and more than Romania.
The Maltese, Cypriot Promotors are also present and traditionally many Russian customers in the Black Sea Beachs and Ski Paradise.
Foreign customers can be classified in three groups - says Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to be installed here buy new or renewed prices between 50 and 100 000 euros or old houses in bad state between 5 to 15 000 euros, to renew them later.
It requires good communication and access, and for them it is important for the nearness of a great city, the shops and generally a local doctor.
The second category consists of chalet purchasers (Bulgaria in December was included among the first 10 vacational destinations of the Germans).
The third group consists of the real estate investors that make their purchase with the hope of benefiting in a medium or long term.
The price of capital immigrants will continue to grow, as the demand is increasing.
Although the European Union has the lower real estate prices, in the past five years, these suffered an annual increase of 21 percent.
The increase in the price of immobile prices is significantly exceeding the growth of wages.
Fodor and the six hundred Hungary
According to the Minister for Environment and Hydrology of Gábor Fodor, meetings at the level of experts will be concluded on Tuesday and Thursday after official inauguration will continue negotiations at the level of ministers on the international climate regime after 2012.
The experts and political experts from 192 countries of the world are discussing on the Bali Road Day, which provides afterward efforts to the period of reduction in emissions set out in the Kyoto Protocol, to 2012.
There are currently encouraging discussions on the particular between developing countries and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that at the time it does not want to negotiate specific figures, although it is intended to reach the agreement that in comparison with the 1990 situation, until 2020, the emission of gases responsible for the winter effect was 25 to 40 per cent.
Another important issue of the conference is that if industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, they are or not willing to provide material and technological assistance to countries that need it.
A further agreement on aid was made to provide developing countries.
The Support Fund, provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be directed by an integrated direction council of 16 members, probably within the United Nations Global Environment Fund (GEF) - writes the "Piac is Profit".
The six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister for Environment and Hydrology Gabor Fodor supports the efforts of the EU to maintain its role of safeguarding in the global climate protection and to promote the signature of the new international agreement until 2009.
The Minister declared that the EU was commitmented to reduce until 2020, in relation to the 1990 level in 20 percent its gas emissions, responsible for the winter effect, independently whether it would be signed or not, and is willing to be able to reduce 30 percent even if other large regions in the world and developing countries are also willing to assume commitments in accordance with their responsibility and capacity.
Gabor Fodor pointed out that the signatory countries of the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 were forced to decrease at 5,2 per cent, and in that period 15 EU Member States were forced to comply with a 8 per cent of reduction.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce by 6 per cent the emission of gases responsible for the winter effect for the period between 1985 and 87, which will comply with our country - notes the press communication of the Ministry of Environment.
It is much to play in Bali, since within two years the international climate policy agreement will have been signed, because, if not, it is sure that its entry into force would be placed after 2012. In this case, the reducing commitments taken in the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately be followed by a new international system for emission reduction, whose need was warned in its recent report by the IPCC, international scientific association of the United Nations that is employed with climate change, which obtained the Nobel Prize of Peace.
Thus, emission reduction would suffer a delay and could not be prevented by an increase in more than 2C of the average temperature of the earth, since scientists would have unconventionable and irreversible consequences.
The British army recluted in YouTube
The British army units in a video distributor publish records on actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First, the British Air Force (RAD) was the use of YouTube services: the special units moved in Afghanistan since March 2006 are loading videos on its actions against the Taliban – informed the BBC.
These records with mini cameras mounted on the castles are controlled in the general body of Kandahar's operations, then sent to London to be loaded to the Internet.
Political message is inevitable
The records from the aircraft soldiers that have been loaded in this way to the Internet and their "canal" have already been seen by over 750,000 people.
The British Defence Minister was registered in the spring of 2007 under the name of "Catry Defence" and publish videos of actions in Iraq and Afghanistan while the Ministry of the United Nations Community (Commonwealth Office) and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
The aircraft had originally loaded videos with recluding targets, but in view of the Defence Ministry, they also serve to submit to the public the real objective of the presence of the British army outside.
This kind of propaganda is almost nothing in comparison with conventional recluding television spots - declared to BBC the experts in defence Gordon Mackenzie - in turn, inevitablely have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the reason for being military action decided by the Government.
Americans prepared a video game
The army is also concerned about the fact that, in addition to the severely edited and censured records, the distributor also appears affected videos, for example on the death of soldiers: in the films of "official" propaganda, a little hypocritical, officials speak as the maximum losses, but without any presentation of the bloody part of the fight.
In addition, many video recorded in real operations have been loaded from the fight camps of Iraq and Afghanistan, but the British army is only recently using this opportunity.
Americans use a little different way for recluding video games, freely downloaded, called American's Army, where the player can be put directly in place for soldiers in a more or less real situation.
Tombola and shelter salted at the Birthday Festival of the Ministry
It doesn't seem very sensitive to the Minister of Work, Monika Lamperth: instead of the shipping party, you will celebrate a work meeting for your colleagues who can defeat the year 2007 with salade and coffee shopping.
There is a ministry that will celebrate your holiday with life music, in the other way, it will create the navigation atmosphere in the heart of public officials with tombola and a brindis.
Festival, Christmas environment, concierts and buffet - so you enjoy the power.
The State offices are also prepared for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas feast will be celebrated in the Ministry of Defence, but not for the ministerial workers.
At the Hurphan Christmas, the children of the fallen soldiers and for the Misionary Christmas are invited to the families of soldiers who are currently filled with outdoor missions and will also be offered a receipt for the press.
This cartilla will be 25 million for the festival environment of the end of the year.

The ANF ship costs 4 700 000 HUF and was celebrated Monday in the National Justice Council (CNAJ) with music and dinner concerts.
The room accommodation costs a million HUF, the rest of the budget was expenditure for the more than four hundred invited.
We have information that the workers of one of the ANF departments are also invited to another Christmas feast to celebrate a competition management company called the Hungary Centre for Economic Development of Community Funds.
For this purpose, the complete building of the Comedia Teatro was equipped.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, since we did not communicate with the competent person.
It can be attended without clothing
The CNAJ building not only accommodated the ANF party, but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which celebrated instead of Christmas the Lucia's Day on December 7th.
The CNAJ did not cover anything for the use of their installations.
Fifty people participated in the dance.
The party began with the health words of the Minister and after the dinner there was a baileable music in life.
In response to the question of [origo], they informed: To attend the bathroom, it was not obliged to clothe or clothes at night.
Health, work and local administration cards are prepared for modest celebrations.
The Public Health Ministry will organize a programme and a party for its workers in its own building with a budget of 400 000 HUF.
Instead, the Minister of Work Monika Lamperth does not wait for his colleagues for an official ship party, but for an annual workshop.
It is referred to the participation of hundred eighth invited who, as to inform the Department of Press, will take so much coffee and salary pastel, so that the party will not cost more than 3500,000 HUF.
The Minister for Local Governments, Gordon Bjanai in exchange, will simply send with his colleagues at the school of the Ministry of Local Governments and Territory Development.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will celebrate a boat in its own chamber of acts with the participation of 436 workers.
The Shipping Festival will be a 2500 HUF budget by invited - from this budget will be paid the receipt with buffet and a brindis.
Since Yanos Veres is the Minister, MF workers every year celebrate the same form as Christmas.
Instead, there will be no festival atmosphere, the official nature will be given not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the nighttime of its celebration.
The agriculture card will offer a New Year receipt on January 20, the Ministry will not celebrate Christmas.
The receipt will be held in the Vajdahunyad House of the Municipal Park and, according to the shopping, there will be a 1000 HUF budget for the hundred guests.
This - according to the Press Department - will be a very simple receipt of foot, which will only be invited to specialized diplomates, believed in Hungary.
These recessions that are held every year, start with a short health talk of the Minister and conclude with a modest food.
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Education and Cultural Affairs will not celebrate no Christmas Festival - this is what they informed the relevant press departments [oriented].
In the Press Department of Environment Card, there was no information on the budget of the Ministry's shipping celebrations.
What we know is that for the party that will be celebrated at the Museum of Applied Arts has been invited to more than four hundred people.
He's going to meet the forces of the giant skin.
The Sindicates of Liga and the National Committees Federation will form on Wednesday a chair commission to coordinate the moon's lunar which will take place for an undefinite time.
Saturday, a mix of protest will be celebrated, while the day-day Monday on the final vote on public health law will be started.
With all security this action will cause great difficulties in transport, since the train trail will be completely stopped and up to 13 hours will also be shocked by the workers of the Budapest Collection Transport Company.
On Thursday, the Liga Unions will inform about the details of their Monday ships that will celebrate together with the National Commission Federation.
The LIGA and the National Engineering Union will also be the committee to coordinate Monday's actions.
The Saturday will celebrate a mix of protest, while the Monday participating sindicates will be declared in undefinite time, if no agreement with the Government is reached.
This means that, on the day of the parliamentary vote on public health law, they have not informed the date of the end of the starting chair.
If the National Assembly deplores public health law, the syndicates will immediately retire their call to the guest.
Instead, if the law is adopted, the Commissions will be gathered and decide on the future.
On the basis of the agenda of the Monday of the National Assembly, it is also possible that only it is voted on the public health law in the very night-in-laws, or at the best distance of the midnight.
As a result of the moon starting, it will be necessary to face significant difficulties in the transport: in the railways it will stop working indefinitely, the morning may be a part of Budapest's collective transport and more than half of the inter-urban bus transport of Volan companies.
Similarly, in many points of the country, half of the roads will be closed.
Many civil organizations and organizations have been joined to the chair, and their names are constantly updated on the Liga website.
Some syndicates announced their strike for an undefinite time, others for an defined time.
Even on Thursday the State Ferrocarril and the Free Union of Ferroviary Workers (SLTF) couldn't reach an agreement or even on minimum services, but by approaching Christmas feasts, more people traveling on trains were more.
According to information received to this day, from the beginning of the day until 13 hours the workers of the Budapest Collection Transport Company will be in a shock, the Budapest Airports from 7 to 9 a.m. will celebrate a four-hour LIGA Sindicates of Electric Industry and Technical Energy, the Sindicators of the Educationers called to a helmet of 2 and the Democratic Union of Educationers from 2 to 8 hours.
Hungarian Medical Association will be declared in national hour in alternative hours and the Democratic Union of Workers of the Health and Social Sector (SDTSSS) which are part of the Sindical Cooperation Forum, will celebrate a warning chain of two hours.
The most important of the four requests made by the Liga is that the Government removes its proposal on public health reform and submits a new concept to a social debate.
The second demand is that they gradually introduce the new form of calculation of pensions that will enter into force the year coming.
The third is to ensure, even before 2010, the possibility of the occupation that it deserves in the system is possible for advanced pensions.
The fourth reason is that the Free Union of Ferroviary Workers (SLTF) which is part of the Liga Unions, they do not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on Railways and expect another proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: In the country, Hungarianguard risks are increased
According to the Office of Analising Analysis de Riesgos (Risk Analysing Division) of the Hungarian Political Guardian, which was established in August of this year with the support of the Movement by a Measuring Hungary, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region from several points.
The "risk advertising" of the company writes: in relation to the activities of the Hungarian Guardia, the greatest political risk is that "the aggregation of existing ethnical tensions between the Gymanian population and the non-Hungarian, even in short terms, can be produced by violent ethnical conflicts".
The main reason for this is that the Hungarian Guardian political strategy is probably the provocation of this event - accompanied the representative of the investigation institute.
They stated that all of this should be one of the main lacks of Hungarian political protagonists: "The protagonists of the public life gave him the public debate on the issue of Guinea to the representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who could have founded their political strategy on existing disregards between giant and Hungary."
This increases the problem, impossable to normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violence conflicts - they estimate.
In addition, according to the investigation institute, the activities of the National Watch Tower, due to the great attention of the national and international media, "deteriored significantly the image of Hungary in the outside, especially in terms of stability and democratic development of the country".
Remember that since August 2006, the reorganization of radical and extreme right groups has been increasingly advertising and emphasized in Hungary and that since summer 2007 have been established in the country of many organizations that are self-defence associations.
"The common race of these groups is that they are self-determined as civil organizations, while proclaiming openly the training of their members for the defence - including armed - (Canada Defense, National Defense, Defence of the Public Order), with the incompliance of the police, the army, namely the State" - aggregate.
They stated: All this is produced in accordance with the method that tries to give it a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the discontent of society with political and political parties.
It is possible to highlight the civilian and the form of association in the case of these associations not only to avoid legal issues of registration, but also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, Hungarian Guardia is also a risk factor of neighbouring relations.
" In the past months, in many neighbouring States, Hungary Watch was a potential danger, while the ultra-nationalist policies figures of certain neighbouring countries want to justify their anti-Humanian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guardia,
All this affects the political stability of the region" - they added.
According to the investigation institute, the Constitution of the Hungarian Guardia is not an isolated phenomenon in the Centre and Eastern Europe, so that all regions have increased political risks.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guardian worked in similar ways, for example, by the Burgara National Guardian, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the Belgian National Union of extreme right (UNB).
The Constitution of the Bulgar guards shall be the massive disorders of the giant in one of the Sofya barriers (Polian Krasna).
By using this situation, UNB decided to constitute the guard, arguing that the objective of the organization is "national self-defence".
In his opinion, in the past 17 years, "Gigan terrorism" in Bulgaria, however, the State remained unfair and unfair against the facts - remembers the Political Capital.
They added: This initiative has caused an enthusiasming discussion in the Bulgarian public view.
As stated, the increase in the risk of ethnical conflicts that certain Gymnasium organizations in Bulgaria have announced to resist, will be their own guard.
As Hungarian Warfare has even shown similarity with the Belgian National Warfare, it cannot be excluded that Hungarians also react to the threat in similar ways, organizing their own self-defence - can be read in the warning on the risks of the Political Capital Capital.
The Political Capital Investigation Director, Attila Juhász at the question of the News Agency, stated: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the investigation institute.
As he said, each year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can affect risk change, they informe the public opinion, as has occurred in this case, by publishing their warning on the risks.
The party is not always written with red numbers
In Hungary, the law defines precisely the days written with red numbers in the calendar and has already been converted into a generalized practice around the celebration days - that the year that will be less - the working days will be reorganized.
Not even in the EU or North America are the festivities unitary.
Hungarian laws make a difference between national feast, State party and festivals.
The festivals are primarily related to historical religious and ephemery festivities.
We also celebrate the New Year: both the last day of the old year, as well as the first day of the new year is festival - this last about everything that they can relax those who pass on the old year.
For the whole year, we have 11 feasts written with red numbers in the calendar.
It is a national party on March 15, 1848, and on October 23, for the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrate the foundation of the State, on 1 May the work party, on 1 and 2 November, we recall our failed family and friends.
Furthermore, in our country the Resurrection Passah, Pentecostes and Christmas are celebrations.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious festivities a few times match with a weekend, so it is often pushing when before or after the party there is a single working day.
In turn of the expanded weekends so, during the previous Saturdays, it cannot be exempted from work or school.
It is the minister of work that regulates in its specific decree when it is necessary to work exactly in change of the day before or after the party.
This legal standard is of binding compliance for all patrons and their employees, as well as for public employees and officials.
It is not binding for companies and services that, due to their role, work uninterruptedly even during the festivals.
This year the order of work can only be changed around the celebrations of the end of the year: from December 24, almost the life in the country is stopped, since, according to experiences, most people "face pump" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
The next year of our feasts will match with mediums or weekends, so there will be less changes in working days than this year.
First, the agenda will be amended around the work party so that, for four days later, workers can relax.
Saturday, April 26, will be working day, so that the change on Thursday 2 May is celebrated.
Another change relates to the celebration of October 23: Saturday 18 October, it will have to work in place on Thursday 24.
On the other hand, the year coming during the end of the year can be relaxed, since from 24 December will not be working in almost any part, nor even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
It's six little deputy to strike your colleagues' life
E-mails that we forgot sent, sound messages that we never received, innocent lies that pass without give us account: they are all part of our cotidian "Folclore" in the work.
It is necessary to decide whether you can adapt to the small smells or avoid consciously the confused situations that may be able to slow them to others.
Councils.
I'm sorry, I've forgotten to warn you that they have searched for you from the marketing Department," says one of your colleagues."
That's why you didn't go to a quote?
In the best cases it feels and try to repair the matter, the best calls for the marketing department to tell them that you have forgotten the message (this is the less ordinary solution).
In most times, the matter is resolved by apologizing.
Before going to boxes, it is important to meditate on the things with which you can smell the life of your colleagues and strive consciously to avoid them.
Do you still give something that isn't yours?
There's nothing more irritual than when you want to cover a document, a service or your phone, and you don't find them.
You remember that last night you put the snake on the table, but for this morning it's gone?
Do you even find your box lost in the table of one of your colleagues?
You don't get nothing to your colleagues without asking them, because you're going to be honoured with you for your things.
Don't shop over or posting from the office because you can be unpleasant when you need them immediately and get off before the time.
Chemistry about your colleagues' private life?
There is no good solution to stop laughing that are already running.
Who, what are you doing and with who?
Where and why?
Do not pass the information (conjections) that you have about your colleagues' particular life!
Do not abuse your colleague's confidence when you share with you your most intimate secrets!
Everything in you is what you have heard, and do not smell about your colleague in his absence, although others also know the things of him.
Are you going to license for illness unjustly?
When you call the office by phone and say you are sick and ill, you feel bad or well, you feel that the day you prefer to relax; think that others should do your job, your imposterable tasks, your work in terms of time.
Don't shoot him to your colleague!
If you already know that the next day you will not go to the office or may happen something, so you must stay at home, communities, so that your colleagues or your chief do not have to compare with you the next day.
Tarares, rhythms, telephone calls
Are you put into your work, but you're gonna get out of him the rings of your colleagues?
Have you heard a telephone conversation involuntary that would have been better not listening to you?
Do not smell your colleagues with your chairs, songs, high voice conversations (not less when you do them above your head), pants, constant blasphemy, expressing your discounts in high voice.
All of these may be angry, although they are not deep in this project (writing, planning, organization).
Did you miss others for a mistake?
Don't get the fault to others if you didn't end at time, you forgot to send a important letter or a message!
Don't shut the caos anyway in the office, nor the smile that make your colleagues!
You must recognise if you have made a mistake that harms others and you have to repair the lack!
Ask how you can repair your lack!
Are you feeling too much at the office?
Jogging and Zapatillas: It's very comfortable for the house, but it's not suitable for the office!
You don't see a pleasant jogging even if your occupation allows it!
You don't be disreglated, respect your colleagues and yourself by seeing a cotidian, elegant and pleasant cloth when your occupation requires it so!
Pairs interest if you want to comply with the expectations of the public
The car slowly progresses in the morning's summer habit.
It sounds a strange coma in the radio: violin with electronic effects.
Get down the volume.
Change the ritm of music and the previous tones are added the lower and then the voice of a woman's core as a real joy intervienes.
The mr2 channel plays the song Wings of Love de Zagar.
National musical life has not made us a lot with electronic quality pop.
But now it looks very different when you listen to the new disk of Zagar.
It appears Yonderboi. Some new and interesting songs of the underground [b2]digital [b3] nationally little will change the image and although it is a moderate rock style, guitarrs break, the national pop electronic has demonstrated: there are news under the Solar.
Balazs Zságer started his cart in the city of Pecs, touched in the whole of Yonderboi until he started his independent carriage maybe because both may not be protagonists of the same together.
With its project (Zagar) and his music, a jazz mixture, e-commerce and pop electronic music, triumphal triumph, when requested soundtracks [b4) cinematographic (pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The largest public was aware that in a principle was only active in small clubs when the magazine wan2 chosen his first disk edited in 2002 between the fifty-week-range national disks, classified to Zagar together with Yunterboi as almost the only national trend former, which could also be sold in Western markets.
It is not doubtful that Zagar and its together are modest, but no one asked them whether they take or not this label.
The whole reacted how to react: prepared a new and even better disk.
The recently launched disk, titled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, can open new ways for them, although the own title aims to establish continuity with the initial years in the city of Pecs.
So this title was one of the old lines of Balazs Zságer.
It's well the reference on the airy, on the flight, but in addition to the airful music, now appeared - in accordance with the spirit and the tendency of the time - the guitarra that sounds stronger, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs the disk on the Millennaris György Ligeti, the song that currently works in England with the whole The Puzzle.
The disk includes a real success of the mr2 Petśfi channel, which recently transmits from morning to the popular music night. This issuer led to the ears of the radioists the high flight music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungary songs (Dive Underground).
So everything's in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success comes to the question: what are you interpreting, in what measure is a music dedicated to a selected public?
Balazs Zságer: The definition of the public selected for me means little.
In my opinion there are two types of castles in light music; not mainstream and underground[b5], not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
The so-called alternative music can also be abusive, without sense and can also be composed only for sale, what it does.
But also a good pop song can occur from a sincere inspiration.
The attitude of listeners also works with this spirit, independent of national languages and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between your music welcome by the Hungary and foreign public?
B.Zs: In the foreign, especially western, the light music has greater traditions.
There is not only the generations of 15 and twenty years frequently the conciers, but also the oldest.
There is much more attention to changes that are made around the light music, because they consider it as part of the contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role has the public in your work?
Who are you, where are they and how many people listening to your music?
B.Zs: Of course, I feel well when you see more people on our concerts.
But we never composed music for the market.
We are not composing music for any goal, but for any reason.
The role of the public is well feeling in the concerts where there is a mutual influence, but this is only in the unconceptive changes of the moment.
And yet, I realize that if you want to fulfill the expectations of the public, you lose their interest.
hvg.hu: How long do you intend to follow Yunterboi's example?
He works in solidarity and made his career better in the west of us.
B.Zs: We do not follow their way, despite sometimes trying to compare our music with him.
We work better in the team, trust in the musical presence of the other and let us develop.
In a principle it was inevitable to compare our work with Yonderboi music, as many of us started our career in their group and from there we started another way.
hvg.hu: In the list of successful successes of mr2 Petśfi Wings of Love is on the first place.
Many people first heard the name of Zagar in relation to this song.
Did you open this style to a broader floor?
Zs.B.: We did not intend to make great successes and sell these successes with our disk.
This song is something more than that.
We add it at the end of the disk, trying to relax after the sound body of the disk and the weakest topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six songs?
Why just to them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a core to the gospel style.
Then the idea was to create this core of the solars of good voice of our own national musical scenario.
Thus, the core of six women - Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Peterfy, Enikś Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh - was then baptized as Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Have you so made the song or girls changed some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed for a long time in instrumental version and when we had the entire disk material, we think that there was something still lacking.
The coat was cut the song.
That night I recorded the song that they later learned the girls.
It was almost the first attempt and in an incredibly spontaneous form.
I remember, I was so excited at that time, but of course I also needed the Divine.
With my voice, I wouldn't have worked so strong.
hvg.hu: both in the conciert and on the disk looks like that girls were in the second plan.
There's no solists (except the short one of Judy Jay), have no own role, they sing all together and not stronger than music, so music is not only accompagning their songs.
In the scenario are also found in the background.
Really?
B.Zs: They are in the fund simply for technical problems.
In turn, we wouldn't want to distribute the roles of solalists.
The song also looks about it, about which we forget a rat of our ego, who from where he came and where he goes, let them go, the rivers of love take us up.
It would have been desired to achieve that others also symptoms the state of evolution that we feel when we born this song.
hvg.hu: What has you dedicated more work?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition in reality to no one, better at the time of mixing more difficult pieces.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play in a conciert plan or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I didn't want to operate the green, and then, littlely everything was put to their place as a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song in the new disk?
Zs.B.: This constantly changes with the concerts and because I already "solved" the disk.
Now the prophet is a Fool, the Escape from the Earth and the Never The Same.
A tractory swimming swimming swimming thousands of dollars for its minority complex
An unfaithful unfaithful.
This is how his former employer Jerome Kerviel, the French giant banker of General Society, also the Checo Trade Bank.
He lost about five billion euros.
However, it seems better that Kerviel was a great player that I wanted to compare his colleagues and, uncertainly, with good capacity.
A long time ago, unlike all the large checa banks, the crisis on the market of hypotheses.
"It has a frogil character" was stopped hearing from his superiors, the same ones they sent him to the police.
But what is out of the answers of Kerviel according to what they cross the French media, such as the Le Monde newspaper, is that it was a man who was over 1,6 million euros at the end of the last year.
Crisis not only in America
"That I wanted to do was win money for my bank" guarantees in your answers.
Precisely, in summer, he gained 500 million euros during the American crisis.
This opportunity has already seen her coming to the beginning of the year.
In February, some news were started to hear about the sub-prince hypothetic calls offered to low income customers or those in the past had problems with payments and that these customers would start to have problems.
However, this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel did not believe it and correctly posted.
And then, at the end of the year, their profits exceeded EUR 1.600 million.
"When I have won my first 500 million, I don't know how to notify it," Kerviel confieses and adds, which hasn't been left for him, in absolutely.
During all the questionnaire, he declared that the records had false so that it would not be found.
Even the chiefs, even when the Eurex Bolsa began to be interested in their business.
Risk converted to benefit
Did you have to find out?
Better, no.
"I thought I had won $1,600 million for the bank and that from that simple fact it would be pleased."
From where did he get so much will to strive in that way?
In my position, I should work gradually.
He came to work in the General Society in 2000, exactly after finishing study in Lyon.
The annual loan was held between $51,000.
Two years later, it was a Bolsa runner assistant, and in 2005, it became a $90,000-year lounge.
I still knew I would never win as well as others.
"In my first interview in 2005, I already observed that they looked carefully.
Because of my training and my professional and personal progress," Kerviel described researchers.
But at a short time of my entry into the company, the first great success came.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, during the attacks with bombs in London, playing a low amount of EUR 500 million.
And this summoned a starting mechanism, and I wanted more.
If you win, we leave you
"This is like a snow ball," the police said.
But it's said that the chiefs knew of all this, or that they're better suspecting it.
"When I won money, they closed the eyes."
Only that, afterward, the shooting came to the beginning of this year.
One day it lost a million of euros.
After the weekend to half January I wanted to remove all the hulls.
When the Monday came to work, I wasn't working at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that he had lost 5,000 million euros for his fault.
And how could they find him?
He was suspected from his holidays.
"I'm only elected four days for the past year.
The driver who has no holidays is a runner who doesn't want anyone to take a look at his poster," Kerviel ended.
Czech Republic has the possibility of reaching 365 billion
The Government Ministers of the Czech Republic signed last night with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes from which the Republic of Czech can reach 14 billion euros (approximately 365 million colonies).
This is almost half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
From seven operational programmes, about 125 million colonies will be paid for the regions.
Checa firms can obtain about 100 million colonies of the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
The majority of the money will be intended for transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of operational programmes and represents up to 22 percent of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the State fund for transport infrastructures that the next year will contain 90.800 million colonies.
The enterprises and innovation programme should serve entrepreneurs and enterprises to obtain resources in business innovation.
The enterprises should be funded for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
As regards the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the recent income countries which are less used.
Twenty-year pension for the president of Nicaragua, declared the Court
The Court of Appeals of Nicaragua decreed the sentence of 20 years for the country ' s president, Arnaldo Germany, which was sentenced in 2003 by the deficiency of $1,800 million.
Despite that, a time later, he was released from the prison to pass to home arrest in his hacienda outside Nicaraguêns.
There is nothing clear in these moments, according to the AP Agency that, then the chief of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002, again is between the races.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, he will depend better on the prison agents if they leave Germany to complete their punishment at home or if they return to prison.
Four years ago, the court has demonstrated how Germany was constantly overlooked the government's money to the account of a company in Panama.
This company was physician, and the account was actually belonging to its closest families and parties.
A part of this money has been concluded in the fund created by Germany to finance its campaign in the elections of 2001.
Thus we adopted the budget
And that's it.
The State budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first elaborated by this government and accepted by most of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
The budget of this year was already approved by the support of the SSD, since it was prepared by the Minister Sobotka and the SSD could not be allowed to accept it.
In addition to different debates before the vote on the vote on the Government ' s reliability vote, there was no dramatic event.
The parliamentary Assembly, in this traditional view, even though the most influenced, adopted with tranquility the new law.
It's a great paradox.
Each government begins and ends with each chapter and leaves from the budget, you will like it or not.
The budget is an important part of the policy, but it is hidden by the resistance of power between government and opposition.
It is important for the media and therefore provide special attention to you.
Political discussions are much more interesting than simple numbers.
The State budgets of the last social democratic governments suffered from three defects that for 2008 it is not so easy to solve:
The first of them is the high participation of the binding laws, called as the expenditure of the officials who are not only pensions, but also the social benefits that the last year had already been adopted before the elections by the "silencious" coalition of ŠSSD and KSOM.
The second of them is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the deficit of public funding, such as the municipal and Community budget deficit.
Nevertheless, the largest risk is not in the deficit of the State budget.
This is public and relatively under control.
However, the clock bomb is in the deficit of the municipal and Community budget.
Many of the funds to be able to obtain other investment sources, separate from the money of the taxes, rates and credits of the banks, often employed obligations with which they deemed unproportionally to their pensions.
In recent years, these debts were able to be paid through the massive sale of energy actions and other development networks receiving the state and privacy.
They are currently not counting with this resource.
If we wait only to official and verified facts, we found that:
Our economy, a few years ago, passes through growth phases in the same way as the rest of the world, which is shocked by SSD.
This was the ideal opportunity for its government to order the financing of the State.
However, instead of that, the state continued to debt.
The rest of countries, except some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have been much more reasonable than our Republic.
It is a great honour that, above all, falls in the previous government.
We belong to nations that are less threatened by poverty within global measures.
Thus, the massive social programmes that, unfortunately, were unnecessary in the past few years.
And although they were able to remove part of the uncomprehensible popular costs adopted this year before the elections, if the age of jubilization and the reform of pensions will be the real end of any policy in this country and the rule whose governance is only a simple bureaucracy.
As far as a little, we can say that the ruling policy will be transformed into officials, mechanical distributors of most of the money of the taxes for jubilation and social benefits.
Therefore, the budget of this year cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of the normal expenditure of the mandate expenditure.
The deficit planned over 70 million for 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary if the past government had not been malgaging in the past 10 years.
We did not want to be a official only, so we should be patients and grant this weak government coalition, which is understood that the state can only cost what is possible to obtain taxes and rates, the tranquility for the preparation of other legislation reforms.
Only this will allow the Palestinian achievement of a balanced State budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The Bank of the American Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the British Central Banks, Switzerland and Canada decided to fight together against the crisis of the financial market.
The Monetary Market will receive more than $100 million through offers.
The banks understood the interest rates for which they are able to provide money.
For example, the American Fed will send 40 million dollars, and then twenty-five million will facilitate the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the attacks of 11 September, central banks of different states are the first time agreed in this coordinated process to protect and reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step must resolve the greatest economic problem, i.e. the continuing growth of the free capital shortage that banks could provide" wrote in their report for customers, Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group advisor.
"This coordinated action of the central banks probably reduced the receipt in the United States of 65 percent to 50 percent", added Baumohl in its report.
Banks have already paid sixty billion dollars in payment credits, especially in the United States.
Economists still expect thousands of millions in loss.
"The central banks should really be afraid of what they still expected when they decided to give this step", said the main economicist of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad", added.
Central banks fear that they have the same access problems and that they will therefore have to provide more money to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy to the receipt with different effects on global economy growth.
The Central Banks thus decided, after they could not reduce the called LIBOR, the London banking tariff that was used for the loan of money on the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly scared of paying money even when the United States Central Banks, Canada and Great Britain reduced their types of interest several times.
"He will have the same effect as another fall of the types of interest," said to the Reuters Agency, Greg Saviation of the Tempus Consulting company.
Some economics are not surprised that the step given by central banks contributes to raising the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the United States.
Claus: The debates of ecologists are incredible
Global climate change affects mostly the developing countries.
President Václav Klaus was again expressed on the problem of global calentization.
The criticism now emerged with the clause of the United Nations International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his blue book, not the green planet, commented that the debates of ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference which creates a strange mixing of government representatives and non-governmental organizations but also the fundamental difference between the retorics used and the reality.
"There the debates are only structured, are artificial fires of words, replaced by the solution to current problems," said Klaus.
The Czech President during the presentation of its book stressed that this issue is very important to him and that it was therefore interested.
He also expressed his joy by discovering his book translated to the German because, as he said, "also many times I am only meeting with the loading of my ideas".
Now interested persons can be informed of their variety of opinions.
Klaus recalled that it is not a climateist, but that he, according to his view, has sufficient evidence as to write a book as this.
It is academic, with the ability to follow and judge a specialized disorder, has experiences with statistics and is also economic.
At the main moment of the closure he expressed his thinking that the climate is constantly changed and that its changes are normal, that on the calentization of the planet there is no agreement between the scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not so large and serious, nor represent potential disasters, and that the attempts to influence climate development are inutile, inefficient and costly unacceptable.
In addition, as a man experienced with totalitarianism considers that it is inacceptable to imposing non-profit opinions to others, which feels like a dangerous way of limiting the freedom of others.
At the questions of the present, it was repeated that it was not against "the reasonable environmental defenders, but against ecologists who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits".
The same theme spoke Klaus in Vienna two months ago in Hayes Institute.
600.000 people did not get to change their carney of driving
The date was passed to six hundred thousand drivers, and therefore they did not change their old carne to conduct which validity ends at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can ask the change to the officials of time to the end of the year to issue the new carne.
However, the Ministry does not fear that after a new year they find hundreds of thousands of drivers without the valid carne.
According to traffic, carne has not changed it mainly those who have no longer want to drive.
While people announce a rapid decline in the change of carnes, the metrópoli offices are filled with requests and the interest of the new carne has increased.
The accommodation calculates around 2.000 daily customers.
A half hour is expected in the legs.
The new carne in Prague has not yet been removed around 140,000 drivers.
The emission of a new carne takes twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the carne emission in a shorter period of five days.
But in that case, the driver must pay 15 coronas.
The drivers who bindingly have to change their carney and do not reach until the end of the year, but will go to roads without the valid carne will be covered to a lot from January.
The infractor will pay a maximum of two thousand coronas.
The police can correct the crime with an amonestation.
If it is an administrative offence, the currency will be at 2,500 coronas.
According to the previous information, the person who does not go to anywhere could receive a lot.
They could presumably pay up to 30,000 coronas.
The Ministry appealed the offices to be modestly income of thousands of colonies as maximum.
According to the vocal of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, thousands of colonies are not threatening anyone.
According to him, the driving career is a document where people can decide whether they want it or not.
It's not the character of identity that each person must have valid.
People who do not want to drive should deliver the carnaval to drive.
Take it or send it with a certificate to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year, the carnes issued during the 1964 and 1993 are valid.
However, the drivers must just go shortly by changeing the other types of carne to drive.
Persons with the document between 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the carne issued between 2001 and 2004 ended in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2,6 million documents.
The court was sentenced to the compulsory detectives in Berdych
The former police Josef Opava and Petr Kośaの accused of compliance with the criminal David Berdych will pass between 13 and 10 years in prison.
The Supreme Court of Prague decided as a definitive reducing of punishment, the first to one year, and the second to two years.
The department ' s department ' s infringement against organized crime would, in principle, fall between 14 and 12 years of age.
The decision of today cannot be recurred only through the revocation of the Supreme Court.
Berdych is also in this case accused, but he first waits for the Court of First Instance.
Despite other processes, it has already been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
You can't receive any more.
In January, the District Court recognized the participation of 19 persons and the Supreme Court, today, was revoked to 16 of them.
The majority of the accused accused were rejected by the investigation to be treated by cases invented.
According to the Senate of Central Bohemia, the police members in accordance with Berdych provided information on police sources to criminals, covered robs, and helped criminal group members to avoid punishment.
These crimes delivered 30 percent of their rob to Opava and Kośaśík.
The appeal refers to criminal acts carried out by the group between 1999 and 2001.
Their victims had serious impact on their health, but they were also accused of the abuse of power as public agents and without a weapons permission.
In the home record, the police found a number of weapons, a weapon munition with a steel nucleus, a laser leader and a metrollator.
The group of criminals, according to the accused, stole them tens of millions of colonies.
Except almost twenty men in this process the court has already recognized guilty for Berdych and other guilty.
Other men in the case of Berdych are still declaring other processes, and in some cases they have not yet appeared.
Tomáš Pśt and Maroš Šulej, who have now avoided the judgment, are in prison in Ireland where they are waiting for the final decision on their delivery to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
A account to change children: 12 million
To change some children in the maternity House the lawyer of the families affected, Igor Veleba wants 12 million corones of compensation towards the expenditure of the court.
For each of the mothers, three million, for parents, two million, and for children, a million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each father.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondśej Dostal, is not in principle in accordance with the Veleba proposal.
"This request we do not approve it, it's too high," said Dostal after the meeting of today.
"Before we can do a idea of this counter-proposal, we need the report of the specialist sent by the counterparty.
We will warn if you have a reciprocal value.
We keep in the view that they will be hundreds of thousands for everyone" said Dostal.
The amount should be moved between 100,000 and 200,000 corones for each of the parents.
At the beginning of the cause, the family of Jacob wanted, each month that did not create his biological daughter, a million coronas.
Velaba was served as a basis for negotiating the compensation of the specialist's report, only that it was developed in the hospital of Motol's powerfulness in Praga.
The parents of girls according to psychological and psychological experts suffered from psychic and stress of different levels and deepness.
The stress situation was better supported by men even if they were fighting with recruitments for the change of girls.
Women make it worse with the trauma they are living today and with what happens today, completed Veleba.
Veronica and Nicola were changed by nurses in the Tśebič maternity House last year, on December 9th.
Last week, girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the śrmákovī to the Pśibyslavic, and Veronica to Libor Broś and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jabloś.
The Governor of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčil, delivered at the end of October to each family 100,000 colonies as compensation costs for the error made in the Tśebič hospital that the region was administered.
All Czech Republic hospitals are insured by law as harmful responsibilities.
In cases of errors, the reserve and extraordinarily may request support to the administrator.
The court until today recognised a relatively low compensation, the amounts that were calculated according to the tables accounting for hundreds of thousands and extraordinaryly of a million corones.
Polívka lost the kingdom of Valaquia
Bolek Polivka lost the pledge on the Kingdom mark of Valaquia.
According to the court of the Provincial Court of Ostrava, it was the first who used the Kingdom mark of Valaquia, but the project was created for many years by Tomáš Harabisch with whom the actor cooperated.
Polivka was not presented today in the oral view.
According to your lawyer, the cause probably has not been completed and your customer will recurr.
"The appeal is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasites of the popularity of Bolek Polívka," said after the process, the lawyer of Polívka.
For him, before the words of the Kingdom of Valaquia, the image of the actor and comic comes to the whole world.
The same idea also has Harabiš.
"We're going after us a ten years of work.
Search of money and inventation of activities," said.
For him, the cause of pleasing is in the money.
"After years, I realized that the project has success and that it could also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work," added.
It's a children's book, right?
According to the court, the Kingdom mark was first used by Polivka in its television program.
In 1993, actor Radoslav Brzobohatī was coronated.
Then it was not tried to direct it toward the creation of a fixed kingdom.
Some years later, Harabiš was editing the Passport of the Kingdom of Valaquia.
From that coherent origin, a business and a lucrative business, which Harabiš created after the Kingdom Society of Valaquia.
In 1997, Polívka agreed on the use of his name and signing in passports and even offered its owners discounted to their farm visitors and assistants to their spectrums.
Who will sit on the throne?
Judge today also decided that Harabiš was only using a simple idea that Polívka made public in the scenario for his own business benefit.
"It's clear that Bolek Polívka helped the peoples of the Kingdom of Valaquia," said the judge.
However, he added that the spirit of the project is Harabiš and its team who were completely dedicated to it.
The cooperation, among the today discovered parties, continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetin.
From that time they started conflicts between Polívka and Harabiš whose culmination came with the decay of the "king Boleslav I, elected forever".
The main role in the Kingdom, through Harabiš's mediation, declined in the single Jamila šulákova, as a mother's single.
In 2002, Polívka presented an accused against Harabiš and his society that has been rejected by the court until now.
Anything clearly could bring into the strike, the throne towards his princess, which is already preparing Harabiš.
He should get out of the new king.
You did not want to develop more data or data.
"We don't have any time.
I'd have to be something like the king's way to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected at a specific date.
Even Mr Polívka can be presented," added Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VT: overcome prejudices
Actually, I never liked Peugeotu 206.
His driving features never were special, the quality of the box of changes, and also the product could be characterized below the average.
But now it exists on the market its successor, the Peugeot 207, and this is much better.
This Combi called SW is a bit more advanced and to me, I'm just thinking about it better.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, I was, for example, deserved from the head space in the backer sit.
But this would be the only complaint because Combi's carriage means in this sense, that I won't suffer before the two meters of length.
Watching the World
I step through the inside quickly to not repeat it too much.
This is a elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here it would be more valued for designing even though the car seems quite elegant.
The sisters are comfortable, there are the times in which we wanted from short seats and supports.
On the other hand of the model 206, the lateral direction has significantly improved.
And space, and here you can feel how you have grown the carriage measures.
In the Combi, the quoted lack of space in the head.
Malte to snake
But the main thing in this vehicle is his skin.
This must be aware of it as a very accessible (by the slower port) and a well-divided storage.
The dead spaces are equipped with gomma mails that provide an ideal solution.
It doesn't hurt, and it can be extended to the point of subjecting weighted objects.
But let's stay in the deposit.
According to tables, it has a capacity of 428 litres in the basic regime, which is better a average value in comparison with competition.
But not in comparison with the vehicle of the same type sold in the Czech Republic, the škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the model of Mladaá Boleslav, we make sure the Peugeot remained with its 52 litres perceptionable.
From holidays to foreign or by putting the child's car is critical.
But if you had to comment something positive then I have to quote the floor that remains pretty planned after attacking the supports of the second line.
120 horses in four walks
Our car tested was equipped with a four-qualf injection incentive on a capacity of 1.6 l. and a force of 88 kW.
And indeed, this is how it should look like a 1600 that less valued the family five doors.
It's quiet, consuming little and especially, it's impulse.
If I compare it with the time of the shoods then that looked like the escape tube was shooted by a trap, I can say that with this I can be impressed.
Prices answer
The price of the car is not for all buses.
However, we must take into account that we have tested a elegantly equipped vehicle and with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with injection fire of 1400 per 329.900 coronas is still possible.
Our adherents put it from 410.900 corones, which is already too much.
The type of Premium tested has already reached 80,000 coronas.
Only if we still have airbag in the heads, air conditioned automatically, automatic cleaning, automatized trash windows...
I mean, the car with all that, it costs 531.900 coronas.
It's very much, but it's counting with the complements of the team in the Fabia and will reach a quite similar number.
Now only one of the two brands is decided.
Slovakia students are not integrated in English schools
In English schools, children from Eastern European countries are assisting, and thereby places fear more changes in schools.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans now is only a series of problems.
Even British schools record cases where conflicts between immigrants and nation children increase violence.
The problem of the integration of Eastern European children in British schools is very well illustrated in the northern town of Kent where they began to grow conflicts between the peoples and the Slovak migrants.
Discussions, extorsion and brochures among students have already reached even their own parents.
The situation has arrived so far that Chatmam's police arrested a Slovenian woman who was taking balls to a ten-year student with a green ball.
In its defense, the girl was insulting her son with racist tonn insults.
The police had to act also after a attack of two young girls of age against a Slovakian immigrant.
The girls kidnapped him with racist insults and took him stones.
"When we knew at home, a boy closed to us at the stop of the bus and began to shoot us.
When I told him that he would leave us the damn of slaughter and pearls, and then the pants were shocked and showed us their back," described another unpleasant incident for The Times, the mother of the Slovakia student.
The complaints are from both sides.
One of the nations even designed the conflict with Eastern migrants as a fight for survival.
The cases already mentioned above are shown to us as the environment in English schools begins to be quite stressed.
In Britain there are 70,000 Slovakia inscribes who came here for work.
About 30,000 Slovenian students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors, it is really the island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holidays can be done if you choose correctly.
Snakes and snakes, big oils or a quiet sea like a snake.
the palmers and the whole included with rooms offering pizzas on the beach, helmets or several cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and rule.
In the Caribbean island, you can find all this and much more.
Only in a island is still much more and this island is Cuba, the most beautiful and most beautiful of all the Great Antilles islands.
During the Spanish times, Cuba began to be the bastion of the American conquest.
Kolon called her, the most beautiful place that human eyes have seen.
Havana became a store and a loading portal of the teachers that the Spanish were out of America and brought to Europe.
And then the American times came.
The National Hotel has grown at the end of the 20th year.
He sent him to build one of the chiefs of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because all that had criminality in the United States (and therefore prohibited) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, games and prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In La Habana, high buildings arrived, by adventure wheels, the cars that were a worship symbol in the 50s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway was purchased an accommodation in San Francisco de Paula, near La Habana, and Cojimar had its yate.
In the walls of the Middle Bodeguita, its signatures left the stars of the world of the spectacular and political world of America.
And today?
In the walls of the Bodeguita you can also leave your autograph.
In the cheap hotel bar, you can mix the coctels according to your desires.
And those cars from worship in the 50s, until today, continue to work by La Habana, because those Lada and Fiat that have arrived long ago have been oxided between these weeds and salt winds.
Even when La Habana, in particular the ancient barrier, is deteriorating significantly, there is no so many wonderful colonial monuments there.
Other places are metamorfose in beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much money, its development is guaranteed.
In the past 15 years, new hotels were grown not only in La Habana, but also in Varadero, the coast of the province of Holguín and in islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is in the unique world and is very valued by the rail lovers.
The sugar cane is transported from the huge plants to the manufactures of sugar by closer ways in vacuum or electric machines.
His cars for decades have not been discovered, and now they are there, machines that work and whose brothers models exist in other parts of the world are only in the museums.
Where are you going?
The most known place for most visitors does not change.
And therefore, it is not necessary to talk more about La Habana or Varadero.
Maybe only remember that in the already quoted Hemingway there is a museum for those who love the writer, they should not stop visiting him.
The Valley of Viñales is the most pintourous of Cuba to the west of the island.
Exubering vegetation that grows in hot rock lands.
Mogotes, hot rock pills and high-scale rocks in the casts of the valley, and their grains are accumulated land fabrics thanks to which rocks are formed to hide from the vegetation.
The valley is the place where it grows, probably, the higher quality smoke in Cuba.
Visiting some of the purple manufactures can be found with your final product.
Perhaps someone seems interesting that there was the chilean part of the series, Major Zeman.
Trinity
Old city, I am abomining that was founded not much after the Spanish colonization of the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and rich.
The richness became beautiful with the buildings in the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by the French columns arrived later, has only changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Sea of Escambray, is a so-called place that still in the 50s of the last century there was no road that joined her with the rest of the country.
This isolation helped her remain outside the rest.
Nothing new has been built and therefore, no one was destroyed, because every person was happy to have where he lived.
If you have more time to stay in Trinidad than one late, you must know interesting places in the neighborhoods such as the Ancon Play or the valley of the sugar manufactures.
the night belongs to the Much House, which animates with its music the silence of the mornings.
Baraco
Small city in the west extreme Cuba, some consider it as the most beautiful island.
With safety this opinion is already confirmed by the own way.
The two roads that come there from Guantánamo must pass by high and cut mountains, as well as by a nature that only knows the action of man.
This East Cuban site has been registered as the Humanity Heritage by UNESCO thanks to its natural intake.
There they do the best chocolate, in your church, have the colonic cross (which is a cross that arrived 100 years later from the breakfast) and from the colline, where the castle was found and now there is a hotel with its own name, you can see the mountains and among them the most known, the Y même.
Café, ron, pure, Sierra Maestra, the Bahia des Cochinos and the island of Pinos, the Tropicana Cabaret, the bosom of Cuba, the Virgin de la Caridad del Cobre, the Santiago, the African religion who practiced the descendants of those slaves, all this could be filled with many pages.
However, as we say, it's better to see it ever.
Alliances are passive in Afghanistan, say Americans
A few soldiers and insufficient equipment needed is what is influenced on the launch of the mission in Afghanistan.
The NATO, according to the American Defence Minister, Robert Gates, should design a specific plan for the next years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not resulting as it was thought, matched in Edinburgh (Scotia) the representatives of the countries with troops in the south of the country.
At the same time that conflicts with the Talibhan movement, the eight participating states are discussed on the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week through its Minister of Defence, Robert Gates, encouraged the NATO forces to increase the activity, Greece sees as a priority to strengthen the Afghan government authority and the distribution of development aid.
" Development in Afghanistan is palpable but armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The following is the possibility to the population that they only can start economic and security development", said BBC the Minister of Defense, Des Browne.
The ninety percent
The activity of rebellious rebels in Afghanistan according to the data of the American army is greater than in the past five years.
The number of violent actions increased in comparison with the last year in 27 percent, and in the province of Helmand up to 60 percent.
NATO countries have around 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan whose fourth part is in the south of the territory.
However, alliances have reached the same limit for the organization and equipment of units for the United States.
Exactly request more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and how we reach them," said Gates.
In a similar sense, the Secretary-General of the NATO, Japan, also spoke today.
"I'm not glad to know what we have on the earth and the heavens in Afghanistan.
We have nine hundreds of soldiers and teams we need, and that's little," said De Hoop to the Reuters Agency in the closure of the meeting three days with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the assistant countries in the past months implies whether all partners do the maximum in Afghanistan.
For passive, for example, Germany was criticized.
" Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in a minimum zone of violence, and there are no struggle requirements that are so high as in our, in the south and eastern of the country," said Gates.
The sensational journalist Sun, this week, called the German soldiers vagues.
"The rebellious Afghanistans discover that the Germans are dedicated to play while our kids fight," wrote Sun in a material associated with German soldiers photos playing the table tennis.
The German Image responded to the attack and published a photo where the British troop played a ruby game in the south of Afghanistan.
State debt will reach the billion in 2009
The State shall be 84.000 coronas for each shuttle.
The total debt led to 842.700 million colonies in September.
This year, the government planned to provide 159,200 million coronas.
However, at the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152,800 million colonies thanks to the improvement of the economy of the State budget.
The State debt of the Checa Republic increased at the end of September to 842.700 million colonies.
In nine months of this year, 40.200 million colonies increased.
However, since June, 13.400 million colonies were decreased.
Thus today, the Ministry of Economy confirmed its data on the debt of the starting state of October.
For each cheque, the debt corresponds to 84.000 coronas.
In the past year, the State was debt to more than 111 million colonies.
"For now it seems to be that thanks to the low deficit of the next year we could pass the border of the billion coronas until 2009.
The next year the debt should be moved between the $900,000 and the million of coronas," said to the iHNeed.cz server, the Economist of Patria Finance, David Marek.
Similarly, it is also the economicist of Next Finance, Vladimír Pikora: "We could pass the billion in 2009.
Exactly when this will depend on the next budget we have not yet known.
If the situation was found in the changed political scene and the political authorities could be able to smell, it could be delayed by 2010.
But I don't see that change," added.
The doubt grows
The debt of the state creates debts in the central government and, above all, the accumulation of the deficit of the State budget.
The debt of the state is paid by means of the treasure, state obligations, direct credits, or for example loans from the European Investment Bank.
The internal deduction of the state increased this year from 38.500 million to 719.400 million colonies.
The external debt for now has grown from 1.700 million colonies to 123.300 million coronas.
The debt of the negotiatable state at the end of September contained 803.300 million coronas Z since June was decreased in 13.700 million colonies.
The average debt rate increased in 6.5 years.
"The total inter-annual debt of the first to the third quarter creates a 13 percent of what is largely given as the economy works.
It is interesting that growth is generated above all of the obligations where there is a growth of 20 percent.
It's bad that debt grows, but on the other hand shows that it's going to be negotiated until there is a reform of pensions" commented Pikora.
Sergeant Eversmann said to get your stuff and get ready.
The 2007 State debt strategy and payment management strategies outlined that the Government planned 159.200 million colonies this year.
At the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced the plan in 152,800 million colonies thanks to the improvement of the State budget.
The amount is mainly composed of the deficit of the State budget that this year will be 76 million colonies instead of the expected 91.300 million colonies.
The remaining is composed of maximum resources for the Checaan Consolidation Agency with around 13,3 million colonies, the reserve of 10 million corones for pension payment, 43 million coronas to finance state obligations and 1,800 million colonies in payments from the European Investment Bank.
It was compared today before a court to Jartum to have given a name to a sweet shoe.
The British professor judged in Sudan for insulting the Islam has been sentenced on Thursday afternoon by a Jartum Court on 15 days of prison and expulsion, indicated his lawyer.
The British was accused of abandoning students from 6 to 7 years to give Mahomet's name to a sleeve sheep when all representation of the prophet of Islam is illicit.
It was passable of a punishment of milk.
This British School of 54 years of age under the High School of Jartum in Sudan has been arrested Sunday in his home and infringement to be acknowledged to Islam and Section, in accordance with article 125 of the Sudan Criminal Code, as a result of a number of complaints of student parents to the Sudan Ministry of Education.
The story is actually removed in September, when this teacher requests his students from 6/7 years of age to choose a name for the shoe of the class.
" Eight names come from the mouth of children, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, accounting for the director of school Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a class vote, 20 children of each 23 have chosen Mohamed as a favorite name.
Mohammed is of course the name of the prophet Muslim, but especially a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have made a book for the class with the photo of the skin with the following reader "My name is Mohamed " .
He himself did not bring any label with this name, but the problem is just the representation of the prophet considered as an insulto to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, Professor at the same school in Sudan, needed that he knew it well and that it would never have done anything that could be insultant to a religious faith, "I'm sorry that you have asked the children to vote for a name " , he is only a " innocent error " .
Divided by numerous students of the school teacher who describe it as " very attention to their students " and " which never speaks of religion in class " .
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the second name which is given in Britain, which is written in English with 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by the Muslim families is a way to honor the prophet (in often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules that constitute the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give it to a game?
It is, of course, a question of interpretation.
We have not reached Monday an agreement on the future status of the province during the last negotiations in Vienna.
Finally, the failure.
The Serbias and the Albanians of Kosovo have finished Monday in Baden, Austria, a sixth and last discussion meeting without having been able to overcome their divergences on the future status of the separate province.
" It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach a Statute Agreement, " said the European Mediator Wolfgang Ischinger, during a press conference in Vienna.
He stressed that peace in the region was " in game " , his American honour, Frank Wisner, called for Belgrado and Pristina to respect its efforts to maintain peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
" We do not predict violence at now, but in a very difficult period, " he added that " apparent tension exists " .
End of mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the tropical, which regroups the European Union, the United States and Russia, will be last Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the population province to 90% of Albanians could be clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will return their relationship to the United Nations Security Council from 10 December.
Baden's debate near Vienna consists of the sixth and last negotiations since the troic has been carried out by a new mediation by the United Nations in August last.
The United States and Europeans believe that their mediation will be completed on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked in the Security Council the concession of independence in Kosovo, insist on the persecution of negotiations beyond that date.
"The Russian was and was compromised for a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Declaration of unilateral independence?
After eight years of Administration of the United Nations of Kosovo, Westerns believe that the independence under the supervision of the European Union is the only viable solution.
Pristina is prepared to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve it in favour.
Belgrado insists on an increased autonomy.
" Unfortunately, no agreement has been found ", announced the President of the autonomy authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the Baden Hotel where the "related negotiations" were held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the rebellion of Kosovo and the future Prime Minister of province, has been part of its weakness.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrado "it belongs to a past which has led to murders and deportations".
"Effect dominated "
Serbian President Borís Tadic has considered its part that a commitment was always fair, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of an unilateral declaration of the province's independence.
Belgrado particularly expresses fear of a " dominated effect " in a region still deficiened by independence wars in the 1990s.
"To Serbia, said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible. "
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had emphasized that any decision belongs exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian alliance has a veto right.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word "
" Only one solution in the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia, " stated the Serbian Prime Minister, Vojislav Kostuni.
" These negotiations have been held for two years.
They must be finished as they have started: in the Security Council. "
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had responded that " the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status " , adding that any unilateral declaration of independence from Albanians would be " in concertation " with the Western.
Bush launchs an agreement between the Israelites and the Palestinians
President George Bush announced, during the opening of the International Peace Conference held by him on March in Annapolis, Maryland, that the Israelites and Palestinians had finally agreed on a common declaration.
The Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert, and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to enter into negotiations immediately in order to find a definitive rule of the age of 60 years between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them to end up a "life treatment" before the end of 2008.
The Palestinians should, among other things, dismantle " terrorist infrastructure " and Israel should end up their colonization activities, stated Bush, remembering both parties to their obligations regarding itinerary for peace that they had accepted in 2003.
The Chief of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would try to " to conclude a peace treaty which would solve all matters that would, without exception, include central issues " .
This calling covers the three main challenges of the conflict between the Israelites and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestinian, the status of Jerusalem and the luck of the Arab refugees excluded from their homes during the conflict of 1948.
Under the word after President of the United States, Abbas emphasized that the future negotiations would be "global and deeply" and refer to all aspects of a regulation, quoting "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things ".
After turning back to the court, Olmert understood that future negotiations were "direct and continuous" and "un effort to conclude them in the course of 2008".
Bush ended the 2008 term of its " vision of two Palestinian States " and Israeli coexistence.
Saudi Arabia revealed that she had made an effort in this part of Bush before decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is the beginning of a plan, endorsed by all the Arab countries, which proposes Israel ' s peace in change of its retirement from all the Arab Territories that are occupated during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marked " a point of confrontation in the Middle East history, especially because it attacks conflict roots and its central aspects ", estimates Prince Saoud in his Arab periodic interview with Saudi capitals.
For the lawyer, the police is not responsible.
What happened precisely, last Sunday?
As always in this type of events, official versions and voice are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the survey of the French National Police Inspection (IGPN), a police car moved on Sunday, short after 17, Luisa-Miguel Street to Villiers-le-Bel.
"I was not in an intervention but in a patrol, and circled 40-50 km/h, without turning, " explains a police source.
A green motor of the Kawasaki Mark, " not homologue, or is not allowed to circulate in the public way " (lease below) and conducted by two young people without castles, circle " to all gas " .
"He passed the police car on the left side, after an incompliance of the chain, the step to the right, " the police needs.
The control of alcoholism practitioned on the occupiant of the vehicle was negative.
The state of the car (the part of the shocked front, agrieted parabrises, launched parachutes) witnesses the violence of the shock.
Soon in the morning, the lawyer of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Therère de Givry, announced that he had granted a investigation for " involuntary murder and relief denied " to the IGPN, co-co-co-co-co-ordinational direction of the public security of Val-d'Oise.
By late, during a press conference, the applicant requires that the investigation of the IGPN at this stage denied the police's responsibility.
According to the judge of three witnesses of the accident, understood Sunday afternoon, they confirmed " the version of the police, namely that this minimotocyclic was relatively quickly left " .
Last night, a type of ranura, without doubt caused by the fleet of calzapies on the ground, showed that both vehicles had been covered the time to the police's car come to fresh.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be objected to a technical experience.
The bodies of both victims have been autopsised yesterday.

The liberalization of the contraception, however, allowed a better " domaine of fecundity " , according to the institution that notes that the pill-use index between women from 20 to 44 years has been passed from 5 per cent in 1970 to 60 per cent today.
Finally, eight births of each ten would be well planned today.
Even calculated a few or less than a month for a couple of five and if possible for spring, timely judged as the most pleased to have a child.
spectacular repair on space station
There will be no more than seven hours of work in the space at the Scott Parazynski astronaut and his international space station tripulation partners (ISS) to make the spectacular reparation of a discharged and necessary sun panel for the continuation of the scientific activity of the station.
A rare outcome that accumulated records because of their duration, from their displacement of the habitable modules, of the speed with which it has been imagined, "chapping" instruments by the astronauts to make the repair.
The problem occurred on Monday when the astronauts had freed from the Harmony launch, a cylindrical piece of cylindrical gruesa in charge of the European and Japanese laboratorys (see rounded).
This module is a type of atterration for laboratory modules.
But there must be a power to provide them in electricity.
The second task of the tripulation was to move a electricity production module with solar panels that were weighing 17.5 tonnes, already presented in the ISS, to put it into its final position.
After moving it, the tripulation began the reorganization of the solar panels of the module that had a 76 meters (76 m).
And it's where one of the panels, which are deployed as adjustes, has been damaged in a few or less than one meter by a cable rounded.
The deployment has been stopped to not hurt the panel anymore.
The astronautas, who had to first conduct a control output of the Discovery launch, and then go to repair another sun pane whose rotation system was defectuous, were forced to dedicate to the damaged panel.
And it's Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go to characterize at the end of the 30 meters long of the telediged arm of the laundry added to the station to make the repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalker" (spaceandor) of Nasa.
High, resistant, very busy, has the very developed torch and the long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor has been responsible for "operating" the sun panel "hered".
After inspecting the damages exactly, he set the fallable cable and installed types of "tables" in the damaged area.
He had helped him the second "spacewalker" that had been near the air exclusion and, inside, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, commander of the tripulation.
The tool that he used is a hockey minibase with a isolator to avoid electricity in the solar panels that produced several hundreds of voltiles, has been designed and chapuced by the astronauts on the board of the station.
Once the operation ended, Scott Parazynski expected that the panel would be completely deployed before making the inventary of its instruments and return to the station.
Last night, the astronauts benefited from a medium of rest before today, seven astronauts return from the Discovery laundry for the return to the earth planned Wednesday.
The EADS title sanized in Bolsa
The EADS Action is currently lowly reduced to the Paris Bolsa, after the group of aircraft and defence has announced that it would have to pay between 1,2 and 1,4 million euros to face the delays of A400M.
EADS is now losing 4% to 21.96 euros to the Paris Bolsa.
The group has been obliged to revise its predict of the operational result for 2007 in response to the delays generated by the slow progress in the development of the A400M engine, which consums the inaugural flight of the airplane.
The cost of paying the delay taken in the delivery of military transport aircraft, announced in October, " between 1,2 and 1,4 million euros from which more than 1 million for Airbus " announced the mother house of the European EADS constructor.
As a result of these loads, EADS will be forced to announce new objectives of the exploitation result (EBIT) for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results on Thursday, add without any more encrypted accuracy.
The group also indicates that the estimation of the new loads is consistent with the delay of six months.
It should be remembered that the operational result of EADS has failed to 86 per cent in 2006, mainly because of loads linked to the delays of another programme, the portator of A380.
At first, the group prescribed the first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The selection of the Statute quo
No surprise on Sunday, at the outdoor of the urns: Russians will spend massively for the party of President Poutine, Russia.
Reaffirming its aspiration to stability, including the authorism, after a very limited campaign.
On three days of legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin guides them today to electors a television message on public chain, already registered but whose content is secret.
He does it as a leader of the list for the unified Russian, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is depleted.
Last night, the President did not leave anything transparent by receiving foreign embassy, satisfied with delivering a new load against the Western accused of inherence - its prediction topic during the campaign.
"We know the price of a true democracy and we want honored, more transparent and more open elections, without incidents," he added.
According to the opposition, we are very far from the truth.
Denunce a campaign handled by pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov said that there is no "always have been so sweet elections, until the time of Eltsin " .
After the repression of the last week's end, at the former camp of the world of Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days of prison for illegal manifestation, visits are prohibited according to his lawyer.
"The Russians watched the mentality of the Soviet man."
After these unspeaked legislative elections, two more open questions are pronounced:
Who will happen to Poland to the Presidency?
The official newspaper published last night the first tour of the presidency election on 2 March 2008; the candidates have up to 23 December to meet.
Elected in 2000 and again elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot request the third consecutive mandate.
Then no eventors emerge.
What role will Poutine play after March?
Prime Minister?
Is Head of the parliamentary majority and of the very powerful Russian joy that would elect the government and the President?
Any legislative elections such as the presidents will triumph.
It's a tradisi.
"The Russians looked at the mentality of the soviet homo, they do not feel guilty of their destination ", estimates the sociolog Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Centre Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov, from the State University of San Petersburgo, was far away: civil society was delayed in this Christian country five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community has delayed the training of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, " Poutine rebuild the model of a paternalist State, perfectly accepted by the population, since this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic deficit, ", María Lipman, the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians " renumber their own will to the personal responsibility " of those who had recently been tested after the U.S.S. Stage.
"Why do you reflect?"
The phenomenon touchs all social faces, including the world of matters.
And the administrative eleite thinks to keep the status quo: 65 rulers (of each 85 Russian leaders) lead the local lists of the United Russian Union.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonyms of caos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
On behalf of the Russians, they will not vote too by extremists.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: "Why do you reflect?
Those who are in power aren't too bad, why change them? "
You don't think we're coming in!

The registers of the concentration fields or detention orders established by Gestapo had been gathered after a war in a practical purpose: finding the deported or subjected to the binding work and, where appropriate, providing a test of their internation, in order to open the way to compensation.
Still today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent asalariats are treating tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is a limited interest.
" There is nothing fundamentally new to expect these documents, " which has been declared in 2006, Professor Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Anti-Semitism Research Center in the Berlin Technology University.

Does it be rally at the end of the year in a ball? Experts, divided by the "subpress" crisis.
By less than five weeks to dispatch the end of the exercise, the investors are already frozen the hands by expecting the traditional rally of the end of the year.
However, this year the experts do not have so clearly that this will be produced.
Banif believes that "with the statistical point of view, the month in December generally has a positive behaviour.
However, forecasts should not be made exclusively based on statistics, even more because in the current context, incertitudes are at least in the markets, in short terms."
Although they are not parties to the fact that the carriage coach in the last few weeks of the year, these experts pointed out that "the burst market is supported by the existence of liquidity, available to invest the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially the fixed income, affected by the effect of smooth quality values in the long and short trails".
They therefore believe that the cup will have a more lateral behavior, not exemption of volatility "to all because it is not known the effect of the probable decline of the types of Fed, given the high level of crude and the risk of stimulating inflationist tensions".
Javier Barrio, who is responsible for BPI sales in Spain, agrees that it is not a good time to adventure to say that it will be rally.
"It's not the thing for many joy," the experts ensures.
Ibex lost about 4% from the maximum marked on November 8 when the index closed at 15.945.7 points.
Not yet all experts have this negative vision.
Juan Solana, an intermoney analyst, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year nearly 16.000 points thanks to the restructuring of cards and traditional contributions to pension plans that are produced every year in these dates.
However, the expert thinks that things will be something different this year since it believes that the rally will be forwarded to the second week of December after the Constitution bridge.
The analyst does not consider volatility to affect the market trend.
For its part, Federico Olucha, an Investis Bank analyst, values that we are close to technical levels and "we could soon see a revocation of the index that could be stimulated in depending on the news coming from the U.S. regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market."
The analist trusted that these are positive.
Analysts agree to the time to select the values that will be charged to bring to Ibex to new maximum counts.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that "this year touchs the greatest values".
The expert would include in the cartlet to the two large banks and some constructors "for when the date arrives, the electrical sector will be very costly."
At the time, Federico Olucha, of Investis Bank ensures that the slows will come from the hand of the bank and the industrial sector.
Constructors may also benefit from this rally if they are given.
"ACS takes several months to recover positions and we hope that other constructioners such as Ferrovial and FCC continue their same way," explains the experts.
Cyclic consumption will be protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the shipping period.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technologies will also be very well done, although in this case there is no large representation on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the past seven years, only two occasions of December has been a bajist month.
The real rally of the end of the year was lived in 2003, in which the Burunty markets were out of the crisis caused by the pink of the technological bowl.
This year, in which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December registered a reputation of 6,68%.
It must be seen if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of profits (for the moment Ibex is 8.36% from January) and if it can be counted with its final year rally.
People will open 200 offices for Sunday 12 hours
People have decided to renew a large part of its offices.
In total, 200 are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These succursales, which will operate under the Max Popular Mark, represent a great change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish institutions, since it is the first group that is decided to give the salt to support the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 20.30 p.m. and open the Saturdays from 10 p.m. to 20 p.m...
Another group that has also reiterate in several occasions that wanted to extend the time of its succursale, BBVA, has not yet been decided to give the step.
At the same time, there is a point to close an agreement with the unions to close the 75% of its offices in the Saturdays in change to opening a late, although not to the public.
The outcome of the people's experience will be decisive to ensure that other entities be covered or not to this initiative which follows the trade time.
This is just the goal that continues people with the project.
Get special customers moved through these areas to purchase their purchases, pymes, autonomes and trades in the streets selected to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open throughout Spain for about 18 months, since they are not new, but renewed.
To this end, the entity will modernize the succursale that is already in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile that present customers from the different streets.
In this way, the expansion of the time is composed of a different concept of succursal space and a new design, more current, with lighter colors.
The commercial bank manager, Angel Rivera, ensures that this restructuring is not a larger investment, although a higher staff contract, because there are some six employees per place to eight or nine.
The offices, which will even contain spaces so that the pymes can meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
People have already tested their initiative in three Madrid offices.
And the experience has been positive, explaining Angel Rivero.
Bravo Murillo streets, O'Donnell and Gran Vía of Madrid have been elected, and it seems to be with acetic, according to the River.
People account at the current with 2.500 succursale.
And other 60 operating under the Mundocredit brand, specialized in immigrants, also with very wide times, which even open Sundays and Festivals.
In these places of PopularMax will not repeat the BBVA model, where several of its offices are counting with a large non-financial products for their sale.
'We don't want to make competition to our customers' said Rivero.
At present, they have arrived in an agreement with Telephone to sell mobiles, with external staff to the bank.
TV doubles for the first time the value in Bolsa of its rival Antena 3
We got it.
With that phrase he expressed his satisfaction last night, Paul Vasile, the delegated advisor of Telecinco, when closing the market, when he found that the chain that directed doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect of his joy was: 'It's what it hurts me, it's not because we've grown more but because we're down,' he stated.
Even so, he stressed that in a weak market, 'We have fallen less'.
Telecinco finished tonight with an advance of 2.54%.
That wine is the loss of it in which we take from year to 15.66%.
The value in Bolsa of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and participated by Vocento (other 13%) reaches 4,488,88 million euros, according to Bloomberg's data.
His Rival Antena 3, which was eightening 1,52% and accumulated 40.5% from January, costs half, 2.193.46 million.
The value of other quoted communication companies is 3,575 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518,53 million Price (Finth Day Editor) and 1.779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 should be that we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how we are able to make, on the same market, what costs and how we repay it in terms of hearing.
Telecinco announced last week that it was expected to convert this year into the first television chain to over 1,000 million brutal advertising income, according to ensuring Giuseppe Tringali, the Delegated Adviser of Telecinco and Public, the branch that manages the advertising of the group.
In reality, this announced date, the television chain would register an increase of 3.6 per cent in its public facturing in respect of 965.4 million of the biennium 2006.
For its part, the net facturation of Antena 3 increased 1.6 per cent in the first nine months of the biennium (by reaching 734.4 million) while the net television income increased 0.7 per cent (630.4 million).
One of the factors that focus the analysts for the best relative development in Telecinco Bolsa is the high payment that has maintained up until now: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevar would share 100% of the benefits between its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that, although it is ready to take the decision, this ratio could vary after purchase of 33% of Finmol in association with your mother Mediaset.
' We have the official commitment to give at least 50 per cent, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope we are able to leave contents to our shareholders, whom we have already given the value of 33% of endmol.
According to analysts, the market shows samples at these moments of a certain candidate.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its benefit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 a 4% and in 2009, 7%.
It should be explained that the expected income growth of 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and 5,5 per cent to 5,1 per cent in 2009.
The same signature has slowed the winning predict of Antena 3 to 4,5 per cent in 2008 and 7.5 per cent in 2009.

Furthermore, the number of systems for the implementation of financial instruments were extended so that the multilateral negotiations systems and order interconnection systems would be summarized to the current basket managers.
The Act also requires investment services undertakings to disclose in the market information on key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risk management and risk management forms and requires a registration of all operations to facilitate monitoring by CNMV.
In its step by the Committee on Economics of the Congress, several amendments were included, including the fact that the debts referred to are considered as a “complete” financial instrument given its high danger for the investor, which has been demonstrated in the debt of high-risk hypotheks (subject).
Furthermore, the transposition of the Directive was used to legally delimite the functions that diplomates can develop in economic and enterprises 30 years after the actual decree that delimites the vocational functions reserved to economics in 1977.
In its part, the Senate incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the mediator, who will work on its own account, will not require the authorisation of the CNMV and may provide its customer marketing services to different investment companies at once.
The harmonised IPC increases five decimal in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which later serves to Eurostat to integrate it in the calculation of the inflation index in the European Union, provides a progress in how the prices have developed in Spain during November.
Its publication responds to the Eurostat policy and the European Central Bank (BCE) policy to provide timely and quality equipment data to those produced in the United States.
The next indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the Employer for the Harmonized Consumption Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not available at the time of its publication.
The INA recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator was only orientatory, so it must not necessarily correspond to the definitive date, which will be given to be known on 14 December.
"IPC will continue at relatively high levels"
The second President and Minister of Economy, Peter Solbes, stated that the increase in a 4.1% of the IPC in November is a "temporary", but at the same time the price index will continue in "relatively high" levels in the next months.
In any case Solbes has pointed out in the passages of the Congress that, although the number is not good, the difference in infrastructure of Spain with regard to monetary unity remains "more or less" the same in the last few years.
He also explained that in November "he had been less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not account for such high-speed.
"We expected a count around 4%", recognized the Minister of Economy as regards the future date today.
Virgin plan for recursion with Northern Rock 42,000 million euros in three years
Northern Rock was decreased by more than 50% to 12.000 million libraries (16.800 million euros) since they entered in a mid-See crisis and had to be recurred to an emergency credit from the Bank of England.
At that time, there were more than 25,000 million library deposits, which has been progressively fallen in two months and medium through the incertitude of their customers and in spite of the guarantee of 100 per cent of the money offered by the Government and that will remain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would renome the entity with its financial brand Virgin Money, needs to be captured around a fourth part of the income in British banks that are deposited in the next three years to reach these 18.000 million rest libraries to reach the goal of 30,000 million.

Northern Rock named this week the Virgin consortium offer, in which three other companies participated, such as their favorite to save him from the routine.
Detented Totana's Chamber by the presumed trauma of urban corruption
The Civil Watch has stopped today at the first hour of the morning at the current stage of the Totana Municipal Municipal of the Popular Party for its presumable relationship with the trauma of urban corruption this week.
Furthermore, one of the secretariats of the compositionary and the chief of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced the past May to Juan Morales, the current popular deputy, and until then government of the municipality, and that, according to the sources of the research consulted by the SER Chadea Chamber, could be the 'cabecilla' of this trauma.
The agents continue to register municipal dependences and the council of Urbanism and are not discarded at the next hour.
Moreover, the reader of Juan Morales, the main suspect of the urban corruption trauma, has been charged at the beginning of this week.
As and last night the SER Chain informed, the lawyer of the 'popular' Juan Morales, therefore encouraging, was stopped out of the Morales' home with an important documentation related to the trauma.
It is also the objective of research, according to the sources of research, of Morales's commissions to facilitate the signing of a urban convention with a gallery building company to recall 200 hectares of land.
At the time there are eight prisoners.
Good accepting the candidate of the PSOE by Toledo and chairing the Congress if they win
The former Minister of Defence José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary-General of Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to cover the list of the PSOE by Toledo for the next general elections and to be President of the Congress when socialists win general elections.
Thus, they have announced the Secretary of the Organization of the PSOE, José Blanco, and its own Bono, after the meeting he held this average in the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The executive Chief has justified the offer to the ex-Minister because "that's important to tell the best" in the political life and Bono "es between the best."
He also pointed out that "I think it" that the lack of political will be the candidate of the socialist group to presiden the Congress if socialists come in the next elections.
Bonus would be replaced as President of the Congress to Manuel Marín, who made public its decision to not be submitted to the next general elections and to leave his car in the active policy to fight climate change in the university.
The former Minister has recognised that the President of the Government has not stopped attending to return to the political vessel since she left it two years ago.
He also stated that, as citizens know who would be the economic vice-President if the PSOE wins the elections, their party wished to announce whom the Congress will preside in a "transparency act".
If you reach the charge, Bono expects to convert the House into "the house of respect and not the insult or the cry" and to "speak more to the citizens".
"Atimely, it seems regrettable that the only place in Madrid where it is not able to speak calmly and selfishly is the Congress, the President of the Government in a certain time interrupted him in the Senate 26 times."
He also had words of joy for his current President, Manuel Marín and "health to do" and he did not want to see her place to not fall in what, as he stated, his opposites could see as "prepotence".
Climate propaging
Since the movement against climate change undermines persecution both the sceptics of its predictions and other political and social battles, it is obliged to show a coherence of iron.
And more, a leader of the movement as President of the Government as Zapatero and believes that this struggle is more important than Islamic terrorism, and it is even proposed to sign a “new contract with the planet”.
This approach is obliged to explain why the action, or inaction, of its Government has decisively contributed to Spain ' s heading in Kyoto's incompliance.
Who are those responsible for the incompliance, in which sectors have been produced and why their Government, the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
Furthermore, it requires to explain the maximum clarity to the Spanish whose measures will be taken to strike climate change.
What enterprises will be affected, what citizens should be changed, what individual and collective energy we will be obliged to do, what economic consequences will be.
Or, who will sacrifice and who will pay to save the planet.
But there will not be any of these explanations.
It's just because it's about to sacrifice and pay.
Measures against climate change, real measures are unpopular.
Costs, income and threatening for business accounts and individuals.
Even the cemetery of the gasoline suggested by the PSOE has seemed to be so dangerous that Zapatero has soon been rejected.
Or, that is about to save the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With influence, committees, committees, protocols, new charges.
With contracts with the planet, this man is so useful for the election campaigns that neither speaks nor complains nor requires, but adorns the meats and inspires the tremendous.
Always it is limited to be a commercially virtually contracting party and does not intend us to move in a bicycle or refresh us with the abanico.
Totana's local police chariot and chairman for a presumed trauma of urban corruption
The Civil Watch has stopped the hall of Totana's murderplace, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, head of the local police, the secretariat of the Auditor and a hostman for possible urban crimes, has now informed sources of research.
The edil was arrested in his home and was transferred to the Consistory, in which dependences are present at these times together with many agents, who have also heard the Urbanism Concejalea and the municipal management company of the Industrial and Vivienta Earth.
These three detentions are subject to the six last Monday in Galicia, Mauritania and Madrid, in an operation related to the recall of more than 2 million hectares of rustic land in urbanization to ensure that the Nuria company will build 4,000 housing, after payment of illegal commissions during the past legislation.
Furthermore, other two persons were not arrested but are imprisoned in the sumary, which teaches the Judge No. 1 of Totana.
The six first detention have passed today to the court.
The sources have reported that the previous government of Totana and today's PP's autonomy parliamentary, Juan Morales, are being investigated.
Furthermore, the former woman, propietary of a today registered immobiliary agency in Totana, has resulted in imprisonment, as the current girl of the former government, who resides in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and employee who was alive Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigeran (Pontevedra), as Paul José M.G., director of the Emmonuar Land, an integrated Agency in the quoted group, and through which the soborns were carried out.

Our Finnish correspondental helps us this comment on last night in Finland's most important newspaper (for reality in the head of the PISA report on educational levels in the world), Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what published on November 18, the same day in which it appeared, curriculumly, the criticism of the December book:

A colleague provides information on the introduction of the Criminal Code of Criminal Discrimination on Internet Downloads:
A. The download of a song would be sentenced by six months to one year.
Instead, if you steal on the shops by values less than 400 EUR, it is just considered lacking (Article 623.1).
B. If it is robbed on the shop up to EUR 1.000, the slaughter is already crime, but the penalty remains lower than the load tax (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty remains lower than the download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight that participates in the exchange of compacts.
Participation in a tortuous rain has a punishment of three months to a year (Article 154 of the Criminal Code) and the exchange would have a punishment of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual acid in the work is considered less serious than to drop a DVD film, pursuant to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The disclosure of films protected by copyright and without authors is more punishable than the pornographic material distribution to minors (art. 186).

My head physician extends me one of his articles on rare investigations referred to: 'The money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less.'
Of course, the feelings generating the monthly payment of workers depend on what they win.
The study has been carried out through tomographic magnetic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the last number of sciences.
According to Bernd Weber, the author of the study and director of the Image Group of Neurocognition of the Life & Brain Institute in Germany: "The strongest activement was produced when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed."
The investigators noted that if both acquired the same payment, the activation was moderate, but if one received the double, the activation was higher.
I don't know if I needed so scientific conclusion.
The Tax of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte continues eight years implacablely to the Balcanian war criminals from the Criminal Court's fiscality for the former Yugoslavia, located in Haya.
His mandate ended at the end of the year and Carla will be with a agricultural sacred, because the principal responsible for the murder of Srebrenica, in which 8.000 Muslim forests died, the former General Ratko Mladic and the former serbosian leader Radovan Karadzic, continue to be free.
His names are on that list which holds the documentary of the Swiss executive Marcel Schübbach, "The list of Carla" (2006, not surprised in Spain) which, with the rythm of a police stripper, continues the work of the Swiss fiscal in Belgrado to New York to continue to pursue the escaped criminals and to press the governments involved to stretch the circle.
What's sure I'm going to be?
The automobile insurance, which covers the driver before possible left, is an important expenditure that will depend on various factors such as age, sex, old carnaval, civil status, type of vehicle to ensure or use it, among others.
Hold the car is just the principle.
And it is that, selecting the suitable car assurance is even more difficult than selecting the vehicle model.
First, we need to be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurance company.
This commitment is materialized in an insurance contract, which provides that the company receives the value of the first agreed, as a result of the obligation to pay compensation in the case of the infringement.
The first is the price of the insurance, which is determined taking into account various factors such as age, gender, antiquity of carne, civil status, type of vehicle to ensure or use, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so that the greater probability of suffering an accident, greater contribution to subscribe.
This is why both the elders of 25 and women have to pay lower prizes, since statistics reflect that they have a less illness rate because of their prudence.
Also, with the hands of the accounts, companies have arrived in the conclusion that marriage persons have less accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and thus the probability of having some type of perception.
The increase in the frequency increases the possibilities.
There are many variables that safeguards take into account at the time to establish the price of the primary.
It is why, the driver has to take care of the situation to choose that car security which is best adjusted to his profile.
Here we will explain the most significant variables when you choose one or another type of insurance, so that you, in addition to adapting to the features of the assurance, offers you a reasonable price.
Youths under 25 years are inconvenience with inconvenience at the time of contracting insurance to a reliable price, such as the reduced conduct experience and the antiquity of the carne.
Although the ideal to be well secured is an insurance at all risks, there are other more economic options.
The most precauted drivers can opt for every risk with franchicy, so they obtain the coverages of an insurance to any risk but to a more factual price.
This class of convenition would suggest that the customer pays a part of the left amount.
"The part of the currency granting the customer will be predicted on the basis of the value of the primary, which will be higher than the amount", specifies Luis Noguera, the maximum responsible in Spain, the mediator of online insurance.
Another option is an insurance to third-party, so that the customer is safeguarded against damage caused to third parties, although not against the caused in its own car.
In addition, it would be covered by rob, fire and the loss of the vehicle.
A advice.
If you are less than 25 years of age trying to be careful and to avoid males as far as possible, because this will impact on bonification, and can reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonification is a reduction on the base tariff that has the company.
On the contrary, penalization is a loan on that basis tariff.
"The bonification and punishment will depend on the company and benefit of it.
If the company has a good year can be enabled to increase the bonification", it acknowledges Noguera.
In the past 25 years the drivers have the easier time to contract an insurance, since neurality index is reduced by accumulated experience.
For this reason, the most recommendable is contracting all the risks with franchise.
"Juveniles are normally not able to use the previous experience acquired at the time of a accident, and even at the time of conduct," ensures the director in Spain of the European company, and adds that most accidents are produced in the second driving year, once the 'medium of the new' is already passed.
However, if the customer is married but has no children, it is preferable to deal with any risk insurance, always and when its economic situation is allowed, it is obvious.
In its part, children's marriages are considered by safeguards as the public with less illness independence, so the loans are less.
In this case, the best security would be one to any risk with franchise (which can be 300 euros) or, where a high bonification level is available, one to thirds extended from the third year of life of the vehicle.
"Levant a more relaxed conduct and have a more purchasing power to allow the luxury to take a greater amount of franchise", sentences Luis Noguera.
For juveniles, it is recommended that any insurance with franchise (such as 150 euros), or one to third-party, if there is a high bonification level.
It is necessary to say that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver before possible locks, but also because it represents a significant expenditure, for which it is essential to adequately study the insurance that is the most convenient of us according to our personal situation.
Celtic Search in Milan a point that values the octavos
Milan and Celtic are in the midst of this Monday in looking for the point that they are lacking to achieve their respective objectives in the closure of the Champions, since Italians serve them to be the first and the skies to condemn their classification.
Italians summon ten points and have already certified their pass on the fifth day with a quarter in Portugal, while the Celtic has nine points, but still need another to ensure that Shakhtar, with six, receives the Benfica, which has four, does not go forward.
These two parties of the D Group will be played a week before the end of the sixth day, since Milan has to discuss the World Clubs in Japan, where 13 in semi-final search for a place for the end of 16.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and quarter in the Joseph Meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to get out by a victory, since Italians do not want to speculate at home and Celtic know that winning would be first and would be able to ensure a better cross in octavos.
In the whole of Gordon Strachan, it could also serve to classify if Shakhtar does not win, but it can't be trusted because the pass is for the Ukrainians, who lost the last week in Glasgow (2-1), but wins (2-0) in the other direct duty.
Thus, the Milanists will try to shock it the night to the skoces, which are in the second metro in the restructured Champions League and consequently, after they were exactly cut into that round the past campaign with a Kaka's goel in the Progress (1-0) after the age's age.
Waiting for the victory of the "rossoneri" will be the Shakhtar who is only the triumph, in the case of Celtic loss, both to put itself into octavos and to follow in the EUFA.
And it is that, despite the last and without options to continue in the maximum European competition, the third place could be reached with a victory, which would play the EUFA.
20,000 people attend in Vancouver at the first conciert of the Spice Girls
The Spice Girls started in Vancouver (Canada), before about 20,000 spectators, his first turn since they disappeared in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared just prior to start their concierto at the Vancouver Stadium that the group meeting was "brilled".
Average of 20,000 people exploded the entries to present the concert that included a video in which the group's history was raised at the end of the 1990s.
The reencounter and the world turns match the launch of a new album which collects its main success as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Vodoo', which is published in Spain.
The five Gentiles of Spice Girls came to the scenario by lighting some bracelets who gave them the husband of Posh Spice, the British fusilist David Beckham.
The sportor was among the public who stripped the GM Place, despite Victoria's nerves had been banned for days before.
At the beginning of the spectacle, Victoria Beckham pointed out that the British astro "he has not seen our clothes, for nothing, so I'm nervous about what you're thinking of the spectacle."
'Sporty Spice', whose group was out of 1998 "for the differences between us" caused the dissolution of the fifth two years later, also expressed its nervousism during a press meeting, two hours before the spectrum started.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous but I saw the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling of the Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I am pleased to have taken the decision," said Chisholm about the meeting of the group that she solved for nine years.
The songer also pointed out that with time, "the things have been corrected and we all want."
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl has lastly acted together in 1998.
To begin, according to the CTV television, the group came to Vancouver in a special aircraft of Virgin Airlines.
At his arrival to the airport, I was waiting for them for an army of kids.
Among the five, seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will act in California (US), in San José ( on 4 December) and Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
In Madrid, they shall act on 23 December.
New fears about the gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing debate on the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk of exporting fuel to Western Europe.
The majority of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so each race between two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev warned that if Moscú increases the gas price, Russia will have to pay higher transit rates.
A previous debate last year cleaned the supplies to EU states.
The last debate between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, the monopolic duty of gas, Gazprom, trying to accept the amount of money that Ukraine had to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom declared that it would cover more in Ukraine, as it has been committed to pay 50 per cent extra in 2008 by the gas coming from the Neighbourhood of Turkey.
Analysts say that it may be that Ukraine pays 40% more for the imports of Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transits during conversation," said the Ukrainian Economic Minister Anatoly Kinakh to the Reuters News Agency.
"Gas price changes should not be related to our arguments on the levels of transit rates [when Europe] through Ukraine."
The last large debate on the gas between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut the supply to Ukraine in January 2006.
This means a fall in exports to Western Europe, which has soon led to prices.
Russian gas represents the fourth part of the EU supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but a lot of it is not yet completely developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own supply with Turkmenistan's gas and other former Soviet countries in Central Asia.
NHS "he must test for foreign workers"
The Swedish NHS needs to control the criminal preceding records of employees outside Europe, said a supervisor.
The recommendation of the general auditor Robert Black came after the verification that a foreign doctor was related to the attack of Glasgow airport in June.
Black also showed its concern that the Swedish NHS has no exact idea of the amount of foreign personnel with that account.
His report, however, noted other controls carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The general auditor was the amount of foreign personnel contracted outside the European Economic Area, due to the attacks at Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor of the Royal Alexandra Hospital of Passley, was arrested in the airport after choking a jeep in the doors of the terminal airport.
He was one of the three doctors who acted in the Old Bailey by video conference in October, accused of the cases attacked with car bombs in the UK.
NHS expects to carry out pre-employment checks to candidates to ensure that they comply with qualifications, experience and authorisation to work in the UK.
Although the Scotland Health Association uses Disclosure Scotia to carry out criminal controls, the Agency has no legality to obtain this information outside Britain.
The report of the general auditor recommends, among other measures, that the joints should contain with the guideline of the Criminal Records Office, which helps employees with criminal controls in many countries outside Britain.
"If we find some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a rutinary review", says the report.
Black declares that the Swedish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes: "In our report the areas that can be improved to ensure that information is available in the number of foreign staff of NHS."
The president of the BMA Scotia, Dr. Peter Terry said that it was "so much likely" that pre-emple cheques could identify potential NHS employees that could do terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that the pre-education cheques operate in NHS Scotia but is not clearly the value added of the recommendations made," explained.
Scotland health authorities declare that they are currently in account with 1.161 foreign people, most of their medical and nurses
But the general auditor warned that the number may be higher, partly because the joints have problems to identify what are the employees who have indefinite residence permits.
The investigation also found that the control procedures established by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were widely implemented.
This include passport controls, work permits and qualification cheque.
The Swedish Government is currently reviewing the NHS policy and pre-education guide for foreigners.
The Health Secretariat, Nicola Sturgeon, states: "It was a great interest in conducting this work as a result of the terrorist attack of Glasgow airport.
He added that, together with health gatherings, the Skow Government could consider the report recommendations and that this will be reflected in the update of pre-emplex control guides for all working groups, including foreigners, which were expected to publish the next month.

Saudi Arabia arrest 208 terrorists
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it was arrested by 208 terrorist cells who planned an imminent attack on oil plants, as well as attacks against religious and security forces.
The state television of the largest oil supplier in the world said one of the cells was planning the contrasting of mixtures.
Al-Qaeda's simulators have mounted a campaign against the local monarchy, in partnership with the United States, since 2003 after Iraq's invasion.
An eight-first cell formed by foreign residents planed an attack on oil installation in the province of the East, declared the television report.

The Minister said that the warriors had planned the entry by eight projects to the country.
Other 22 prisoners planned murders of religious leaders and security forces.
The Government warned religious leaders that should be more active to keep the Saudians traveling to Iraq to join as warners to Al-Qaeda and to support the Muslim Government, which is considered to be heritage by the most extreme Saudi Suns.
Al-Qaeda warriors have been appointed by the authorities to support the policies of the real family, which dominates the government.
The warriors who were called by Osama Bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, born in Saudi Arabia, to join the Pro-west government of the country, were targets of foreign residents associated with government, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a great effort from the security forces, from five months of work," said the portal of the minister of Interior to the state television.
The arrested also includes a "medical cell" of 16 people in Medina, whose objective purpose was to promote "Tafiri thinking" - the ideology of the radical Sun Muslims that support violence against the unfaithful and post-traditional musulmans.
The arrest includes 32 persons accused of providing support and financial support to combatants.
Clima de Venus can give an idea of the future of the Earth
Venus could have been a suitable place for life, they declared scientists last night.
The data of a European space ship in orbit showed the planet most similar to a earth's gem than previously observed.
Venus is the nearest planet to the Earth.
The two planets have similar size and take similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
For millions of years, Venus could have had similar conditions to those who made a habitable planet from the earth, now the scientists believe.
But the effects of the carbon dioxide and the winter effect, the atmosphere through sun radiations and the slowest sun rotation sent to Venus to a very different type of development.
Today the planet has no water, the temperature of the surface is enough to throw the plume and is erosionate by the slaughtered winds and ray torments.
The results of the European Space Agency for Venus Express, which has studied the planet for a year, offer a view of how the Earth can develop catastrophic changes because of the climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, from the Department of Physicals of the University of Oxford, and one of the leaders of the mission Venus Express, states: "It is clear because climate in Venus is so different than the earth, when two so similar planets are.
"We new data make it possible to build a scenario in which Venus started as the Earth, possibly with a living environment millions of years ago."
Police Deputy Enriched Urinum
A kilo of radiation material, which they declare is enriched uranium, was deleted yesterday by the Slovakian and Hungary police.
A police porter declared that three persons were arrested and the material was investigated.
The effect could not confirm whether it was enriched uranium but said that it could have been sold by $1 million (480,000 sterlin library).
It's still open.
Mitt Romney says that it is not honourable that the candidates answer the questions of a nest monkey.
However, the Republican candidates for the presidency may eventually be allowed to keep a debate on YouTube, where common and current voters store video questions and send them for their dissemination between candidates.
No question submitted at Thursday, 28 November, were more rigid than the sneemon that asked the democrats about climate calentization in the debate of the Republic of YouTube.
But the questions, and the answers, reflected a lot of the state of the Republican party faced with the elections of the next year.
You don't know exactly how CNN producers, who co-patronize the debate, chosen YouTube videos to show candidates to aspirants.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest dedicated to one theme, focused on immigration.
The topic is one of the most powerful topics for the Republicans.
CNN requested an indecisive voter group to submit the dialogue when they listened to the ideas that they would like: the employees noted a bit of approximation when candidates talked with extremist arguments.
The most hardest words exchanged between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, which has been pointed out in the critical Iwa and New Hampshire surveys.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin the reputation of Romney because it was broken with illegal immigration when he was at New York's Chamber.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former ruler of Massachusetts to contract illegal immigrants to work in his home.
Both responded aggressively when they asked whether a candidate could support a "amnist" (allowing illegal persons to regulate their situation and give them the possibility of obtaining citizenship).
The smaller candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressist, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congress, agreed with the topic.
No one has the word to be called a candidate, but both remain in the carriage, perhaps because they both warned about the theme of immigration before others.
At least in immigration and in general terms, candidates share views: increased monitoring in borders, intolerance with illegal immigrants.
This subject, together with the fear of the toxic games in China and other concerns outside, helps the Republicans to forget, or minimize, the divisions between liberalians and Christian conservators.
But the debate was uncomfortable when other issues appeared.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he supported the arms control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether water invasion should be considered torture.
One person asked whether the candidates believed in each word of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to strive to the position that, although the Bible was his favorite book, he did not believe literally in the story of Jonas and the ballena.
Another person asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee -ahora, against all expectations, first in Iowa's recent survey, thanks to his long-time Christian conservation, said that death penalty was painful but necessary.
When it was pressed to answer if Jesus would be favorable, the rider said that Jesus was too intelligent as to be a candidate in the elections.
The car is still open.
Mr. Huckabee increases in Iowa, in accordance with the liberal Ron Paul's fund recovery campaigns, and its appreciative statements on Sunday's debate.
They've been out of the ground, because the two sides of the party did not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the early and convincing party with a winner message on the size of America, satisfying both sides of the party.
This time the game is shared and the result is far away from being clear.
Workers
Gordon Brown has discovered another present in which he runs; but it also emerges
As political scandales remain in England, this is not particularly interesting.
There are no influences that have been sold, nor it is exorbiting hotel accounts in Paris, nor shoes of extramare teeth.
However, a rich businessman has been dismissed contributions to the English laboratory party, more than 650,000 sterlin libraries (1,3 million dollars), for about four years using false names, and the party did not condemn it.
Two months ago, when the first minister learned to call a election, strictly insulting the British intellectuality, declaring that opinion surveys did not affect its decision, hope was that it would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead of that, as Vince Calbe, the liberal democrat is leading to growing engineer, because the feared Mr. Brown has been Stalin to be Mr. Bean.
Northern Rock's rescue, a bank in trouble, has demonstrated regulatory deficiency and justice poverty at times of crisis.
Small proposals to change the tax code have been put to the business groups together against the Government.
The fiscal authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative chaussure.
One triumph of the retreated generals started a motor in the Lores camera, protesting against the courts in the military expenditure: being ministers of the armed forces was a medium-term job.
Now they are the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the worker-General (and previously assembled) has already diminished.
Nothing of this means Mr. Brown walks irrevocablely to the outdoor.
Governments can reach an infringement point after their ability to rule.
People do not believe them as political, but normally suspend their incredulity when a new struggle is controlling.
Once it is clear that the first minister cannot improve the things, which isn't still long, this suspension is more: public officials start to fall; office ministers are exposed; the press seeks bad news; and the government is put on the defence and does not focus.
In one part, the position of Brown is particularly difficult, because, unlike other political leaders, it cannot be defended by argumenting that it is new.
Although I would like to reject Tony Blair, it was his Supreme Tender.
The problems of Northern Rock and the authority registering tax are related to the decisions that Brown made as an error channel.
And yet, when it is not directly engaged in Blairish's contractualities - or "efficient for partners", research on the financing of political parties - voters may assume that if it is.
However, the situation of Mr Brown is not as bad as it seems.
The plates are not so bad as the Tories want to show.
Like Mr. Bean, nobody died, nor has he been shooted directly.
And the remedie, although painful, is to give what the naturally stalinist trends of Mr. Brown have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandale of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his gifts with charity gifts, says that he does not want public recognition for his kindness.
This may be so, but the decision does not take it.
The laws against the anonymous for the large political contributions are clear and there is a clear reason: the public has the right to know who is buying access to those who have power.
Mr. Watt, who said to know Mr. Abraham's agreement, and that this was not illegal, will obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, Head of Funds to which he was asked about the donations in October.
But Mr. Brown is not involved until now: there is nothing that he suggests that he knows of these actions, although the grace of payments was done after he would take control of the office in June.
Eventually, the first minister has done half of the work.
It has been fast to condemn its party because of violating the law, but it is divided into decisions for a family matter, a research commission on the matter - conducted, in good measure, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, moralities are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it's a police matter.
Furthermore, there are other things that Mr. Brown must do, as to find a permanent and independent leader for the Commission of Standards in the Public Life, because he has not had one since six months, and it must also be pressed for a real reform of the financing of the parties.
This will require a deep co-operative work of workers with the Tories, and perhaps a renumber to the special financial situation that is in place with the trade unions - amarquate measures for a party such as Mr. Brown.
But he must face some partisan facts.
The conservators now have a good level of support in the surveys; he has two years to win voters; and the only way that you can move to victory is in action with an unexpected probability and a solid competitive.
Tiburons of cards
Is the crisis of hypothes underpressing the American market in credit cards infected?
When there is blood in the water, it is natural that some dorsal snakes emocioned around.
Today, the American housing market is in crisis, the depredators have their sights on the country market of credit cards.
The analysts in Goldman Sachs calculate that losses of credit cards can be reached by $99 million if the hypothesis crisis subpresss other forms of consumption credit.
Contact signs are already seen.
There is a increase in card charges as well as in criminality rates, which measures the percentage of sales that have not been affected or have more than 30 days of delay respectively.
HSBC announced the last month that he took 1.4 million charges in its business for the United States consumer, partly because of the deficiency of card providers.
However, it's very early for the panic.
Mority and crime are at low levels.
According to Moody's, a qualification agency, the third quarter of the crime rate of 3.89% was almost a percentage point below the historical media.
Deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the American Chief Law of Persons (2005) was placed to a cut down in the requests of sweet, which represents a great loss in credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore, morosity) would be growing again, or may happen that the conditions for providers were deprivate.
The industry also reports solid payment rates, which shows how many of its debts pay consumers each month.
And trust in credit cards and values supported by assets is sufficiently strong, despite the paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a investigator sign, predicts that emission volumes for 2007 will be approximately 25% higher than the last year.
The direct crisis infection channels between subpress hypotheses and the credit card market are certainly existing: consumers like to load credit card debts since credit institutions are falling.
But credit card issuers view more the liquidity flow than the active values, so that the fall prices do not necessarily affect a change in the credible capacity of providers.
They can even work to adventure employers.
The encouragement to consumers continue to love the hypothesis decrease whether the properties value less than the value of the loan; and as a result, the payment of the card debt is under the list of priorities.
Card emissions can also respond rapidly and flexiblely to the difficult conditions that hipotech providers, changing interest types or changeing creditor salts.
This in theory should reduce the risk of a rapid retail of assets.
"We're not going to break a day and evaluate all the loans again", says Gary Perlin, Capital One's Finance Chief.
If a slowly infection of subpress on the market of credit cards is impossible, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If house prices are lower and a credit contraction leads to the recession to America, the industry is uncertainly faced with a more serious future.
We need to continue to monitor these dorsale sweet smells.
British banks declared guilty in case Enron
Three British bankers who were sentenced for their responsibilities in fraud with the previous head of the Enron Financial Office, Andrew Fastow, were declared guilty for this Monday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent seven fraud charges by riding with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich employees' cost.
They were sent to judgment in January.
But during the hearing before the judge Ewing Werlein Jr. of the U.S. district, each person was sentenced as a fraud fault.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a Skot PLC unit in the Royal Bank, became famous in Britain for the extradition procedures for two years.
In the United States, its case marked the final fleet of an investigation launched after Enron's destruction in 2001.
At first, banking offices were to have warned in 2002 to Fastow that aimed at a government investigation on Enron's fall.
The accused against bankers - doubled the "NatWest Tress" - claimed that they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former assistant, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of Enron's company controlled by Fastow, which was the artistic of a miracle of frauds in Enron, who helped his shocking spirit in the crystal.
In 2002, the bank valued the interests of the subsidiary in zero, but the three British people knew that it would be higher.
A company under the control of Kopper purchased the subsidiary bank interest in $1 million.
Bankers paid $250,000 to Kopper for interest in that company.
According to the accused, Fastow was fairly representing Enron, as the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its parts of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million remained in the hands of the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers covered 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about 12.3 million, according to the accused accused.
In January 2004, Fastow was sentenced to be two conspiration charges in Enron's failure.
The triumph of Britishs was arrested three months later.
Fastow is fulfiling a 6-year-old sentence in a federal prison of Louisiana.
Kopper is doing a 3-year penalty and one month in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay $1 million that requested to live in the United States while the judgment was held.
Enron, one of the seven larger companies of the country, declared in routines in December 2001 after years of trucks in accountability, could not hide the debt of millions or make it seem successful to its business that fails.
Cause lost thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension plans.
Enron's founder, Kenneth Lay and the previous executive head, Jeffrey Skilling were charged as kings last year for their roles in the failure of the company.
Skilling is doing a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's conspiration, fraud and other charges were suspended when he died from a heart attack last year.
Not down or out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce motor and enough fuel capacity to fly from Moscow directly from Los Angeles, starts $54 million.
But this is a small expenditure for some of the Russians.
"You have capacity up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, representative of Gulfstream.
"But no one asks this model of so many seats because it is for family private flights or for a company's presidents."
Mr. Fireer was responsible for the Gulfstream chain last Wednesday at the Millennium Fear, a 4-day consumption body held in a centre of events near the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, other 200 luxury suppliers had installed their exhibition stands, expecting to attractive new Russians to all types of products, from cooked yachts to the diamonds of 50 cents.
Mr. Firer looks slightly a brilliant Porsche in the nearby stand."
"It's a beautiful car, but it's nickel and caldery compared to us," he said.
"When the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
The Russian capital appears to Dallas when he was in a pharmaceutical position.
"We lived the same in 1890, when some academic Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialists," says Marshall Goldman, professor of the centre Davids for Russian and Euro-Asian studys at the Harvard University.
"Come the healthy ones in the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, Russians are emerging as the largest consumers and guests of the world."
The most exclusive luxury marks in the world are looking for their part of the pastel.
In another place of Moscow, this week will be held a conference on the luxury industry with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, President of LVMH, to exchange ideas about how to sell luxury goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owner of the New York Times company)
Russia has 53 billion dollars to make a total of $282 million, according to the list of Forbes of the richest people.
In addition, the second level of riches includes 103.000.000 Russians whose money arrives to $670 million, according to a study of the development of personal riches in the former Soviet Union, written by economics of the Centre for Economic and Finance Research, a local view.
(World Bank said that in 2005, 15.8 per cent of Russia had been placed under the sustainability level.)
"There are hundreds of thousands in Moscow - and so we are all here", says Nicole Marais, representative of David Morris’ sales and marketing, the London joyer.
She attended the holiday for the first time with the Russian brand distributor, the Soho Jewelry group.
"Women are unexpectedly prepared and men are very dignity."
Visiting the Sunday's night, clothes in afternoon, two root goods agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their customers and their own as a thousand.
"Show the cars and I'm trying to decide between the Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Yumatova, who reelled out the design clothes that used as a network veteran dishing with Joan Rivers.
The holiday aims to affect the new riches, the type of buyers that would be ready to stay in a store that mix marks from Cadillac Scalades, platinum cortaples, Mövenpick helmets, shipping pool tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund's tissue.
The public can buy 30 euro boards ($44,57).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most costful and the best", said Mr. Gijrath, who felt patriotically in a state of the Dutch real Porcelanas Delft, before a mural reconstruction of a Rembrandt's painting painting, pinted with hands.
"Certainly, Russians are more interested in the "bling-bling".
In fact, soldiers said that Russians who were more trayectory (10 to 15 years, for Russian standards) have changed their enjoyment from calling logs to limited edition marks, which would not be exposed to a commercial holiday.
Nevertheless, thousands of people: millenniaries in effectiveness, missionaries of the millenniums or tourists, are filled with the passes every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first evening of the feast, Roman Ershov, the general director of the beds King Koil, said that he sold two $70,000 cotton systems each one, seat, cakemira and gold rings.
Also, in the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, who was responsible for sales for A1 Moto, who had high gamma cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said that the company had sold the brilliant porche, $170,000 to a Russian millennium.
By Sunday afternoon, André Karapetian, President of L.A. Connection, who changes the luxury cars for special requirements, said that he had sold three car parkings with the form of chain bracelet, for Rolls Royce Phantom, $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel designed for a Russian casino, with incomprehensive rays of Swarovski color cristals, so that it was put to a ruleta route.
The cost: $22,000 for four roofs.
"The Russian millionary who wants avestructure cues or a cut of his wife from zirconium cubes, it will not necessarily drive on those routes," says Mr. Karapetian.
"He'll keep the car in his garage, with the other 30 or 40 cars."
Even if many of its Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian believes that the "Russian millionary" phrase does not mean exclusibility, given the oil of prices of the real estate.
"If you bought a apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, it's probably a millennium, at least in the paper if it is not effective," said.
"There are more than you think."
Those who weren't thousands could at least finish being rich for support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian signing of assets.
The company made four red phone chains (Britanic style) filled with false pieces of a million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing employee, said that his team had printed 500,000 false to the Millennium Fear.
Visitors stopped shootting money piles, asking their friends to get photos with their mobiles while they rested over a lot of money, or putting a couple of million.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millennium," says Karriev.
"chapuza" surgery could be caused by a death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving When Ronald Livingston looked through the restaurant window "A little more healthy" and he saw how a ambulance went through White Cape Cod, two lower doors in West Scott avenue.
Unfortunately, there was a car from the police patrol.
And then another.
"And you go up the ambulance," said Mr. Livingston, restaurant supervisor, that Sunday.
"There was when I knew someone died."
The authorities knew that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo of 41 years of age, who assisted the Director of the Police Department of Newark.
Now researchers are trying to determine whether she died because of a non-authorised plastic surgery, which is not yet identified by the police, but working in the house of the 212 West Scott.
The authorities still do not determine what has caused Ms. Arroyo's death, but they expect to toxicological test, although the results are not available to some weeks, and it will help solve the mysterious death that has reached the top lines of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo had been an assistant from the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the Department.
" she was loyal, working and tenaz," Mr. McCarthy says about Arroyo in a telephone interview.
"It was my guard."
She protected me."
Mr. McCarthy said Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former police officer of Newark who worked for the Commission for the Control of Alcohol Bedding, and left two children of 14 and 11 years of age, and one sister.
Eileen Walsh, the police officer of the Condado Union, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the detectives are trying to determine whether Mrs Arroyo died due to an unautorised surgery.
"This is one of the possibilities," Walsh stated.
"It's a current research."
The authorities said they reached the house near 3 p.m.
From 21 November and found Mrs Arroyo in a sofa.
It was declared dead at the place.
It has been over a week, and the authorities haven't told about their investigation or the house's duty, called Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh couldn't say if Mrs Castro has been interrogated by the authorities.
The investigators are trying to determine what part of the house was used as medical consultation.
On Thursday, no one answered the door in the house of Mrs Castro, where a marked rock is located in the front of the house, and a dalmate laid on the back.
A blue tank labeled as "ethyl vagina" - used as a substitute for grain in food and perfumes - was found on the door of the car, next to a door that leads to the ground.
Two mountain bikes swimming out of rings on the one side.
Mr. McCarthy said when she came to Newark after 25 years in the police department of New York, Mrs Arroyo was an instant help to know the new island city and its political course.
" she would say, "You have to monitor with this or with that," she said.
" she was always here when I was, and also when not.
It's pregnant."
The Federal Reserve is expected to repair the rates to upgrade the Bolsa
The actions shocked both sides of the Atlantic last after the market expected that the federal reserve calms the credit conditions with rates of interest rates, which increased with the tranquillious comments of the Vice-President of the United States Central Bank.
The bags were shocked in London, New York, and through Europe after Donald Kohn, two of Ben Bernanke's President, stated that policy factors should be "flexible and pragmatic" to respond to the continuing stress of the financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm the markets through growing samples of credit bags, Mr. Kohn said recent turbulence was "in part of market improvement at the end of September and October".
If the trend continued, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments in the financial conditions for real estate and business, said Kohn.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reservation is listed to inject fresh capital in the US markets and to make later shorts of the type of interest to stabilize the credit conditions.
The observations also helped to calm Wall Street through bad news for the United States economy, such as household sales that reached the lower record in October.
The results of the financial turbulence were highlighted by a warning of Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut up 650 jobs, which equates to 4% of its total work, in a global reduction of costs to compensate the loss of their investment in the sub-prior hypothetics of the United States.
Only 20 of these posts are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1.500 people.
In New York, the average industrial average of the Dow Jones was 331 points, or 2.55%, closed to 13.289.40, while the broad S&P 500 was up to 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 was 165.5 points, or 2.7%, closed to 6.306.2, adding more than 39 million sterlin libraries to the value of the first order companys in Britain.
Germany's index was 2.6%, and CAC40 from France was over 2.3%.
Previously, the recovery of the credit tension on the market was highlighted after a strong demand in a three-month fund allocation from the European Central Bank, which considered these loans to European trade banks at 4.7 per cent, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure to the Bank of England to follow the action of the Federal Reserve and the ECB and to inject extra funds in the value markets in London was stressed the credit and rates of the "Libor" loans for three months between the British banks, which means the higher rate since September, of 6.59%, after a permanent slowage from 12 November.
England takes the demands of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
There are two dilemas, each one is so hard as the other.
Who should hit No. 6 by England in Candy this weekend, Oweis Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And no one is less important towards the first test against Sri Lanka, who should take the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the selection, which is in charge with that particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the trainer, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because the Bureau of Hugh Morris, the Director of England, is starting to fill offers to become a national selector, and if not, in a partial time.
Whoever does not get the sixth bathroom will be unfortunate, but life often is injust and sports too.
It's not easy to remove what a man does in the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes by lack of chance more than by capacity.
The election is not only difficult in the crycket, because it is necessary for judgments that are always being subjective.
Is that the right time to Bopara get up?
Is it just for Shah if he does it?
The same question could be done in another way if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good-level levels and that they know the business well, would be promoted to the table: there are only one place for one of them.
Who should say what is a good level for a cricket player, unless it gives the opportunity to shoot or smell the next chance?
The figures, of course, have a great influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
In a team, a cricket player must take the eye of the captain at the same time to take a "wicket" and a battery to get the opportunity to change the order if you want to have an impact as a player any day.
But capture the eye of the selectioners is more complicated.
There were many who have improved the past time, for example, James Anderson, who plays safely in the first test even if Stephen Harmison is declared for "fit and bowls" as the wind in the networks.
Anderson took 32 first kitchens in 33 cars for each one to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 in the same average, but both have had its high moments and can expect more of them.
Shah or Bopara games at the Asgiria Stadium can only be a question of view.
The option can break or make a man's car or may mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each test and did it well in the first, with 5 kits and 40 useful carriage, but Paul Collingwood was struggling to set up the same time that came to become an important player, and despite noting a hundred double against Australia, it can still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after a further discussion on the today's session at the Asgiria Stadium, will follow its conservation instincts and will promote Shah's best experience for the outcome of the young Bopara.
There are arguments for both.
In favour of Shah is its brilliant and valuable testing of the 88 debut in Bombay, 32 centuries of first class before only 6 of Bopara, who, in 22, is seven years older, and has excellent advances against the spin bowling.
But Shah did only ten carriages in his two tours in May against West Indias in the test in Lords, his home as Middlesex player, and this caused an immediate rejection of the selectioners when Vaughan called his place for the next meeting, seemed to have taken from his "batting" something elan in Bombay.
On the contrary, the Essex team has joy to live in swords.
He takes nothing in the cricket field and his attitude was summarised as when he flyed his vehicle in an exhibition for the English car patronator, Volkswagen.
He suffered less importance and, presumably, a shock, but the first thing he did was to get out his Vodafone (patrocinated, of course) and to call Alastair Cook, his team team that looked at the distance, to tell him with excitation: "Have you seen that?".
Bopara is the best player, it is included your rebalade step to have effects on your games that seem to be satisfied because it bathes with confidence and ability.
Select the right man is one thing, choose the best moment, another.
Maybe that is the true art of the selection.
My inclination would give Bopara your chance, which does not mean that Shah doesn't overcome, as they suggest the tea sheets, is he who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and fight against Al-Qaeda
The first bus with Syrian refugees began to reach Bagdad yesterday, expulsing the exiles who remained without effectiveness, without expansion of the visa and who expected that the city returns to normality.
Some even had returned to fight against warriors who led them out of their homes.
In Mansour's bus station, even before 800 people from Damasco arrived in a official port of the government composed of a twelve of buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned to private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Bagdad," says Sabah al-Qubasi, Sunday doctor.
"I returned today for what I saw on the TV and what I read in the newspapers, about what happened in Bagdad, and that's safe now."
" They say that the army of Mahdi left killing people," says, referring to the Chief Military of the religious warrior Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops a momentum cease.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old teenager and professor in Amariah's sun zone, returned with his two children because it was impossible to renew their visa in Syria because the regime did not want Iraqi working in their country.
His neighbors in Amariyaah called him by phone to tell him that a membership of the U.S. helped to get Al-Qaeda out of his bastion to the west of the capital, and they called it to return.
One of the newly arrived from Jordan was the chief of a Sunday and Chita tribe who had been conducted from their home to Sleikh north of Bagdad, by a graaf attack, after he urged the citizens to stand against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"Third two days, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and my companions."
"There is why I returned today," Sabaah Alu Obeidi said, 62 years old.
Many have said to be shocked by the growing calm in the capital since the United States troops engaged in groups of "feared citizens", armed and working in cooperation with the United States military to defend their neighbourhoods.
But many declared that they returned to the denition of the visa and the lack of money in Damasco, where more than 1.3 million Iraqi were established in the past years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51 years of age and father of three children, urged the common suspicion between the exiliates, Nouri al-Maliki, the Chief Prime Minister, requested the Syrian government to impose restrictions to refugees' visa to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe that they have gone out of the country because of the sectile death quarters.
"We were good until Al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the Government to let the Iraqi faces to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunday.
"I can't believe in a government that supports criminals who burned my house after I left her."
It is part of the reason for the stop of violence that the sunists have been expulsed from the Chinese and viceversary areas, relaxing the tension.
There is fear that a oiled floor of refugees will re-establish the secular tensions and start the fight.
The small Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even brilliant by the international orientation of its higher schools.
As in the whole country, the Syrians have no education only.
"Here I explained for fifty times to a non-Sirlandian who aren't French," that was the iranic motive on himself from the smallest federal state for its fifty-year-old.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg have a great role in the Sarre educational system, which in a study of the German Economy Institute (IW) called "Implanter" occupied the fifth place.
Thus, higher schools in tradition have good relationship with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was funding in 1948 by French.
To this day students can end their university care with two or three diplomas.
As a result, the percentage of foreign students is 15.6 percent.
However, the number of students from Sarre is higher than the average in higher schools.
"In the Sarre the professional education system is used," says Axel Plunnecke, the educational experts in the Almanian Economy Institute (IW).
More than five young people make their bachelor at the Professional School, so that Sarre is 7 percent above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety is very wide.
The offering of dual carriages, in relation to the population number, is the second best in Germany.
Despite the practical vocational training and a growing demand, the number of technician sciences in the last few years slowed a third.
This was the reason why the Minister of Education of Sarre forced higher schools to make more advertising for Engineering sciences.
"On the first study of PISA, we performed some reforms in general education schools," said a portal of the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the Government introduced comparative evidence throughout the country.
In order to start studying the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr", children have no cost. While this model also imitate the other federal states.
The comparison with the following studies will show whether it has increased the performance of students.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of students delayed in school development reduced from 29 to 20 percent.
But in general, Sarre did not improve as well as other federal states.
In Baviera, students know to calculate better.
For the disappointment of the Syrians, the PISA report does not compare the knowledge of the foreign languages, although in this field they could achieve good results.
Although the Syrians are not French, the language of neighbors is a binding assignment in the Secondary Education Institutes.
Chávez changes the time.
Next in Venezuela, there will be another hour different than the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez left to change the time in the South American country by delaying the average hour.
Currently, Chávez is as a chemist in Spain.
As noted by the Official Bulletin of the Venice State, according to the new law, the hour will pass at least four hours.
Thus, the South American country will have a time shock that does not exist in any other country of the world.
Among other things, Chavez, as the enemy of the United States, justifys their decision by saying that the United States will take the world's obligation to change a full time.
In addition, Thursday (local time) Chávez announced the breakdown of relations with its neighbouring Columbia because of the action of rehens.
The left nationalist said he would not keep any relationship with the head of State or with the Colombian government until Alvaro Uribe continued to be the President of Colombia.
"My dignity does not allow me to do this," said Chavez, which is promoting a constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil country must decide Sunday in a referendum.
With this reform, its power could be sufficiently extended in the country.
The reason for the conflict was the decision taken by Uribe when removing Chávez's mandate in negotiations with the marxist guerrille in which it was the release of rehenses.
Thursday, Chávez criticized that the decision taken by Uribe has infringed Venezuela.
It is also much about Chavez in Spain.
A new ton of call causes feeling in the country: "Why do you not walk?" is the phrase that already downloaded a half million people.
This phrase stated the king of Spain that it was terrible for the continued interruptions by the left populations at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007, the reduction of the real wage threat to the Germans was reduced.
According to a prognostic, this year a reduction of real wage threats to German employees, despite a strong conjunction.
Experts present a large number of reasons for a pessist prognostic.
In accordance with the calculations of the Hans Böckler Foundation, German employees should contain in 2007 with a real salary account lower than the previous year.
"The fault of this is the weak evolution of salary, increased tax on the value added and the style of food and energy prices," reported Gustav Horn of the Macroeconomic Institute and Economic cycles.
New unemployment insurance loads can also correspond to employees.
The Minister of Finance Peter Setinbrück said to the newspaper "New Ostanbrücker Zeitung", which was given to the current situation, the intention of reduce the unemployment insurance load of a 3,3% by one year to another, is fair and reasonable.
Of course, the work office must not be put again in a unpleasant situation, requesting credits and subventions to the Federal State, according to the words of a political social-democratic party.
The march was public that inflation rates with price explosion in the food sector and oil derivative sector had reached the highest level for 13 years.
In comparison with the prices in the past year, these are increased by 3 %.
Venus: A gemele brother of the earth.
Despite its atmosphere is not appropriate for life, Venus is the most similar to the Earth, something that has not yet been drawn up. The European "Venus Express" audio has discovered rays in the atmosphere and remolinns on the pools, the same as the winter in the earth.
For three decades, the investigators were suspected that they could exist radars in Venus.
But now the European survey has brought new tests: he discovered electrical waves at the edge of the atmosphere. In Venus, the rays run a height of 54 km from a cloud and behind the other, the account of Cris Russell from the University of California at Los Angeles to the scientific magazine "Natura".
According to the famous model of the origin of Urey-Miller’s life, the rays caused life on earth: the storms could have caused reactions in the ocean that, on their part, had originated amino acids that are the basic components of life.
In Venus isn't that: if any day had lived there, that would be in one of the first evolution states," Sean Solomon explains the Carnegie Institute of Washington.
Today, on the surface of Venus can not have life: the atmosphere pressure is almost 100 times higher than the earth and on the surface regnates temperatures of 500°C, so that temperatures can be reached under zero.
"Possiblely, Venus is a giant "diabetic" of the earth, but it is still a gemeel," said Russell.
The main objective of the "Venus Express" mission is to answer the question why Venus, such as the Earth for its masses and size, has had such a different evolution.
As since the ninety-five had no special missions, only for research of this planet, the launching of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for Venus' research.
The last results of the investigations to be presented in many "Natura" articles, according to the investigators’ opinion, are not only stressed by Venus' unity in the Solar System.
"This also shows that neighbor planets have more common features with the Earth of which we had certainly been", reports the ESA.
Despite the slowly known winds in the North Pole, researchers found in the Polar region also a voltice formed by the clouds that turns faster.
This phenomenon recalls the wind flows in the high earthquakes of the pools, according to a team of Joseph Piccioni of the Italian Astrophysics and Space Physical Institute.
The second planet of the Solar system has almost the massa equal to the Earth and its equivalent diameter of 12.000 km results almost so large.
This planet is also called alba star or evening star around the sun nearly 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: one day in Venus equals 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and its atmospheric pressure of 92 bars is not much at the Earth, scientists are part of the basis that both planets had been formed in the same conditions.
In the two planets, water was gloomed on earth in the oceans, but in Venus was discovered in the universe.
While the carbon dioxide was converted into carbon stones on the earth, in Venus the majority of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's mixture with Dalai Lama.
The Federal President Koehler insists on the end of the battle between the parties by the Reception of Dalai Lama in the Federal Chairmanship.
He indirectly criticized the German Social-Democratic Party for its attacks to the Federal Canciller after the mitin in September.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, was concerned about the reputation of Germany and therefore requested that the great coalition ended this battle for the receipt of Dalai Lama.
"In this case, we should not present us as a shared UNA nation," said Koehler to the journal "Handelsblatt " .
At the same time, Koehler showed its understanding about the receipt of Dalai Lama by Angella Merkel (Democratic Union Party) in September.
"I have a great respect to the difference between cultures, human rights are absolutely safe for me," said Koehler.
Everyone knows that Germany must act with a great balance in putting out the foreign policy, emphasizes the Federal President, defending Merkel for the reproach that he received when implementing a new policy with China.
"The Federal Canceller did not take the distance of the traditional China policy course.
China also knows it," Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Minister for Foreign Affairs (Social-Democratic Party), had shown its disappointment indirectly because of Dalai Lama's receipt, and because of that, the members of the Union were attacked.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its inoperative policy in external matters.
The receipt of Dalai Lama in the Federal Cancillery caused great incomprehension in Chinese-aleman relations.
Thus, the Chinese Government has not only removed the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social-Democratic Party), Germany's Minister of Finance, but also, according to the informal sources of the magazine “Spiegel”, conveyed the called strategic dialogue of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs in both countries.
Wen Jiabao, Chief of China, requested the Federal Canceller Angela Merkel to recognize this receipt of Dalai Lama as an error.
Reaffirming China's position, Wen Jiabao said that China would not accept European politicians to receive the religious leader of the Tibetians in their official position.
The actions and words of Dalai Lama showed that they are trying to divide the Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now includes other provinces.
Schauble warns that disorders like those occurred in France will be produced.
Battles with the police on the streets, fires, car shoots: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that disorders will be produced as the case of France.
The Federal Minister requires that the social insatisfaction in Germany may not be transferred to the streets.
Barricates were made, the Valentines shooted with police shooting: after serious disorders protagonized by young people in France, the Federal Minister of Interior, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Part of the Democratic Union) fears similar trends in Germany.
"We have to set TAMBIEN in that social problems in our country do not take the violent form."
"It's what we need to take it seriously," said the newspaper "New Presse", published in Hannover.
Not all youths are developed in the constant change of social reality.
The Federal State, federal states and municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, said Shaeuble.
This is not only the integration of immigrants.
"Dead of the Integration Summit to the Conference of Islam: all this is already given its first fruits."
It's still early to sit down the end of the alarm.
At the same time, Schaeuble indicated that German suburbs do not have the same constructive and socioological problems as that happens in France.
Young people struggled serious disorders on the streets with the police north of Paris last night.
In Tolouse, also shooted public cars and buildings.
Kenan Kolat, President of the Turkish Community in Germany, requested more efforts from the Federal Government for integration.
Colat, in view of the disorders in France, warns a imitator effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, actions are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the parity index between young people of foreign origin under 25 years is higher than the average.
There are more jobs for vocational training.
Kolat emphasizes: "We have to give younger perspective."
The President of the Turkish Community added that there is a large social control in the family in Germany more than in France than in France.
In addition, most foreign youths do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat thinks: "But, however, we have to be careful."
Young people need to receive a job or vocational training more quickly.
While the evening in the Paris suburb Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of police participated in the action, a helicopter with doing so overlooked the territory.
The responsible authorities informed three arrests, as well as of shooting cars and shooting cars.
Since the previous day, a team of almost 1000 police are employed in security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, Minister of Interior, announced that the police would take rigorous measures until it was necessary.
The Monday night around 80 police were injured by disorders in Villiers-le-Bel.
The disorders continued next night in Tolouse.
The disorder began by a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young people died.
According to the information provided by the fiscality, the death of young people was not due to the police.
In the Kingdom of Angela Wolke.
The very far from the reality of the Federal Canceller shows that coalition on content has come to its last point and that there is no need to wait for anything more than it.
But what country really lives the Canciller?
After its unexpected, unreasonable and unreasonable action in the general debate of the Baja House, it must be said: it does not live in the country that would be ruled by it.
The Canciller rejected it with a presumable phrase on the reproof that he had been reiterately dedicated to action in external policy.
He said that would be a provincial way and thus showed that he did not want to understand what is interested in the critics.
In the Baja House, it was very clearly declared to everyone that this reproach was appropriate.
I couldn't feel any interest or no feeling for the problems of the country.
But instead of that, Angela Wolke was presented in this way: a very high policy that runs in the external policy and remains there without any concrete achievement.
One example: prevention of climate change: it has been much blessed by the decisions taken in Heiligendamm, but it does not say anything about how these objectives should be achieved here in climate issues.
In general, this way, for two years, has not been allowed the Chief of the Democratic Union Party for himself.
So it is put into expressions to make people move.
And in this way, it hurts its public image by the pragmatic concept with which it resolves the problems without going through the branches.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke, internal problems are low-value appearances.
Children ' s poverty and concern for workers with low salary?
The only dedication is to talk about this topic using subordinated prayers.
It is impressive how many times the conversation is wrong when it is about the supplement for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to make a more or less good phrase.
It started to be "come if it had been in an unknown territory", when it was more specific.
The section of attacks.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, faced a valuable debate on YouTube presidential precautions and should now be afraid only a candidate from the outside.
The tensions between candidates are already noted since the beginning.
Mitt Romney reproved his adversary Rudy Giuliani that this would have converted to New York to "a refugee site for illegal immigrants".
This answered with serious reproachs: "I would like to say that his own house was a "port" for the illegal."Juliani responded to the ex-governeur of Massachusetts, saying that he was who had employed illegal immigrants without role.
Candidates have attacks: as until now the Republican group does not have a clear favour, the eight presidential precautions use the debate in the CNN, especially to disfellowship their opposites.
The small videos from 30 seconds, rounded by Internet users that were sent to Youtube, also have not much content.
"With this way we let Hitler reach the power," was John McCain's reproach to his adversary Ron Paul, the only meeting that insisted to immediately remove the Iraqi troops.
Romney also acknowledges many critics by the veterans of the war in Vietnam, when it refuses to recognise the " Waterboarding ", a questionnaire method, by allowing a person to die.
The public reactions in the room in St. Petersburg in Florida show that while the most important topics of the campaign are not only the war in Iraq or the discussions on torture.
The public always appealed very strong when they swallowed the conservative values and refused the slowdown of taxes.
So you can see better where both favorites' weaknesses are.
"In that time I was wrong," Romney acknowledged and asked for forgiveness to people and television public for being abortion defender in 1994.
On the contrary, Giuliani did not know what to say when they asked him what I thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time, Musharraf goblished without uniform.
One day after his departure as the chief of the army, the President of Pakistan was pleaded as President.
This ends the eight years of military government in Pakistan.
Thursday, Pervez Musharraf, President of Pakistan, took a plea for a second 5-year-old mandate.
The Pakistani television directly transmitted the ceremony to the presidential Palacio in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf pleaded to respect the constitution and act for the well-being of the nation.
Thursday, his army chief mandate was transferred to his confidence Ashfaq Kiyani, and thus accepted international pressure, especially by the United States.
Eight years after the power would be done with an incredible military shock, the former general government for the first time as civil leader.
With his renunciation to the Chief of the Armed Forces, Musharraf complied the main condition of opposition and western.
The other requirement is the end of the state of exception, which was declared by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayum, the general fiscal of the state, after the Moharraf jury is going to very quickly cancelle the state of exception and will comply with the second condition of the West.
Since the Supreme Court had been proclaimed a state of exception, there were many party lawyers from Musharraf. Last week the Supreme Court of the country rejected all the resources before the conversed new elections of the head of the Government on 6 October.
While, in an attention to an army gate in the North Watistan region, five soldiers died and four other were blessed.
According to the army porter, a bomb was explosed in one of the streets in the border with Afghanistan.
Return the founders of Krautrock.
The famous German band of the 70s continues to work: three members of "harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a reestern was made a copy of "Live 1974", which was written at the best time of the band.
In those times, they were very famous in foreign countries.
The assistance of these three ladies to a official food caused the feeling.
Each of them has their cages, cables and above all their bottles.
In the middle, Deter Moebius is sit down with 63 years and is clothed with a white shop.
His left is Michael Rother of 57 years old, who has his portable computer and guitar.
Right, looking at the audit, Hans-Joachim Rodelius is 73 years old, which is very occupated with the control panel.
Each one contributes with his sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a part of music.
Looks like this doesn't hurt the ladies.
It was a very exciting thing for Krautrock's appointments that the Harmonia band returned to make music.
What we need to rebuild here is the following: the specific questions have shown that the name of the band was back in the mind of people, but it was not so special that after 32 years the public would be so strange.
But why are Germans not also able to please their lively legend of the seventy years?
In particular, because the Equiptor Krautrock was always more valued in England and the United States than in its own country.
When the entertainment industry granted a "Echo" music prize to the members of the Can 2003 band in Colombia for his life work, in the room the surprised faces of German pop artists could be seen.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the La Düsseldorf and New! band, they all opened the mouth with a strange.
Later Michael Rother passed time at the scenario during the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts like if he was a old friend (of the band).
Ignorance in its country and recognition in the foreign is one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the triumph has only existed two years and in those times I have not achieved a great impact on the public, but I have received it later thanks to others.
A long time ago Moebius and Roedelius had music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, who promised a lot of famous.
At the beginning they touched in the garden of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was patronized by a church.
During a time, Rother had an energetic worker and then worked as a guitarist in the New band! He made it possible to improve the famous German band's fame that in those days was too radical.
In 1973, Rother followed Cluster's musicians in the exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, who is a ruin of the 17th century, lived as refugees of the city.
The life mode was less ideological than in the Common I, where Roedelius could have been left from his position.
That was better a life of an artist full of surprises.
According to them, one day there was an Harmonia channel of Ottenstein's song association in the pool, which resulted in being a good name for art.
There were also deventures in the use of the name Harmonia.
The first album was called "Music from Harmonia" and the second "De Lux".
Although music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as artist was not only to meet himself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert in Greece. Somebody remembers that almost 50 people were involved in this recording.
Then Rother expressed his desire to propulse Harmonia and to do again when tests.
For Roedelius and Moebius this requirement is against the habits.
In 1975 the band announces its separation.
Rother ended into the topics of esoterism and ensured its existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived the eighth years and since that time he had more success than I had Harmonia.
The direct recording of the album in Griessmer, that's the need to thank Greenemeyer.
Your Greenland music company was as a goal to cultivate this German own contribution to maintain it as life music.
As the work of Roedelius, also the New band! was again discovery.
The presentation of Harmonia as a band is located in the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidied with public measures of the Wordtronics festival.
There is Julian Cope, English, old punk and the author of the "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the Dr. Motte, the Loveparade manufacturer.
Thus, all the influences of Krautrock on the next pop music are present.
Harmonia takes the position of a super bath, a place that was empty.
Brian Eno's phrase accompanied with the special music filles the room: "This music is the only true music, she belongs to the future."
There are pictures where Harmonia appears with producers in a finish.
The history of the Legend development is shown in the projections of white and black photos, where instruments are seen with cables.
There are three veterinaries that have started to reprove again.
They do nothing more than fixed microphones to the organ and the battery so that they could produce extraordinary tones with the help of effect devices that had built with their own hands.
Electronic music is like it should be.
Three people who develop in the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under Barbara morningster’s address, in a musical environment, it is sweet and at a good moment of enthusiasm is sing "Aaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a term of English origin.
But it was never a rock.
It was not searched for gender origin in the blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or away from the art and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever here crys "68!" also has right, but now Harmonia keeps calm.
In the scenario it is very well reflected on what is already clear.
Where begins and where's the music ending?
This can break one the nerves or give a fast moment of luck.
Richard Gere's only lacking cynism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moderary Peace" are again dedicated to the war in the Balkans.
But the two weren't very convinced.
Or concepts are fixed too much in actions and shoots, or the two films are too emocioning.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can not help in this case.
At the beginning there was a good news: Karadzic and Mladic, war criminals, continue to hide themselves in the mountain of the Balkans, but exactly there, in the dark inside of the country during the Bosnian war, the actor Richard Gere was recovered again.
Finally, we had lost view of the most wide man in the 80s, because no one wanted to see it after their pleasant and little importance in the films for women and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important argument to see the film "The Hunting Party" when a caster becomes what he continues" (Why today the titles of the films must be so long and shooted?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the view: on the ground, his reporter's role in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if the destination and industry of the cinema had not been so mercyful with him. He was a man whose best times of life had already been, that as a monument of his decadence had to remain until now the majority of his attraction.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, together with "Moerderiserer Peace" which is German production and will also be presented this week, results in only a series of films without success on war in the Balkans.
It can be narrowed by the film "Moerderiser Peace" in a few words: it is two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serbia of Kosovo's francotors, one of them acts very quickly, and that also leads it to love it.
The sense of the film is lost by actions and shooters, although we celebrate that Serbias are not submitted once again as the only guilty.
The film is like the German series "Alarm fire Cobra 11" without autopsy, but in war situation.
The Hunting Party can be investigated, because there was never a good film on war in the Balkans.
On another occasion, with another director and another guyon author (Richard Shepard in two charges), the history of the American reporters in the war that will be to detect a criminal war serbia called "sorcer" may probably be a new "Apocalypse Now".
So, the stories are amazingly similar: the small teams go to the mountain two times to carry out something that can't do the army and always result in a loose journey.
A reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when at the beginning they present us to Simon Hunt, whom he won't just be a cynico with heart.
No, the guide also provides a loving adventure with a Muslim bosnia that will kill it later.
Then "The Hunting Party" is very far from the reality, especially when in the past five minutes the reporters with a prestigious rapidity achieved what they couldn't achieve for five years the NATO, the CIA and all the head casters of the world, which was captured the war criminal and left them to the Muslim Bosnians in a fair way.
It's so bad, that you want to appeal to the international court in the Hague based on crimes against cinema logical.
However, the purpose of the film is, in fact, a deep human.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karadśi and Mladiś are still free, and highlights that Americans and French are not really worried to follow them because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes good and bad are so similar, so that one comes to the head a very famous poem of Brecht.
In this poem it is a mask of a Asian demon: "In the great shocks of his front, shared the feelings with him, it is hard to be bad."
In films like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they show that hard is being good.
The problem is not only the gender of war films in the Balkans.
Shortly in a newspaper published that all the films on Iraq produced in Hollywood are fascinated.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film on South Africa.
Always there is a rule: when a star is placed by a crisis region or by the mines fields, then something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arguette, "Other the other part of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Directs of Blood" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Maybe all these conflicts occurred in a short time space.
They have to pass at least decades until Hollywood runs a good film on the holocaust, with the "The List of Schindler".
Some films need more time. Classical works like war works in Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in their times were not one-time celebrated by master works.
Today, we may be too sit too much about global conflicts, and therefore in our times every killing (Massenmord) is presented directly in two home televisions.
And that's because the guion authors do not have the smallest repair (which is necessary for power) to sing good stories.
"Ser or not be" or "The great dictator" resulted at the end so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not even know that so bad was the nazi regime.
Maybe it wasn't a good person to run a film.
Perhaps it must be like the newslist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant view of a artist.
When they asked him about the paralelisms between his new historical "Lemprière Dictionary" and the war in the Balkans, he said, "This should only be to some things never changed."
The great cities will always be in danger, men will always be cruelly murdered and in Yugoslavia will always reigne war.
From Beaust receives the negative criticism on the Olympic Games as a response.
Hamburg has received many critics from the policy and economics because of not requesting the Olympic Games in the summer.
Many want to continue fighting for competitions in the aquatic sport section.
But Beaust remembers that it must be realistic when estimating the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, Director-General of the Hamburg Trade Camera, expressed this renumber as "not good for economic loan".
Last time no other project in the great city promoted such motivation as the idea of the organization of Olympic Games.
"No this goal could not be maintained the political impulse, sporting at the same level."
Schmidt-Trenz requested the senate not forget this project, but finds a new long-term application "what refers to another time".
On Monday, Ole van Beaust held his statements that the ambitions of Hamburg in the Song Olympic Games were not performed at least 2028.
"Hambourg does not decide on the request for the Olympic Games, but decides the Almanian Federation of Olympic Sports," says Van Beust in the WELT ONLINE.
He sent the decision of the Sports Federation (Sportbond) expected at the beginning of December on the request of Munich for the Olympic Games of Winter 2028.
"This preference means for us that in this period of time, which until now we thought we had up to 2028, from realistic point of view we will not have any opportunity."
Despite all, this dream did not end forever, said by Beust.
The Hamburg Sport Federation (HSB) regrets the statements of Van Beut.
This makes the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to ask Olympic Games.
"It's too fast to leave the opportunity, if the plans are now broken," said the Sunter Ploß, director of HSB.
A rejection of the request is contrary to the declaration of the senate who had been made in a receipt due to the general meeting of the German Public Federation for Sports of High Schools (adh).
There van Beaust designed the request from Hamburg for universities in 2015 not as "a substitution" of the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only the last week the Sport Federation of High Schools named Hamburg as a candidate to the request.
The German Social-Democratic Party Group (SPD-Bürgerschafts Group) repressed the Senate that he would not use such a valuable time for the construction of houses in Hamburg.
"The Senate was late for many years with the development of the small barrier of Grasbrook, because it was in plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses," said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, deputy of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always requested an integrated Olympic planning for the small Grasbrook and then the use of the building houses, the DDC stressed the importance of entertainment.
At that time, the request of Hamburg for the Olympic Games of the summer 2012 caused a great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not the tree boxes.
Who relates to Sweden' terms and wood box, thinks in Ikea, but don't think about Andy Warhol.
Yeah?
Currently, the wood boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on the Warhol's work list.
Most of the ninety and four Brillo-Box "type" of this list are false.
After some months ago, the Swedish "Expressen" newspaper questioned the authenticity of Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol, the modern Museum of Stockholm conducted internal investigations and arrived to deceptive conclusions: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former director of the Museo Pontus Hultén gave the modern Museum, are false, and almost one hundred of the other "type Stockholm", which are in circulation in the international art market, also results.
The prehistory is too complicated with a confused relationship between artistics and patrocinated productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted the red, blue and white wood boxes, with the same sample that they had jabon powder cards "Brillo".
According to Warhol, in the exhibition of 1968's works in the modern Museum, hundreds of cards were exhibited by Warhol. They did not make them Warhol (for expenditures), but were taken directly from the "Brillo" card factory.
It was not art works, but examples (which was only some of the objects) exposed.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed to produce a few wood boxes in Sweden but were not exposed to the modern Museum.
Witness of those times now speak that almost 15 boxes, which in that time entered into the history of art and substances as original of the "Brillo-Boxes" of "Stocolmo type" authorized by Andy Warhol.
Some of them were purchased for more than $1000,000.
The problem is that after the famous director of the museum Pontus Hultén would make false statements that in Sweden in 1968 were produced and exposed almost a hundred of the tree boxes that Warhol left them to him.
But in fact, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and for exhibition in San Petersburg.
In that time Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, the chief of the modern Museum conservators, invested six Brillo-Boxes of the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. First they were printed and shooted their swimming plates and then pinted them to the oil with the pincel.
On the contrary, the structure of the copy of the 1990 ’ s shows that the painting was applied with a wheel without printing directly the flat plates. Furthermore, it is not the painting on oil, but the acrylic painting.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official Brillo-Boxes list of Andy Warhol," says Lars Nittve, director of the modern Museum, and adds that if the Commission of Authentication "Andy Warhol Art" in New York will not reach any conclusion, the modern Museum will classify these six boxes such as the copies/objects of exposure."
In July, the Commission of Authentication announced formally that it accepted these "creat accusions" in which it is jabon powder boxes.
But since that time, everything remained absolutely silent.
