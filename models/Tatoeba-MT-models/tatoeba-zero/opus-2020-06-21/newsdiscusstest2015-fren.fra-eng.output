The remainers of UKIP who refuse those who live with HIV are a perfect example.
You are talking about when Nigel Farage says that the NHS must not serve to pay for those coming to the United Kingdom to make health tourism, and when, with this in mind, he answers Yes, when the interviewer specifically asks if people live with HIV are included in unwanted people.
First, you will use specific arguments, then discrete them by a widespread homophobia.
Each time I or my family need the NHS, we need to do the skin behind intolerants to chronic hypocondry that thinks they're all supposed.
I think you are using specific arguments.
The health tourism, as defined by the right rings, does not exist practically.
I think this is what the democracy is called.
So no one would be affected by UKIP measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
There is only in the parallel UKIP universe that Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A torchon quote is not a proof.
Yes, then get out of the messager.
The Mail did not write the report, but commented it.
Those who control the majority of media in this country should be shocked to promote such a popular propaganda as the reality.
I don't think you know what's a specific argument.
You don't know any of my personal situation or my identity, so you should be careful when you tried to kill the debate by accusations of homophobia.
The Phare's phrase was very surprised, but only because we are talking about this problem so rarely.
He did not absolutely have any homophobe comments.
You'll have to be able to get it back.
I'm not sure where you want to come, but I think you don't like when media talk about what you don't like.
It is speaking so rarly because in contrast to Farage and his blind disciples of Thatcher, who think that AIDS and inhumanities are a sign of God, and not a reflection of their own incapacity to understand that the complexities of humanity are something good, then not.
Finally, the situation is also in Ireland and in Spain.
With the new crisis that arrives in the period of austerity, nothing will be arranged.
Waiting almost 5% of growth in 2015 is a great deal.
Ireland's 'TIGRE' of the EUROPE' was worth us, there are some mothers.
We've known the suite!
This reiterates to read the article.
It is tried to believe that Ireland is a green country and that a 'New ECONOMIC ' is being produced.
With the Brussels Agreement, taxes on the lowest societys in Europe, a three-speak job walk, an immigration that continues.
With these ingredients not to 'pavoter' for the moment with the coming of the Polandians.
In the 1980s of the twenty-seventh Sea, Ireland was one of the poorest countries in the European Union, with Portugal, considering a constant permission, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
Greece was before.
Their development was not a long tranquille river, which is in view of recent events.
The lackest impossions in Europe?
That's wrong!
Latvia has a tax rate of 0% on businesses.
There is now a real hypocrisis in France from the policy on impositions that multinationals really pay.
If there is a report issued in 2008 or 2009, they pay less than 5% in France in general.
Only the SMEs pay full-pot.
Now I confirm that road traffic has become a huge, and there are new cars (and chere) with all the street coins, exactly as before the 2008 crisis.
I lived in Dublin for 14 years, it is obvious in daily legs since the retreat.
Is it supposed to be the economic news?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will soon be slow.
In another article that they are in writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in an A140 accommodation.
Do Ryanair now have to transfer passengers from a flight to the other way?
I think Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a new fleet of devices, so a few boss and rays on the older ones will soon be forgotten.
This is what I want to be with him next week, so I hope that it will not be on one of these two once smiling.
So it would be completely the mistake of the other pilot.
Has Ryanair paid a supplement to passengers for the additional fear we wanted to provide them?
But without such an Irish business, you couldn't allow you to leave in holidays, young man
I never took Ryanair and the last three times I took the flight was with the BA.
I prefer when the airline offers a quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, then they can give it joy.
Any article on Ryanair starts decades of comments of people who would never take Ryanair to the place of those who love to take Ryanair and think that those who pay other things than the basic tariff have only to take themselves, etc.
It's enough transparent.
Ryanair will not be satisfied with additional costs for this incident.
I ask what the delays will be, and if the passengers are going to be compensated, and if so, if Ryanair will avoid paying, saying that it was an error of the airport controllers.
The passengers were put into another aircraft less than one hour, they have no right to compensation.
I'm sorry to deceive you and your dreams of immunization.
Welcome to this British Airway flight that brings English ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Good journey
Last Wednesday in Paris, the street of the Francs-Buurgeois: Marais is in most parts of the peak, and a large world's literature.
People don't come in mass for the quality of restaurants (queconques for most) or for the Revision Hall at the White-Mantal Space (hyper-intelligent and slightly poor).
The reason for this multitude is that the shops are all open and that the neighbor is incredibly living and animated.
With many foreigners that depend...
Do you think the opening of Sunday will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where businesses are open on Sunday, worldwide with 50% of tourists.
@aloes Fals!
The only argument that seems to me is that of the areas receiving a significant number of foreign tourists and it is disappointed by the fact that they buy in detachment.
Tourism areas lose a significant number of business rates each year for the same reasons .
Returns the industry where costful equipment operated on Sunday, they allow prices to reduce.
Dominical rest is a right to benefit, except the employees.
That is why it is planned and regulated by the Labour Code.
Nor the minister of Economy, nor the other, the foreign affairs, have the lack of competence to reform the work code.
Then they're gonna cut it out.
What does the law serve?
A part of the population and enterprises who want to work on Sunday is satisfied.
To Montreal Sunday, I take my little kids to the municipal library.
In my Villa of 30000 people where I live in France the municipal library is opened for 4 days per week, but not for us!
That's the access to culture...
And this is also the regulation of time of work.
the life mode he defended with tennacy against fascism
the life mode that he defended with tenacity against fascism and bolchevism
And if her daughter's success was, against his will, used to pay success fees?
There are paintings.
Some are good, others are not horrible.
Uncertainly, his succession would like its part of the kitchen, if you pass the expression.
its preference for a victory of nationalists/Franco in Spanish civil war...
And its hostility in the independence of lands such as Ireland and India and his fascist ideas in their whole, and also add its well-known hatred of Jews.
Churchill wasn't perfect.
It's not me anymore.
But for five years, and only for five years, he was perfect.
In 1940 he held his head to the other government aristories who wanted to discuss a “concord” with the Nazis, and he was very able to win.
Thanks to his magnificent and energy reactor, he has joined the country in the idea to fight fascists was the only way to win.
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom, and of France, and of Belgium and, finally, the whole world can thank God for having had been during these five years, just these five years, Churchill at the bar and no other.
The majority of Churchill has nothing to see with this debate.
That its descendants sell the pictures on the free market to gather the money of successive fees, they could even benefit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, they gather the money to buy it.
It's so simple as that.
But we could use tax money.
No one can remember that when it was “the moment of truth, ” the personality of Churchill was a positive advantage for his country during the Second World War.
The internal market relaxation by public works will only promote major companies that will increase their dividends by avoiding employer, infrastructure chainers are a little renewable definition.
As regards the social reforms prescribed by the Minister, they well reflect the actual franchise evil: the infidelity towards the dialogue
Return to the principles.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
That the weakest of us is not in the need!
We are so solidly at his help, or he has DROIT in exchange of services that he provides or made a minimum of resources.
The SM40H I prefer to smic corresponds to this vision.
There is also the dancer who lives income from its properties.
There must be a difference in the one who invests for a return at the time of his retirement and who lives from his interests.
A good to loat two for a couple above, it's vice
The small genius of the Finance is uniquely lacking imagination.
The new deal was a policy of great work, but at a time of care in major infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and in France, this is not the case.
Developed countries are exceededed.
The need for infrastructure is, therefore, marginal, a new deal could be a solution.
Only a time when the question of decrease emerges in response to a recession which is only a brutal decrease.
You would have been right 30 years ago: more (or opportunities) of barge, carbon mines, authors...
But if you want to make the future climate-energy shock, then the need for investment is creating: isolation, renewal of the rail network, urban transport, transport and energy storage etc.
A fiscality that promotes high income and residents.
Who's the power?
It was obsessed by smartphones.
Charles Arthur is really a galopin.
Samsung's benefits are made bad by iPhone 6 and its competitors in the same range
A half-seventh introduction by AppleTM of larger screens for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have seized buyers who wouldn't buy a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and decided for the GG3.
So Samsung lost me as a customer, but not with Apple's benefit.
I think it's essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft established this philosophy, we have known a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We need to have several dynamic platforms to stimulate competition and development.
In addition, we all have different needs and can't be satisfied by one manufacturer because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I love their sub-jacent philosophy and I appreciate the design.
Some people do not acquire any value to design, for them options, functionality and prices.
There's nothing bad about this.
Stop looking for "a better platform".
Is there "a better car constructor", not really, they are different but likely.
I would like to see a flowering portable industry with radically different approaches for people and markets.
It's more healthy and must be encouraged.
This is our interest in all.
I am glad you have found exactly what you're looking for and that it's not a Apple product, even if I did a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhones.
Our opposite friends who, according to one of them, fight the ideas and not the men (not the other than the Paris boxes), could tell us about what authors are going to fight on gender ideas and to show us the books they are just listening to fighting.
Or are they attacking just as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Actual Values?
Their sources are Judith Butler or Eric Zemour?
Well, Jean, I love you well, and you're a skilled and cult.
I told this about Judith in the vengeance of Furusato, evocating Holopherne, which was not coming to me (I didn't have his life of mind).
If not, in the "fund" because you return it, this issue does not interest me, and sincerely I don't see where the problem is: I hope that you and your friends could get me out of my rise, because I'm late but I understand well...
@John: Recognize that, culturally, Judith returns to Holopherne.
Who's afraid to ask the World?
But what are we afraid those who are afraid?
Furasato and @ give us answer elements.
The first by calling the Bible Judge, the second qualified Judith Butler of very symbolic gorge.
You see how close these studies touch their homes.
Of course we are no longer in the debate of the idea.
It's another thing, well deep.
@Have you read, Jean, what did the World publish a article on the need of the theology?
@: With regard to a discussion of idea, I thought he had to go to sources.
To fight ideas from the only exhibition that they do with their detractors (Cardinal Ratzinger, the inventor of Genre Theorie or X Lacrox, theological) does not seem very strict.
But good, as I explained to our hump-frontist friend, it's the whole difference between having a clear view and a simple view.
I'm not in the other way that he understands nuance.
I didn't read Judith, the very symbolic strike of grace, I was satisfied with the "Third sex" (which was more than my time) which I believe is the source of "the source" according to Lo's vows.
While I looked at the elipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon was clearly shown when the clouds were opened.
This sudain appearance of the red moon had its charm and a little deceptive of having sometimes blocked the view of the clouds.
It was fabulous here in FNQ.
Yes, the noise of last night would really be in the coast of Victoria and NSW, while the largest part of the rest of Australia had a clear time.
Special blood moon flash.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey makes the laboratory responsible.
But if the Labour accepts our unjust budget, we will make it its real color as soon as possible.
You're obsessed, right?
I was in Melbourne then naturally I saw only clouds.
Melbourne also succeeded to cover the whole week of the Persesian meteor rain and for almost all the important astronomical phenomenon of the past few years.
I'm starting to think there's a bad genius whose only goal is to prevent Melbourne's people to see what is from heaven.
Melbourne is not really the best place for a observer, even though things are greatly improved on the other side of the Cordiller.
There were periods from 10 to 20 minutes where I couldn't see the elipse because of clouds above the Melbourne bathroom.
I'll put a TAXE on this elipse.
CHINQUE looks at this elipse should pay a TAXE.
I think your first thinking of the day is for Abbott, as last before you sleep.
Who or what will obsess you when he will (forwardly) end by disappearing?
It seems that you have a lot of time to read the discussions searching for messages in which people criticize the Abbott government and then accused them of being obtained by the EUX.
Super photo of Monday above Sydney's Harbour Bridge.
It seems that Mars's going to get into a collision with the Earth!
Nothing on the barrier and real estate.
None of the inequalities between work and capital income.
Nothing about fiscal fraud.
Ultra liberalism is being killed in Europe.
Nothing on the gardens of Babylon...
The article says too or not.
The details and arguments of these preconditions are not given.
No hypertext link to the original documents to make a view.
Let us see today Tuesday, 15 October, the results of the wonderful revenue: in Spain, exports are at least low than five years.
In Greece, the borses are cut off.
However, it seems to be the examples to follow.
The reform of notes would generate a request for unimmunization of the order of 8 billion euros.
The Ministry of Economy claims that these applications are not based.
Is it still in case of error of the Ministry of Economy?
Do the decision-makers who have violated the political benefit resulting from the courageous attack of the notes have the same courage when the facture is presented to the State budget?
Success in his time.
Okay, thanks, JYL.
@lol Not the State is not comparable to households in terms of the management of its budget because the temporary horizontal of the State is theoretically unfinished while the household is cut by the life period of its members.
Furthermore, less than considering that public expenditures are improving, those contribute to financing material and immatricular investments from tomorrow's growth and therefore in future revenues.
Some elements of answer.
A regrettable decision.
But remember the holy grain of Hippocrate: the health of benefits of world farmacéutical society must be preserved before all.
Nice theory of the complex.
Unfortunately, the truth does not match your fantasm.
The medical personnel would like to serve it, but they have hands related to the law as written by policies.
It is the same thing as for the product that causes medical advertisements instead of having risked surgery interventions, shooting rooms for drugs instead of having them on the streets, etc.
On these issues, political people want to enjoy the inculted mass.
In fact, doctors do not win money with medicines.
That's why there are pharmaciens.
physicians don't win money with medicines Since our health system is like the United States, you should learn about how this works.
Medicines are shorted in the world in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
It may have been bad to put a mistake on the Toubib, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, give priority to the benefits of enterprises and the “search” benefits.
So read the several rare reports on our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme expenditure and on negotiations with pharmaceutical companies regarding other countries.
Compare the worldly prices of medicines present throughout the world, as well as the differences from one country to another on what is being sold free or only on order.
This is a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific, direct or indirect process.
In fact, some enterprises are currently testing on marijuana inhalations against oncological pain, despite the laws that strive them and the necessary permissions.
Although manufacturers of certain medicines may not be happy that alternatives such as marijuana are used, those who arrive to a version of good quality products to known doses will be widely benefited.
I'm sorry to tell you, madam, but you're wrong, it's a lot of things in the collisions for doctors and pharmacies.
With regard to this hospital, they were pleased to serve it until someone puts the pocket to the ear of a hospital responsible.
We can't have patents on herb...
If the "searchers" in social sciences were searching instead of policy and networking, they could be used to use their "works".
A investigator, he does not compare a fact to another.
Compare it is not searching.
Compare it's making no research pedagogy.
You can't say “search is worthy, it must be applied” and then in the same jet, “we need to experience everything.”
If your investigations are out of charge, why are you experiencing?
If your investigations aren't engaged, why ask you to apply them?
Can you explain how a "forscher" may deduce that a student who can't like the single mathematics could easily easier the mathematics and other materials?
New technologies allow to learn the condition that students learn to serve new technologies, but how would they get to learn new technologies if they don't know?
Pisa tests are only a indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfied.
What will this be to build a indicator that informs you of what you are arranging, an auto-promoting will, a tromper?
One piece to form teachers: electing the sophists and ideologists from training, and the practitioners teach practicians.
Fabric refer to the paragraph on the stages (which is not very argued) and you will see that your conclusion is the most inefficient to conservatism: "This is a device that leads mostly to the reproduction of existing practices, and which does not allow to progress the system."
In view of the general consensus on the state of the French system, only practitioners are teaching practitioners, even if they have all their place in a modern education of teachers.
Theocratics of education should not have any place.
Practicians, they must have one.
Should you be operated by a surgery whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never put the feet into an early operational block?
There is no consensus on the causes of the educational system.
Giving more weight to educational theoryers, this would definitely destroy it.
Your analogy is totally horrible: if I wouldn't like to be operated by a practitioner who has only a theoretical training, I would like to do less by a surgery who has no theoretical training and has learned on the tas.
Mike Weatherley, the conservator of the fight against the violation of the law of author by David Cameron
Why don't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should take a popular arrest.
MDR exmaiers thanks.
If one day I begin to feel guilty of violating the right of author, I would have enough to read a article like that.
In an information economy, the violation of the author's right = vol.
That's the same because they need to quote their sources correctly.
Remember, obtaining a license costs nothing.
No, it's a violation of the author's right.
Not the same thing.
Using content without having the appropriate license, you free the artists of their wine-pane.
You can always discuss about pedestrian hypothesis - but it's flight.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, it will not become so true.
It's a violation of the author's right.
Come on, repeat him again.
If one day I start to feel guilty of violating the author's right
Visiblely, this does not strive to save the artists of their income.
If they think that they should receive money for images used in school duties, almost perfect definition of what should be a reasonable use, then I am pleased to save them from this fixed income.
Learning No. 1 should be shown how, if children themselves create anything and publish it on their prefered social networks, they leave any intellectual property to the site in accordance with the general conditions they have passed from a click.
Maybe if they share the listeners of their mp3 ballet with a girlfriend in the school bus, they should be dismissed to have freed the law in such a way.
Ah, if we could export this resource we control, the rail that says everything's going bad....
If it's a PS deputy, we have to believe it.
I have 2 children and when they're age to choose, I'd suggest them to leave France if nothing changed from here.
France takes people down by continuously assisting them.
I don't want my children to support the debt that this policy will be created.
What takes France down, it's talks like yours.
@gus I'm working in private business forever.
I had the CHANCE to have worked in enterprises leading to excellent business leaders: this exists in France, but it is rare.
I'm employed because I know I don't have the skills to lead a company and this choice allows me to shoot red balls on the nucleus patterns I'm often meeting.
In my baskets I totally share the post of Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan: he says the horrible truth!
@gus, if it is compared to German companies that French business leaders are constantly quoted to request reforms in France, Germany has structured their industrial tissue to make it competitive, especially by ensuring the link between large business and medium and small business - what are the French patrons expecting to do so?
What's the state holding their hands?
This state they accused of imperiality?
@Jacques L.
Always this counterparty of business leaders from your side!
Remember, what has you created as a job, as a value added, to be too severe?
@ Pat I understand your reaction.
Indeed, France is faced with an unsolvable problem: the incompetence of the chiefs of French businesses that are incapable to create jobs and which swallows and threatens by waiting for the permanent state assistant!
That's horrible!
But they have solutions: removal of the Labour Code, patronal charges, taxes, working 45 hours/week payed 35, and some, walking on eggs, oils claim the decline of salary without their removal!
I am glad to see all "negativ" comments on this subject.
What is ironiac to see how people are always angry of First Group.
As I see where I am, Last has not really been an investment for us.
They tried to keep on fleet instead of transforming.
It doesn't mean that the skoceous ferry roads have not been improved since Last is on it.
But they were also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we have no power to do this, hey.
I tried to have them recently, but I didn't have succeeded.
But well, the work will shoot us, isn't it?
It's a international subsidiary.
They already worked trains in Germany.
No one prevents people in the United Kingdom of creating more moral and participating in offering.
But it seems that we are not very good in management, most of our private services are finished by being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandale and critics when First has returned the Virgin contract, all of this to be finally cancelled.
And it's better: MTR, a Hong Kong company, reported the Crossrail operating contract for eight years.
But the Labour, as they repeated us during the referendum campaign, is totally for the common development and share and thinks that all workers have to be married outside the borders.
Therefore, it may be estimated that they will be happy of this decision ;)
This may be because the Dutch's management is on good rails while the British is not.
What ScotRail needs, it is not just a change of owners but especially new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the struggle of franchises, not the franchistor.
"It was a battleing girl."
God, I hate, but I really hate this kind of expression.
It is likely that the fact of being "beat" is a higher quality of many others, the concern of others, the intellectuality, the listening, for example, the fact of being "batter" has nothing to see with the one to survive to a disease: "batter cancers" which are not less dead, I know palancies.
Sounding a disease has nothing to see with merit.
Let's start again.
I don't tell you that it's LA condition to generate, I tell you that it's IADE..
There's nothing to see with any mercy...
When your life's examples, there's only one to judge them.
I'll start again.
Intelligence, wouldn't just a moment, that we may have a merit to get out of a disease or that we can't get out of it, it's just a monster.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that laughs, all of all, despite the will, despite the confidence in the doctor, you have a vague idea of what C?
I would like to think on the contrary, if, having a solid moral, there is no doubt to accept easier treatment and to prepare it, to try experimental treatments like this woman and not to reject them by fear.
Someone who's struggling in a physician is mostly anyone who trusts the physician.
But if we prefer to get it to the "Master" is another thing..
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
These considerations are own to moralists.
When you touch a salt, a real one, you're going to make it shock so that you're just a zombie.
Personally, I touched them two, salts, greats, and if I'm "beat" as these psychological purposes say, it's completely missing.
Unless this struggle is only to shut the dents, to suffer the hell and to cut the cuts.
I thought that the accused of Milosevic was decided and ended for decades ago.
I haven't seen that name in the newspapers since at least that time.
What's going on?
It's a birthday.
A forgotten birthday.
His proceedings were conducted "speakly" and then balled under the mass.
Is this the story we've told at the time?
The Communist became nationalist who started three wars in the Balkans during the last decade?
The Communist President of the Federal Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia ?
Please ask, therefore, what has been left volunteerly: 1.
How could NATO bombs be legal in accordance with UNMODRE International Law Rule?
What country has Serbia attacked?
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why don't you not mention that NATO destroyed the same building by killing civilians, then considered it a valuable target.
Milosevic had no way out: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a trader.
And if he defended him, he would be blessed by the Western Compressor.
Western smoke screens used to detach a part of a sovereign State, which then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was immediately recognised by the Western States who then lie to shoot on the field situation.
The Serbian population is now totally disappeared (ethnic purification).
Vojislav Kostuni, mentioned here, has been politically dead after his first mandate so that he did not understand the situation developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures of the time's political world.
Finally, the Guardian should not qualify Milosevic of Tyran (if we did not like it).
At my knowledge, only in Greece a method for seed prediction walks nearly, measureing the piézoelectric level in the quarter.
This kind of study is inconsistently useful and thankful to share the results.
A hope, however, is to put this water has nothing to see with the explanate named HAT-P-11b, situated at about 124 years of light of the Earth in the Cygnus Constellation, which would be “the smallest and cold planet to present detections of water molecules”, according to a study conducted by the Drake Deming team and Jonathan Fraine of the University of Maryland.
The method to follow.
Like those that involve animals feeling a threat to arrive.
Thanks for the Scientist's Passer of regaining us often from these experimental sweets that are performed in the world.
How would the animals be (In advance)?
Indeed, by the perception of other elements of which the rate evolves in the case of seed.
Like the radon, for example.
A gas was inodore for humans but may be deceptive by animals.
All of these methods are indetectable for humans, but not for the instruments that it provides.
But we don't have a reliable result on these tracks...
It has been mainly observed (and since centuries) that some animals act strangely some hours with a seismo, including powders, vaches, dogs, and especially fish and serpents.
I had seen an art report that tells the struggle of two scientific teams, a California, the other Japanese, to recognize the validity of their work that leaded to the sensitivity of animals to the earthly magnetic fields, and especially to their changes before a seminar.
So I'm not scientist but their hypotheses were convinced me!
Or are we on these investigations?
Why isn't it so misunderstanding to this track?
We should learn again to listen to the nature...
If we are reviewing the things quietly and strictly, it is published in a serious magazine, and no one is missing it.
As we speak of the "signs" given by the animals, the same beam is shocked: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before a seismo the red fish turned out awkwardly around.
I don't understand that we could think that Boris would be a good leader for the Conservators.
He's too much done as a master in London.
When we listen to the LBC program, we can't stop thinking that this man does not know anything and that he's always trying to divorce with a blague.
He never answers anywhere directly.
He also said he agreed with Farage, and then Nick Ferrari asked him about what.
He couldn't call one point.
He made so many promises to make himself elected as a master and he did not hold it alone.
It's just emphasising how the rest of the Conservator Party is just a ramble of shit, right?
Because he's popular.
Because he's nice.
He was in "Have I Got News for you."
Because it's a celebration, and people were inculked to worship the celebrates.
The Londonians voted for him and will be the same for the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the direction of the party, the popularity count of the Tories will grow the platform I'm sure.
God helps us.
I am not so sure: people love the blagues, but do not want their first ministers to be one.
That's exactly what the Londonians said.
He would have brought his friend the parking with him, more intelligent than him.
In terms, I think he's trying to copy R Branson.
The Americans had one as a President.
The French were truly and always destined in the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have been given the punishment of reading some books (which exists, including a French and excellent B.
Thousands), the "Satan" and the "detroit of ice" speak, so unfortunately that the dead who have remained there.
It is understood that the Australians, who know (one of their heavy crosser, Australia, must always be through the fund since Savo's battle) did not want to return to it.
We actually have been in front of Savo's island, in the "Iron Bottom Sound".
Even if the mission touchs its end.
That's the little ones.
But the echo coat is a total smoke.
Calculate the consumed kerozene to achieve the entirely decredible objective of the concept..
It is enough to pass the list of sponsors as philanthropes.
An or more com operation, nor do it.
It's too excited!!
I'm waiting for the website with impatience!
Your recreation makes me rever, identifiing me a little at the pass (I also learned to navigate with the Golden Cross in the Moulin White in Brest!).
Head for the environmental message, even though some criticize the impact of the movement.
The end justifys the means.
Keep going to see us again, and show with fierce fiery that the Bretons are great travelers!
Peter, from Trinidad and Tobago.
Welcome I think that the red that has demonstrated against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsorized by the British Region and the Brest Villa.
More seriously, it seems to me that local collectives and public bodies in any way should not devote one of our taxes to finance the dreams of some even sympathetic adventurers!
Does there players in the current Serbia training that is cosovare?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, once at the Youth and now in Fenerbahha, are Mirrovia, but I don't know if they are still in the team.
It's Bisevac Lyon's Defender, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was a terrain or a long time in the 1970s and 80s, and was invaded by many teams in Greece, but I don't know where he is.
Bajevic is of Mostar, in Bosnie-Herzégovine, and played as attacking in the large team of Velez, which, under the board of the Legendary Suleman Rebac, twice ended in the second place in the Yugoslavian link (and also accounted on points like Vahid Halilhodzic and the faithful equipher of Arsenène Wenger, Boro Primorac).
Well, thanks Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just because of curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
It was said he would become a big player when he was Juvenile, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was linked to Tokyo *frisson*
There, I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, then he went to Fener and I know there's no title.
Maybe it still do something, perhaps in the Indian Super League?
Really, Serbia.
Very seriously, Albania, don't worry.
You should love Albania because you are neighbors.
This is that the drapeau of this drone is not the dragon of the true Albania today.
It appears to be the dragon of the Great Albania, which includes all regions where there is an important Albanian presence.
A little excessive nationalism, actually.
Unfortunately, there was no too many degates (who I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian dragon with the map not what the Great Albania is called, but from Albania before 1913, when the large European powers decided to give boards from the country to the neighbouring countries.
How can we have felt "a pleasant explosion" by seeing two tours get out of knowing that women, men and children are inside?
How?
What comes to me a little in this "share" is that the only fact that I could, would only once, be spontaneously joyed of the horrible death of thousands of people, witnesses at my eyes of a personality "border line" whose all "proofs" should be taken with the greatest circle.
Uncertainly in the short moment of "joy" there will not be thought of the dead or the reality of the inflicted horrible.
It will just be thought, a minute, that, for a time, Muslims have been able to do true and apolyptically badly to the great wicked Satan in his own heart.
To do powerful qqch.
The great.
It seems that this feeling has been shared by thousands of Muslims ruined by their feelings of hummation.
With witnesses filmed in Palestine.
Classic Fair Freude.
We had a little bit of it.
The Western "Christian/blanc/gaulois" cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, and hatred of the muslim when it contempt the general poverty, the social and cultural development of the Arab Arab world today.
I'm talking about Caire or Alger's faubourgs, not Dubai tours.
The past splender, certainly magnified, is not a console, on the other hand.
How can the Muslim world out of this diabolic enthusiasm?
Totally in the phase, 2 major fishers irrigate the Arab world: the large conservatism of the established powers and the fascising nihilism.
The common point, the glass of thought and excommunication (douce or armed) of his critical expression.
What we have understood before, it must not make Muslims return.
It's the only way.
Did Edwy Plenel read this article?
I think that's true in many countries.
But in Britain, the automne marks the beginning of six long-year dark, humid and depressive months that affect the well-being and the humor of many people.
Moreover, everyone gets sick.
A seasonal depression.
I suffer myself.
When the light goes, it's the hell for me and those like me.
A vitamin D dose should help a little for humor and well-being.
The car is beautiful in Great Britain, with or without rain.
The campaign is in particular to cut the suffix in autom.
Not as to cut the souffle as the green of the summer when everything is alive instead of being on the point of death.
In Great Britain, if you have the chance, the summer ends a weekend.
We've been a beautiful one this year, don't make your grinchy smells!
Not everyone.
I'm randomly sick in winter.
But now I'm on the retreat, and I don't develop immunity for outside germs, it can change, I think.
It's not being on the point of death, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful stage full of swimming smells, with a feblility that culminates with festivals such as Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risks of eternity and full of other wonderful words.
It's enough to stop doing things!
That's my recommendations for you.
Yes, these dark and green months make me actually more happy and more detained.
For the fiscalization of the majority of children , it is the amount covered by the State primarily from the decimals 8 to 10 .
However , in terms of the number of households which have seen their tax to increase from this measure , these are especially the numbers 4 and 5 concerned ( median income ) according to graph 2 .
The elimination of the half part relating to in particular widows is not all treated in the article or instead of its impact is completely assessed: 230M euros are a detriment that does not take account of the impact in 2012 and 2013 and understood that it is indolent.
And it's not ready to stop.
Well, we're not on the ball, but dreamers.
For once the PS makes a policy instead of left, we're not going to cry...
It is obvious that those who are part of 20% the richest must support much more than 75% of tax increase, why not 90%?
Let's continue in this way and you will encourage these 20% less work or from.
Well, I know, that's not politically correct, but I'm telling it at once.
Live the Trots and OCI recycted to the PS: they understood everything.
Adam, you see what you're looking at.
The proportion is always the same here or in Bahrein: 20% of the population have 80% of the riches.
A fair tax is when he forbids anyone to love as much as he can.
Besides a certain limit the money lost its entire use.
And once over the use of money, the money will be more than to do money, i.e. ) to make the worst of the largest number.
The most rich 20 per cent is part of it.
Indeed, also 20% of households who work most (and create riches with a part logically redistributed).
Equitable tax must allow these homes to benefit from part of their efforts.
Or then so much weak the arms and live at least social, especially if there is a social housing.
The utopias of red khmer head cuts have lived happily.
I made two AirBnB in Norway recently.
There's no problem.
In one of the two, we had things that we wouldn't have been in a 5-star hotel and we have not had to present us at receipt or face a fewer tracks.
It's enough to go home somebody, to sleep there, to spend behind himself and to divide.
Dorenavant this will be my first option when I'm on travel.
The logo changed, people...
Check your assurance before lovers your house.
In most cases you will need a type of ownership insurance.
Please use a service with the good logo!
Oh, it's too late.
I love Airbnb.
"It's very dangerous and highly risked." It's not true.
You just missed a chance.
According to the link provided in the article:
In his download, the response of Airbnb to Teman was almost fast, almost fast.
In 24 hours, after a mail provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb sent a lock to change the locks, took provisions for a week to pass to the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is assured, but sometimes).
So why is this article cited by the Teman that he has not received support from Airbnb?
AIRBNB, to receive how to travel
Hello, I'm looking for people who have already used bnb air just to make sure of me back.
I think to pay a shop and a month to lodge from a shop but I've got a little fear to send 1 600 £ to a site that I have never really heard.
But where are we going?
“Support the troops” sing the Bu$here on all the tons...
So weapons are insurgent.
I'm sure that this will be pleased to families and nearly thousands of dead curves at Halabja learning that their parents and friends have succeeded otherwise than the chemical saddam Hussein bombs.
Unless the content of the article has been radically changed by the author, your comment is inadequate (to stay poli).
Furthermore, what would this mass crime in 1988 prove that chemical weapons found nearly 20 years later were still useful?
It is not clear the style of the author: "to search for weapons of massive destruction.
We're okay.
You think it's the time to fail the army to strengthen education.
It is never the time to strengthen education, because we are always in war.
Alternative: Is it the time to strengthen education, because we are still in war?
The education would already be strengthened if 35 hours were working instead of 17 hours.
At the time, our teachers now gain more than technicians.
And that we do not believe that teachers take 18 hours per week to prepare their program.
But it does not see because National Education does not have the way to provide a office to the college/learned to his teachers so they boss their homes.
A kind of tv is forced in sum, except that the employer does not pay any computer, nor internet connection, nor supplies.
Furthermore, it's so much the floor at 17 hours per week and 4 months of holidays that we are not coming to fill the Maths CAPES, come, we're waiting for you.
How do you don't want to smell you with ill-educated smells, whose parents are worried about you by treating blonder?
I believe that the priority in this area is to defeat the djihadites so that the Kyrdae population could better be able to improve.
There you see that Bush administration has completely done everything through.
My first diplomated job was in the sale, in London, to win no three times, and it was a post for which it had to be a diploma.
A year later, I saw an advertising to be opened for London's metro, it was paid to $5,000 per year, and it was not even asked for the patent.
I never regretted.
In this regard, don't make you if you don't find a diplomated job, try to find anything that pays well or you like to do.
If I was left in the diplomated job, I would still pay my student loan.
I do not like the business work so much, so I hope to pass or in the public or university world.
LOL LOL This article is really late!
Exactly, when I got my diploma in 2011, there was a three-year-old fall.
The best way to reduce the number of non-employed diplomates?
Exhibition of biblical branches such as art/letters/theater/media / philosophy/political sciences, which is called the unemployment diplomas.
I have one of these diplomas, and I've finished the production director.
He noted that the importance was not the diploma, but, as the above article states, a good professional course, starting at school and all over the university.
Of course, the department wage was less but it is slowly shocked because in the real world the results are more than knowledge.
This discussion of engineering/artist subsidies has been dealt with for years.
Scientists can not solve all the problems, it is more important to be able to get up early, arrive at time to work and to interact with people in a way to get results.
Letters, philosophy and art are biwnor filiers?
It's ridiculous.
I think you're talking about kind of media study diplomas or whatever the absent subsidiary you're going on.
Letters, philosophy, political and art sciences are true branches.
We need people who can explain the great questions to the lessons, including the importance of cultural bases such as literature, art, etc., and put them into value.
This would not be better for a real territorial policy to desecurize Paris and dynamize the rest of France?
Personally, I see the people in the end of the Esonna and the Val-d'Ocean to go to 80km every day on board to come working to Paris.
Intra-more and small cemeteries have already many more practical transport means (metre, bus, tramway).
> several safe and closed parks, as there are already in the northern Europe cities in Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the beach.
Good idea.
On the surface, the space is cannibalized by 2RM.
Indeed, it is hoped that the Paris Ville works with the Netherlands and Denmark professionals.
As well as benefiting from their great experience in the field.
Well, we haven't found place for UN SEUL switching devices.
The motivation seems to be stronger when it is to find a office for Bertrand Delanoe....
Well, it's not all right.
When we are discussed with pietons and other users of the common transport of reasons for which they do not spend it seems that the main reasons that are: 1/ It is dangerous with all these baths, these trucks, these shooters that run over fast and fail to survive 2/ are taken full of pollution in the head For me cyclable pistes are swimming pools, we need to reduce the switch switch loading switching (Parks = 30), reducing speed (Paris = zone 30), to respect the switch code in systematically switching (seen switching to premature swallows that need to adapt the switch code for the switch to the 100 years of shoot switching and shoots.
Cyclable pistes are the apartment, we need to cohabit but reequilibrate the occupation of the urban space.
Nothing on the ship in the Great Paris?
Doesn't a word on the ship place in common transportation?
EELV is right.
The target of 15% speed movements is ridicule.
I'm starting to believe that Anne Hidalgo rolled the green in the fat.
In addition to seeing what OR reports, EELV adjoints seem sceptic.
I prefer very optimistic.
Before the racket doesn't start, it'll be better to find someone really hide behind this mask.
Index: This is not Russia.
It's not sure to love the way the world evolves.
It looks horrible.
My children are not a financial activity.
A lawyer expressed his intention to put the case before the CEDH, but I have not heard that a complaint has been effectively issued.
Moreover, they should first be sentenced in Germany or Ukraine.
I also hope that these cases are retreated by waiting for the result of the investigation report on the accident and the criminal investigation that it would take.
Yeah, but Libya did not explose Pan Am 103 more.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, in this case the Ukrainian government is responsible for airspace security.
Was the accident predictable?
Other aircrafts had been attacked previously, Ukraine was launched in the aircraft zone against rebels and all aircraft could certainly be considered possible and immediately.
Has the Ukrainian government taken reasonable precautions in view of an obvious threat or has he chosen to play with the life of innocents so that airlines pay the rights of the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls that defend their U.S. Government / the Ultranationalists of Western Ukraine - who want to demonstrate that Poutine shocked MH17 flight.
As I know, there is already a complaint against the Kiev government because they are responsible for what happens in their heavens.
The previous: An arrest of 1986 of the International Court of Justice which concluded that the supply of weapons by the CIA to the rebellious conflict forces to Nicaragua did not mean that the United States were responsible for their actions.
There is no chance that Russia let this case go to the CCI.
It's glad to think Abbott would mean Poutine that Australians were killed by Russian rebels supported.
I hope that it can present evidence to slow down his allegations.
Until the investigators haven't said anything like that.
Call Ricardo and be such a beoten in eco, it's affecting!
The call Polar is losing the north is joyful.
A single question of Beotten: is the poor today more poor than the poor to go?
I can't stop noting that those who criticize most virgulously the Pikety book have not read it!
It's easy to read, I've had a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, capital income, inequality-concentration, labour inequality, capital property, merit and heritage in the term log.
He shows that the concentration of the capital today joins the beginning of 20th to 1914, showing that it is the two world wars that have declined the capital concentration, from 1914 to 1945, and how the concentration returns after...
Bernajuzan: You don't do anything.
I ask you how long this took you to read this pavilion that the concentration capacity of a person has a few limits.
Then the question is not to know whether it is easy to read.
The question is if the summary of the central thesis given by the press is just or not.
If it is fair, we can discuss about that without having read the book which is essential to argue in a unique sense for that.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan : How long have you been reading?
Is the central thesis of his pave summarised by the press is false?
I haven't read and I won't read it.
So I trust in the summary of his central thesis and that's the one that seems to be pure fuming.
The concept of difference between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Is humanity not globally enriched?
And this enrichment added to increased population is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and worth the price without doubt.
But remember that she was just 17 years old.
A age in which most people just start to find their place in the world.
I hope that this price will not be a fade for the young girl and that she will find her way to carry a happy life.
The problem is not the price, but the political capital of Western Governments who want to prove the old adjustment that the colored perverses are the incarnation of the evil.
All my happiness legs in Malala, but she must be aware that she is used and that nothing will be done to educe girls in Pakistan or even in the popular districts of Great Britain!
Someone thought his talk was a little strange.
She thanked her father for giving him a lot of freedom but said that if she was not there now, she would have been married for 14 years.
Is Malala himself not part of those "colored perverse"?
You shouldn't have no "time of ante" on this site.
You're, yourself, a horrible pious.
It's absolutely revolving.
No, his father wouldn't marry her for 14 years.
She was 15 years old when we shot him up.
His father is leading to a school where girls are schooled and is in favour of equal rights for women.
It is, and has always been, that she receives a higher education and that she has the right to decide on himself from her marriage.
For this reason, it's someone who lives in Pakistan, as he thinks that women are equal to men.
What she said is that a medium-sized Pakistani girl must often marry at 14 years without having her word to say.
I'm sorry that she hasn't cast it enough for you.
This may seem contradicting, but maybe she wants to say that if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married for 14 years.
Shortly discovered by this season 4 entry and especially by Jessica Lange that visiblely has a little bad to find her personality of Marlene Dietrich.
I've been looking at the last two seasons that are quite different but I have to admit that it's one of the best horrible series, one of the most worthy!
A first fascinant episode.
The achievement is near to the perfection and the show of Jessica Lange sing the Life Life on Mars de Bowie is quite simple.
I have not yet looked at this new season (which will be the last for me, without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story, I prefer to have a shock that looks at 13 episodes stolen on 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is on, outside Jessica Lange, is especially the risks of scenes and mountains that sit down.
In AHS there is an abalanche of original plans that do not ridiculize the assetization of today's productions.
It escapes me a little to see you putting the shooting forward for the next seasons without even waiting for shooting the quality.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pilar of this series, but, you say so well, there are still other things.
It's not just that for me Jessica Lange (and especially his way and the way she uses) is really the UN pillars of the series outside technical qualities.
And I look like a lot for her.
Then I find that the sequence of sin by writing, she wants to do too much in the same time.
The season 3 was slightly below, in 2 it was too dispersed, despite some excellent episodes.
I don't see them doing 10 stations of American Horror Story or that's going to end as 24 chronic hours what.
But everybody do what he wants!
That's why I say "I will not look later" that everyone is obliged to do the same!
I simply share my point of view, nothing less.
The loss of Jessica Lange, JE thinks she's gonna be fatale to him.
But after that, it's just my opinion.
Let us speak less tax hair, please, instead of the State expenditures.
No, let's increase the expenditure, please.
Those who wanted to know in the expenditure failed.
Starting pollecs about relatively few expenditure posts, such as development assistance
The problem is that this represents less than the error margin in government expenditures in the United Kingdom.
The truth is that we are all in talking to nuances instead of the orientation change that the elections seem to call their vows and all that time some in every camp seem that these nuances are much more important and substantial than they are - and the electioners are clear in their game and find them of bad faith.
Above 1 % of expenditure.
The 'debt' is an asset that is essentially detained by financial institutions in this country.
"Debt" is nothing that doesn't worry.
I wouldn't see any problem that the government applies to a third of my income (or even before I talked about consumption taxes) if I thought he would be aware of it.
But this is not the case, and many contributions have the same feeling.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not been honest about how to reduce taxes but good, if you add our net contribution to the EU, the development aid, high speed 2, the subsidies to eolians nearly unnecessary and the nuclear centers that cost the double of what they should do, you will arrive to a number that seems to redistribute the work and the Lib-Dem tax on the most luxurious residues.
Your first 10 000 £ are not impossible.
This means that someone who wins 35 000 £ per year will pay about 5 000 £ (a seventh of their payment), one with 50 000 £ would pay around 10 000 £ (a fifth), and one with 200 000 £ pays about 70 000 £ (one more than a third).
What about social contributions?
More social contributions, more local taxes, more station costs and car wine, and it is before TVA.
About 30% of my money is predominant to the source before local taxes and the car wine.
I'm decently paid, but not extravagant.
Not that it's a problem, of course, I'm glad to pay my taxes.
But we don't seem to believe that money falls from the sky, or that it is not important to know where it passes billions of tax books.
How can a unemployed who looks for work at the door may prove it?
Although even, 20% of the unemployed people do not look for, it means that 80% are searching and not found.
If I'm a lack of jobs, do I have more interest in what others are looking for or not?
What a potential receiver 10 or 20 CV, this increases my chances.
Indeed, I haven't had news from Pole Employees for months, which means that agents are more busy for control operations than to really make job advertising?
I don't see the interest.
Because it's not the State to provide work.
If Pole Employee does not provide enough posts, then it must take place from the Employee.
What is a sensible subject?
We all have rights and duties, in the event, we are assured that the unemployed workers have a good fulfilment of their duties in contravention of their rights.
As a controller requests their transport title to users of a means of transport, a service manager or are employees of their work, etc.
Nobody's crying to the scene in these cases, right?
It is effectively good to remember that unemployers have rights: the only two times I had dealed with Pole Employee, my rights to the AEA had been badly established, and on one of the dossiers, shooted 40%, had failed to fight closely.
It takes time!
I'm not expert in right.
Fixing and control is currently above, while Statutely Pole Employee is near to be an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of impending should be only employees, these are those who pay the costs.
Non-France policies and non-solaristics are granted rights that they have not actually done!
It's not normal.
I would add that a dignity of unemployment is involved in the valuement of the employed work.
More than waiting for Arab killers...
In fact, a direct military response must be held in Iraq/Syria which will stop Iis so that this virus does not reach this area of conflict.
The situation would then be similar to the propagation of black pest in 1348/9 in connection with war and population movements at the time.
The Sauditans had the spirit of prohibiting Hadj this year to Mexico to the Muslim Pelers from the three touched countries.
The Party reports that 7 400 have seen their request for refusal of visa because of their country of origin or recent travels.
In fact, there was the case of a peer coming from Bosnie who contracted the variation to Mexico during the Hadj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a peer from Somalia, where disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same presence.
Is it unreasonable to propose to prevent Ebola's diseases to take a plane for Europe?
I thought it was just a good sense but apparently those "who knows" decided that we could risk the life of tens of thousands of people...
These West African countries, where Ebola is outside control, should be placed in strict 40.
Nobody's out.
Only health personnel can enter.
21 days waiting after treating patients before they could go.
If they contract Ebola virus while they're there, they're staying there until they're healed.
There are no dramatic measures.
Only last week, people were contaminated after having contact with people in West Africa, although they had taken “all the necessary warnings.”
You can stop the advancement of this disease.
It is mainly promoting by airlines.
We prohibit them to fly to these countries.
In addition, customs agents in the airport should be formed to report people with typical symptoms of Ebola, so that they may be immediately miscept in quarenteine.
What happens to pass the message of the first individual and the group (including religious) second and will mercy the Nobel of Peace.
I doubt it is possible to dog the image of God characterized by the total cortex of the planet in operation.
It's still far from this design there.
This only makes 20 years that information appears to be as the first given humanity, while the religion, the brain issue, may lead our actions since Lucy.
What is the interest of become a former protestant church?
For those who have not noticed it, Catholicism is widely minority in France today, nobody is forced to adhere to it.
Those who criticize no way put the feet to the Church, there is only a low number of protesters in France.
What is the next step, is the concept of sin, too "anxiogenic"?
@louise: Sorry the church has no vision limited to France.
And in the world, it may allow more to touch the world...
@Martine E, to be honest (for example) the respect of others like you were expected to be Christian.
Hill said for a century before him: "Do not do others what you don't want to do to do to you, it's the whole Torah and the rest is just commenting: go and study!".
Christianity is well beyond a simple reciprocity but introduced the appeal.
You "make progress in justice, peace, brotherhood" but without God?
Is it a return to communism? :-)
Nearly step: incarnation and resurrection are taken.
Jesus will remain this hero who bought the moral laws by refining the respect of others.
The Christians will then be ready to take their role in the ethical debates of our society and to progress justice, peace, brotherhood.
Not very Catholic?
I think I remember that the low number of protesters in France is mainly explained by the fact that their former ones have been extermined, and they have become forced and have been able to immigrate over the past few centuries ago.
I'm too hot between buying this, the new Alien game, or Watteland 2.
And the new Elite game comes immediately.
That doesn't make it.
I would personally choose SoM.
I love Wasteland 2 (I even participated in his fund leverage campaign) but I don't think that's 30 £.
If it's the PC version you interest, Green Man Gaming currently sell Sum to 30 £ and also proposes a 20 % reduction.
Green Man Gaming currently sold Sum to 30 £ and also proposes a 20% reduction.
I'm gonna look at it.
Of course not at work.
The joy rabats of the IT department block all the sympa sites.
Hello, is it 30 £ then 20% decrease, or do 30 £ include 20% of reduction?
However, warning: PC version is only for DX11.
It took me a surprise, I bought it, but I can't play it.
In addition, I bought it on Steam, so no reimbursement, isn't it.
It's time to buy a new video card * Make the gloves*
It's a Brazilian website, but you get a valid Steam identifier, I think.
Caveat emmptor and all this: I didn't use it myself.
Amazon 30 £ per PC, 35 £ for Xbox 360 and PS3, 44 £ for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I would be afraid that a day they're shocking you from your library if they decide to seal against the people who buy it there when they're out of the planned region.
So join the beta version of Elite: Dangerous.
So, 1940 France was it a "threwful earth"?
So say that Nobel price looked at me all of a sweet gift.
Should you love France of 40, "the strange?"?
When you see this obtain the literature Nobel is asked if Proust or Dostoyevsky had it today.
Nobel isn't even an event, it is not even intended to read the premature authors.
Brazilians, Chinese or Australians will read Modiano, who is already difficultly liable in French and who describes a very limited and egocent universe?
I hope the other Nobels are more credible, but I'm frankly sure.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a close relationship with literature.
Have you read it at least?
Or another Nobel price?
That would be better to judge.
As to China, Brazilians and others, do not worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture, they.
They will be grateful to M.
Modiano to his just value, if they don't know him already!
From your side, continue to associate Levy and Musso.
I share your opinion.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso keep all their chances.
So let's see who has obtained the literature Nobel: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Hello.
Since I've conducted one in Island, I don't stop see Kia Sportage all over.
I think this thing followed me up here.
Maybe she wants to shoot me?
Or shoot me like Superman III's horrible computer?
Hello, Dantra, always hate her?
Hello DQ - No, not today, I took my doctors.
That's mercy!
I had a few days of rest.
That was cool.
Last weekend, I went to the Bird Festival of Nottingham.
It was random.
I managed to have 19 different birds, Wobbly Weasel is one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mixing of people there, there were only fantasies of CAMRA (not confronting with the fans of the camera).
It was really hard to drive on the back of the Sunday.
Thursday night we went to the grandfather of a push to play the nine brag card.
Thanks to a real chance of starting, I could share with several decents.
I hope if I get to 95 years of age, I'll be as living as he.
Last night I went to a chic cocktail bar to Farringdon.
One of my drinks has arrived with a shirt upstairs.
I'm admire M.
Read a little Buuddha and you will understand how wrong you do, dear Christian.
That says, without wanting to smile you, I think you're a little away from the subject.
This famous totality, she bans the demands for the Djihádistes to get out of the mosques.
She reports the weapon traffic without late.
We have the big eyes open like Meddeb and Thailand or Boubaker or we have the big eyes closed.
You have to choose.
It's not by watching closed eyes that we can access to light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again, you do a monumental contrast: the totality of representative, Muslim or non-muslim authorities, have formally condemned the II and its crimes, French, Muslim or not, have nothing to add to these unified official condemnations.
That's not the word.
The problem is that people like you first see them like Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not as French.
Unfortunately, nice Kentoc'h Mervel, the doubt exists for everyone.
As I told it thousand times, some doubt about the approval by the Jews of the Jews of the Israeli masters in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent of accusing them to accusate priorly and demanding publicly to prove to the rest of the French society that she was wrong to doubt.
This principle is my eyes the rejection of the Republic and can only contribute to deliving the French society.
SI there's no doubt, as you say.
Who does not agree, but what do you agree?
They agree to a neighborhood with II or EI condemnation.
The silence is well practiced, it is the main weapon of those who want to do their head and shoot.
Your position is intelligent and pragmatically insensible.
Alex Salmond predicted that, during elections, the Scotia could "wear" of the parties represented in Westminster because a huge shock was crossed between their proposals for decentralization and what they promised to the referendum on independence.
Cameron must be paid to the idea to lose all these seats in Westminster.
Cameron's got to ride.
What are these threats?
Conservers are completely wrong with Scotia as they have no seats.
They can do what they want in any electoral impunity.
I don't think that even Cameron is enough stupid to believe that the Labour losing seats in Westminster for the benefit of the SNP is a good long-term thing for him and the Conservers.
Who will smile a laugh for the Travailist Party.
They will completely remove SNP and UKIP in Scotia, which will cut their head in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the "ProMESSE" who believed that he knew his party but did not realize that he signed the death stop of his Scozian deputy.
It is not surprising that some labour deputy demands accounts to their leader.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and has no majority in Parliament, although the seats do not come to Conservers, they will then be in very good position to negotiate any coalition, and they will be able to force both Conservers and Workers to do what they have promised for maximum decentralization.
I think this is instead the important thing.
Not if the Labour or Conservers want to be re-elected a day in England.
Decrease 8% pomps by 85% detriment, it is not a super-electoral strategy.
Furthermore, when the Scotiaan deputy will no longer vote on the issues relating to England, the Conservators will win all votes.
Oh, I think he's right.
Cameron may not have a lot to lose, but Miliband yes.
Maggie did it with the Ulster Unionists, and that's a good success.
However, he is still in license to be the first Minister in 2015 and since he returned the Travailist Party.
So, in large, these boxes will be virtually behind each reader to look above his floor and see what he read, how he read, and up to the mouth.
It's "The Life of Others" of Eastern Germany or KGB applied to the FRIC world...
Always the same fascination for monitoring techniques.
At the end, this will at least have a steroid effect.
I wait for the next ticket: Amazon Fabric VOTRE book on VOTRE Profile and this is automatically thanks to an algorithm of its secret!
It's like a world.

Thank you for the article.
As under this system, DRM management is not implemented, it remains the reading of pirated files, public domain books or buyed by some editors who have the ability to propose files without mouchard.
As I paid Kobo's price, it's unfortunately.
I am excited of the generalized assignment of users towards the generalized appreciation of their private life.
In your large public library you will be fully observed that everyone gives his fidelity card (fn*c, d*itre, ...).
There are also chief workers whose opening and completion rates are uncertain.
For example, James Joseph’s “Fnegans Wake ”
@Thomas: In Big Data's era, the data really does not need to be personal to be relevant.
Attention to not put the entire literature into the same bag.
The collection of anonymous data when there is a profile...
The collection is not an anonymous.
This is the data published by Kobo, which are not allowed to identify readers, or authors.
But Kobo has all this information, he.
There have been so many exagerated, misleading and contradictory statements from the Turkish government in recent days that the country seems to be conducted by a full-sized maternal class of cyzophrene children under oxygen.
It's even worse than if you take into account the religious fundamentalism of Erdogan.
It is interesting that some parties of Erdogan think that Islamist is such an insult that they remove your comment, but not my. ;-)
Very well seen :-P But Turkey did not want to shoot a ball on his feet, unless it won something.
If she attacks ISIS, ISIS will rise, so it's actually shooting a ball on his feet.
A retreat diploma wrote on his blog: "The AP reported that Iran has guarded the United States that it would be a mistake to seek to reverse her President, Syrian Bachar Al-Assad, because this would threaten Israel's security.
It is not clear in the article if Iran sent there a serious warning of refusal or if he would simply advise the prudence.
This second option is more likely and, in all cases, what really surprised is that today the Irish and American diplomatic commitment to Syria, Israel and the security of the region is now.”
The read of Indian Punchline is to recommend strongly that anyone takes attention to the details instead of the traditional media c*nneries. The short article you give is important and should be read in mind regarding the realistic comments / warnings previous from Iran for Africa around 1979 to 1980.
Who are those "modified" who seriously fight the horrible Assad lay and at the same time the ISIS's wicked ones?
Pippin policy puts the world into the aime and I would suggest those who are referring to "modified" inexperienced to make more attention to the facts and alternatives before sending children to fight in the Third World War.
“It's still worse than if you take into account the religious fundamentalism of Erdogan” Is there any other religious fundamentalists in the Middle East?
I've got one in my head.
There would be a prosecution of Nuremberg for the Armenian genocide made by the Turkishs.
Should he “deal ”?
Do you realize that nor the criminals, nor the victims, have the little chance of being in life?
A little late for that, my...
Does the criminals not be able to be old now, like 120 years old?
A little late for that, isn't it?
In particular, with regard to the triumphate of the CUP planned and directed the genocide, Talate and Djemal killed just after the first World War by the Armenians, and Enverting killed by the cupchevics in a shocked place in Central Asia near the same time, when it was left to establish a Turkish imperial.
That's funny!
A impressive master of the fatal skin sophistics, but on the other hand, we're just looking for contact with the real.
It's a crowd without argument.
The foetus will always hear a heart that even struggle in the hand of a portable mother.
The Lebanese couples may just be a child's desire and not a desire to be accepted.
The stereal couples also.
How much kids!
It's a shame to appoint them as a future psychological unbalanced.
One day, they will have the age to defend themselves, saying they are happy to live, win their life and pay the retreat of this woman (?)
The GPA is certainly an interim "solution" in the development of the doctor who knew our world.
She doesn't give it today.
Many women took and put into the world children who weren't their husbands.
It's still so, we're doing so...
The important thing is that this practice is framework so that the "marking" of the body is limited.
But ethical surgery, cosmetics are not also marketing body?!
Analogue Faunity...
It is certainly more comfortable to increase a good in far-related country via Internet and Pay Pal than to send his responsibilities and to avoid the scandale in another century near home itself without crying it at this time on all the teeths! ...
These practices were no longer made in the name of the church! ...
There are only Christians and believers who reject these practices ...
It remains not less than the exploitation of the body is a real problem.
Oh, my God, this man's angry about something.
At the end of the 1970s in the Midlands I saw that just far away.
I had to go there the day because I didn't have the right to go there the night!
But if you love it and you listen to music - this music today she's always touching you.
I don't know why there are so many misunderstanding comments here on what Paul Mason says, maybe they have been posted by people who have never been nice, even for a few years!
I believe in the sport section there is a post on the foot that waits for your comments.
Good article, very true.
Since Tony Parson's movie, there is a lack of reports that really reflect the reality of the Northern England culture.
No surprise that Paul Mason had well introduced the social and political context, he understands the things.
Northern soul has always lived, but it has been vampirized by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.
This says, you can take a ear if you're in the London region in November : 99psoul will retreat soul vinyls, including full of Northern soul, on Saturday 15 November at Bethsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I also thought "will always the same story", but this is a small article well written and well-being.
Your critics really need to be more constructive.
Super article.
I loved your documentary.
I think you're happy to miss in Newsnotte.
Last train for Victoria/Exchange and go to Wallgate.
By swimming pillars.
What the car before Wigan was, 15 minutes away from Wigan after purchasing a ticket for the stop after Victoria!
The starts of the Northern soul scene are described in an excellent episode of the police series called Gently Northern Soul, which is in Newcastle in 1968.
The affairs are increasingly emphasising.
Palestinians have no partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahou never calls an opportunity to ratify a opportunity to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahou does not search for peace because he wants to continue to take up-coloniser (for example, it was also the case of Rabin).
Of course, Rabin, Netanyahou and all their elections prefered the peace-colonization occupation.
He removed his clothes, put them on the rock and entered into the water.
A Israelite had shooted them.
The Israeli representative is angry and voting: "What are you talking about?
The Israelites were not even there at the time."
The Palestinian representative (UN) has added: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the Palestinian bipolary government and will not decrease the guard...
That this moves to the anti-Israel is a proof, it is not the searching purpose ...
Antisionist : But I answered you, I translated : the global geopolitical report ...
And it's always so since the policy is globalized...
Evitablely, obviously...
In the Israeli-colonial conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it is certainly losing!
For Israel's creation, you don't answer.
What force report allows the creation of Israel?
Antisionist: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a force report!
You doubt?!!!!
Moreover, it turns not only around Russell Brand, but the journalists of the Guardian seem to have a pain to go beyond anything he shouldn't say.
Many of what he says are only pseudo-chomskyists written not others.
That's what proves you don't understand what Russell Brand says, or what Noam Chomsky says.
It's just a follow-up of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter loves it well, which would mean that it's a matter of immature).
A truly zealous load, with just awareness suspicion that Russell Brand tells some truths, maybe truths to those who prefers not thinking.
Get up, this feeling will be more expansive!
I can understand why Brand horpille some: he sometimes speaks deeply and after all the absurdities of the tableds he actually gives the impression of being a starting popularist, but all this story of not voted has been completely uninterpreted according to me.
The general consensus seems to say just to the people not vote and rather crush the arms and ignoring the entire political process - but if you look at Paxman's interview and other items / videos that he posted, he said that it is essentially voting for only five years for the Labour or Conservors (or Lib Dems I think) and restricting the democratic commitment to this, the two parties are not completely inutile because of these parties: it is not to say that they are just to vote in favour of special interests, multinational and rich businesses, and they should not have the right time to ignore completely because these parties are not in our name: instead of say that they are just to vote in the place and to develop a few years.
I don't say that I'm necessarily agreed with his solution (for I think I'm politically active in presenting his requests can go to a couple with the fact of voting, since the politicians are rounds that will change their opinions if they can really lose their elections), but it is raised to see all these condensing responses that say that this unbelievers that Jesus said to young people do not take the punishment of vote and just expecting that all will be better because it is really developing his arguments.
His solution is extremely discussed, and it would be good if people discussed what he really said, rather than simply labeling it as irresponsable and putting the concerns of him and a large number of persons left in account.
Yes, thank you.
The vote was completely deformed.
The inutility of shooting a bulletin in a urn every five years was deeply encouraging to me that my vote really does not contain anything.
I want more referendums, electronic votes, direct democracy and Members who are locally taking account of their elections.
In addition, I react the idea that Russell Brand's proposals are not its (written by others).
It is sufficiently intelligent to have his own proposals and ideas, even though those are strongly influenced by the kind of thinkers and universities anti-stablishment of the anticulture that Suzanne would like to group under the "pseudo-chomskist billeves".
I am instead convinced that it would be successful to convince Suzanne in a debate.
Maybe this is what the Guardian could do, that Suzanne do as Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a verranda, even the head heights added to the mount!
As Max Keiser, who first attacked Russel but ended by become one of his fans and invited him in his emission, is too easy to attack him without really understand where he wants to come.
It is possible in a political talk that exists from generations, but has been marginalized by traditional media, including the Guardian, since generations.
This “fraude” especially shows my eyes that the intellectual debate has not been held for many years in the history of the history where the work historians have become minority, and where the exchanges of specialists have been appealed to the benefit of condensed types of Sciences Po for press files.
For my part, I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Peter Bourdieu as well as Michel Foucault, the need to take it to a guilty, a embassy leg.
They develop one of the very reasonable reasons, but this rationality is on these emissional legs that are the key of their thoughts.
I believe, instead, that the State was essential for Foucault as guilty.
This is a very archaic thought, the sacrificed thought, which is also the magic thought.
The problem of the report is resolved by eliminating it.
There is an anarchistic, neo-lib and / or/or/Liberatory pen ( of two terms the second marks a duration of the Status's radication desire , the first saking go to search for State assistance for its markets ) in the sense of at least State / not all of the state at Foucault .
The old dream of the base that is self-organized beautifully.
His thinking is built on the fault of the State: without that fault it does not delay.
This guilty, this elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a position against the three intellectuals referred here.
No other support.
The totality left remembers a good old time, the one of his god of values, Staline, the little father of the peoples.
Oulala, you certainly read too fast chouya if you took the texts of Foucault on Iranian revolution for a apology of Khomeiny.
Today, even Peter Manent wouldn't be able to attack Michel by this bias...
The left has a deep reflection on the contemporary and collective individual, the difficulty that represents the membership mechanism in our advanced liberal society.
If we agree or not with him, it is an original and respectable thinker.
See this orchestrated cattle by researchers in human sciences from the hard left, which do not support the alliance to their mantras, is sufficiently reciprocal.
The narcism and the authorism of these people are unlimited.
A important point to add to me seems to be the post of these "rebelles", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of Chinese and other "years" whom I have been witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You didn't have the joy of hearing our Australian friends about this, then.
And where was it in Russia, that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have personal opinion?
I don't remember when I saw a Chinese last time.
In London and they were sympathetic to me when they learned that I was Russian.
In Russia, the last time in 1990, in a market.
The Chinese thinks equal to the Whites!
My family lived in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou in the middle of the 20th century ago, and I hear some of them to hold a violent anti-Blancs proposal.
My father isn't pleased that her old daughter's happiness with a White.
I also believe that the attitudes have changed in Russia since 1990 and especially during the past years: they are increasingly rich, prosperity is promising outside large cities, and through this prosperity people travel to the foreign and see how others live.
For what was told me, the Russians were particularly injured against temporary workers without qualification originating in Caucase and Central Asia, working in households and in areas where they have a great chance to be exploited by their employees or faced with high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the rivers of the Ienissei River, in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I heard the Australian opinions about China and Aboriginal.
It's really strange that a foreigner tells me that I don't support the Chineses, while I met them two in my life (of one to the foreigner), I didn't keep them bad memorys, and in fact all people have been valuable and, in fact, that's the only reason why I remembered that they were Chinese.
If we don't remember who we meet, all people value, how to remember who he was.
You know what's strange?
That you and the other Russian here speak of China as a kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you're always going out with that White.
How many Chinese men are in comparison with whites?
No one, because there are many chances that the parents of these Whites would attack them.
No measure of the impartiality of justice.
However, it is the mother of all battles and justice in France remains manipulated by strongly left-handed groups as the trade of magistrates...
@Marabout: Excuse me, but the judicial environments are frankly marked right.
When it is in the Syndicat of the Court, it is only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of participation can be made from the relativeness of the application of the laws in the courts, it commands to avoid two obstacles.
The observer's political vision as the factual interpretation of the magistrate.
The Law's tool remains obliged to recently evaluate the basic assessment.
The measure of its inconservation in all the judiciary acts of judges, including parking, is forced to operate a distinction between the error and the parity of the magistrates.
It would only be said that the acts of justice do not divide among these three groups.
Pretension and misconsciousness does not pertinent to an objective analysis.
And if all this is not analyzed, how do you say that justice is improved in France?
If it's only by statistics, it's a very low part of it.
The previous preambule allows us to integrate what follows in the third ratio.
That's the corruption* of the magistrature.
Sensible undertaking in proportion of the power of abuse*, which is confined to the judiciary capable of such heritage.
The field considered is the of the spolition* of heritage made until the process is through successive genealogists mandated by noters.
This profession receives a good of EUR 150 million, while benefiting from the cover* assured by the almost judicial impunity* of the French notariat.
For the understanding of their mechanism, a party was reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this is joined by the statistical improvement modeled by the previous comment, it is that the judicial institution has produced, in many differences between genealogist and heritage, a whole set of contrary laws for heritage laws.
The presentation of European statistics ignoring such rational criteria, isn't it then a formulated form of lie?
Prices are certainly totally prohibited.
Another material to raise disabled persons.
We can say this, but my brother has one of the whole land tricycles, built as much as his size and his weight, and it really allowed him to benefit from full air as ever a normal roller, with roots and swimming powders, couldn't.
As we say, the legs and the colors...
Tankchairi looks like that Jeremy Clarkson could invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
Tankchair has the EPIQUE air.
I think the Will's inventor has never been cleaning a dog crystal on a chain.
I'm sure my sister's gonna love the whole tricycle, but it's just too nice.
The rolling swimming Ultra long distance would be perfect for a disabled with a pencant for the longboard.
There are collines that would like them.
The prices seem to be actually high, but there are really people who put this kind of price in a wheel, then “you see”.
The whole country tricycle seems very useful.
All persons with disabilities are not poor, however.
Many of them have insurance of a reasonable amount.
Only if they have become disabled.
This is that the rolling squirrel market is a nickel, so they can enable to practice high prices for things that they know that they are necessary.
We can't really say that Whill is minimumist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately, it's just a shirt, it is not planned to make it.
I am aware of the fact that the “long distance” routine does not arrive on the market, because there seems to be no way to lead this wrong thing.
About 20,000 houses were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza, when intensive bombs from deeply few resident neighborhoods.
Two million human beings are prisoners of the Israeli block of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupant power of the Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
The half of them are children and youths who are less than 18 years old.
The eight-year-old children lived all their lives under the Israeli block!
The unique situation in the world, unacceptable, also illegal situation, since this block is inflicting a “collectional punishment” to all the civilians of Gaza.
" The entrepreneurs working on their projects have a little bit of their cement to the black market " ...
Ah, that's not the wood language, instead of beton and armed the woman...
The references are here to support a argument or a fact.
Antisionist...
The good cement goes in the tunnels!
The black market is certain and recognised.
Two million human beings are prisoners of the Israeli block of Gaza since 2007.
The unique situation in the world is unacceptable for every person who has a heart and moral sense.
US has a well-guarded field: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the time necessary to control because the dictatorship (who you know) excluded it!
Don't forget, too, just after he leaned him, Morsi had rebuilt the blockus!!!!

Gaza's children live on a subterranean strongness, built against the people who chose his grandfathers!
A boat, it's a lot of work, Alex.
I hope you've been thinking well.
Couchsurfing is much better than Airbnb.
It is the same definition of the share economy, without lucrative purpose.
Many are looking for a piece of night on Couchsurfing.
So it's going to pay (or at least hope it) in another way.
It's always much less pretty than a hotel, if you need to search for the good address.
In addition, the owners and locators that are trusting often stopped using Airbnb and treated directly in species, with so Airbnb.

It would be better to have a good assurance for the boat, ensure that it is 100% in accordance with all security rules and ask those who are channels and rivers the authorisation to practice a commercial activity (that they will certainly reject).

Capitalism isn't going to shut up!
High funding, speculal, play with our companies, with our first materials, so our purchase, our foods, with our health care structures, with our debts, so our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily life by the same and our money they hold..
This is all of the benefit of those hyper-mega-oceans of the fresh.
As a proof of the contrary, FH said: "My enemies have no name, my enemies have no face, my enemies, is the financing."
It was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed a former Minister of Economy, Rothschild bank, a history of a better defence of the interests of banksters, only responsible for the crisis of 2007.
Has there anybody else's competence?
You call this How: Return his clothes, down his pants?
Primary and popular reaction
In fact, we don't know too much what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where did you see that?
Because the Germans refused to help survivors.
I'm not sure that Spee really rejected to help survivors.
One of the aspects of this battle is that no party seemed to be certain of the exact force of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book "Charles of Steel" suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British kitchen in the area.
The sea was wooden at the beginning of the day; I don't know if it was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the struggle ended after the sun's sleep, making any more harder rescue operations.
Compare this with the next battle, the of the Malouins, where, on photos showing survivors in being sealed, we see a peaceful and full-day sea.
Moreover, the saviors knew that there was no more German fighters in the area.
Hmm, this really does not match what I remembered about this battle, so I made a rapid research on Wikipedia:
"A certain confusion was among the German ships about the type of the two shocked crews, who had lost in the dark after shooting the shooting, and a swimming course began.
Leipzig lived something in fire, but when he approached him, he saw that it was just a sword.
Nürnberg, slower than the other German vessels, slowly join the battle and lives the Monmouth, shocked and seriously damaged but still moved.
After pointing out his projectors on the ship's board, the proposal to be rejected and opened the fire, finally covering the ship.
Without reliable information, from Spee judged that the Good Hope had to escape and stop research at 22.15 p.m.
It is worried about reports that indicates a British kitchen in the surroundings, he puts up to the north. ”
So, if that's true, the Germans, at the darkness before the raying, did not know that a ship had been filled, and therefore couldn't search for survivors.
They also thought that there was a more important kitchen of the Royal Navy in the area that had been seriously damaged them, so in confusion they were degusting to benefit their progress.
They were far away from their base, and Spee had very conscious that they should take a way through many ships of the Royal Navy.
The sacrifice of Cradock had already caused them to do so and had covered them about half of their munitions, condemning them so when they were finally taken.
A number of votes are highlighted to the UNPU to request that it be included in the law that a definitively condemned election is deemed to be definitely unlikely.
This is a courageous position, which would also touch the right left elections.
But noon, it's a blague.
FOR THE IDE AND THE PROPOSITION OF THE INSCRIPTION TO THE CONCLUSION OF MAGISTRATES
When does the prohibition of trade unions in the already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality among citizens be tolerated?
Strengthened by policies whose society's vision is limited to these sectors, people who will benefit from their inadmissibility to prevent actions of true policies, which are really trying to move things, not the beautiful speakers whose immobilism is at the extent of their sufficientness.
I met them in the metro to midday with their small pancarts of under for justice," they came from province and did not do the difference between Bercy and the POPB.
It supports the existence of political trade unions with members put their great power to the service of its party.
It would not defend the same theories if legal or extremely right signs were designated for the purpose of personalities of its border and settled against them a legal and medium-sized war.
Your confirmations are totally free.
If now, the right defeats the judiciary is just that she has made facts that resurrected it!
There is no example of the left personality that had so much to be done with the Justice but all those who have been subjected to his attention have not been treated in favour.
On the other hand, there is still a need to remember that the trade of the right to be left is not the only sign of magistrates and that it is minority.
A minister supports the trade unions with so many commitments shows how useful they can be.
@MCR The trade you cited may be minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great to the Chancellory, it is not a secret.
Now it is questioned if the "mission" of certain judges isn't going out instead of teaching.
@gus - You should be satisfied, the SM is minority.
What are you kidding?
@Pivoine: You forget that magistrates are not officials like others: they're the only ones to have the power to put it in charge and to incarcerate the whole chacun.
Jade Goody?
What if no participant would never come back?
Hello, Katie Waissel.
I believe that even the most afflicted weakness of glory is understood that X-Factor can just mean the end of a career, so I would be surprised that someone accepts the offer.
Many of them served as a tremlin to start a successful carrière.
The One Directorate is filled with the cities of the whole world.
Others then sold a lot of disks or went to West End.
Popstars, the precursor of all these programmes, launched Chreyl Cole, which is actually part of the jury.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Celine Dion, Cliff Richard, all have made the Eurovision concours, as well as others.
While others, like Frank Sinatra and all the others, participated in support in the United States.
In the 1970s and 80s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the light divertissement stars from the British television.
Of course, some have fallen in the forecast.
But this is what happens in any way to most stars that do not participate in competitions.
Rare are those who, after a tube, have succeeded in doing others.
In any way, most players / groups can better expect three albums and a best.
Yeah, but now Cole, or any of his name, has only fans in the United Kingdom.
His celebration comes in part of his marriage with a footballer who breathes through the mouth.
Most Americans know who is Jeremy Clarkson.
can not just mean the end of a carriage
In fact, it has more chance to go on a carrière than the typical rock path, even if in your dreams you think that all flyers to guide the herb in the garage of their father and balance three agreements on a primary school poem will certainly become stars and that the only question is how they want to touch before even a album.
And worse than redistributing: this establishs a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the peoples studied – a distance that looks pretty rapidly to racism, because sacralist ethnologists present us these people as an infinitely superstitious and strict ritual petries, while most of their ways are strictly equivalent to our and inspired, such as ours, of practical considerations in the daily.
Excluding that you are unreversely interpretating.
Are you, but instead of say that the smooth is deposed with holy character, is it not better to admit that our Marianne and our Molders have also a little sacred character?
Our biais is as reminded of seeing the sacred as a kind of well defined object and circumscribed to the religious sphere.
It is very interesting in what it is.
It's the ephemere for measuring the empty.
Nothing more.
Super articles, thank you.
The recent Paneonization of illustrious figures of the Republic is a illustration that the sense of holy life is always living.
Who still believes the archaeologists' interpretations!
Any other disciplinary would go to the directions of the interpretations not of any scientists who depend on the life of a mandarin, rarely less.
When is a critical compared to disciplines for a little rigour?
Because what is good for archaeology is also for the interpretations that gives the other disciplines.
This would bring a health modesty dose.
Your lack for the Archaeologists is absolutely unjust!
It is thanks to them that there are constantly discovery treasurers, valuable witnesses to reconstitute the history, including society, and the example of comparable archaeology here is passionating.
This method wasn't very old and before the archaeologists believed in their “instinct” and their knowledge, and could be wrong.
Today, there are so many technical and scientific means that the interpretation of the crowds is better but can always be released in cause by other discovery!
It is in full (and old) pollegious on the callednism extended by the presistent Jean Clottes (cf its book The Phones of Prehistory), especially the increased redistribution of the scientific controversy, compared to the editions La Maison des Roches).
Thank you for this strong instructional article
The historic men love the anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could take it.
So it's finished among us?
I don't really understand why we can't continue to three?
This newspaper is to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall in the cake level?
No, but we're not against a theatre room above.
We couldn't look at a musical commodity there above, that would be too gay!
We could wait to have such a comment from your side.
It looks like Mary Whitehouse came back from the dead.
Because your test offer is almost finished, I suggest you to go to Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more home.
He prefers mikedow.
I can suggest that we all look for a journal that pays real journalists, courageous, to write on the Middle East, Ebola, etc. to their risks and dangers.
Soon as to swim with these puerle snakes.
Not very bad.
Let's go.
If these "pottery cows" shock you so, you're not obliged to participate, aren't you?
You know also that this newspaper covers also the Middle East and Ebola and is so much possible to do both and publish an analysis article?
Is this the subject you shock, or is it the fact that people ride?
Nevertheless, we find the amateur video of the crash on the network...
The amateur video of the crash on the network...?
If the FOM has chosen not to show these images is only to protect its interests in any case of the pilot.
If the FOM wanted to protect the pilots, it would have been safe because at the time or at the other vehicle (e.g., deployed) to be on the circle.
But it had to be done soon before the typone we knew that it was coming, but for which the FOM did not have a good idea to advance the time of the start (TV, pub, money...).
But on the other hand they protect the pilots.
I also share this opinion.
But it's also that if the very British FOM comes into the SC, she will allow Nico Rossberg to have a chance to fight the English that killed then...
You leave on this blog my chart Dayrton.
But it's not serious, I have a little time to break all your c*****ries.
No, just not.
There have been many conspirations in F1, but never one who puts the Commissioners in danger of death for a distance history of the possibility of victory of a pilot in the detriment of another.
It's not the FOM that gets security because it's the FIA.
You're smelling.
In view of amazing images, the absence of images allows the IFF to avoid genital issues of the type: How does the Commissioner act with a green dragon in full intervention and continue to do it after the accident (see complete video after the accident)
No, this is not because the video is judged too violent than the FIA blocks the images of the accident, but because it is clearly seen one of the Commissioners acting a green dragon, signs that the course can normally return and that it is more under a yellow drap regime.
Some comments show a measuring shadow of F1.
Yes, car Etian, the course is no longer under the sight of yellow APRES the place of the accident, where the green dragon is actor.
That's the normal procedure.
The post of just in availability of the accident (in the cases, it may be 10 meters after the accident) affects the green to tell the pilots to get a normal alert.
The sensationalism makes sale from the pub.
Before I thought that the media were an integral part of the government's "patriotic" propaganda, but I was very afraid that, at the end, it's just for money.
And sex, don't forget sex, fear of not having sexual life, pub and media are good to sell things to improve our sexual life.
Information does exactly the same thing.
Make the buzz with information we don't really need to worry is just to continue to fear people so that we can continue to control them.
“When the tablets are all about Ebola, we all touch the fear” It should be “smile”, not “all”.
As a result of the medical reference, “allser” is better said in this context than “destroyer”.
I ask me whether all people who feel that Ebola could slow up by airways realize that they now believe in evolution?
You're doing them too honourable.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the apocalypse that is approaching.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You confond Ebola and Murdoch...
Good article, thank you!
A short and concise article that ridiculizes and pleasantly this pseudo-journalism appealing.
It made me rigour.
I am depressed that the media speak of most things with this optimism inverse.
The goal is still once again to keep us sufficiently angry and angry (such as to come to hisstery) for the government can make us disappoint when it needs.
I believe it is perfectly logical that, if we have to be a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why don't we have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any case?
It seems that this government seeks to save us from the crisis he himself invented.
Is there not something fundamentally problematic with the idea of governar by fear?
Congratulations for this post, and for being still from this world almost 35 years later.
More than the beginning of this had to be horrible, see the context of the 1980-90s.
I'm blue, living with the certainty of passing it for years...
Witness is perfectly unnecessary.
As always when we're talking about sciences.
Not only witnesses serve nothing: they can not serve scientific material.
But they have a narrow impact on the objective assessment of facts.
@trafic: witnesses cannot serve scientific material.
This may be why there are questions to patients in psychiatrist when they have reliable observations from nearby.
My psychiatric file indicates that my psychiatrist mother explains that I was telepathically educated by her beauty mother.
This is therefore an objective symptom.
When I say it's wrong, it's a subjective witness without importance.
Ah, because the certification of a fact (= here this testimony, who obtains contamination and efficiency of new treatments) does not serve anything in a scientific course?
What are you based on research, then?
About fantasms?
Are you putting on the same level of fanatist theories and facts (= giveing a verified testimony)?
"Resilience": the word bidon deducted by the grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who takes for great psychologists after having read D'anemburg.
@Jim: There are fully empty bugs in the psys.
Cyrulnik made us the “resistance. ”
As a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope he'd bear us a reliable scale of measure to quantify it, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the air sensors could all save us from Farage and company?
Doesn't you think about the American team?
Very seriously, it's not * a good idea to resort the air sensors...
And why?
It was a great series and it seems to be that those who resurrected it have conscious!
So let our salvation to all powerful who can make miracles.
But how are they going to make kids shock?
The only solution that comes to me is the kind of pipi-caca, which would kill the series.
It was already a series for children.
The kids were cut off.
Ah, because it's a series for kids?
The UKIP works for mystery.
So keep your American team.
Always in Supermartion?
It's not like if we don't see the sons and the animation is well done. :-)
I'm glad to see this (which is a adult), but I hope that this will give the idea to a chain of redistributing older people.
The series has almost never stopped being distributed here in Australia; it is at least 40 years of age that we have episodes of one hour in Saturday and Sunday at 06.00 p.m.
Since a few years ago the free digital television has been arrived, it is on one of the second order commercial chains and it is always possible to see it at these times.
And more than half hour episodes pass at 5:30 p.m. from Monday to Friday!
All right, I'm probably a 60-year-old guy, but I don't look at this series every day!
There is no "Mont of the temple" in or under the mosque of the splanades!!!!
Radical sionists invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to Jerusalem.
Furthermore, all the Israeli crowds below and around the mosque of the splanades since several decades have not been allowed to find nothing.
The mountain of the temple if there is another place.
Can you be in argentin?
This mount is not searched for the simple reason that it is the colline on which the splaned of the mosques has been built.
His sums, or Rocher's dome, are sailed in the middle of Omar's mosque.
For the Muslims, Mahomet is taken into Paradise from this rock.
For the Jews, it is the mountain of Moriah where Abraham fail and sacrificed his son Isaac.
Since it was taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, search K1K1.
Israel also takes into account his extremists, it is good to regularly remember it, and they are unfortunately related to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahou, who had accepted the plan to 2 states, and has continued to discuss it!).
It is also good to show how it is not a peaceful fact in Jerusalem.
Can God recognise hisselves?
The shortest Jewish blague: "God be loved!"
To spend the tourism in Israel, young naïdes are often shown to us in the middle of the beach.
The reality is, as normally, different from what we show advertising, as we can see on the picture that illustrates the article.
It's a little scared at once.
And this photo is a wonderful propaganda work!
It hurts that the photo of Reuters did not take the hundreds of Palestinians authorized to return to the mountain of the temple and prefer to cast the Jews in contrabase, praying to the Wall of Lamentations.
@Mat, if this photo distracts you, it's right, it's not the newspaper, nor the photograph, but this woman and ideology that she has to be sentenced.
This system is not tensible and will end in loud.
The only way to end this system is the revolution.
Since the economy seems to be broken, large enterprises have greatly benefited from their employees.
They succeeded to convince their employees that they had the opportunity to have a job and that they can't allow to increase payments, while at the same time and without hiding, they gave a more significant payment to the small eleite at the top.
You're right, it's not delicate, but it's not gonna change in this country only when workers will really speak of a single voice.
Instead of riding and gendering when someone else does the grief, support them, show a little solidarity and understand that their grief is not only about their problems, but also shows your employer that people are not uncomfortable.
Except if we leave the democracy, wherever if, it's quite intensive.
I am totally agreed.
The only thing you forgot is that British and American enterprises have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are worse.
Like China and India.
All this can't be done.
That's because we're in democracy that took it.
Have you voted for the PTCI?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (PTCI) aims to increase the benefits of companies detained by these people in short-term circulation of national governments by secret courts.
This seems unbelievable, but this is exactly what the mechanism for a regulation of differences between investors and States (ISDS) proposed by the Agreement.
The Greens are against this project and try to advertise people about the immaginable degradations that this agreement will have on our lives.
It is just recently started to talk in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement So look at these links and you will understand what is being negotiated in your two.
Didn't Churchill say "the blood, the laugh and the laughs"?
That's that makes extraordinary cuts, while the digital money has no reason to cut down and even less powder on the trees.
The next weak maillon will certainly be the market of the car.
This man had the right, at XVIII, there were trade unions in all regimens.
In the very French Catholic Army, there is a sacrifice dimension.
Let it (finally, his officers, others, no one knows anything) believes the strength of the eternal values of France, and it will fight and shut up.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the value crisis, shortly: the dilution of the nation's idea, have this small crystal, is comfortable.
Even if for her, it's even more inconfortable...
They're still missing you the synagogue of married men, celibatary, married women, celibatarys, lost dogs and I don't know what yet.
If you don't write the French correctly, I'm singing.
You're warned, it's your fault.
For the defence of categoryal interests, the protected professionals with trade unions have been sufficiently undergoing, which has created a rupture of equality with other citizens.
It is requested not to ride for the fear of the risk of a official.
It is very well to imagine a system that ensures a certain freedom of expression without syndicates, or then without the right to grieve as in Germany, in contrast with the protection they play.
Except assured disaster.
And with the charrets that are preparing, the government welcomes it.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance in reality...
I don't know Sybille's ignorance, I made an allusion to military and other officials, because it's the subject here commented...
Delete the "intermediate of its delegates" in article 8 of the Constitution of 1946.
It will be : "8.
Any worker participates in the collective determination of working conditions and business management."
This is absolutely essential with the irruption of the informative power.
And yet you have opened, likely to read, then commented a specific article entitled The Great British Bake Off review.? ???????
Wait, the section was there, all empty.
I thought we had to start the conversation.
In any way, it's Joffrey's wedding I looked at, and I can tell you that some have been sought.
In the episode of Joffrey's marriage we have one of the best moments (cooic tromper: it was wine) in the story of the television.
So, the ball mmmh...
Thrones game!
I love GBBO!
It's the second time of fun that, slowly, the emission ends with a most worse victory of the swimming; no one has done a sort of "boom, that's my sweet smell now and swing before your master"!
Maybe the additional pressure of friends and parents outside has finally affected them?
Previous weeks, all these external persons were held differently.
And there's also this idea of "speaking security, always the next week" that disappears the last week.
I like kitchen, but I don't think I'm infringing this.
I am grateful to those who do it and thus offer us a great divert and tried to try new things.
Previous for GBBO 2015!
I agree, the last challenge of the last year, the marriage gateway, was absurd.
Professionals generally put days to do, and they had to break up at 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really difficult to start, I don't know how they could choose a winner.
Chez Luis, the only real defect they found was a little sweet base (which I agreed with Hollywood to say that the green glass on the moulin of Richard did not live, in any way Richard had already lost at that time).
I have to say that several challenges in this series appear a little artificial because of the time that is imposed.
There's also the cancer that leads, with the sun wind cuts.
Decisively, all of us are successful at this time.
A bad moment to pass for humanity, we hope.
You confound sun winds and ultraviolet radiates.
UVs are mainly blocked by the ozone shooting that is fairly formed by the impact of residue sun wind and UV.
So even if the magnistic field was fail, there was no enough solar wind to "have" the ozone of the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and therefore less UV and "cancer".
Happy that the ozone bag does not block UVs.
They have a lot of useful functions you don't suspect.
If we are limited to humans, they are interested in allowing us to have oses (Vitamin D synthesis), to shoot us (other than the infrared), to modify our immunity system and, it seems to be, to improve our moral.
The ozone locking UVC cancer and let the UVA and most of the UVB pass.
You know that you are not obliged to be condemned and to consider your interlocutor as a stayer when you make a comment?
Overall for a smaller specification that was underlined in the comment, which itself hears proof of pedagogy.
Without saying that I'm a melanom habit, the UV only makes ACCELER its development.
They're not provoquént.
For evidence: all blonded people have not forced melams.
It's, when a toubib tells you that we need to avoid the sun and live at the bottom of a cave, it's better not to listen because the UVs are necessary to all humans.
The exception, on the other hand, is like all: he kills.
But for other reasons.
UVs directly cause the melam.
Can we get it?
And more importantly, can we pass it to the mixer?
or pass him to the mixer...
I believe that most of the interested people have established that everything can be increased if sufficient strength is applied and the robustness of iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable for the use of which it is intended.
I believe that the army would need something more resistant and has not yet adopted iPhone6 as a first line communication equipment.
But for us otherwise,
It's a good choice.
The majority of those interested have established that everything can be increased if sufficient force is applied.
Except a Nokia 3310.
More specifically, is it already expanded?
This blague is made in each debate.
I decided to tell them.
It's the fourth blue on the adjacent I've read in the comments today.
It's difficult to understand how a prototype can be distributed like this.
Before specific software is installed, it is imagine that the phone has been removed from the main production chain and that is badly seeing how it could be returned.
So, uh, mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm......
The most likely is that it is a production unit on which iOS has not been installed correctly and therefore is covered with the installed plant test code.
I don't know how they do these things.
But would they put test software on all?
Ebay photos clearly show the lack of FCC or CE logo and the presence of a red prototype connection.
ah the article for bobo by extraordinary.
We want few cherished products and we are surprised that industrials produce in » industrials' It's put forward or but all teachers and smaller trade are interested How to swim good, bio Avac 1650€ (Med salary in France)?
But to answer your post, if it is possible to eat correctly with a small salary.
After each one is free to put his priorities there where he hears it.
For my part, it's one.
Go without punishment, I'll smell you
Bobos, or better boboes, are called people who see the world through an ideological 'software' that leads them to deconnect realities.
That's the total degroupment of thought-reson.
They are experts in gesticulation, for example they intend to save the planet because they avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in Tartuferia, joining the left-caviar, which are sometimes discovered, for example condemning CO2 rejections while passing their holidays to Maldives.
The large majority of our citizens does not support this mixed ideology of sovereignty and tatuory ideology so that don't be surprised to meet critics about them.
Waouh, thanks for this complete and exhaustive theory, as well as for all related details (avion, shower...).
I would like to be part of it, but I don't find it.
The concept is not so complicated.
Boboecols are monobloc.
Did you understand the concept of the coffee left?
And you are able to understand the concept of boboecolo.
It's the perfect copy with just a ideological nuance.
The classification would be more complicated if we were interested in short schools.
Boboecolo is actually part of but is only the most visible franchise of schools because it is the one that infectes the media.
It's a beautiful turn.
Apparently, no one wants to look at this turnafe in face.
She's so bad that she looks like a nine woman.
Chut, you're next to the plate.
It must be part of the art microcosm to understand the surprising beauty of the truth of this work.
But you just have no legitimacy to make a comment because you have not been innumerable for decades to study and flat great artists.
It is not the fact that Emin does not know drawing and always seems obsessed by the same subject.
The important thing is that she has really succeeded to become fabulously rich and famous by having no artistic capacity.
That's, it's of *l'art*.
No, it's cotton.
The fact that Emin does not know drawing
This isn't really a deceitful fact.
This is instead a view.
Except if the only thing you can appreciate is real playings of dogs that smoke by playing at billard.
Judging the art may be difficult, but not in that case.
Drawing, it's much more than just representing the real.
If you're looking for just this, a photo is going to do this.
The author also speaks of Emin's expression.
Look again and let the image speak of yourself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you may prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There are also economies: equation activities, the number of horses of the Republican garden or the status of the generals that aren't in active service....
(The honestity is to say that France reduces its effectiveness, but as all countries have done, sometimes more dramaticly, to begin by Great Britain.
It's only half-encouraged...
The operational without support, it's quick to find its limits!
A unique approach, at the time when we observe weaknesses, the insufficientness of our defence tool, especially in Sahel.
A bad cut for the relevant local collectives, who lose a dimension of their activities, or a part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctuary?
@edmond: It's good what I said, look at anywhere to make economies but especially not at home, at me it's really not possible...
That's exactly what you propose to do, see otherwise where dogs are certain.
That all those who have covered little or proof the military thing come to say here, the eyes in the eyes that there's no money weared in this perimeter, and that's without smiling...
As regards the same position to all public functions and public finances will be a little better.
And for Josi: Very relaxed: look at the inflation of public jobs in the other departments and you will understand why Defense can consider a bit loaded!
Ben yes, the economies on which everyone agrees to say that we need to do it, but that's what it looks like, right?
There's no powder, those on who it gets to the murder when it comes home, the poor ones.
It should be done but especially that it does not go above me because, in this case, it is a crime and not an economy.
Gugnols, go!
What to shut the Grace Val will fail our defense tool to Sahel?
In the case of local communitys, history is repeated to each post, maternity, hospital, hospital.
But everyone is for the economics quite listening.
It is strange, a major UMP who wants compensation and does not enjoy the economy carried out in the public expenditure.
This article is really the most amazing thing I never read!
This shocking moment where the first three people who comment the same bad blague.
It is the depression to discourage his face Facebook and to see that 80% of his friends started their statutes by the phrase “This unfortunate moment.”
I think they're going to make a movie.
It will certainly be based on hilarance scenes where someone shoots on his ex in the bus by walking to work and only takes account of the fact that his shooting is returned to his shoot.
It's not funny, it's completely con.
Nevertheless, I think the author adopts the role of the typical British man who has always been learned to strike his emotions and to shut the dents.
I'm sure if you're a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of his return to the scene after 25 years of absence was something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now in the heart of a battle to know who has the rights?
I don't have the Internet.
So I don't think I can't comment.
You don't have a computer.
Oh, my God, I have to see this movie before I die!
I can't believe how this article is the most amazing thing I never read!
Charlie really has shown that it is all above the top of the cosmic universe that is satiric journalism!
I'm going to get it back!
I must be able to share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so they finally have the illumination and discover the unbelievable fulfilment and the unperpassable genius that shoes from Mr Brooker's clavier as a divine light.
Oh, my God, it was really noble.
Of course, if it's not women, nor travesters.
I'm a parasites.
This demonstrates a positive development within democracy: the dimension of regional policies and effective associative initiatives.
Until the new order, we make the right to save our planet by States that play tortuffs at each meeting to save the planet.
We therefore decide, citizens, to take things into hand.
With the Commissioner they planned to energy, all these beautiful recommendations were bound ....
Translated by Eolians and Soldiers are the Round Points tomorrow.
All financed by the con-dependent.
Please stop this pronucleary talk.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactive activity is much more nervous at the level of its waste and in the case of accident.
While the subsidiary is not mastered in its integrity, it should be better to limit the laboratory.
Renewable energys are our only salvation, with a clearly decrease of our consumption.
The electricity by the renewable to combat CO2 emissions?
France is nothing concerned.
Nuclear electricity is CO2 emission to production and epsilon for other stages.
The electricity by the elolic or PV renewable is already more than GES on other stages, especially the gas, or worst carbon as in Germany, to compensate the interim.
Replace the nuclear by the elolic or PV renewable would go against the fight against CO2.
Christial I'm not insulting you, I'm a state doctor in physical sciences 1981 more I've done nuclear physical research I've put you the challenge to prove to read instead of what I've said.
For what I did not say is you who prepare me ideas I didn't say anything about Germany in fact you have not answered to what I said and as all people of right to democrate the speaker I never do it.
I also cite to you the conclusion of experts mandated by the German Government: the current German renewable energy programme is a non-renewable and inefficient means to reduce GES emissions and should be arrested.
0 Emission if you do not contain the extraction of the uranium and construction and if you don't contain the gas vessel of lower effect that Co2 is true to the two thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear central in water vacuum and a little in the waters of the rivers.
I stopped reading when you talked about Pakistan as a "a gentleman of South Asia"...!!
The last time, Pakistan wined Hindustan.
This is not mysterious, most of the Indians who have comments wanting to read and comment only on articles against Pakistan.
In fact, it's good to show your mind status.
It would have been like if they had qualified India of South Asia's Gender...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players participate, but have a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply open a full Pandore box of corruption and mafiosi.
With regard to ISL, today's opening match was amazing, the Colkata Athletic is 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a lot of ways to do.
In comparison with milliards and milliards that India offers to IPL's cricket and now on football, how we could reval with our "bruying neighbors"...
The low-cost course is payable for cash.
Damn for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the lack of event is shown only with a cold helium.
So we may not be in a defect of design, but implementing...
On the contrary to arial space, which is a private company, it seems well that sozous belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here the state is his own assurance.
They may go pay the satellites in sweats that you know..
This is so easier than many media take the only titles of articles - and many readers have only these titles.
In total this creates an incorrect impression against the content of the article itself.
In fact, indeed, the title is not appropriate, it is injustly concerned with the project, while it is just a launcher problem.
