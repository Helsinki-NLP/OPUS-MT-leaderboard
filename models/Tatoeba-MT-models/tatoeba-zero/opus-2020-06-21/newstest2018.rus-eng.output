The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, signed the Act on the introduction of administrative responsibility for violation of the deadline and order of payment of goods (work, services) in purchase for public and municipal needs.
The law aims at addressing the extreme difficulty of non-compliance with its claimants with the implementation of State and municipal purchases.
Another two years ago, the situation when the entrepreneurs were not able to receive payment for the already implemented public and municipal contracts.
Then the President of Russia appointed the Advocate-General to address the issue of special control.
Because the businessmen themselves couldn't take account of unreasoned claimers who had not been supported by contract financing, they all tried to abstense from payment obligations and included in the treaties of illegal conditions.
The problem was generally in the country.
Since 2015, the prosecutor ' s prosecutor ' s payments for public complaints has been provided, as a result of their consideration of the discriminatory responsibilities, 4.5 million officials at the Administrative 533, in the investigative bodies for the organization of procedural checks, 75 materials have been condemned, for 46 criminal cases.
In conclusion, the debt was deemed to the employees for more than 66 billion rubbers.
These huge amounts were not covered by non-payment of multimillional contracts.
In the basic debts, numerous, systematic delays for entrepreneurs' payment services have been made to where more modest amounts were paid.
That's a personal case.
The Small Corporation Manufacturer wins competition for social transport services to a number of millions of rubbers.
The man put all its trade funds, fully complied with the obligations but was not received by the amount of money.
The result is a long-term financial composition of payments, taxes and credits that would lead to banking if the entrepreneur is not in charge.
Now, in a number of regions, the problem has been maximumly reduced.
However, at the first half of 2017, a joint amount of debt for public and municipal contracts identified by the Prosecutors of the Russian Federation was about 27.4 billion rule.
In regions where debt indicators continue to achieve critical values, the prosecution works in the ruling anti-crisis management regime.
The General Prosecutor is individually visiting meetings with the representatives of the local authority, which are subjectly selected by all the offenders of violations and measures to immediately eliminate them.
These operational meetings have already been held in Yaroslave and Ecatherinburgh this year.
The principal improvement of payment disciplinary of public claims can implement Federal Law No. 189-FZ " The amendments in the Russian Federation on Administrative Criminal Discrimination in the part of the Administrative Responsibilities of officials in violation of the duration and order of payment of goods (work, services) in the purchase of public and municipal needs, which was signed in the past week by the President of Russia.
The draft law was developed by the Russian Minnesome Development on Génprocoration initiative.
The new law complements the Code of the Russian Federation on administrative offences, which provides the cost of 300,000 to 500,000 rules for violation of the officials of the time and order of payment of goods, jobs and services in public and municipal purchases.
And if the official has already been sentenced to an administrative punishment for similar offences, it is expected to dismiss the duration of one year to two years.
All assignments of the Russian Federation have already been assigned to ensure the use of these legislative novels in practice.
The Civil Rights Group announced a warning to move to Missouri
The National Association for the Progress of the Flower People has published warnings for people traveling to Missouri, because of the discrimination policy of the State and the attacks on racism.
The Declaration of the Group calls on: "African travellers, guests and citizens of the Missouri State are particularly careful and enhanced in the state journeys with regard to a number of doubts in the racism, recently present places in the entire territory of the State and in the country. "
According to the National Association of Promoting the Progress of the Flower People, proclaiming the movement warning of the group has recently established the Mixture Act, which has made people more difficult to win discrimination and that the legal authorities of the State are often elected by their representatives of minorities.
“ You have a violation of human rights.
They stop on the roads because of the skin, kill them and kill them,” reports the Cansas City old, Rod Chapel, President of the National Association for the Progress of the Misury People.
"We hear complaints often as ever."
This is the first warning of such a kind announced by the United States State.
The Panel focused on incidents such as the reduction of black students on racial signs at the University of Missouri and the death of the 20-year-old Thory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances that year ago after he ended the benzine during the state journey, and the police arrested him without a crime accused.
The warning also indicates the recent report of the General Prosecutor of the Missouri State, which is likely to be stopped on the road for black drivers to 75 per cent above than for whites.
“ The purpose of warning that people are aware of the situation and warning their parents and friends and colleagues about what may happen in Missouri, ” said Chapel.
“They must be prepared or otherwise, whether they take money for the loan or report to the parents that travel to the territory of the State.”
According to the last report of the FBI report on hate crimes, 100 crimes were registered in Missouri for 2015, which makes the state sixty-first in the State, including such violations.
The movement warning is also a response to the new Missouri State law, which would be more difficult to restore the case against the legal person in relation to housing or working discrimination.
The American Civil Freedom Union (ACLU) previously announced warnings for travellers in Texas and Arizona after the new immigration control laws that the local laws prescribed to arrest persons for immigration laws that, in view of the ACLU, should increase the number of checks on racial signs.
Transition warnings are generally issued by the State Department in respect of other countries, but recently public organizations have been in response to specific laws and trends within the United States.

The Russians supports the abolishment of free shipping laws for non-road aircraft

"It must be able to create conditions for which a person who has no bag may buy a dechevel either the one with the shuttle," he stressed (quote for TASS).
Mr. Safons said that, despite the fear of the citizens, pay for the shipping of high clothes and mobile phones is not necessary.
"It would be right to calm all our citizens and tourists and say that it's the top clothes, the zones, the mobile phone, the episode or even any computer's relationship," said the Chief of Russianism.
The previous President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, has signed the law which provides the right to aircraft to exclude the rules of free-free shipping in the aircraft.
It is the case that the aircraft may determine the number of locations and the weight of the bags included in an unexpected tariff.
Vladimir Putin ordered to eliminate the pollution of Baykal
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, at the Baykal Protection Meeting, reported that in recent years, significant areas of the sea were extremely contaminated.
It was mandated to determine the sources of financing, plans and executives to eliminate pollution.
Mr. Putin also urged the full correction of the polluted territories.
The President ' s 'REA News ' s "which should also be identified with the objectives that continue to work here, purified weapons of most of them.
He also added that the General Prosecutor of Russia had to conduct a audit on the identification of environmental harmful activities.
In his words, there are problems related to the emergence of natural calamities and a number of distant environmental violations.
"I would like to emphasize this: not all the substances to check, but the measures are also necessary to know here, but it is illegal and environmentally harmful activities and take appropriate measures," he stressed.
Previously, the GhanProcurator reported that fish stocks were reduced in the Baykal Lake and proposed to increase the number of plants under environmental supervisions.

It was reported to him about the matter of business in the island of Olhon, which is in the Baycale Natural Territory.
The Head of Minor Prostitute of Sergey Donski immediately suggested that the problem was addressed by the determination of the Bahamas waterfrontier, but the Government of Buratia recalled that this change was inadequate because restrictions were related to a number of regular acts.

The new temple will come in Jugree
In the village of Sweden, communities from the representatives of the small indigenous peoples of the North, Rahthenia, together with the people of the Belarus area, participate in the construction of the Orthodox temple for the honour of the holy honour of Nicola Chidobuchi.
His location is a certain beach, the temple will be well seen away, so it will serve fishermen for a traveling maich.
According to the representatives of the communities, the construction work has been completed in this year, and now the cowboy has been established, and the church colleagues exist.
The ECB fleet had transportation.
Kram was appointed to the holy Nicola Chidocre, because it is read by the Orthodox Church as a traveller, including fishermen.
In the world, the fisheries also provides work to the employees, and they are covered.
Local inhabitants are waiting when the temple opens their doors, and children even write to school associations about it as a local ability.
Disneyland with death penalty.
Why are Singapore respecting the laws?
I'm talking to the local employee Changom, sit in a shopping air.
Changing the situation in Singapore, it smokes one smoke for the other, and the oaks are attractively constituted in its hidden office.
After the end of the conversation, the businessman is sent to the nearest urn, 100 meters to it, and he elects the shoes there.
The Chang reports that the shipment in the public place is $500.
You know, I've just developed a reflex: I can't leave a fan from the box to the bridge.
And now all the video cameras.
And the Singapore troops are really clean in the center of the city, like in the museum.
Chang says: three months ago, his 18-year-old son, his neighbourhood, described the wall of the old colonial building.
The court acknowledged a man who was blessed by the Vandalism and condemned the park.
What?
Imagine yourself.
He received ten shocks of a wooden ball in the jungle and held a week in prison.
We don't have a rational punishment.
As in Singapore, the higher level of life and unlikely ridicule laws have been covered at the IAF summary site.
There's no one who thinks to abolish the death penalty, explains the lawyer Victor Li Hong.
And the Government has long referred to the view of the European Union and the United States in this regard.
If a person transports a large party of drugs or sells it, he is a slaughter.
In 2002, the 22-year-old citizen of Australia was detained in the Change Airport, with 400 g of cocaine.
The Australian prize was held in his protection, threatening sanctions, international rights defenders and even the Pope of Rome.
However, the man was still pregnant.
After that, the narcotics of our country strictly turn into the side.
The following is: Singapore states that the laws are required to comply with the ECE, not only modest and sky-based people.
I don't care who you're a million, a Vice-Premier, a known artist or a Euroes people.
One option in this case: if you find a cocaine powder, you'll be all right.
When you go to Singapore and meet some warnings, you're just wondering how much it's in the city of State forbidden!
For example, the skin is sold only in pharmaceuticals and can be purchased by a doctor.
The kitchen's tour will not be discarded, but the "resink" should be shooted in the metro, the cost of $1,000.
For four days, I met two people with white tablets on the shirt, "I'm shooting."
For a shooting shooter, more than a straff often calls for the shooter: a week to remove parks and shoots.
6.000 Rub. pays the " criminal " forgotten to shut the water in the public toilet, and when trying to make a small need in the lift of the house, a special detector is blocked by the door and sends a signal to the police.
The total exotic laws include the prohibition of blue in the street, the public performance of the songs and even the excessive heat of the room plant (!).
In avoiding the fire of the smokers, it is not possible to shoot in metro, other than 5 thousand Singapore taxes.
In general, there's a thought: if you're trying, you're supposed to be a violation of something.
This is not true, - it's trying to discover me Mohammed Kabi-Kajaria, the owner of the local tourism.
Especially fantastic laws exist only on the bowl, and in the past twenty years, I have not seen that somebody could be violated.
Why do they keep?
To let the citizens do not shut up.
In compliance with the basic rules, there is no compliance.
As a result, if the young man is sold in smoke, it will be punished by all the ceilings: the master of the shop will pay a great amount, the offender will receive the shooting on the "day" shuttle and the seller will also put and settle in prison.
That is very rare because of the so serious laws of crime in Singapore.
Is that correct?
In the past seventy years, we had a chaos on the streets - automobilists ignored the lights, moved as they wanted, sit down on the rule.
After a year’s breakout, it has been a lot of trouble.
Now the driver, drinking a visa portion, knows: if they stop, the police will not leave the shooting, put the cost of the apartment, and they are sent for years.
Many foreigners in South-East Asia seem to be a variety of concentrations.
In 1993, the American writer William Gibson called Singapore "Desnesland with Death Crime" - a guest from the United States has caused fear of the general richness of the people, the "purer airport" and the "outular nature".
Debates of such things are artificially insecurity, and there should be no principle.
The first days in Singapore, and you're sure you're afraid to leave a paper on the throat, you're hiding if you're coming to the metro with a marine.
But then you go to the small Indian area, and then the model explosion, and the car stops are shocked.
"What's this?" - You're surprised.
That's how -- the singapores are shiny.
Everything's going to be.
Not for any such "criminality" to be adopted on the place, but you must know: if you are calculated, you're not going to disrupt, because you have violated the law.
It's just enough to make a man feel normal.
It is certain that the authority of Singapore is fully authorized.
But you know what?
In Viet Nam, I moved very carefully - the motorcycles often cut off the hands of Smartphones and cameras.
In the centre of Paris, the bombs and requests are full.
They're not all trying to shoot up on our streets.
However, Singapore has become the most peaceful, clean and safe city on earth through the assembly of dragons and disgraceful (related to death) laws.
You're thinking about it.
Such human nature: Remember, and no one in Russia was shocked by the rule until it was slaughtered.
Although the main part of Singapore is not the rape, but the voluntary compliance with the laws.
And we should think that people in Russia would also be pleased in the clean streets, the absence of a metro, and welcome those who spend a lift with a public toilet.
There's a physical punishment - thank you, don't.
In the rest of the Singapore laws the minimum stands for them.
No holy thing?
The White House of Trampa is now inclined to the Freedom Statute.
The most reliable sign of the regime is when it begins to fight statistics.
Americans do not understand it worse than all of the other -- the theatrical contribution of Saddam Hushin's statue in the Firdos area in Bagdad in 2003.
Steven Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Government of Trampa, knew uncertainly what he had done when he put a symbolic point on the Free status during the disaster interference with the journalist CNN Jim Acoty on the proposals of the President on the Reducing of Legal Migration.
We're honest, Miller hasn't tried at the same statue.
The largest owners of passenger ships and artists, pictured by the Freedom Statute, would be cut it if he tried to do so.
But he tried to make her meaning, and in particular to the meaning that she was appendixed in 1903, 17 years after the currency was completed, when the text of Emma Lazarus was added.
Miller said to Acosta, "I don't want to get in a deep story, but the State of Freedom is... the symbol of American freedom that saves the world.
It was added later and not part of the original status of freedom."
Miller made the facts right, but as he himself said, it's not really the story.
It is about the current sound of the voice of Lazarus, the only ones in which the State is invited not any immigrant but the poorest: "There are your lips, your poor, / your dreams, / the unfortunate displacement of your powerful beaches".
There's never been any "unfortunate displaces" on our screens.
Miller didn't care for literature, and he realized that these people are not waiting for in America.
This is a part of a broader political and cultural war, which is really the counter-American sense.
Lazarus, and her friends, fighting for putting her words to the statue after her death, were very good to understand what they do.
The sculpture was intended to mark the relationship between the French and American Republic with a classical image of the Free Women.
Lazarus changed its meaning: the women ' s figure is not Abstract, and it has a voice.
And she received a complete name: the mother of the Exiled.
The association of shocking and image was a slight pheminist path and a devastating attack against American tacticism.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statistics, the right to change it back.
In 2010, Rash Limbo, his kind of John Baptist, who had brought to Trampa's arrival, said that nobody would like to invite it to be a early non-consistent non-consistent who was covered by the shore of the Americas in the dark world: " Freedom goes forward.
It has a set of freedoms from the United States to the rest of the world.
The Faculty does not need to shine the way to the United States."
Limboa's transmission was really in the point.
The meaning of the status depends exclusively on the point of view.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see her as they would have seen, unfortunate, but full hopes of people on the ships after a long and often heavy slope.
This means literally to look at the world by the eyes of people who are looking for rescue and chances for the best life.
Its article answers the words of hope and hospitality that they are dreaming to hear.
And of course, it's not the prospect that Miller and Tramp ever wanted to recognise.
Their faculty is necessary not to stream the way, but to wipe out hatred, which is the only source of their strength.
The World Champion 2017: Nil Blake apprecies the Skotlandian members of the collection of Britain.
Alid Doyle remembers the time when only two Skotlands were in the assembly.
Nil Blake, director of the Federation of Athletics of Britain, stated that 16 of the Skotlandic part of the World Championship would produce a "important contribution to the team game".
The low number of Skotland lifts was selected for the start of the London Championship in Tuesday 2017.
Blake believes that Skotland is "also special" and that the Federation of a easy attraction should take into account.
"We know that and try to understand, and we will support until they have the capacity," said Blake.
"I spoke to people at the Skotland Institute, and they think it is related to what they did.
The Skotland Federation is thinking that they have to work with what they have done.
The British Federation of Athletics, which they have done, needs to work.
And people on the street think that's the same.
I don't know why the circumstances were so shocked, but it's perfectly smelling."
Some of the Skotlands claim to meali, including Lora Mure and Andre Bayer, who will compare Mr. Mo Faroch at a distance at 5000 m; and Elid Doyle chose the team to the Captain.
"Elyd's mutilating.
Her captain was great," says Blake.
" Many lifts, unlike their shocks or no, and from where they live or train, have been out of this room, feeling proud and stipulate to win.
"Alid's earliest emotions and sincere feelings were wonderful."
The manufacturer of a silver meal champion of the Society, who will fly at its fifth Champione of the world at 400 meters away, says that 16 Skotlands in the British collection are "incredibly".
The previous refund for the world championship was equal to seven, 1983 and 2005.
Laura Mur, a specialized fleet in a medium-term distance and killed five British and two European recurses last year.
She'll run up to 1500 and 5000 meters.
Chris O'Her, who will participate in the rent of 1500 meters, is another Skotlandian whose attention was to the shooting season, which was winned for the selection of the British collection and the annual conceptions.
Doyle recalls her first world champion, when Lee McConnel was the only Skotlander in the team.
The captain's team says that she is "incredibly proud" that so many of its co-technicians were not only in the collection, but they will in some cases claim to meal and fight for the end.
"The Chief of the Collection selects other team members, so it was in any case a great honor, but I know that your friends have made a statement for you and for you, that's a perfect person for me," she added.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the Skotlandians who entered the assembly.
This shows how much we've been.
And they're all the light boards that will try to spend on the shooting.
What about my captain?
Yeah, I think she was good.
I just pointed out that we were very glad to take home Championite of the world.
So it's just how it's important to receive support from the farmers and use what we're talking again on the Olympic Stadium.
I got another chance to go to his jungle and to participate in the conceptions, and the atmosphere will be wonderful."
Blocking critics in Facebook: you should not go to public position if you are not ready to listen to the critics from the electors
The founder of our country understood that it was a critical press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not prevent them to criticize it from the internal policy to its political principles.
His criticism, of course, was disappointed.
But he didn't smell his critics.
Because, in 1783, Washington said, "It can take the freedom of speaking and of us, deep and smell, leads to war."
Now I'm going to go to the Governor Maryland Larry Hogan, who would try to be more like Washington.
The underlying Hogans blocked and stolen at least 450 people who expressed their view on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Civil Freedom Union gave it to the court.
The underlying Governor called the search for nothing, and the comments in the Internet were written in the spirit "no and what".
"It's just Facebook," they say many.
But it's also important.
And it's especially important when it's talking about the Hogan guy.
It is a surprising popular Republic-Rubernamentary in the democratic advantage of the State.
He is in the second place of approval among 50 gouverneurs of the country.
Hogan isn't an incredible reactioner.
He demonstrated a strong hand in the management of the state and commitment to its principles.
He also uses the Facebook as a primary way to link his electors and shocks on his page, and shows his voice after the chemistry of his head.
Thus, blocking people coming to the Governor's page, which is declared as an official public forum and carried out by the Administration for money payers, is unnecessary and finally harmful.
In the Vasington Post interview, Amilia Ches protected the Governor's action, claiming that the commenting block was just their modernisation.
But it's too easy - to use the throle images, spammers and the chatters that slaughter in the Internet.
Post talked to some of the real people who blocked Hogan.
And that's the real people that aren't thrown, the teachers, the businessmen, the pastors, who are treating their elected leaders.
All of them say that their comments were respectful, contagious and not cruel.
The pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to the fact that Hogan is Catholic.
The lawyer Lakshmi Sharma Raman, in Bowey, Maryland, had not expressed hatred but asked for a crime of hate.
"I wrote a strict comment that I have disappointed the lack of his reactions to hate crimes and to other news of the last time," she wrote in the commentary section to the Post article.
"I also don't like the idea that when many people leave comments on one and the same topic, some say that it is so shocked, instead of admitting that they have the case with a large group of unvoluntary citizens."
That the underlying Governor is called "concentred spam attack", others probably would be called "active life position".
In the ear of the Facebook, it is easy to raise its image, just block critics or strike negative comments.
It is much less pool than before it was required to send people, gather and smell newspapers with critical precautions or arrest and smell the Protestants.
But that's exactly what happens now, just in the number.
Hogen is not the first person who criticizes that he doesn't want to listen to Facebook and others.
The President of Trumpus was pronounced for Twitter users who were engaged in his Twitter account.
One of the first, returning decisions on the subject was adopted at Virginia this week.
According to the U.S. Environment Court of Alexandria James C. Casheris, the President of the Chart Council, Laudon, has violated the First Amendment, invoked the electioner in his Account in the Facecbook.
And in Kentucky, the Republicn Gouverneur Mattu Bevin, a claim for the American Union for the Protection of Citizens' freedoms for his behavior in Facebook and Twitter.
This should not be so difficult.
During the era of Washington, the accessibility email costs were almost the same as the Internet today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers grew four, and the authors of anonymous letters were strongly violated by its authority.
And even then, Washington had an anonymous trills.
People under the pseudo-annual "Juricola", "Valius", "Belizarius" and "Porcius" writed a letter in the newspapers expressing the decision of Washington.
According to the historical documents collected by the Online Documents of George Washington, his chain was engaged by the complaints that criticize his position on the Treaty on friendship, trade and maritime.
But he didn't try to stop them.
The freedom of speaking, the uncognition and the statements are based on our State.
And the true leadership means agreed with that.
Ron Rafferty is hoped to work in the Rensance Club
The former European champion, Ronald Rafertti, is expected to be shocked in three days when the Renesens club in Eastern Latvia takes twenty-fifth Skotlandic golf turin for old sportsmen.

Return to this hole of the world is magnificent.
It's a nice place for golf games.
Remembers last year are returned, and for me and my wife, Sheron, was a special impression to win in the past year.
It was a very special time, and we will always remember it."
Returns to the battle of the country, Gary Orr, joined to the European Tourism for older sports, after 50 years ago.
This event will be his first appearance in skotland with the time-time tour "Abreden Asset Management Scottish Open" in 2013.
“ When you play home, it's always a little more important, ” said Helensboro Orr.
"You want to be good, but you're feeling that more burden."
I played with great joke again, and I showed a good golf.
"I am satisfied as everything is received."
In the field of this triumph, the former winner of the Tour of Masters and the Champion of Mayor for old sports Paul Broadhardt, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNalty.

All income are coming to the British Cancer Fund.
The British roads are learning to reduce harmful emissions
The forming tunnels over magistrates that are able to pull carbon oxide cars are already tested on the roads of Britain.
The Country Trade Agency, as reports the Autocar publication, has noted the positive results of the 100 meter tonne testing set on one of the shoes in the northern country.
The tunnel is 6 meters (6 m) of new polymer materials that can absorpte harmful substances contained in car rentals.
However, the establishment of the entire network of these tunnels is only part of the extensive measures that the authorities of the United Kingdom will take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the network of tunnels, the Englishs are planned to expand the network of loading stations for mobile motors, to launch a number of activities on road reduction, to expand the use of commercial traffic on electric freight and to modernize the park of heavy cars.
Official statistics, four of all polluted atmosphere are being transported, and the unpleasant air quality is due to 400,000 premature deaths per year.

The 28-year-old Anton Mamaev was sentenced to four and a half years of punishment with the removal of punishment in the colony of the general regime for a disaster, whose victim became an ex-special fighter.

Poorness and death in the Indonesian “soil land”
Preparing for dinner, Bardin Degey does not use a sweet.
She's even rarly useful.
In his village house in Enerotaly, the capital of Paniy, in the Indian province of Papua, the household is usually a swimming card, which is called "note" right in the eye.
After half an hour, the swimming clubs get and eat with unconscious hands.
Degey is sit on a landside field - it's not there - and here she works at home, such as a sweet water clothes from a neighborhood.
The slaughter serves in the room without snakes.
She was the youngest of four women of her husband, and therefore she didn't have to work in the field.
Many of them have been distributed.
Of course, working afternoon may be dangerous: many men from this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are soldiers.
“Nobody decides to walk in the village after five nights,” she says.
This is a remarkable opportunity to look at a daily life in the higher Papua, the former Dutch colony, joined to Indonesia in 1969 after a doubtful referendum, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote, with a personally higher hands before the occupational troops.
The existing movement from the Netherlands quickly argued its angry against the Government of Jakarta, which maintains a cruel control over the region, without allowing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially separated to Papua and the West Papua, and the independent state of Papua New Guinea is in the east of the island.
The Enerotali is the city that has been distant as well as the buried; the road is in itself a half-time move from Jayapur, the Administrative Centre of the Province, Nabi, and then a five-hour shooting shock on the shooting machine.
There's no public transport here.
The population of about 19,000 people are from wooden houses carried out by bambooting debts; the clothing from the heated has been improved in different markets.
There were little indonesians who haven't spoken about journalists and almost no foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, my pauas was worshipped by the god named Uga.
Other changes have also been changed.
“We were slightly shocking this clothes, ” says Degey, showing on his skin, shocked in the hands of the prison, the dark shock and the bright shock.
"We've brought only a card on the tv."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, 28 per cent of its population lives in poverty and the level of child mortality and gramm among the worst in Asia.
But this is the Indonesian gold land.
The world's largest gold machine, Graceberg, belonging to the Freeport McMoran company, is about 60 miles away from Paniya, a higher province near New York, where 153.000 people live.
Only in 2015 the Freeport company has reached the gold and mediums for about 3,1 billion dollars.
In addition, Papua can be able to enjoy forest stocks that are estimated by 78 billion dollars.
These riches, however, have a challenge for Papuas, safeguarding that the powerful armed forces of Indonesia remain here with its deep presence.
According to the New York Times report in 2005, Freeport company paid for local military offices and units almost $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including $15,000.
The more autonomy requirements from Papuas are threatening the existence of this golden heavy, and it is unfortunately slaughtered.
Since 1969, more than 5000,000 Papuas were killed by the Indonesia military forces, and thousands of more have been violented, subjected to torture and freedoms.
The Asian Commission on Human Rights, in the course of 70 years, may be considered a genocide of massive murders in indigenous populations of Papua’s high-earths.
Only in the past year the Indonesian police arrested more than 3900 peaceful protesters in the region.
"We lose everything," report published in 2016 by the Brisbanian Party, contains a witness of the animals made in the previous year, such as punishment without court, torture, especially the parties, as the other report, the violence and the protest of electricity, and the cruel contribution of peace demonstrations.
“ The number of victims is difficult to compare, because the events have a place every week, ” says Andréas Harsono, who conducted research in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
Haiki was displaced, as the resources of Papa’s people’s populations were cut into other Indonesian regions.
3.5 million people of the province are Christians, but the demographic indicators are changed through the arrival of the Islamic economic migrants with the Gustav Indonesian islands – Yawa, Sumala and Slovakia.
The Yavanian wheels, "warunges" are sold to a smoke and a sweet "arao-гадo" supplied with archaeous sous.
Local people are trying to keep competitive.
“The migrants started on the traditional market to sell smoke and fruit deceive than the Indigenous people of Papua,” explains Abet Jou, twenty-year-old Panya, who moved to Jayapur, the Administrative Centre of Province, because of the work.
"In this reason, the Indigenous people of Papua, Mother of the Women, lost their market of death."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Vidodo, who was known in the people as Jokoya, pleaded to deal with inequality and violations of rights in Papua during his presidency campaign in 2014.
At his path to the President of Jakarta, the former carriage was supported by 27 of 29 districts of Papua, including Panama.
But Papua has almost nothing changed, and local people feel loyal.
“ Our hearts are disappeared, because we voted for Joki in 2014, waiting for our hopes to restore justice,” says Jou.
Indeed, only two months after the October inauguration, Jokoy Panye survived the tragedy.
On December 7th, 2014, a group of 11 children was on the street and a skin of birthday giants in Anarotal when two Indian soldiers were shocked from the darkness.
The scared children told them that they should be involved.
As the local pastor Jadette Tebay reported, one of the soldiers slaughtered on their tone and a few days later returned from four soldiers.
According to the victims and witnesses, the soldiers who were drunken were shocked for children and slaughtered them with examples of extinction.
Then one of the soldiers shot the children's group.
A child, a 15-year-old Julian Aimee, was so shocked that he was shocked.
A few hours later, some have been shocked by the Government's electoral committee, and the next day the situation was shocked.
About thousands of Papuas men, women and children gathered at a football field before the local police office and the military command centre to need justice.
They brought ritual snakes with themselves and smile out the snake, the dance of the Papuas tribe, the dance of the Papuas tribe: they flew around and pictured the birds.
Some protesters began to swing stones into the police office and the military base.
When the situation was attacked, the soldiers in the internal radio-related were ordered to say: “If the torpe is opposed more than three times, shoot them”, he sounded as the official document, which saw the TIME residents, but not published in local media.
The fifty-sixty-year-old Eremias Kaime, head of the Kjo Coto area in Enerotaly, felt the risk of approaching and calling for calm, calling back to the house.
Nobody wanted to listen to him.
“ When I returned, I was soon shooting at the left pool, ” he told the TIME magazine, standing on the ship of his shooting tree house.
Kaame is still not known who shot, but he says that the gun came from the sherong of the soldiers gathered.
"The shooting, the shooting was a lot," he adds.
In the local population of Alfius Job, his two - year - old brother, who became a witness to the shooting.
“ I went to him and checked his body to make sure that it is him, ” said the TIME magazine Johanes, who, as many Indonesians, uses only one name.
"I saw him died... I kissed him."
General Jotje Mendee, senior police inspector, said to the reporters that his officers were only “protected” on their base because it was attacked.
“We must protect when people are threatening to kill us,” said the representative of the police Commissioner Pujo Sulistio in 2015.
“This is the question of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five of the young protesters were killed, and more were arrested.
The murder news came to Jakarta only on the next day.
After three weeks, Jokoy was in Jaipur a pleasant talk that expressed the confusion of the victims and pleaded to address the question of historical consumption of the authority in Papua.
“ I want that situation is immediately resolved so that she will never again be repeated in the future, ” he said.
In October 2016, Viranto, Minister of Security, said that it would establish an injustice organization to put an end to historical violations of human rights.
But we almost went out of the reserve.
“The majority of violations has been held for a long time.
Some of them had place in ninety or early nucleus.
The fact is that we, of course, want to take these violations, but there are procedures that we need to go," he said.
Then Viranto rejected his words, speaking with the TIME magazine in Jakarta on 5 June, and said that it was not planning to create a organization to consider complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, "They will be decided through the court."
The United Nations has been accused of “the crimes against humanity” in the bloody vote of the East Timor in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua, including the incident in Paniya, had already been employed.
Seven victims from Paniya met such statements with mature infidelity.
“ In the past three years, I was asked four times, but no change was completely made, ” says John.
"I'm lying."
He says that the years later, she's still in fear.
"I'm afraid," he says.
“I am afraid that I am arrested by the army, and I fear that they will shoot me.”
His brother Jacobs also expressed the view that the people of Paniya were afraid to discuss the event.
He said he was killed by the military after he helped to fill four victims.
“When we buried the body, the soldiers came after me,” he said.
The starba hasn't stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot in villages in the neighbouring of Panye of the Deay.
During the assembly of the villages and the manager of the building company, which refused to help a man who had no conscience, a man died in the hospital, and another 17 had been blessed, including children.
Man, twenty - seventy - year - old Ravian Doww, died in the hospital’s way.
Devastated villages protested before a building area belonging to the company.
According to the police, the villagers shocked stones into officers who were in response to warning fires.
However, local people say that a mobile brigade (Indonesian Spencer) has become shooted and killed one man.
“ We were in such a panic, we were afraid of return, ” reported the TIME magazine of 20 years of Badia, who lives at the hospital and saw how he had been slowly shocked.
“I was hiding at home two days. ”
The Acti Parliament needed to respond to the officials in the event, and the mobile police bridge was resigned from the region.
Pania was always a sick place for the Indonesian Government.
The inadequacy of significant development results in the injury of the tribe mee, monkeys, donations and donations displaced on the whole territory of the pine green of the central high-earth regions of Papua.
Many have joined the “Free Papua Movement” (OPM), a resurrected army, who claims that the rights of pausins is protected by the cause of constraint attacks and inflicting people in Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the senior OPM leaders have been from Paniya, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Koyoya.
As a response measures in the past few years, thousands of people were arrested and unfairly arrested by military under the provision of “protection of national independence”.
Some haven't come back.
Among the people of Papua Panii is considered “persooned, forgotten place”.
Poverty increases in dignity.
A small portion of the quality sold in Enerothale is too precious for local inhabitants.
Brothers are not inadequate at the same time.
People are growing here all of the foods: mainly, notes, and some fruits and breast fruits.
Agricultural household is the work of women whose four-five fields can be able to spend.
Of course, they remain a large part of the household for the family, and the rest are sold at the local market.
Ten clubs are only 100,000 Indonesian rupes (75 cents).
The economic inequalities between the Indigenous Papuas and the new migrants, which have arrived in large numbers after the introduction of new aircrafts to Nabuki Airport.
Many of the existing vaccines are usually more educational and state migrants.
The pausins have typically lacked money or ability to carry out their own competitive business.
“Young people don't want to stay in the village... because there is no job or money,” says John Gobai, Chairman of the Panii tribal council.
The isolation of Papua has been removed from the views of the rest of the world.
Furthermore, the limitations to work on international media remain awesome.
In the past year, French journalists Frank Escudi and Basil Lonshan have been deported from Papua for “inadequate coherence with relevant organizations”, despite their radius permission to videos.
According to Felima Kine, the Vice-Chairman Director of Asian Human Rights Watch, the promises given during the pre-selection campaign of Jokoy restraints the media work in order to facilitate transparency and development.
“Another journalists who are now trying to report from the Middle Eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and Western Papua are faced with new dangers: refusal to the visa and to introduce the black list,” he stated in the statement.
The lack of attention from the press means that the international pressure to the Indonesian Government was mainly limited by the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall, Islands and Solomon - requested the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate “divergent and widely distributed violations” in Papua, including the shot in Paniya.
The same country has been supported by OPM in the past.
The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, Arramanata Nasir, was denied from the statement of the group, reporting journalists in Jakarta that “In Indonesia still operates a democratic system and there is a free press, so that it would be difficult to cover the evidence of episodes of violation of human rights.”
Local people want to take attention to the situation of more foreign governments.
When a official delegation from the Netherlands, the Dutch Ambassador on Human Rights of Kiss Van Baarm, visited Jayapur on 4 May, the local people were inflicted to silence, prayer: “We want freedom”, as the source that was also present at the meeting, but wished to remain an anonymous.
In Indonesia, the new presidential elections in 2019 have been held, but the Papuas said that they are not re-declared for Joki.
“Jhokovi is a man whose good purpose is, but he is around people who are involved in the gun in Paniya,” says Gobai, chairman of the council of the tribe.
He wants to know that the people of Panii, except that they live in the dark of the threats from the Alte Army, were polluted in poverty, and that education and health are in a regret for them.
Gobay says that the people of Panii, as well as other pavuas, consider their voice rewarded for Jokoy, a long time that he must pay.
“They don't need money, they just want justice,” he says.
In spite of threats and intimidations, the families of the fire victims in Paniya have carried out the last symbolic innocence: one of the victims of the earth had been entered directly against the police and military office.
Knowing that justice may never be disfellowshipped, they will at least not allow the guilty to forget their crimes.
“ They killed a member of our family, ” says Jacobs, not taking up the head.
"What else had we done?"
Fire in the second time covers the Dubai skyskill Faculty
Fire covered one of the higher in the world in Dubai in Friday, when hundreds of people slowly abandon the seventy-yearth building at 337 meters above.

There may be a return to the agenda on security materials used in higher buildings around the world.
During the investigation of the Fakela Administration, in 2015, it was found that there had been more painting than the outer panels used for training and isolation.
In the United Kingdom, the police stated that the isolation system and the plotting panels of the Grenfel Tauer building in London could accelerate the dissemination of the fire in June, resulting in the death of about 80 people.

The university occurred on 2 August in the Mediterranean Caip-Cood east in the United States northeastern, declared Necn port.
The man tried to cut the bag into the camera, which was holding on a special ball.
A man, a animal of over three meters, was shocked to him.

He also noted that such a behaviour of the marine animal was for scientists in the news.
It was known for the mass dragon in the Ural Military Center
In the Ename School Center, where a massive drama occurred, a work group of senior Military Officers arrived to investigate the circumstances of the incident.
Some details of this fear have already been known.
According to the table of Mash, which appeared on the Incontattate page, the U.S. Military Contractors of the Urinary Military Part 31612 were wreckly slaughtered from the unsigned bed.
It started everything from a row named Sayan demonstratively ignored the order of the officer to make the strip swimming.
The officer stood the soldiers from the sixth mouth.
Saana supported the first mouth.
By half a year, 140 young men were rolled in beds and racks and slaughtered.
More than ten people suffered in the mass dragon.
The WHO checked information on the powder.
A study showed that at least one of the five passengers in the United States had prohibited aircraft.
A study showed that more than 20 per cent of aircraft aircrafts were conducted in a flight bag by the United States Transport Security Administration forbidden objects, including at least 6 per cent in the aircraft, in spite of the prohibited feet or other severe objects.
Only 1 per cent reported that later they found that they had a fire weapons, guns or explosive substances.
A study conducted by Stratos Jet Charters, Inc., and more than 1000 people, also showed that young passengers were more strict to violate the rules.
From respondents who acknowledged that they were aware of trying to flee with something prohibited by ATT, 19.7 per cent were millionary compared to less than 15 per cent of the Generation X members.
In particular, the ATP staff is often taking food and water.
More than 3 per cent were acknowledged that they had been specially conducted through the investigation of extreme objects, and 2.2 per cent of women ' s respondents and 3.7 per cent of the male respondents acknowledged that they had been conducted in the prohibited aircraft.
The company stated that passengers were studied throughout the country to know how accidentally the contract was carried out through the airports, and how much it was done.
We are fully expected that most of them are well-known or unreasonable to switch the contraband through seeing those who fly most.
As indicated by the company, the ATB rules are very complicated and inconsistent.
People often don't know exactly what kind of weight they can transport.
Therefore, it is unexpected that the large part of the ATB's chosen is the prohibited weaknesses.
Sometimes, people thought that ATTB could be considered forbidden to transport books.
Drugs are authorized on internal races but not on international.
Chapter EPA Premitte refuses to reject the implementation of the Rules of Emissions adopted by the Ombudsman
On the next day after the search for 15 States of the Environment Agency ' s head, its decision was to reject the implementation of the Rules adopted by the Ombudsman to reduce the emissions of air polluting and driving to education.
Privat explained its decision that his Agency is now more than the previous administrations, as well as the needs of the environmental controllers of individual states.
He did not mention the case against his previous position in the Federal appeal Court.
The controverse has been turned around the period of 1 October, to which the states should ensure that the 2015 land-level standards are complied with.
In June, the Privat declared that they would take compliance for a year to give its state more time to study the plan and to avoid "the inadequacy of local decisions or obstacles to economic growth".
Praitt, who was appointed by President Trampom at his current position, was long known as a follow-up opposer for environmental standards.
After the movement to Washington, Pruitted several times blocked or deleted standards against chemical or gas-energy industry.
The unexpected change of the currency in the environment is a periodic legal vision of the Peite Kurs to return to the previous standards.
In the last month, the Federal Appeal Court in Washington decided that the head of the EPA had exceededed its powers by trying to defeat the implementation of the Administration of the rules required by oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce the loss of metal.
In the statement issued at the midnight, the Privat suggested that it had simply changed the course of the zone standards to cooperate with the states in a comprehensive timely compliance process of new standards.
"For the previous administrations, the EPA was often not able to switch in the current period, and then waited for the groups of activists and other persons and discussed the duration in the process resolved," said Pruit, which gave more than two decades to the EPA at its previous post.
"We do not believe in the regulations through judicial proceedings, and we relate to the deadlines set.
We are also seriously concerned about our stipulation and the authority he gives us."
However, the EPA declaration states that the Privat can again use its "fulfilment for the delay and other data of the authority" to ensure that the standards "jcyjdfys in a clear course and all available information".
The Republicns in the Congress have a broader review of the rules relating to ozone.
The draft law adopted by the Palestinian Representatives in the last month is intended to defeat the 2015 Regulation as a minimum of eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this issue.
The General Prosecutor of New York, Eric Schneederman, who launched the coalition of states in the case of EPA for this week, said that the group intended to continue legal pressure.
" The change of the EPA currency -- after our courses, is an important winning for the fight against health and security of 6.7 million New Yorkians and more than 115 million Americans, which are directly influenced by their city's aid", said Sneyderman.
At the site of New York, California, Connecticot, Delaver, Illinois, Iwa, Man, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rod Island, Vermont and Washington, and the district of Colombia.
Earth-level ozone occurs when normal pollutant substances from machines, electrical stations, non-producing and chemicals and other sources are in the atmosphere with sunlight.
Those who have been able to cause serious grieve in feeling to them, bringing to thousands of premature deaths a year.
Health Protectors and Environmental Protections welcomed the unexpected change of the Privat course.
"True thinking about how much pressure was needed to achieve this completely logical step from a man who has been commanded to protect the air that we breathe," said Lori Anne Burd from the Center of Biological Diversity.
"We should continue to resist the ideological campaign of the Trampa Administration and protect those polluting air and their special interests."
The IAAF Congress extended the elimination of the All Russian Federation of Facility Atlantics

The Wall Street Journal and the Reuters Agency reported the Special Prosecutor on Russian election in 2016, Robert Murler reported a great prisoner in Washington, which is accepted by the study of Russia’s influence on the election of the president of the United States in 2016.
The largest prisoner is a group of common citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to ask witnesses under a sentence.

At the beginning of August, a number of media showed that the Declaration of the Trampa-Mediter on the meeting with the Western Republic was literally identified by the elderly Tramp.
In the house of Bella, the President was not dictated, but just using his authority to do any father.
Mrs. Pensey was arrested at the workplace
The Advisory Head of the Pennsian Administration of Irina Syrsin was detained at 48 hours for the appointment of the next Committee at its workplace, reports RI News.
Official communications from law enforcement authorities on this matter have not been done, but the SCC press was assured that they would soon follow.
There is no comment in Mary Penza.
Irina Shirsina is one of the five Vice-Chairmans of the Pensian Administration.
She smoked strikes and land relations since April 2015.
She had long worked with the leadership of the Hospital Inspection on the Pennsylvania.
Irina Shirshin is upgraded by three non-professional children, notably that, once a year ago, she was mother, she refused to be decreed and returned to work.
Of course, there is no space or missiles in Mexico.
However, there is established by the Space Agency and the desire to develop its own space programme in 2010.
And the installation of the Yuria Gagarin is the respect of the first man in the space.
Unlike the memories of the soviet period in some countries, Gagarin's memories, on the other hand, are "placing the planet".
In 2012, the monument was established in the United States Hostel at the former headquarters of the NASA.
In London, a reminder on the Kingdom Observatory was established for the first 50-year-old fleet in space.
There is a memorandum of Gagarin in Germany in Erfuth, where our space was in 1963.
The memorandum in the Carlos Varies (Chekia) was escaped in 1992 by the public protests and was transferred from the city to a local airport.
In the 70th age of Gagarin in Riga, a memorandum of the Juryus Gagarins occurred.
So it sounds name and name of the first Latin space, and he looks like if he was 70 years old.
Mors Ford murder: activists play the Lynch Courts at the scene to call for justice
Ford Mercurey, 1948, passed a slaughter in Monroe village in Georgia, and with a shirt to the small moon of Mors Ford.

The sisters were driving from fear.
"We need this nigger, Roger!" said the man.
Get him out of the car!
A young black man was cut off from the front seat.
Happily, this horrible scene, which has played on July 22, is only an incentive.
But when the Rose's shoes shocked the shoes, almost all the shoes were breathing and actually breathing.
Since 2005, activists return to the Mouse Ford's bridge to play again on the night when the cocklecks sleeped in 1946, Roger and Dorothy Malk and George and May Murry Dorsy.
No one was condemned for these murders.
"Clearly, no one was arrested for all these years - even though we see them close to us; although we know who they are," says Tyron Brooks, who helped to organize the order.
"It's a skin in our history and it's a stone in our souls."
71-year-old Brooks, former member of George's convention, who is struggling for human rights.
The spectacle is a dramatic call for action and an annual reminder to the people of Monroe that the injustice has not been corrected.
"We want to investigate, we want to end up, we want to rescue, we want reconciliation, but first we have to achieve justice," he says.
"We can't go to healing and reconciliation until we reach justice."
The Coroner covers the simple body of one of the victims in Mors Ford on 27 July 1946.
According to the FBI materials received by Ann-Bi-Sy News, over 50 people in Monroe and neighbouring graphics were suspected in ringing.
But no one was accused of it.
Although the suspected decades remained free, the rights defenders said that the city has always known two related motives: policy and sex.
In April 1946, the decision of the Supreme Court first authorized the black citizens to vote on the plomers that were to be held in the summer.
In the same elections, as the FBI report, the black user Roger Malcolm shooting in the footsteps of Barnett Hester, the white landowner, because of the woman.
Brooks say that Hester was sleeping with her wife Malcolm Dorothy, and that the child she had to be born was not a husband.
According to the FBI report, on 25 July 1946, Loy Harrison, a large white owner, paid $600 to release Malcolm from prison.
He went to prison together with Dorothy and their cousins May Murray and George Dorcy.
But when they went out of the prison and went to the Moor Ford's Moor's bridge, the shooter was around the car.
"It was explained that he organized and commanded Harrison's murders," was concluded in one of the FBI reports.
"By obviously there was a complaint between the law enforcement bodies of the State and the city that had not only participated in murder but also destroyed the evidence and hidden the personality of witnesses."
Brooks call it short.
"This was a trial for election rights," he said.
"All of them were killed to send a black signal to the city: if you register and vote, you will be the same."
Just 10 years ago, Cassandra Green directs an annual spectacle that plays the blending of the Mors Ford bridge.
Her spectacle is overlooked, he slaughtered and condemns the deep racism, which many would like to think that there is no longer in America.
It's hard to see and it's harder to turn back, but Green believes that it's the main thing.
"We don't want to talk about Lincha's judges because they show us our own nature," she says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't hear me or you don't hear what I've survived."
The spectacles of this year began in June, and the first day, about 30 actors, the white, the other blacks gathered in the place and listened to the slipped review of the drinks.
Wayd Marbo was a register with Green.
He played a few years of the main member of the clan, but he says that the role was not easier.
"I think I'm missing, because it's not the man I'm," says Marbo.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to come back at that time."
Actors of Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who played as Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, repeat their roles.
Spectal begins with Malcolm, who disappointed Hester's sleeping with his wife Dorothy, crys and touchs him.
"I said, neg, go out of my house!".
Cry Rascon to answer.
It's shocking.
And at the same time, all of them (at least all black actors) are shocked.
Gren's laughing all.
"What is it?" asks Ascona.
He's worried and funny.
Do I play again?
"No," he says, "in the midst."
"I just don't think the white ones were saying nigga."
Yeah, it's ridiculous one of the black artists.
"You need to spend a strong 'r'."
Similarly, energy is changed in the room: the discomfort changes the feeling of association.
Everyone must do it right, not only for drinks, but also for the memory of the four killers.
The scene begins first.
This time Racona says the word "N", it is clear and strict.
No man's laughing.
The spectacle is finished cruel and fast.
Cricky, shoot, and then calm.
The woman in a snake black clothes stands on the body of the actors and performs a tragic song of Billy Hollyde Strange Fruit.
His voice is interrupted through the word.
In hundreds of eyes of it, half of the riders get out of the eyes of smile and pot.
Among the rabbits are almost equal to the number of black and white.
One couple came out of that, New York State, to look at the presentation; many live.
They were almost eight hours suffering from Georgia’s heavy spirit while Brooks driving them in the palm of Malcolm and Dorsy.
To this time, the murder remained only a story, but now when they stand on the same place where people cut down, they seem to be driving here in the air.
When the last note of the song, Green invites people to come closer and look at the body.
Childs die to their heads, they smell to a snake of blood, and unmovable bodys and slips to each other.
"It's not really dead," is a little boy, like to remember himself.
A few minutes later, Green thanks the slaughterers, and then it's over.
The actors strike the legs from the shoes and cut the legs out.
Bradshaw understood Marbo, a man in the coast, who played the main cocktails.
Nick Rascona understood two other actors and, soon, smiling, smiling in their smile: the emotional load of the spectacle was finally inflicted.
"I'm all right," one of the women.
"We know that your heart is good.
You had reasons for this."
Then the snakes are sit to dinner with the actors.
On a table, a white couple from Atlanta has a spectacle with a black couple with which they just met.
Dennis Daplensky's work is looking for words to describe what she feels after the spectacle.
"It's like to listen to these horrible, horrible words, and... people look like you, and those who do it because they look like you," she says.
"I think there's still a shock," she adds, "that it's called that the police shoots."
In the other corner of the room, Tyron Brooks had a general attention to the work of the human rights defender.
He said that it was started to plan the submission of the next year.
"The path is encouraged by us, because she does not only describe the fear of what we have survived, but also taught us," he says.
"For if you don't get out of this lesson, it may happen again.
Those who do not study their stories, who do not know their story, are attributed to their reminders."

After the unilateral winning of Harry over the former world champion in four pregnant categories of Eric Broner, on Saturday on the Showtime channel, both boxers are in five best boxers outside depending on the pregnancy categories.

New test results were published to assess the age of asylum in Sweden
The recent tests of refugee visitors in Sweden, which have been under the new medical assessment method, show that more than 80 per cent of the protested persons of 18 years were evaluated, but not yet believe the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Medical Medicine Agency (Ratts Medicinal Network) began testing this year.
They were developed to assess the age in providing asylum more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) discovered that it had not been able to determine the age of some refugees who claimed that they were uncomprehensive.
At this time, Migrationsverket sent 6 880 cases to test, and the judiciary has now published results of 2 481 tests for the average March to 31 July 2017.
8 per cent (2002) tested were estimated as people of 18 years or older, and in 25 cases, the judicial physicians estimated that the tested “incredibly 18 or older person” was tested.
In the case of 432 cases, the person said "also less than 18".
Tests are conducted only when human age causes doubt.
According to Johannes Geranceson, the results of the last months are corresponding to the results.
“We are not looking at a great difference with statistics over the last months, the numbers are completely relevant,” he said to the Port The Local.
The higher part of the cases in which people were estimated as aged 18 does not necessarily indicate that refugees have been lied for their age.
In May, the Agency published 581 test results and reported that 442 cases “approximately the age of 18 years or more”.
However, in consideration of 581 published results, the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper found that in 243 cases persons were openly declared that 18 were implemented in this year.
The method of medical assessment of age in order to make dentists of the wisdom and the theography of collective foundations and give them to the analysis of the donists and ringgenologists, also criticizes some instances.
One of the sceptics is the endocrinologist of the Carolin Institute of Crow Marcus, part of which the work is the evaluation of the biological impact of people in order to determine whether they had passed through sexual abuse before or later.
“ I had reasons to think about this, and I don't think that we should use the methods of measurement that now are used.
Biological age is so unlimited.
If we can't determine him with confidence, we don't have to do what we can," he said the Metro newspaper.
However, Gerancen from the judicial medical office said to the exactity of the tests: “In general, it is possible to say that the risk of taking a child for adults is wrong.
We are at the largest risk when a person is 18, in that case, he is about 10 per cent."
I'm thinking if I'll be balled at the president's position.
During the work journey in Buradyma Putin, it was prepared to think whether it would be able to be paid for the President of Russia for elections in 2018.

And the Chief of the Libyan National Army Feldmarshal Haftar gave his submission to oppose Italian ships.
In Rome, however, claimed that they did not believe these threats and intend to send another military vessel to the liquid territorial waters.

As the financial rules of the football are affected by the movement of Nepal to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unlimited costs from the European football clubs are not hindered by the world-based transfer of Nepal from the Spanish Barcelone in French "Sen-Jermen".
Whatever the consequences could be further on the scene, for the "Sen-Jermen" Party of the WEF, the Director of the European football Authority, whose authority prohibits the teams to participate in the prestigious tourism League Championship.
According to the financing "fair-pay" regulations introduced by WEFA in 2011, "PSD" finally must be shown that Nepal's transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelone has paid EUR 222 million (262 million) only for the release of the Brazilian contract, and the Nymar will receive a punishment that will reach tens of $1,000 per year.
There are some financial aspects of the Nymar movement to France.
The “PSJ” may be precisely disappointed to take Nemar and add it to the galaxies of other stars, if it takes into consideration the financing of the team from the rich energy of the Catar family.
The clubs have the right to expend large amounts to buy players, but they should be equipped with the legal sources of revenue to achieve rentabilities in their football business.
“FFP” entered Michel Platin after his election by President WEFA in 2007.
The former French footballist believed that the clubs used in great debts in their efforts to achieve, in fact, jury, and risked disaster if banks or owners stopped financing.
In 2011, “FFP” stopped focusing on club debts and turned into follow-up of their losses instead.
As a result of the change in business model, which Roman Abamorvic was used in Chelsea in 2003, was to buy a club with good capacity, and then severely expenditure in order to improve the team and establish a worldwide bread, was a difficult plan.
During the current third year of the 2018 evaluation, clubs may lose 30 million euros.
Although Platina has been shocked with the presidential position in 2015, his predecessor in WEFA Alexandre Chaferin is still decisively urged to maintain excessive costs.
“The FFP is alive,” said the Associated Press Agency, Andrew Traverso, who controls the FFP in WEFA last week.
The 'PSD ' s will and pay the purchase of the Nymar contract at one time, it may be able to distribute the amount for all the terms of its contract.
Nymar signed the five-year treaty, so the transfer value can be shown in an annual accounting as the cost of 44.4 million euros during the next five years.
During the first wave of the FFP sanctions in 2014 to the “PPS” and to the belonging Abu Daby, Manchester City, were applied to deep sanctions.
The “PSD” was established in 60 million euros (82 million dollars) which later was reduced to 20 million euros, and was required to limit its composition in the Champion League during the 2014-1015 season of 21 players instead of ordinary 25.
EDF is monitoring clubs that may try to overcome its financial inspections by developing their income income from club owners.
The Catar Company would be able to provide “GPS” but if the amount of financing would be higher than the standard market estimates, WEFA would not allow it to be considered legal income.
That happened in 2014 when the WEFA decided that the amount of financing “PSD” by the Office of the Catar Tourism was dismissed.
It was reported that the part of the Nymar's shipping in the SPS could be paid as a payment by the organizational Championship of the World Champion in Catare 2022.
But “PSJ” and Catar-2022 refused that Nemar would be a world championship, and such a maneuver could easily find WEF inspectors.
The last sanctions imposed on the CPS mean that WEFA will be more careful to follow any attempt to pursue the rules.
As reported on the fourth persons confronted with the situation, WEFA did not have an preliminary discussion with the NSA.
They were communicated with the Associated Press Agency in an anonymous conditions, since they were not authorized to discuss the terms of the PHJ.
According to the latest report, the EUR 542.4 million had been reached in 2015-1016 EUR.
The accounting for the last financial year is not yet published.
“PSD” expects that the arrival of Naimar will be a favorable mail for Panzhor business, sell attributes and footballs with the team logotype.
The club suggests that the traffic will grow as a minimum of 30 per cent because of the new player.
Indefinitely, one of the best footballists has tried to prevent Naimar's transfer, claiming that “PSD” would violate the financial fair-bearing.
“ This apparent case of the “financing duty” with the club and the state,” stated the Spanish newspaper La Liga Havier Tebas, which means that the final ownership of the PSJ is Katar.
Arsenala, Arsen Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sport magnity, shares the doubt of La Liga about the financing of the state club.
“ This is all the results of the fair participation, and it has completely changed random football over the past 15 years,” said in the fourteenth Winger.
"When the club belongs to the country, maybe everything.
It is very difficult to comply with the financial fair fair, since the country may have a lot of ways and a lot of reasons for being presented by such a serious player.
The order and location of the sentence shall be determined by the President
Where and as the new Russian citizens will join RF's loyality, the President will determine the second amendments to read in the relevant law developed by the Heads of Legislation and Guest.
Another week ago, the deputy planned to determine the order for sentences in the law.
From the provision of the treaty clamp will be released to the children of 18 years, as well as indeed, the amended text in the draft "Canitarianship of the FR " (which in the provision of the " News ") which will be considered before reading at the second meeting of the Committee on 11 July.
The idea of introducing sentences to RF nationality instead of the formal signing of documents by President Vladimir Putin supported the 6 June during the meeting with the Vichela Voluntana.
The deputy made this idea as an amendment to the second reading in the draft legislation, which provides for the cancellation of the citizenship of those who later were sentenced for a number of crimes of terrorism or extremist nature: for example, for public calls to terrorism or its public adjustment in media or online (cf. 2 p. 205.2 CFR), as well as for aircraft, train or water transport, but only if the act is related to terrorism (art.
According to the draft legislation, it was the logic of it: the formulation of documents to citizenship is signed under the promise to comply with the Russian legislation - instead of extremism, it violates the promise.
The draft legislation was introduced in April by the leaders of the Reflexion Fractions of Vladimir Vasilie, Gennadei Zugan (CPF), Vladimir Jillinski (LDD), Sergey Miron (Russia St.
On May 19, the deputy adopted it in the first reading.
Last week, the Committee on Hospitalization and Legislation adopted the text of draft legislation to second reading, but now it has been reprocessed again.
It now states that the order for sentences will establish President of the RF.
The parliamentarys had to describe the procedure directly in the Act of the FIR Citizenship, pointed out that the ceremony had to be held in a commercial situation before the public herb and the Russian flag in the presence of the representative of the MDM.
However, the text of the draft legislation was not understood where such events should be held - a list of places where the RF herb may be placed, regulated by the federal constitutional law.
They include courts, heads of subsectors, municipal education, judges, prosecutors, heads of executive authorities, etc.
It would be likely to be the SASCs.
To make a tragic clamp that wishes to obtain citizenship of RF will be after the officials check their documents.
But the Russian passport will receive only after the sentence, the text should be made.
A week ago in the project was said that the sentence should be before the signing of the statement.
The updated text indicates that Russia will be from 18 years of age, not from 14.
The rule for which sentences will be released by inadequate or limitedly deficiencies, as well as those who cannot make it possible to read, read or sign the sentences.
Furthermore, the President of the RF has the right to free from this procedure and " other persons",
In the updated legislation, also, the special order of receipt in the Russian citizens of Ukrainian, which are considered by Russian portraits.
They should be officially rejected from the Ukrainian citizenship, providing the corresponding declaration to the Ukrainian Authority.
The recorded copy of the declaration will be sent to Russian officials.
The "human" citizenship, as now, is not necessary if it is prescribed by an international treaty or if it is impossible "in the power of those who are not deemed from the reason".
The corresponding amendment to the law proposed a group of deputy, among which the first Vice-Vice-Vice-Vice-GD Ivan Meller (CPF), the Natalya of Polonia, Paul Crashininger and Irat Farkhov (the whole "Ross One").
I think many of you know that you get the help with Ukrainian in reality, just impossible.
Consequently, many people are waiting for a decision on the CF citizenship, explaining the head of the thinking Committee on Hospitalization and Legislation Paul Crashinians (ER).
Furthermore, the text indicated that the limitation of certain jobs for foreigners will not be distributed to those who were writtenly rejected from the "now" citizenship and made passports in Russia, but "not depending on the reasons of it" had remained to be considered citizens of another country.
Foreigners now are prohibited to employ a municipal service office, to work on objects and organizations related to the security of Russia.
Any person with a double citizenship or a type of residence in another country cannot be a deputy of the Hospital or a member of the Federation Council.
The law is planned to enter into force since 1 September 2017, at that time the necessary signatories should be prepared.
The Nostralia is the "Chark of American flight" and "Detective Train"
The current history of the newspapers recalls the glorious days of the 80s; the era of the greenhouse in the 1990s (approximately when the master David Wayne and Michael Schwalter made the committee of the "Organists" for MTV; and it was about 2001 before her stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Pauller and Paul Rad had been transferred to more serious publications.
As cultural facts, it is the increase and impact of our era with its permanent memories of Facebook.
But as Francis, she seems anaronism.
The "First Day of the camp" was a good surprise, not only because of the absorptive humor (including the original history of the speaking bank of the Almighty Bank, called John Benjamin).
The result is the main shock: Actors of a medium-year-old play sexually worried children who have only achieved the age of perfection, and there is no ability to return to a part of the shock.
"Tween years later," where adults were already playing, they have less deep emotional roots, and their paridoidity is more unsystemized and includes the rifs of the steaker films of the 90-year-old Ruke.
In one episode, Apple Powerbook, a four-coloured role horses and a few other things since 1991.
Many of the sudden steps are the same.
Welcome Kup (Shooter), now a writer, has not yet been obtained by Catty (Marghetti Moro).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't disappeared.
And there is still a sweet and suburb that is part of Ronald Reagan (such as Shawlter), who is now underlined by George Bush older (experienced couple in the performance of Michael Yan Blake).
As always, the best part of the Francis is a disappearance from her.
Especially pleased to see a young Rada, who firms the song of Matthew Dillon from the Odiaches, whose old man, an old man, is now a old man.
The success of this Francis could be the caselessness in the spirit of the "Seven Up" recursive series until it would be until I think that it would have been her logical conclusion: "The Great American flight: the twenty-year-old."
"Detective" in Amazon is called to another type of nostalgia: remembering the cold war from the Americans, the "Extreme Bronnic" or even the "Braceca" with its shape of the East and West.
The committee created by Brian Gatudo and Alexandro Tanack with Rizm Thomas is a TV: the Rumanian police drama of the 80s on two police in Buharрест, who are fighting for the truth, the atheism and the Marxist-Leanne way.
The main roles of Gregor and the idealist Joseph perform Florin Piersik and Cornelly Urich and heard their English dialogues in Channing Tatuum and Joseph Gordon Lewid.
That's a funny idea.
But just a idea.
There are several visual shocks (the police shocks have time to look at shocks, as Americans could view football).
The team of famous chair votes, including Jenny Slaughter, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevini, allows us to play interestingly in "Remember the voice".
But "Detective" is so holding for the deceased propagandist drama - there's even a killer in Ronald Reagan's mask, which often looks like it.
Six long episodes are broken, and it is not very common.
If it's done soon, "Detektive" could be better able to do with her smile in the spirit of a agepropa; for example, when Gregor and Joseph come to the American Society, two sweet men are sit in the wheels of the hamburger.
This image of the Communist says that the western culture is capable of making a grain.
We do so even with our recent history and with them.

The United States and Russia should be able to work together.
This statement made an official representative of Mr. Hizer Navart, responding to the words of the Prime Minister RF Dmitria Medvedev on two States' relations.

The Bank of England maintains the rates of 0.25 per cent
It is expected that the Bank of England later announces that percentage rates are not changed after the weak economic growth and declining inflation have been made to highlight the hearing of the potential increase.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth remains unreasonable and left percentage rates without changes among the increased pressure on family income.
The Commission's monetary and framework policy specialists (MPC) proclaimed by 6 against 2 per cent for the maintenance of 0.25 per cent, and in that month, less of the members of the Committee had increased rates because the weak economic growth had decreased the increase.
In its quarter report, bank inflation was limited to 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6 per cent in 2018, and warned that the pressure on the family income continued, while still expected that inflation is up to 3 per cent.
However, the bank warned that the increased rates in the next few years would be necessary to control the flash of inflation, and stated that the costs of business must probably be stronger than expected for financial markets.
The members of the Committee also proclaimed to reject the part of the public comprehension of economic development as a result of the breeding year.
Starting from February, the bank will close the urgent financing plan for which he provides low credits to banks, although he reported that it would now be in the framework of the plan to provide more than 15 billion feet, up to 115 billion feet.
In the Protocol on the adoption of bank rates, “in accordance with the main predictions of MPC, the growth of the currency internal product (WFP) remains closely, while the pressure on real income is still influenced by the consumption”.
On the basis of the tax, he repeated that for the stopping of inflation, “unnecessary financial policies” is needed in“more” size than the market expected.
At this time, the markets predict the first increase in the third fourth next year and another in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all increases will be “progressed” and “limited”.
Bank projects for increase in this and the next year below than the predictions made in May, which were equal to 1,9 per cent and 1,7 per cent.
Bank left its instinct prognosis to 1.8 per cent in 2018.
After these news, the sterling falled in relation to the dollar and the euro.
The fund slowed by 0.5 per cent to 1.31 US dollars and 0.4 per cent to 1.11 euros.
The decision was not changed after the recent increase rates were expected to increase, and the GDP increased by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter of 0.2 per cent in the past three months.
According to the representative of the bank, the growth, which is all, remains at the level of 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, although the end of the year is little.
The last bank ' s inflation report provided little to the joy of households in which high inflation was affected and the totally significant increase in the payment of payments: according to the bank's words, the pressure will be increased before slowing.
Bank added that the financial policy “not can prevent” the wages in the next few years, but expected that payments would be “important” to the end of his three-year predict.
The economy has also been increased in the result of the growing British products demand, resulting from a low fund rate that compensates part of lower consumer costs.
The decision was adopted a year after the rates were reduced in August last by 0.25 per cent after the shocking results of the European Union ' s exit issue.
Based on the evaluations of the bank, it may be necessary for four years to make full impact on prices and economy.
Before the bank made his last decision on taxes, the sound of the predicted rate increase was raised, as the inflation has increased and so experiencing household pressure: three specialists asked to increase rates up to 0.5 per cent in July.
In the last month, inflation has fallen up to 2.6 per cent from 2.9 per cent in July, although the bank reported that the fall was expected and reimbursed in the next months.
According to the bank, the higher indicator compared to the planned 2 per cent is the result of a low fund rate.
Andrew Montreak, director of the Coreko Epothetic Brothers, said: “If you take account of the recent fall of the currency, judgeing the whole, the epoch market will become more competitive, since creditors require business opportunities and account for a good year.
The line appears particularly favorable for those who are close to the end of their existing treaties, as the refinancing of credits, often with the absence of the Commission, as well as with the low rate, becomes popular as ever."
The State Health Service writes the disappointment of HIV 10000
Since September, patients will have access to the "revolutionary" preparation for HIV prevention after the Battle of the High Court on the financing of preparation from the State Health Service.
The National Health Service announced that the pre-positional prevention of HIV (PRIP), the treatment that was taken before the sex, which was proved to reduce the risk of infringements in persons in the risk group, at average 86 per cent, will now be provided for health services during the initial three-year test period of approximately 10 000 people.
She agreed to finance tests after the Appeals Court supported the decision of the High Court in the past year, in which the National Health Service claimed that there was a possibility to pay the PRA, despite its statement that it had to be financed by local authorities.
This step announced in Thursday was called the President of the National Health Service of England Simon Stevens, and the National Monitoring Office of the Distribution of AIDS (NAT) was called it as a “return moment”.
Before the full launch of the program throughout England to April 2018, the venerological dispensers in London, Briton, Manchester, Liverpool and Shefffield will start registering the first one of the people, and more dispatchers will be joined in October.
Pre-positive prevention (PRP) is the course of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce HIV infringement risk.
As a result of the study, PEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infringement among people in the risk group.
In receipt of the PRI before sex, human body is sufficiently determined to prevent HIV infection.
Such preparations can be taken daily or not after two hours before sex.
Patients with the right to preparation are homosexual and biological men, transgenders and persons whose HIV partners are positive and are not successfully treated.
Dispansors will take appropriate participants agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgenders and persons whose partners are unknown whether their HIV status is detained in antiretroviral therapy.
People who live and applies to the doctor of general practice in England will also be able to submit a request for potential participation in the nearest venerological dispenser that participates in the programme.
The programme will be 10 million feet, and the National Health Service of England this week after the International Tanner to purchase has signed the preparatory contract.
A study has been built to assess all the Clean data possible for the collection of Clinical data on the purpose of the preparation auditor, its cleanness and use in a large scale.
“ This important new involvement should be supplemented and increased by broader and successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another century of more than three decades of success against one of the largest threats to health, with which humanity has occurred.
Debor Gold, President of the NAT (National AIDS Distribution Control Management), said: “This is a turning point in combating HIV.
PREP, if it is grammaously inclined to people who need assistance and risks, will enable to change the situation of HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, persons in the HIV risk group, through this study carried out in England for the National Health Service, have access to the new open-ended use of new means that person can control himself without discussing this with a partner that will lead to improvement of many lives.
We welcome this news."
Jan Green, President of the Terrence Higgins Fund, said: “The first time it is to be worried about the testing in the whole country and that no one of the HIV risk groups should be forgotten.
Now, when we are providing an experimental PREP, we go to protect more than 10000 people in the HIV risk zone.”
Sheron Hodgeson, the Deputy Minister of Public Health, said: "We are very welcome to the beginning of the PEP test, which has been very delayed for months and shipments from the Government."
Data shows how revolutionary this prepatrie can be as part of our approach to prevent HIV and stop transfer of this year's infection.
This test approaches us to a step to a comprehensive understanding of the PMA's advantages.
It is now important that the test is as soon as possible in the whole country to protect those in the HIV risk group and to continue to step up to the end of the dissemination of HIV in society.

On 11 July, the Chairman of the Tataristan requested the President of Russia to extend the agreement and to maintain the name of the head of the region.

In Russia, there were complications in receiving international driver rights
AIDS units have experienced the deficit of international driver certificates.
In order to obtain such rights, a few weeks should be expected to be a real problem for departments who want to go to the border on their car or take it there.
It should be noted that the situation with international driver certificates remains contrary.
IWU was introduced to understand more about the national certification, as the information is explained in five languages.
The requirements of international rights are recorded in the Vienna Convention on Trade movement in 1968, but in countries ratified by the Vienna Convention, Russian rights are also recognized.
However, all of them depends on the specific police or detainees, and some of them require an OMI and some of them are sufficient to national rights.
In order to undermine, international rights drivers are still obtained, but it should be taken into account that no ratification of countries (e.g., United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) will not recognise any national rights nor WWU.
There is now a problem with bands of almost all the HYBD units, reports "Commerce" by studying in a number of regions.
Yes, in Moscow's units, the talents aren't just out, the balls aren't missing for four months.
It can be recorded on the guest site, but there is already cutting up in the middle of August.
In Crosnoyarsk IU, it is not possible to obtain the "technological reasons" without details, the Samaritan area says honestly that there is no blocks, the same situation is also in other cities.
Many of the mosquitos have already been discussed with the problem, and the social communications are more often available:
Irina Burmistrova: "Remember why Moscow cannot obtain international rights?"
Right, because all the HYBD offices have been finished.
Elena Podkolzina:
The international rights must be obtained urgently.
In Moscow, it's all the time to get away, it's not going to get out of the bathroom (which there is, but it can't give it).
The portal of the hospital shows that in the Spb time is free to shoot.
Have anyone been worried about receiving another city?
Does it work?
As explained in MWF, the requirements for international driver certificates have changed, so the Hosaut Inspection Unit has implemented new blocks.
This may be related to the deficit, in fact, unexpectedly what changes have been made, has not previously been reported.
The Blocks purchase the Centre for Trade Safety (CDN) IUD RF and then put them into the HYBD unit.
In the last few years, all contracts were with AO Gonzak: almost 2000,000 MWB banks were prepared in 2014-2015, 150,000 banks were purchased in 2016, in 2017 to 90 000, but the last contract was concluded with the OOD on 18 July, the "Parksports" for the production of 70 000.
There's a version that the CIA just didn't sleep at the time, because of the deficit.
However, there are other versions of the lack of burns: because of the crisis, many people have become self-reaching to Europe and in the more delicate Asian countries - China, Thailand, and so further.
What rights have been taken there, until the end is unexpected, so people are disappointed, and therefore a smooth question on the international " shorts".
Recently it was known that professional drivers have to make an exam to confirm their qualification.
The proposal was made by Mintrance.

The Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Cromble Bridge
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine, Paul Peter, said that it would not believe Russia’s ability to build a bridge in Crema.
On Thursday, 4 August, he said to the portal "Observator" interview.
There is no respecting international company, even balls or hakeees, because it is risking to lose its business in the EU, the United States, Japan, in countries joined against Russia's sanctions.
"There is, in my deep conviction, there is no prospect in this project", said Peter.
He added that Russia was not able to implement a large infrastructure project self-sufficiently.
Russia can not normally build smaller objects.
I know that after the Olimpiade in Sochi, all the stadiums have started to be destroyed.
"I therefore think that the best tool in this situation is the sanctions against companies that were so inadequate to join this project," said the official.
On July 31, the buildings completed the shift of the Cromble Bridge.
The counterparty of the Cromble Road Arc is completed on the shipment of the shipping beach, which is covered by 45 metres from the foundation of the construction.
"On timely drivers have prepared a plant on the shooting face, " reported in the project centre.
In April, the President of Russia, the President of Warcram Putin, informed the report of the installation of the graphic restraint.
The Croming Bridge is connected to the Cross Mediterranean and the Cross dark land.
In Spain, an employee who had not been employed for 10 years
How should an angelic patient (or the absolute insufficient of public service) be the Spanish chief of Carlos Resio?
The permanent passenger was slowed for 10 years.
However, Mr. Recio was still cut off.
But not his immediate chief.
What's wrong with the bureaucratics in the world.
It seems like it was a long time to join all the shoes of the people.
However, the officials will always be surprised by those who live well.
This time, "sensitive" welcomed Spain.
There, the officer of the Archive Valencia Carles Recio was struggling for the whole ten years.
In that regard, he regularly received forgiveness.
The total amount of EUR 500,000 per year.
And this is the wonderful time Mr. Recio.
He was authorized by the decision of the Valentia ' s legislative congregation.
The investigation found that the bad driver came every morning to the office at 07.00 p.m. to take place in the electronic system.
And he went home.
Once again, he came to the workplace at 16:00 to see again in the system that he left.
And that's 10 years.
It was also known that every time the passenger was freely dedicated to the design of mixtures at home.
The Deputy of the Valencia Legislative Meeting now thinks how Mr. Recio was a direct leader who couldn't know how to work actively on his workplace.
The judges proposed to protect the Chairman
The Presidential Council on Human Rights (HIV) on the Administration of Vulumir Putin has developed proposals for strengthening the judicial independence of the authority.
It proposes to limit the power of the chairmans and to enable them to be elected.
For the courts of appeal and cassation, the CSD wishes to introduce special circles that will not be associated with the administrative and terrorist delegation in the FRC.
His proposals under the Presidential mandate should also be submitted to the Supreme Court.
The CDS concluded the development of proposals that will enhance the independence of Russian justice.
This work was held on the mandate of the Wormira Putin of 3 January 2017, which was given by the President after the meeting with the Council.
The meeting with members of the Council of 8 December 2016 was discussed in particular cases of the court and the issue of public control in the fields of citizens (see " . 9 December).
The total work of the GDP was 25 proposals concerning the independence of the judges and the identification of judicial errors as well as the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlean rights defenders is to restrict the authority of the chairmans of the courts to increase the independence of the other judges.
If the applicant has successfully passed a competitive and received support to the court community, the Chairman of the Court of Justice, in view of the Auditors, must submit it to appointment, without having the right to reject how this allows the law now.
It is also proposed to leave the Chairman of the right to distribute the cases for consideration between judges.
This may, allow experts, a specially written computer program.
The CHR also believes that the Chairman is not “determining the results of the qualification of the judges, initiating its responsibilities to discipline, to decide to establish additional material payments”.
The Chairman's Council considers that it is necessary to transfer to “the elections of judges by the judges” and“to give them powers to a relatively unsuccessful deadline with compulsory ruling”.
Now, all judge chairers (of the Republic of the Republic to the district) are appointed by the President for six years to submit the Chairman of the Supreme Court of Justice.
In order to rejoice the judges from the pressure of regional administrations, the CPs propose a new organization of appeal and cassure in the courts of general law.
Their structure is now linked to the administrative and terrorist delegation in the FF.
The CHR says that "the organization of individual courts of appeal and cassation should not be at the level of administrative judicial bodies in RF submissions, but in judicial areas."
Experts are based on the practice of arbitration courts.
There are “countries” which are not consistent with the Administrative Delegation in the RF but guaranteed by this large independence from regional officials who are difficult to use telephone law.
The World Courts of the CPs proposes to strengthen the public meetings in order to consider some of the "Clearly and Administrative Affairs" categories.
For example, the punishment of parents ' s rights, the recruitment of work, the protection of honor and dignity, the punishment of driving rights, etc.
"It's only our proposals," explained the members of the CSD, the judge of the Constitutional Court in the department of the Mozambique Tamara.
She also recalled that the Chairman ' s mandate was not only Aids but also to the Supreme Court (US) who had not yet discovered its proposals.
The time for the implementation of the mandate in the SC (middle of the Génprocurator and the Human Rights Authority) is still available.
To add the Putin's U.S. V.R. on the effectiveness of the RF of the independence of justice, the Chairman of Vichela Lebedev should take place until 1 September.
Living a high life: half and swimming designed accommodations have converted this small apartment in Erls Cort in space housing
Joan Li, an ex-banker involving non-motive repair, moved from a space home to the Nightsbridge apartment in Erls Cort in 2014.
The Quarter is on the first stage of a sympathical house in the style of the Queen Anna, and in the benefit of the new design, Joan has not collected its things and has not moved again.
“ I lived with my former in Natsbridge at a larger level, ” says Joan.
“ I searched for something that compares my money.
I've shown this apartment in Eres Cort, and there were the same high shoes here.
I loved her and offered a price on the same day."
Since the first review of the apartment, the area has been fully rebuilding at 1000 square feet.
This was originally a apartment with a complex bed planning – to get to bed, it was necessary to walk through the kitchen – and Joanna wanted to add spaces to store and half avail to survive the maximum use of the slight height.
“ I wanted high clouds, large windows, a lot of light.
That was my requirements," she says.
To that end, she started Erfan Azadi from the architectural design studio at Notting Hille to use the slope at 12,5 feet high and create a household that would not only be successful but would be Joan for life.
The floor was insufficiently high enough to build two places over one another, so the architectural task was to build a half where it could be in full growth.
Erphane had to think about creatively to handle the bridge.
“The work of steady construction is very complicated” he explains.
“We had to make a place so that they could be on each other, and they should not be lost.
It was not just to build a simple platform, but to shoot buildings so that they could be at the right height, and to allow them to use the places above and down."
This decision allowed Erfan to establish two full-scale rooms above another in the area, and it was still much interesting.
A medium-round medium light window from "Retrouvius" is opened up a view on a smooth guest down.
The golden furniture with the office, the silver accents and the profitable machines from Serja Muya are designed.
The use of the mirror plays a role in adding slightness, space and light.
A short corner is covered with a mirror so that it's longer.
The grid protector panel seems to be a window in the other room.
In the entry of the scenes, Joan's whole ships serve.
To create a more growing space, the beauty of a guest can reward the kitchen when it is not used.
There's nothing new in the kitchen.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it's moving up the door like in the garage.
“There was an engineering art”, said Ertan about the armed shield door.
"He is sanctified by the opposite, so when you cut the door upward, it is very easy to smell."
With a reasonable use of space and storage location, Joan received additional 16 square meters, additional bed and improved planning.
"In the end, the gender area is what you're going to sell, that's what your inmobility is evaluated," says Ertan.
“Incredibly, trade agents will enter and calculate on the basis of gender area.”
Here they have been able to increase the gender area using quality materials that provide the space of the vegetable area.
“The materials are what we trigger, so they are helping to create an emotive relationship with the house,” says Erfan.
“Nobody is loved by electronic guidelines in the walls.
It is important, but is not our hearts.
This is a witness that, according to the good design and the increased apartment, a apartment may normally become something tragic.
In fact, like Joan, you can decide to stay.

Inflation in G20 has reduced to eight-year minimum
The Wall Street Journal reported that the increase in consumer prices in G20 has reduced at least eight years in the last eight years, with reference to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
According to the OECD assessments, inflation rates in June 2016 were 2 per cent-lower in October 2009 when the price growth index reached 1.7 per cent.
Previously, Russia reported that the consumer price index was 0.1 per cent.
The State thus fixed the first weekly deflation in 2017.

MIT: VSU fighters agree with Donbass officers from the command
A regular phone link has been provided on the basis of the armed conflict in Donbass.
The fighters of the fighting parties are constantly communicated with each other on mobile phones, and there is no idea of this communication in the stages.
The U.S.S. and Donbush's officials have established social phone communications out of their high command.
The 4 August reports "Strana.ua" with a reference to the military operation participants in Donbass.
According to publications, the office teams have well known the names of their colleagues with the anti-found front and are communicated daily on their phones.
Communication is absolutely unreasonable: the commanders are trying to achieve a few "tactic agreements".
The results of such discussions are a part of the transition to a certain part of the front.
The journalists were known when the welcome of a birthday of a officer was received from the front line, from its formal enemy.
The VSU and DNA and LNR fighters are sit in the division lines from spring 2014 when Ukraine began a war operation against Donbas.
IMD has abolished UN SB's statements on RF Attacks
The Russian Foreign Political State has been displaced by the actions of individual western diplomatic representatives that block the declaration of the UN Soviet Union in the press condemned by the RF Ambassador in Syria.
This reports the Russian Middle East.
The State recalled that the Russian Embassy Territory in Damaskus, 2 August, was a third-party shooting shooting by terrorists of the group Haat Tahrir Ash-Sham (the former Jabhat An-Nuzra, prohibited in RF) and Filack Ar-Rahman.
Bearing in mind that the international community in the qualification of Nizzar as a terrorism organization, and UNSB resolution called on to oppose this structure, the MID RF noted that "the terrorists of Nicera should meet a comprehensive and decisive condemnation, and in evaluations against diplomatic representatives there should not be duplication".
However, as noted in the diplomacy, "the threeth monthly diplomatic representatives of the United States, Britain, France and Ukraine in the United Nations Security Council, in a different way, have blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to adopt a standard declaration of the Security Council to condemn terrorist attacks against the Russian diplomatic capital."
The desire to demonstrate diplomatic solidarity with us remains aware of these delegations.
“Arely that the incapacity of the Security Council to condemn terrorist acts is to encourage them to new invasions and terrorists, give them feeling impunity” said in the MID, and added that "as it would not want to create these barriers a conviction that somebody in the Security Council would be in the same way."

Vladimir Putin also said that it was necessary to prohibit researchers to remove servers and hard disks on businesses.
Furthermore, the President believes that business associations should have the right to protect the interests of their members in the court.
" This is hoped to make a certain position in considering business activities or involving undertaking law," said the head of the State.
As reported by the Moratory Action on Planing Checks, the number of other types of entrepreneurs' inspections increased.
In May, a survey was made by the President of Russia, Boris Titus, which was found that it had been really replaced immediately (of 21.9 per cent in 2015 to 30.8 per cent in 2016), prosecutors (from 16.9 per cent to 21.8 per cent), raids (of 7,9 per cent to 13.3 per cent), as well as citizens ' declarations checks (augmentation from 15 to 19.5 per cent) and administrative investigations (10.8 to 15.5 per cent).

Brothers are fighting for the imperiality of more than $500 million
Two brothers are fighting for one of the largest in Victorian Empires in the trade of an inmobility of over $500 million, 40 years after their Italian priests were based on the dinastic.
The former director of the football club Carlton and the manufacturer of Colen de Lucis lives in the gate of Turk through three doors from his young brother Paul, who gave it against him in the Supreme Court for ownership and assets.
Paul wants to go out of the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court has been a terrible dispute on divorce conditions.
However, with her mother, Anna’s brother has 87 more than half-millionary dollars since their family purchased a shop in Smit-strate in Collingua in 1973.
The family was based on the Westco Jeans company, which grew up on the network with 160 trade points.
She was sold for $85 million in 1999.
Days were invoked in movement, and the list of families of De Lucis includes today official buildings, parts of the building in Brussels and Sorrento, the apartments in the Zone Area, and in Maunt-Buller and the commercial centres in rewards.
According to the agreement with the dead father of Cole, Paul, whose family De Lucis describes the “good movement and household personality”, belongs to about two thirds of the company assets, and Paul is about one third.
According to the court, the property of the Colin is 316 million and the Pole is 176 million.
Department of property and money became the Paul of the Confusion Steel.
"The Razdel proposed to give him, at my view, the best part of the ownership", he wrote in his first statements in 2015.
On Thursday, after a number of unsuccessful attempts to reconciliation, the first hearing was passed in the Supreme Court.
Brothers are now talking about whom will control the existing business, from which Paul's views have been excluded.
Colin claims that it is not true but accused of Paul to incompatible management of some objects.
In the indications shown at the beginning of the process, it is hoped that the conflict will be allowed.
"My Italian roots make me consider the family as the top priority," he wrote.
Judicial expenditure is growing as a sneak: hundreds of pages of indicators, electronic letters and reports of companies such as Deloite, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer; both the most famous lawyers, including the Queen Avocat Allan Mayers and the best strikes.
Ms. De Lucis and her peaceful partner Louisi were immigrants from Italy, since the end of the 1950s they managed milk bars and guests, and bought a shop in Brussels at the beginning of the 1970s.
In financial guarantees, they purchased a shop in Collingua, where the first family shop was opened by Jins.
Colin says he started Westco when he was "the last school classs, and Paul was a boy (approximately 10 years old).
Anna De Lucis said that they and Louise who died in 2012 were expected to transfer their possession to children without conflict.
"Luidy often told me that he wouldn't want the brothers to be judged," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, have no longer been included in the De Lucis Group; Whenna says that Mark received 10 million, when he went out of the business and 26 million Luke.
According to Paul, and Luke, and Mark were “unpleasantly satisfied with the financial conditions of their office.”
Colin was not a public figure, although it was an ex-member of the AFL club directors and, according to the biography published in 2015 by Eddie McGira, the best friend of the TV.
Farfax Media was connected to Colin and Paul and their lawyers.
He only answered the text message in which he said that because the case wasn't considered in the court, "I'm certainly nothing to say."
"I'm very sorry that my brother Paul decided to make me search and driving in the court name of our family," he wrote.
Colen wrote in the midday 2016 that he tried to meet the brother's requirements.
"Our father wouldn't want to see Paul and I are in court," he said, "we still hoped to resolve the conflict."
On Thursday, this hope seems to be divorced.
"The case will soon be issued by the court," wrote Cole.
The New Chapter of Trampa Ageo plans to limit the receipt of information to the President.
Others tried to do this and have suffered.
Maybe John F. Kelly's really going to get it.
In that case, he will be the first.
"Political" reports that the new head of the White House Age plans to limit the flow of information to the President of Trampou, including the newspapers from the media, to hope to keep the chief in a more peaceful condition.
That's what the reporter Josh Douzzi reports.
"In the meeting, who held the new head of the White House John F. Kelly with the machine leader in his first working day, he marked the main problem in Bell house at President Donald Tramp, which he hopes to solve: bad channels of information to the President. "
Kelly said to the staff that information should be passed through it, in a paper form or in a briefing, because the President would be better to make decisions if he would receive the right information.
The diagnes of Kelly are completely faithful, but others have already suffered the failure by trying to die of the Trampa, pursuing the income to him.
The relationships of President Trampa with television have been placed a few decades ago, and now when he was at the Belarus house, his tendency to watch television is still strong.
"When Trump, being candidate, was useful to show him that he had received a fair light in the publications that could be overcome," said in February, "Polyticco" Sam Nanberg, former election stage advisor.
Tara Palmeri then wrote in the Politico that "as the words of the six former election stage members to keep Trampa's access to Twitter, it was necessary to follow that the personal information was a permanent flow to him."
Okay.
But the idea that Trampa's appeal to write to Twitter was never under control, it's just funny.
Maybe these members of the election stage know something we don't know, for example, that if not, the Twitters would be more invasive.
We may never know about the Twitters that Tramp has not published.
If his staff were safeguarded from an unfortunateness several times, their efforts were not stressed.
But no one was always able to keep the trumpet from the shooting of oil in the fire.
Some of the problems are that the Belarus house, separated in the confronting fractions, is always trying to extend its agenda by the Trampou material, a reliable or not, which confirms their views.
"Political" - as once to this story - wrote in May on the tendency of advisers to continue to accompany the President of doubts.
This is an example described by the reporter Shane Goldmacher:
" The current and former Trampa staff said that Traamp could react very strictly to press reports, especially with dangerous information losses, and would not be calm until he finds who stands for them.
This happened at the end of February when someone sent the President on the article with GotNews.com, the website of Charles K. Johnson's web advisor, whose head of the head of Catty Walsh was accused that she was "in the Belarus house."
It is not important that Johnson is permanently engaged in Twitter for agressive behavior that he did not present specific facts or that in the past he had made false charges and then rejected them.
Tramp read the article and was taken to ask the Walsh staff."
Goldmacher adds that then the head of the Rains Camp and the secretariat Robb Porter were trying to build a system to manage the tramp flow and document them.
How did that work?
Three months later, Kelly tried to do the same.
It may be a more effective manager than Pribos, but Trampa continues to have an impulsive nature, and his assistants are still fighting for the influence of each other.
These permanent factors make Kelly's task very difficult.

Italy is a ton of NGO ships saving migrants.
Italy warned NGOs belonging to the Mediterranean Saving Courts that they would not continue to work if they were not subject to new rules that regulate their activities.
"If NGOs are not subject to the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they can continue their activities", said the Minister of Interview of the Tourism daily newspaper.
The warning of Minnesota was on the next day after the Italian authorities confidenced a vessel belonging to the German humanitarian organization "Junge Rettet", as suspected that his equipment actually cooperated with traffickers and facilitated illegal immigration.
The civilian organization, working throughout the year, rejected comments on the existence of details accused of the Italian Prosecutor Ambredjo Cartocio.
"The salvation of human life is and remains the top priority, so we are very regretted that we cannot now continue to work in the search and salvation zone," says the organization in the community.
"We can assess all the accused today, only after we collect all the information and assess the situation."
Italian authorities follow the Court of the United States, belonging to Jugend Rettet, from October.
His equipment suspected that the whole savings ships had taken on the board of migrants whose traffickers were directly sent to them and allowed contractors to go together with ships that they could re-use again.
As a minimum of one meeting is expected, there was a total of 1,3 miles from the Libyan Valley, which is claimed in the materials of accused that the content was published in Italian media.
The Equipage is suspected in violation of the prescriptions of Italian coastal authorities that control saving operations in this area, perhaps from humanitarian rhino than any other motivation.
The Code of Comporting provides primarily that the court type of the United States will have the board of the Italian police officer, which will follow their activities.
As long as only three of the nine NGOs participating in search and saving operations agreed to subscribe the Code "Slaughter Childs", the Malta MOAS and the Pro-Activa Related Training" from Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that the new rules were not necessary but acceptable, provided that they do not affect any "important changes or grounds" to its saving operations.
Among those who refused to sign are the Nobel Prize of the MSF.
As a result, Minniti said that the slight reduction in the last weeks of the number of migrants arrived in Italy as a result of rescue operations indicated that the efforts to support the liquid sea protection and cooperation with the local seamarks were produced.
"In the last days we started seeing light at the end of the tunnel," said Minister.
He reported on further negotiations with the Libyan Mares on economic development initiatives and Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants left in hope to reach Europe.
"In Libya, we don't want to associate any part of the conflict."
The RF authorities recently intensified their policy on the liquid direction, and visitors in Moscow participated in the anti-liby combating delegations.
Head of the Russian contact group on internal settlement with IT RF and Hosed, Headquarters of the Checa Republic of Lev Daygov told what goal Moscow is to be pursued in the region and to whom the rates are to be taken.
About the Libyan contact group, which you call, almost nothing knows.
Here, let's say, the Ukrainian contact group is all about it.
And here's the weight of secrets.
What are you doing, and what are you doing?
The accounting group was established on the initiative of MID FMI and the State thinking.
His activities were smoking by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mikhail Goddan, and Adam Delimano (Deputy Duma from Chechnie. - " ś ").
The last authorized to work on the liquid direction of the Vichela Voluntana.
Instead of establishing a group, the Russian Dancer in Libya, Mechanic Chabotarv (in September 2015, 11 persons were on board. - ✔).
We've been thinking about how to help the equipage.
Then, a group of military specialists, representatives of the Hospital, has also been established to support the Chief Channie Ramzan Kadirros.
How did you get it?
As I worked in Libya since 2008, I have called on a proposal for a group's work.
Our activities were not limited to the freedom of marine from the Cheboterarea Mechanic.
We have been able to establish contacts with representatives of all the main groups that are opposed to each other in the Libyan conflict, and from the third part of the Tripolis, where the United Nations recognized Government, head-in-law Fais of Sarajem. - ✔, and Tobruk (the parliament resident, which opposes the Government and supports the Haftar Marshall, which controlled the Eastern Libya regions. - ✔).
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metiga (Vice-Premier Libya), we could quickly agree on the release of Russian marine.
It was then decided to use these contacts more effectively to create a contact group.
Its task is analysis of circumstances, identifying key factors and players, dialogue with all the parties of the conflict.
I should like to emphasize: In Libya, we do not want to associate any part of the conflict, we lead to dialogue with all.
How many are in the contact group and how many of them are in Libya?
The contact group now includes five people.
There are among them who have experiences in force structures, including the Ministry of Defence.
We also want to integrate a group of experts in the region, representatives of the Institute of the Middle East of the RAN.
There is no one in Libya until it is not necessary.
Is there now Russian military advisers in Libya, instructors?
And if so, who's on the side?
Russian military specialists in Libya aren't.
All conversations and publications of this are not real.
But in your contact group, the former soldiers...
Yeah, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit the warm point.
Or close to a certain moment for us by the city, such as the Misurerate (which is based on the performance offices playing a role in the Level leader of Muammar Kadafi in 2011 and was significantly actived in the following years. - " .
We came to Missouri in January this year.
We were scared, they said you were all the Islamics, terrorists.
But it was important for us to evaluate the circumstances there, to analyze the real military capacity that answers why the ears to the role of Islamics.
In Misulate, we met all representatives of the IH destruction in Syria (in December 2016, this city was discovered in the Mediterranean coast of the banned "Islam State" in Russia).
We wanted to look at them, to meet them, to check the information that they have played a decisive role in the destruction of the IH in Libya, not Kalifa Haphtar, which has recorded them.
And what outcome did you come?
"Islam State" in Libya won't Haphtar?
He did not.
Haphtar has operated on the other front in Bengasi.
And with the IH in Syria, the structures undergoing to the Government in Tripoli were fighting.
And on the other hand, we invited people to Russia to conduct this anti-terrorism operation.
And they came to the visit from 19 to 23 April this year, and the legitimate delegation adopted in the Federation Council, Douma, MIT and Russia.
You have understood that you are in all the liquid regions and you probably represent local elites and field commanders.
How do you think it could be possible to make a war stop agreement, about the elections reached at the end of July at Halifa Haphtar and Fais Saraja?
Or, how has this been several times in the past, will the agreements be ruled, war action will be renewed, and the parties will try to take the authority unilaterally?
For us, a good sign has been the fact that Sarah and Haftar agreed to a regular meeting, not so long as it was impossible.
In the past recently, both leaders were extremely negatively reacted to each other.
What about Russia's position...
Many believe that Moscow is actively supported by Haphtar.
We faced this situation when we were in Misulate, and Haphtar was on the Russian aircraft board on this day.
It was a convergence.
But they did not believe in the Misulate.
We said, "You must be very courageous people that have come to us today."
But our task is as to show that we are not only supporting Haphtar, we lead to dialogue with all key parties to the conflict in Libya.
You've been talking to Haphtar.
Does it facilitate understanding with Russian partners at human and emotional level that he has learned two times in the SSSS?
And, of course, do Haphtar know Russian language?
He's Russian if he knows, it's very relative.
But what he has learned is, of course, helping the dialogue with him.
And among others, not only with him.
When we communicate with the military in Tripoli and Misulate, we meet the generals who have learned in Russia or still in the Council.
And here they're beautifully talking about Russians.
And they're going to Russia, and somewhat they're experienced by it.
Do you read the possible abolishment of the weaponsambargo Levia?
Are you interested in your Little Countries for Russian weapons?
Of course, we are interested, but, as I have said, we do not do any part in this conflict and would not want to weapon one another to harm others.
We would like to be closely in equal positions.
With regard to the armed embargo, the liquidists are always calling for Russia to make it possible.
It is now active in Libya to develop constitutional processes.
We hope that the parties will go to compromise decisions and that internal consensus will be achieved.
Then the elections should be held at the Saraja and Haphtar meeting.
If elections are held and finally chosen to the legitimate authority (who there is no part of that status), the United Nations Soviet may be asked to remove a weapon embargo.
To put this issue now unreasonable and dangerous, it will only lead to the excavation of conflict.
At the time of the media, Italy, who had faced the problem of African refugees, has felt that he had been broken in the courts of the EU.
Can Moscow help Italian partners in this situation by using their liquors?
How, for example, is the realistic option that the Haftary offices will install the cost control and put the end of the business of immigrant contracts in Europe?
A very time question.
We're active about this.
Italians need Russia's support because Moscow conducts dialogue with Haphtar and Sarajeh and the Missouri and the Southern country at the same time.
And in this regard, the tribes play on the south of Lewi, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is this about the flows of migrants in further attacks?
I mean, what I mean is, they have turned back the bus in which Nigerian migrants come from?
We're trying to do this.
But it's not simple.
Some clusters and groups are interested in continued walking.
We hope that we can combine South in the negotiation process between Saraje, Haphtar and the southern tribes.
But for the beginning, we would like to see the only view on this issue between Haphtar and Sarageum.
The Head of the Government in Tripoli Fais Saraja is considered Islamic, a stakeholder in the country of shariat standards.
How radical is he holding?
Is this not an obstacle to the extent of Russia or West?
I will express my personal view of it.
In my view, he opposed a radical Islam.
But the Islamics are in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself holds the position that Libya must be a completely normal country - a deadly Islamic, open peace.
He is also actively fighting terrorists.
How did he have such a reputation?
It has been established by countries that are not interested in Russia's communication with Tripoli.
Tripoli is a capital, and there is legislative, executive and judicial authority.
There is a national oil company, a national bank and other government structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in not being used there.
And we've got all the maps to them and we've been actively communicating with Tripoli and Tobruk.
And the fruits of this work were already broken: Rosnife has concluded the cooperation agreement with the Libyan State oil company - NOC.
The director of the NUC Mustafa Sanal, whose head of Ronnifety Ygor Sechin had a deal, was directly from the Tripolis.
And two weeks ago, the first shipping of the Rosnit Oil was loaded.
What would Russia do with her?
I think we're gonna sell it.
What other economic interests in Libya are Russia?
Reimbursement of contracts held in Muammar Caddafi.
This is, in particular, the previous contracts in the transport area (construction of iron roads), the energy (electricity) and a number of others.
What do you have to pay the liquors?
Well, they've got oil.
Does it mean, as in the case of Iran, it's about the "scale of services" scheme?
I don't know what schedule will be, so I'm not doing this matter directly.
Indeed, Russia's economy is not mainly in Libya.
We are, in fact, employing peace-making work.
For us the main thing is to stop bloodprostitute, help liquors to agree with themselves so that they have been able to set up the order and Libya has stopped being a well-being environment for terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task of helping the Libyan people and to issue terrorists from there.
Do you have information on the presence in Libya (or now or before) of Russia or other former SSSC countries?
One of our contact groups was the explanation of this.
I met with the representative of the Libyan Security Committee, who said that there is no leave from Russia and other former SSA countries there today.
He said he had some 500,000 phone records of representatives of Islamic and Radio-Gruppe (in Libya) and Russian speaking there is no sound.
What states are those fighters then?
I wouldn't like to get into these details.
Then we'll make a question otherwise.
How many of the Islamic fighters in Libya are the most livians?
There is no more than 5 per cent of the Libyans.
The last ones are sweet.
Can Moscow conduct internal negotiations on Paris?
There are such plans.
We conducted active negotiations with the leaders, some delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow and said that they were ready to come to Moscow or Grosk.
And when can such negotiations be taken?
Now it's hard to say.
There should be a number of visits, and I hope there is a clearness about time and negotiations.

Condemnation Michel Carter for the message of Conrad Roy
The Deputy of Massachusetts sent two and a half years in charge that it had encouraged the self-assault of Conrad Roy's slaughter.
Michelle Carter, who is now 20 years, will be delayed for 15 months for the decision and five years of testing.
Carter was acknowledged in June by the unforeseen murder of Conrad Roy, which ended with her on 13 July 2014.
Father Roy said to hearing on Thursday, "My family was killed by pain.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to stay free to appeal.
She threatened the maximum period for 20 years, but her lawyers said that she was, and Roy suffered psychological disorders.
Carter, who was in the red brown and a bleeding blue, listened to the judgment standing, slept his hands and shooted his eyes.
"He killed Conrad Roy with his acts," said the Prosecutor.
"He stopped his life to improve her.
She didn't recognize the responsibility," she said.
"He hasn't demonstrated repentance."
But the lawyer Carter said that it was "a tragic case that she was very sorry."
However, judge Lawrens Monys said that it was the view that her "drast, the level of brutality or even mental diseases did not have a significant impact on its action".
The accuser reads the statement of the mother Roy Lin Roy, which says: "I wouldn't have been a day when I wouldn't swear the loss of my loved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I run - I'm trying to support his sister, despite all the pain that remains with us forever," says it.
Sister Roy Camdin Roy said that she was urged to overcome the thought that she could never be able to present on his marriage or to become his children's tea.
"Let the man who was with me always since my birth is the pain that will remain with me until the end of my life," she said.
This case seems to be legally preceding, since Massachusetts had no law which would be responsible for the Council for self-assault.
In 2014, when Roy found the dead symptoms of coal gas in the car, Carter was 17 years old.
This happened to the whole country when it was known that he was subjected to the self-assault message of Carter.
"That may be shooting, smelling, smelling your feet, I don't know a lot of ways," she wrote in a few messages sent for two weeks before his death, when he was shocked with his family.
In a few minutes before the suicide she wrote, "You're gonna do this, Conrad, and "You're just going to enter the sweet, and you're free and happy."
The judge Monys said that Carter wanted to get attention by Roy's death, and prohibited her to contact the press to not give her the desired one.
The opinions of lawyers on this matter were separated.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Nox, who was sentenced in 2007 for murder in Italy by his British neighbourhood and was sentenced two years later.
Nox, a 30-year-old year, published his special view in Los Angeles Times, stated: "Ms. Carter is worth symptoms and assistance, not prisons."

“Audi” is to modify to 850 000 distance vehicles
On the day before the Audio Declaration, BMW stated that it would propose to update the program assurance of more than 350 000 cars.
The President of BMW stated that the company was considered that “earnest intellectual ways than the restriction limits”, which means European cities, including Munchen, where BMW is, had considered the possibility to prohibit or limit the use of environmental cars.
The Dymler said on Thursday that the revised three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their dioxide flow.
No company called his step to call.
European cars were actively conducted in Europe and the United States to facilitate the compliance with the carbon gas emission rules.
But the oxygen of the azote that elects the dioxide engines are considered cancer and can call asthma.
The cost of the manufacturers of the installations, which is also higher and the maintenance of the competitive cost of the vehicle is complicated.
While the German car producers were in a position, the Government of the Office of Angela Mercelle also accused that it posed an impacted car producers and ignored the signs of the problem.
The companys are trying to not repeat the "Folxvagen" errors that hide the use of such "first equipment" which could be sent during testing the number of selected harmful gases in order to comply with the rules and, in terms of ordinary injury, disabled.
In the United States, a sentence was sentenced to a number of Folxvagen leaders, the remaining of the Atlantic sides.

The former manager, Zakeo Jovannie Pamio, was not protected from extradition and may be before the court in the United States.
Last year, “Audi” was under German criminal investigation with Folxvagen’s involvement since the authorities were accused of ‘Audi’ in the establishment of the European Rules of Emission and extended the investigation that was previously concentrated in the United States.
Inclusion of the Audios can create serious Pholxvagen problems: the producer of elite cars is an unproportionally large part of the income of the Folxvagen.

The astronoms have found a "aside" planet on which even iron can be floured.
In the first study of the properties of the guiant exhibition named WASP-121b, the astronomies were very surprised by the temperature that could be eliminated by iron and other metals.
The specialists pointed out that water molecules were so disgraced by the light of the stars that disrupted inflation.
The "Habbl" telescope has printed the water molecule on this gas gas, and this high temperature makes the water in the atmosphere of the planet light in inflation diameter.
The WASP-121b refers to the so-called "great pitters" - gas hydrats, the size and mass compared to the largest planet of the Solar system, but is ten times close to the parent star.

Climate change is threatening the lavande in Provans.
She became a symbol of Provans and South France, but now it is a threat to climate change.
Lavanda was worse to grow from the weather and the transmission of insected diseases, and it was the main pain of scientists and farmers who are trying to find a decision.
Eric Shes, an expert of the Agricultural Research Institute in Provance, says: "The Lavanda in Provans is really threatened, since this growth has affected the impact of climate change in the past years: early and especially sugar has become too few.
This affects the deadline of the lavanda.
And there are still small cyclings that smell insected insecting micro-bacteria; they are very slowly weatherly."
There's a lot on the map.
Lavanda is not only attractive to departments, but the lavanda oil is very covered in parfumeration and space.
Eric Shes says: "Instead of a very long number of large colors, we have small, unfavourable, weakened or missing.
So we have less parts that contain epileptic oil."
The decisions that are now considered include the improvement of water distribution and the slowness of eating, as well as the detection of the plant protection of bovine and water and the smells that are more sustainable to the sugar.

Violence is not transferred, and among the bodys multiplied in the country, more journalists: on data of the Protection Committee of Journalists, not less than 25 since President Enrico Peen Nieto took its position in December 2012; 589 persons after attacks and threats are under federal protection; and at least seven people have already died in seven states in this year.
Among the last ones are their publisher and inspirer, the Riodos Collector, Havier Waldes Cardens.
“The great error is living in Mexico and being journalist,” wrote Waldes in one of his many books on drug-related violence crimes.
His absence is very delicate, even though his presence is a large photo of the Valdez, showing the medium ball, with the description of the Riodose building; two reporters for 30 years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, have a football on which his legs, his faces in the eyes of the company, or his firm panams.
The seminar is less than two months after his death; the journalists discuss their general trauma, their cosmetics, their unsomed and paranoia.
While in 2010, a special federal prosecutor was organized to investigate journalist cases until two cases were investigated by the Journalist Protection Committee.
Like in most of the thousands of murders of drugs and organized crimes each year, journalists are rarly in front of the court.
The journalists Riodoos claim that they will write on violence in Singapore, although they are killed by pain, although it is now more dangerous.
Without information on the murderers, without the justice of the security talks at meetings, Ibarra says.
"It's very stupid to lose time on this seminar," he says.
"When we don't know why, we're all suspected."
On May 15th, Waldes went from the Riodos office in the city of Cuban.
He was able to walk only a couple of quarters before his red king stopped two men; he was shooted out of the car and shooted in him 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which means "Twitter River".
He went to his car and slaughtered her closer.
Waldes was 50 years old.
He remained a wife and two adult children.
The servants normally disappear to Kuliakan.
But Waldes' prayers are almost all.
Since Guzman was arrested and issued in the United States in January last year, Singala became one of the most bloody fighting fields in the country, since the conflicting fractions are struggling for the full of the training vacuum.
We will not say that every day on the Sinala streets kill one or a few people, or that the slaughter is fully shocked by two-ethic drugs, more than the house of many living people.
Let's forget that the state of shocking is just when one of the carrières takes control of the premature state with important drug ports and ways leading to the United States.
Despite this, Valdes was well known about the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohokux, the 60-year-old co-chairman and the director of Riodos, was dismissed by the sense of guilty because he did not want to protect a friend.
He thinks that the murder helped two mistakes.
First, in February, Damaso Lopes was a leader of the controversial fraction of the carriage that fights with the sons of Guzman.
Publication could be disappointed by sons; people who preferably were band members have purchased all the publications when they were brought to the kitchen.
The second error was that he did not put Valdes for his own security to leave the country after a other newspaper written on the same story.
Waldes was a lingery in Mexico and the border, and his murder was estimated as a natural century in developing violence against journalists in Mexico.
He was so long away from the danger, his friends and colleagues thought he would always be.
He was an experienced reporter in Norwegia, and in 2003, with five colleagues, Riodoos, sold his 50-off-to-building action.
In Singapore, "It was impossible to work a journalist without affecting the topic of drugs", said Bochorks.
Since the newspaper, the reputation of courageous and honest publications, sales and advertising revenues grew.
The journalists liked that they could publish sweet reports without fear of the scenes, but the readers were able to read that there was no more time to write.
Eight years after its foundation of Ríodos, Mary Murs Cabo received a prestigious prize for reporting work in Latin America.
In the same year, Waldes wins the International Press Freedom for the Rule of Drugs investigation in Mexico, where it would not be a wheel.
He was clearly acknowledged that he was scared.
"I want to live further," he said with the CPJ premium.
The drug trafficking in Singapore is "This is the shape of life", said in October last year at the TV interview.
"You have to take the tasks that are false on you like a journalist, or you're just swearing the smell."
I don't want to ask me, "What did you do when you were around the dead... why didn't you say what's going on?"
The Riodox workers are missing in Valdes, a shooter who slaughtered as a loader in the port, the other, a generous, and the advice, a teacher who knew how to get a hundred in the lives.
They trusted in their order.
He should always take his shooting.
He had to go to El Guyabo, bar against the office, and always sit there for the same table.
Now they ask: Did he lost love for a single order?
His death also made them aware of how to do better their work and remain in the lives.
"They do not like you to find out in their women, children, their legal business and underpower aircraft for drug transport.
"These things were shooting," said Boholics.
The results, even in the best times, were high levels of self-estimation and self-reliance.
I have to believe in his instincts.
Stay away from what's bad.
The problem is, it says, "Riodose" editor Andrés Villareal, that "the fear can be lied... and then happens what happened to Havier."
Old rules, said he and others, are not more in Sinala - both in Tamauripas, Veracrus, Guerrero and other states, where there are a deterioration of profitable contractual ways, weak state institutions and corrupted officials.
Landshaft's always changed.
In the room where the Riodoos staff had gathered for security training, it was then prohibited to introduce hundreds of phones: for a few days before it was known that the spy programs sold only to Governments were used in Mexico for journalists and public activists.
Out of two police officers are hidden in the dark of 104 degrees of grain (40 degrees per Celcia).
They gave the Government ' s mission to protect the Riodoos Office, situated in the four-year building in the Kuliakhan Quarter quarter.
Some journalists asked whether the police were not included in the 50 per cent of the orders that the Governor had said that he could not trust them.
A few months ago, journalists have been sent to a mountain place that is de facto under the drug trafficking band.
In the nearest number of Ríodos, three main topics were calculated.
That's a murder in Sinala's brother's former champion on the boss of Hulio Sezar Chavez.
They also had the deployment of government costs concentrated in the gubernamentary city.
And there was a group of people in one of the most beautiful restaurants of Kulikaan, in the Quartet of the Prosecutor's office.
It was officially not declared who had been disfellowshipped or what happened, so it had to be careful when it was time to write that all in the city knew that it was the favorite restaurant of drugs and authorities at the same time.
One of their journalists learned from the open databases that the restaurant was registered on behalf of the policy belonging to the Governing Institution and Revolutionary Party (PRI), which was dominated at all levels of the authorities in almost the last century.
Recently, a number of gouverneurs from PRI have been charged with a slight detention in corruption.
Wildreal asked journalists to write on the previous incidents in the restaurant, including when El Chapo, the son, Guzman, was disfellowshipped from the areas of military.
A few months ago, readers would search for the Valdes column with the most reliable search information.
"We would have known what happened," says the 46-year-old Villareal, for its artic body named El Flaco.
"All channels of our sources are disrupted every year."
The Valdesa office is now used for plots and strikes with protests against the murder of journalists, since the staff became the one whom they had never thought to be: the activists speaking on behalf of the press.
The journalist Miriam Ramirez took several pledges and sent the next morning to a demonstration in a local prosecutor dedicated to another journalist.
Salvador Adams disappeared in the Michoacan state, west of the country, three days after the murder of Waldes.
There was a body found, and the authorities said it was, on the basis of DNA tests.
In the whole country, journalists have been expressed so much, organizing protesters and writeing SOS Press on the throats and the walls of houses.
On that day, the director of Boholics was in Washington, trying to support internationally in the case of Valdes.
The next day after the murder of Valdez Ramirez accused the authority that they were shocked by journalists and ordered to kill them because they say the truth.
After that, she asked not to give her more tasks to the Government ' s publicity, fearing that the angry was harming its objectiveness.
Valdez said many times that journalists in Mexico were "circle" organized by crime, its participants to the government and the impartial society.
He wrote in his last book that reporters are not just killing drug traffickers; they do this on orders for policy and security services in conspiration with organized crime.
The Committee on the Protection of Press Articulus 19 believes that half of the attacks against journalists in the past year were made by the police and government officials.
"In Mexico you're dead because they want to close you," Ramirez says.
Of course, the murder is threatening people.
All remembered that Maria Elizabeth Massai six years ago in the northern border State of Tamaulipas, blogger.
On her body, there was a note written in the face of the card of Zetas: "I'm here because of my articles."
The computer keyboard and the snakes were close to her cut head.
Some publications prefered to close as the El Nord newspaper in the northern border of Chihuahua after the murder of her representative of Miroslav Brich in March.
Others remain as El Manjana from Novo Laredo after the murder of her leader in 2004.
In 2010, The Diario de Sudad Huarez was publicly called to drug cards using a draft article on the first page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists abandoned their family states or their country.
This is a painful decision.
In the escape, it is difficult to find work, and they are still exacerbating the dangers on the streets.
And sometimes they killed them as apparently with the photo of Ruben Espanzoy, who was killed in 2015 with four women in the apartment in Mexico three months after flying from Veracrus.
Those who remain and continue to work are balanced daily between risked decisions.
Ibarra, who had ever dreamed to be a poet, admits that he was afraid to write about drug trafficking.
"Mexican's cut into the god, and so I became a journalist," he says.
On Thursday, when the last exhibition was ready to print, the Riodoos publishers sit on the troop side of the office and drinked a drink when their phones were soon called.
A series of shocks between the combating bands and the security forces near the smoke city of Masattlen left, as confirmed, 19 bodies.
The war continued to discourage, as was promised in a series of letters from the carrières found in the area.
They've been on the trottel, they've posted news via a mobile phone on the Riodos website.
On the next day, the first page was to be distributed.
The snakes have increased, the other shooting in the neighborhood.
Boholics had considered whether they were ready to defend their police.
If they were scared, they did not show anything.
Situation under the great portrait of the dead founder of their newspapers, whose medium-spot was issued to the survey of the whole Sinala, and the Riodose Workers continued his case.
"What can you think about closing?" said Boholics, "if the day when Havier was killed, the practitioner asked me to send her to the street to make a report?"
Dinosaur was used to avoid the enemies
First, he seems to be statistics, although it is a fearful.
Researchers reported that the first remains of the incredibly incredible dimensions of the noise found by the Canadian shooter remained so well that the experts were called "My Liza among the dinosaurers".
It was so well that they were even able to determine that the color of his cheese skin was red-rooted - and to say that he had, in some kinds of, "this was the past".
In the report published in the Modern Biology Journal, it was described as “the one of the best dinosaurs of the world’s dinosaur.”
This was scanned, a recent Nodozer, which lives in the middle of the low period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly good status has been made by researchers who are called "effectively wonderful".
This magic tireofor is the most well-conserved species in the whole history of events, according to the articles in National Geographic magazine.
He was found by Shon Fang, when the Millennium Company was close to the Fort McMurry, northern Albert, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
He stressed something that seemed to be different from the environment, and decided to look more carefully.
The discovery was sent to the Kingdom Paleonological Museum.
The following six years has been working for the discovery of the animal inside the earthquake of 2500 feet (100 kg).
Now, when the whole hard work has been done, the final results can be demonstrated.
“ It's just a slightness and it's possible to realize that he's sleeping,” said the leader Caleb Brown, scientist of the Palestinian Palestinian Museum of Tyrrells, where the creation is demonstrated.
"He enters the history of science as one of the most beautiful and well-conserved dynamizers – Mona Liz among the dinosaurs. "
In studying his skin, researchers found that it was a heavy skin, despite the smell of the pancil and remembering the skin tank, all of the visibility, was a significant danger from the flesh dinosaurs.
This powerful panzer dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from strikes, and used a protective technician known as a protective squeeze that also uses many animals today.
This would allow him to communicate with the environment and avoid meetings with enemy, said the experts, pretending that there were larger dinosaurs on him.
This exists in the age of 110 million years of age, with regard to the family of nodo-saws, was widely launched in May, and is now on exposition to the Kingdom Palestinian Museum.
Scientists have already studied animals and gave him a name of Borealopelta Markmitchelli on the honour of the museum lab, Mark Mitchell, one of the members of the group, which has been held over 7000 hours for his crowd.
The surprising conservation of the extraterrestreater allowed Dr. Mitchell and the international scientists to document the painting and shape of chessue and pancil platinum on his body.
They have found a protected shock distributed by the protection method in the Kingdom of the animals, which means that the top of the existance was darkly below.
Although the protected clash is well distributed, the opening was unexpected, because the size of the Borealopelta dinosaur is significantly higher than the present living animals with protected okra.
It could be suggested that the dinosaurs had so actively seized in this dinosaurs that the evolution prefered the mass of conflict as a way of survival.
However, most modern animals with protected oceans, for example, ovins, sweats or bronettes, are a significantly lower size and are more accessible, which indicates that the nodosaurus had to be severely fighting for survival.
“The severe threat from the strikes for a massive, smooth panzer of the dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaurs of the Melo period,” reported Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic connections in the cheese dinosaurus also indicates that his hair should be redacted and redacted.
Scientists continue to study the animals, finding information on his life, including the content of his nutritional trace to find out what he eat during his last trap.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, he fell into the river and was taken into the sea where he was cut down and slow down the lion on the bottom of the ocean.
At that time, Albert was so warm as now on the south of Florida, and the rivers and the oceans, likely, were widely dispersed in the depth of sugar than now.
“ The nodozavur was indeed noted that it was fully smelled with the cheese skin, and at the same time it was fully maintained in three measurements, keeping an identical form of animal, ” said Brown.
“The animal now appears almost as it appeared in the Lannn at a small period.
It must not be particularly necessary to go to the imagination to restore it, just to be slow and you can almost believe that he is sleeping."
The low period is the time when the guiant terrorists, the meat dinosaurers on two feet, were broken on the earth.
Although the most wonderful one of them, the Tirannozawr Rex, lived for millions of years later than Borealopelta, a tireophora could shoot some of his magnificent priests.
They include actors, a 38 feet (11,5 m) weight in six tons.
Scientists whose last openings are published in the New World Biology magazine, believe that Borealopelta has been brought to the sea and has been mutatised to it.
The property was found by Shon Fang, when the Millennium Chanching work was close to the Fort McMurry, northern Albert, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
According to the museum staff, it is the most well-conserved tireofor worldwide, together with skin and pancil, and it was aimed, from the sea to the poor skin.
In the meantime, they reached about 18 feet (5 m) long and weighed up to 3000 feet (1300 kg).
Their characteristic meeting was twenty-twenty-five shirts, speaking from the shoe.
Researchers believe that this magic tireophor has been harder because it is now Canada until the river has not brought it to the open sea.
However, the sub-convulsion of the dinosaur maintained his panician with precise precise precision to the smallest details.
The random remains of this specific expansion were so well that the skin remains still covering bugry pancil plates around the head of the dinosaurus.
As Michael Greece wrote in the article for the National Geographic magazine, it is a stage of maintenance as you win in the lottery.
As far as I look at him, he seems more sensitive.
The skin skin remains still covering bugry pancils that smell the heads of the animals.
His right front feet is cut around the side, five fingers on it are turned up.
I can compare the cheese on his floor."
Mihail Saakashvili was able to return to Poland without documents
Mikhail Sakashili, who was previously launched in Georgia, and then the Odeks area in Ukraine, arrived in Poland.
He did so, not with documents that confirm his personality and citizenship.
Saakashvili reports the Poland television publication of the Republic, which has posted on its YouTube channel with his exhibition.
Saakashivili held an event to the Varsabian Resurrection anniversary against the Hitlerian forces in 1944.
Since the politicians did not know Poland, although he tried to start speaking in this language, he had to speak to the English through the Polish translator.
During its speech, the politician was focused on Georgia's cooperation with Poland, and was also talking about Ukraine.
The Ukrainian Migration Service has lost his citizenship, the public policy has found it in the United States.
How could he make a transatlantic transfer without documents until it was unknown.
Previously, the former Governor of the Mihail Saakashvili stated that his signature was undersigned to the Anket to obtain the citizenship of Ukraine.
Politics stressed that he didn't fill any ankets.
The duration of the events in the case of Vinzicher and Olhavski extended to January
The period of the preliminary impact on the ownership of the Rnova Group, the Oilhavsky Employee and the head of the T Pluss, Boris Vinzicher, extended to 2 January 2018.
On Thursday, 3 August, the Court of Basman considers the proliferation of a house arrest.
The representative of the CP at the meeting reported that the last time it was decided to extend the period of preliminary impact.
The investigator stated that "the extreme complexity and long-term impact is the need for the elimination and expertise of a large number of documents, as well as for investigation on the territory of a number of RF actors," said the investigator.
He added that the suspected had regularly given the Commission ' s guidelines.
They are estimated in at least a billion rubbers.
As a result, Vinzhier, Olkhuik, and the former SO, Commplix Energy Systems, Mikhail Slobodyn, who resigned to the Shimpholk company until 5 September, had transferred the senior officials to the Republic of the Commission for the establishment of maximum benefital rates for heat and electronic energy, as well as for the establishment of favourable conditions for business.
Vinzier and Olhavick were arrested, stood in Sinktawkar and arrested for two months, Slobodin was hidden from the incidents and was declared in the federal search.
How did one aktivist learn the answer to the question “What is the street?”
On 9 August 2014, Britain Ferrell was shocked to the depth of the soul.
Only a day later after the arriving to New York in a tourist journey from St. Luis was sit down to bed in the airbnb at the phone board.
She shocked somebody from the middle of the school.
The police just killed a 15-year-old child, and he still stays through the street.
He pointed out that no more of her fellowships did not cover this information, she closed the fax and opened the Twitter.
There were many posts of users in her legend with no one @TheePharoah.
Repertoire from St. Luyus in real time has been twittered by Michael Brown, a preserved preserved 18-year-old teenager murdered by the police officer in Ferguson, Missouri State.
He published a photo of the unreliable Braun body, distributed within the street, where it will be four hours.
“ It's disastrous, ” Ferrell thought.
But death wasn't a new thing for her and her circle.
She took a phone, and later night he returned to Twitters that people were gathering in Canfield.
There were photos of the signal and the crying people and people who claimed that he was the father of Braun, who shouted: “The police from Ferguson just killed my unarmed son!”
She looked at the direct transmission of the police officer in front of a group of protesters with sweet dogs.
Another video of another policeman, she told her, shooted a smoke and shooted, "I'm gonna kill you all... animals."
“ This is an unexpected situation”, said Ferrell at the time.
“ This isn't a murder like those we're attracted and typical.
At that time, I felt a sense of awareness.
I was angry and crying."
She took a ticket on a ray and hurleted home on the next day.
When she landed on the 11th night, she took her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided both of them to Ferguson on the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years, was a new documentary film “What Is the Street?” that will be on the screen on August 11.
This is the story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and patience from the view of people living in the community and in the full streets, the demands of answers.
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter, covered in a ball in a color and a vent under color, they remembered the conversation that took up to this morning countless times, “to experience of black and their situation.”
She remembers how she said: “Remember, how I told you how black people had to fight for what they believed?
We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed a 18-year-old boy, and that's wrong."
“ I couldn’t take her, ” said Ferrell later.
“What happens today is a culmination of what happened before.
She must know about it, see it and learn about it.
It should not only be a good idea in activeism and organization, but also understand the different levels of experience of black and their situations and what we should do to be free to be free.
Even if I can assure her the environment in which she is not personally connected with the obvious racism, she is nothing different from any other black girl.
I feel that she would have a bad service if she would be rewarded from it."
When they arrived in Ferguson, the first stop they made at Saoth-Florissant-Rood, on the board that was located through the road from the police office, which made something like a palace camp while activists waited for reports on the outcome of the officer, Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and her daughter were joined to a local company who prepared the package chain.
They gathered the packages and helped their protesters.
Inconsciousness, Ferrell stripped a new type of activism.
“ My activist has been completely changed after August 9,” she noted that as a student of the University of Missouri-Center-Luis, she was President of the Sanitary Association of Students, National Minorities, and had been a food justice and health inequality among black communities.
“ I had no experience of the organizer.
That came to himself."
After a few weeks of the evening, Ferrell met Sabaa Folaian, one of his counterparts.
Folarian said that she and her principal operator Lucas Alvarado-Fererer wanted to document the event.
Ferrel came to the head, “You want to document or try to find the story you can play?”
This skepticism was a lot of people, often white who came to the community in order to benefit from his pain and patience.
As explained recently by Folaian, “We heard that the voice of people who were born and growing in Ferguson would not be in the centre of attention, and those who want to do this differently.”
Foliani has already been linked to his co-chairman David Davis, the local artist known by his activeism on the cases sentenced to death penalty.
His participation was a symptom of the Ferrell project and the six local people with whom the project “What is the street?” supported the connection over the years after the murder of Brian.
“In this documental film no one speaks for us or with us, that's what we say,” said David.
“This was the most important for me as these people will be presented, because this is how I will be presented.”
And although the project was aimed not to focus on the experience of Ferrel – to show that the movement is not “the leaders of the Safety, but how the community is together,” said the Forestian, was the most open part of the films.
As a result in “What Is the Street?”, the personal aspects of the life of Ferrell, for example, how she loved and marryed her wife.
“ I feeled awesome, ” said Ferrell, smilingly telling me how I had first seen a ready product.
"But I understood that when you do such a job and humanize the blacks, some level of vulnerability must be. "
Moreover, the history of Ferrell again discusses and emphasizes the role of the blacker homosexual woman in a broader context of the movement “The Life of Blacks has an importance.”
Two of the third movement founders – those who created #BlackLivesMatter in social networks after the murder of the black adolescence of Treybon Martin in 2012 — are counting to homosexuals.
“Another homosexual women in direction support all this movement,” says Ferrell. - And all because we are always fighting with several fronts.
The black homosexual women must take all this burden."
Foreign agreed with that appeal, noting that “the movement is in fact supported by black women and the multitude of homosexual black women”.
However, she insists that “assuming a positive discrimination” and that Ferrell was not chosen to be a central film because of its different features.
“It was a man who experienced this energy,” she said.
“ On the other hand, it is not a coherence that she was on the first plan, because when. ”
You can feel her energy through the screen."
Thus, in Ferguson, there is no film channel for a long time, but there are still complex racial relations between the community and the police.
Ferrell will be tested for the shift during the demonstration of two and half years.
It describes the social and political atmosphere, which is called the house, just "Bardak".
She still holds for the thing he learned when he went out of Ferguson's full street three years ago.
We have to fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
We do not lose anything except our tents."
Two Salvador footballists dismissed for the course of US players

Henri Romero's first protector.
The Salvadorian shocked Joseph Altidor's attacking, after which he slaughtered him.
Then the semi-professional Seren was slaughtered by the U.S. Omar Gonzalez's protector.
Consequently, Romano was dismissed for three masks, and Seren has six.
The same meeting has been finished by the US winning account 2.0, transmitted Goal.com.
Decorations: Artist creates portraits using DNA, Chelsey Manning
In the centre of the Garerrey Fredery Hall in New York, people are white, black and red, all of which is not similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by the artist of Hizer Duy-Harborg from the shoes and shoes sent to her Chalsey Manning.
Manning sent a recruit from Fort Levenworth prison where the former analysis of the information is a 35-year-old period for the famous transfer of confidential diplomatic telegrams on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition of 2 August is called "Origination".
The result of the two-year record between Duy-Harbourg, whose art combines technology, information and art, and Manning, the woman-transsual and a famous dissident, which Barak Obama had condemned the judgment all over three days before the end of his presidency.
It was analyzed by the computer program received by Manning and used it to create three-mime portraits that could be in persons with such a gene, Duee-Harborg made a deep, even though it was difficult to improve the manifth, not only the Plastic Plastics, but also the different ways of interpretation and intellectual deterioration of these interpretations, but also the understanding of identity.
Manning, who was born with the name Bradley Edvard, but since a adolescent age, said that it was open to be a woman, in 2013, 20 episodes were condemned, including six Spionage violations, computer smuggling and violence.
Her photos were not available in the prison, so only one of her photos was known: a black and white village in which Manning in the playing park, apparently feeling unlooked, sits on the roll of the machine; with the photo of it and began to associate.
In 2015, Duy-Harbourg has completed its 2012 draft "Visions of Non-Controverse".
In it, the artist created the portraits of unknown persons using the judicial instruments of the oak and the wedding resort, drawing from the DNA museum and creating images of how these people could look.
And then she received an e-mail from the Magazine paper.
"They took interview at Chelsey Manning in prison and wanted some portrait to illustrate the article," explained Duy Hagberg at the premature showing a new exhibition for the press.
At that time, Chelsea could not be visited and photographed, so they were connected to her and asked whether she wanted to get a portrait created from her DNA.
Indeed, the artist and her sit in the museum became friends in sight and exchanged a few letters over two years.
They even wrote a book of the Mixtures of Images, illustrated by Schoili Cannongo, which illustrated how the Chase's future challenging punishment was raised and can be visited.
The fact that Obama really decided to release Manning only a few days after the release of the book to the light was welcomed after seven serious years in the military prison in Kansas.
There is something deep and strong and that the exhibition is now open when Donald Tramp announces the war of people who opened secret information in the Government and finds new ways to smile in Twitter.
When Duy-Harbourg asked about the coincidence all over time, she said "is nothing happening".
In the statement of the artist, written on the wall of the gallery, the great sign of Manning down (with a heart-in-law instead of "i" in her home) calls for the end of the "automatic separation on the basis of gender, race, sexual orientation and culture".
On the contradictory side, its mitocondrial DNA, a long shift of the C, G and A.
Included 200 letters (or nucleotics, as an artist is learned,), Duy Harborg hoped to show how we all looked wonderful, in any case in our biological structure.
"I hope to explain people that our genius does not determine what we are opening genetic data for interpretation and how subjective it is," said Duy-Harborg; its video work in 2007, also issued here.
"Date data can tell us a lot of different historys, and 30 of these stories here."
The last part of the exposition used in one room is the Roman mentioned above in comics.
Manning, King-Cong style, appears on the building of the United States Correction Catherine with a speaker in his hand.
"If they kill your speech, they will win," it is written there.
"Don't keep silent."
"This is a direct quote from the letter she wrote me," says a artist who welcomes us from Philadelphia.
"I've still got a skin skin when I'm talking about it."
Manning has not yet seen a personal exhibition - how it was visiblely pictured in comics - but when she comes, she will welcome the mask in the room centre, its own genetic symbols collected, like the balls of the protesters.
It was also intended to be made, as well as all of the exhibition to the height (5'2, Manning growth), on which the career had been recorded genetic glups.
"After I would smile them on the walls, but now I wanted them to look like a fool of people," says Duee-Harborg about the portraits.
"I wanted them to be like a massive movement that was formed around Chelsea, as a movement standing up and for her freedom."
Professor of Northwest University and Oxford University are looking for the police for murder

The Russian Vice-Premier Vitality Mutko said that the conditions of the World Anti-Dopening Agency (IADA) to restore the work of the Russian anti-doping Agency (RUSA) will be carried out in the nearest time.
" The determinated stage of implementation was made, the RUSAD had the right to plan and conduct tests together with UKAD (Antidoping Agency).
The UDA road map was updated accordingly,” said Mutko on Friday.
The Prime Minister has commented on the second part of the IADA road map to restore the status of the Code, which lists the conditions for renewing the work of RUSAD and was recently published on the website of the organization.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could be possible to imagine the complexity for Russia.
"It's been declared, everything will be done.
The International Olympic Committee (OMC) and the AWAA will be submitted,” he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list underscored that Russian Indian structures should be publicly recognized by the results of the UAD's order to investigate the Canadian jurisprudence Richard McLaren, which stated that the continuation in Russian sport was controlled by the State.
In response to this question, Mutko said, "We are conducting an investigation, because our anti-continent system has allowed the bad.
All measures were adopted.
But there was no programme, and we will not recognize what wasn't.

Stars that help your company not to become a typical "Storm"
Aimee Errett wanted to assess the satisfaction levels among its e-commerce staff, but the investigations did not work.
The answers were often disappointed, unworthy, or worse.
Even though she promised an anonymity, some staff did not trust in the process.
“He never was sustainable and objective,” said Errett, who managed the company of 75 people in San Francisco, Madison Reed, employing electronic trafficking in hair.
So she called to the third person to help.
There is now a new type of emergency in the field of work with staff helping companies to find out how they feel.
Developing and licensing a programme assurance which is the measuring of the staff's participation, they allow companies to make an express survey, address the specific teams and demographic groups, to propose an anonymity and horribleness for complaints, and, in some cases, to enable informors to migrate fuel and directly addressing.
"We have more tools like Strava and Fitbit for Health Monitoring, and where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-constitutor and President of the Starpaper of Redwood City, whose analytical programs are used by companies to measure the involvement of staff.
Errest told that it had been a greater understanding of the thinking and feeling of its staff for three years of use of Glint.
In addition to the exams and ankets of the specified product teams, it proposes a warm card of the company and shows in the form of which more complaints and in some low approval management managers are enabled to disclose why.
The company recognizes that they need to control the situation in the workplace, otherwise they will become a temporary "Ubero", which was interrupted in the scandal when the former staff published a post in the blog, in which the aggressive situation in which those who expressed frustration were commanded.
For older people such as Glint, it is the desire to control the situation - the opportunity for a profitable business.
The Internetports estimates “Search on payment” by the financial technologies, the global management industry, regulations and correspondance to 2020 may be more than 118.7 billion dollars.
The Star of Convercent from Denver, Colombia State, helping companies to prevent and discover a bad behavior, noted the small growth of the interest and the activity of the Ubera's reputation in this year.
With “Convercent” almost 600 customers, including “Airbnb”, “mycrosoft” and “Tesla”.
Recently, the clients appeared to be cut.
Like “Glint”, “Convercent”, companies allow personal views to send to the personnel's own orders, to collect confidential responses in the real time regime and to provide the warm maps of the problems zones.
He also provides a warm line for anonymous text communications that allows staff to report on bad conduct.
And if you're shooting the shooter, the complaints are going directly to the directive.
“The public view has overcome the authority of inspectors,” said Patrick Quinnlan, founder and President of the company Convercent.
If the company is explained that it is badly treated with staff or inethnically, even if the inspector does not interfere, the company may be covered with the cost-related consequences in the form of customers, the department of staff and the judiciary, reported in Quinlan.
“Ruby Tuesday” the restaurant network, where over 25,000 workers worked in 500 businesses, uses Convercent more than year to make sure that law and procedure staff workers are able to provide a simple way to go to the company’s main office.
Before, if the staff wanted to report on the problem, he or she had to search for the phone number or the main office, to give an official complaint and to hope that it would be serious.
This was often a fearful and unbelieving experience, reported James Vitrano, head of the Rudy Tuesday legal administration, who said that it was not a normal way to follow the complaints of staff.
But now, when the company is used by the Convercent Service, the problems that were previously hidden from the managers who are in other cities or states, such as discrimination, charsement and unfair work payment, can quickly find and take them.
“I can draw close to the comprehensive, comprehensive understanding of the staff situation,” said Vitrano, leader of the 'Ruby Tuesday' network management group.
"And we protect our shareholders from judiciary with staff. "
According to the Queenland, the company began to deal with the economists, values and involvement of staff in 2002, after the Buhgalter Company Artur Andersen had suffered cash due to ethnic violations resulting from Dale Enron.
But only when “social networks received massive dissemination,” the company realized that they would not be able to keep their bloody burden from viral distribution into the network.
“Instead of starting using technologies for the control of the ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
And “Glint” and “Convercent” propose their programing as a service with the company's regular payment for the use of their products.
This is a business model and opportunities that have received the approval of venture investors supporting both age.
In February, Convercent was funded by $10 million from companies such as “Sapphire Ventures” and “Tola Capital”, resulting from the total capital of $47 million.
“Glint” received $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November, resulting from the general capital of $60 million.
These investments are not surprising if it is aware of the interrelated nature of companies, cultures and venture capital.
The growing survey shows that today staff expected more than that was before.
On the markets with weight competition, such as the Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects, are only the minimum required.
The employees want to feel that they accept and appreciate, and that they dedicate their time to the company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to work in the company, feel that they hear and what they do, they are trying to make such a successful company,” says Nina Mackin, Vice-President for global money and satisfaction of staff in the LinnkedIn company where they are used as Convercent, and Glint.
Investores receive income when businesses from their portfolio go well; businesses are good when the staff are dedicated and involved.
If the third party analytical instruments promise to increase loyalty and integration of staff, it is unseen that they find support.
As cultural specialists say in workplaces, it is important to provide staff participation data.
But data are not useful until the suppliers do not take steps.
In fact, if the company requests back-related staff, it may create the impression that changes are covered.
And if the changes are not enough, or not all, it may be distressed, and the staff will lose interest.
“If you are going to ask for 4000 proposals, you should be ready to conduct 4000 weeks,” says Russell Rat, President of Advisory to the management company Kotter International, who had to see how the company did a mistake, too much confidence in the collection of data.
“ Because if you don’t go to the end, the staff will ask: ‘ Have you heard me the truth?
Isn't you all right?
And if you are equal to me, why should I not be the same?
According to Errett, the Madison Reed company that is now conducting monthly staff surveys can take steps on the same day when someone reports about the problem using Glint.
And, after the re-councing of staff, unnecessary speed of decision-making and communication, it was able to reorganize a number of teams within the corporation limits and introduce communication training to address the problems.
The Ruby Tuesday company receives new knowledge of its staff and hopes that, in a long-term perspective, these knowledge will help her to remain more effectively in the area of high-spectified staff.
“If you don't try to create a culture of transparency, you're losing people” said Vitrano.
If you lose people, you're losing customers.
And if you lose customers, you're losing the company.
In Barnabas, the new asfalt is on the Crusnoarmean perspective
In Barnabas, cardinal measures were taken to eliminate the cause of asfalt losses at the Crusnoarmean perspective.
The place where the shoes were taken two times on a recently slaughtered part (reviewing with the Youth Street), was decided to "closure".
Remember, a small part of the roads near the tramway has occurred because the land is in the area of an unexploitated network.
According to the words of the Vice-President of the Road Committee on Trade, Wellness, Transport and Links of Ivan Harmat, a detailed investigation and elimination of the preference for crime is conducted.
Depending on its results, necessary measures will be taken.
It is suggested that the rebuilding of non-profit communications and their betoning would be necessary.
This is reported on the official site of the outer capital.
The team of Bruinz should be more worked because the National Sport Association has cancelled training two times a day
The time is near to the 11th night; the thickness of footballists from the University of California in Los Angeles is delayed to cut on one side of the new training fields of the camps.
Some of them cut their footballs out of the pool after the first day of the sporting camp.
For many team players, these minutes are a break in the middle of the day.
The games registered at the summer occupation, after three-time training, they return to communities to prepare for final reviews, and the next morning they return to the Vasselman ' s football centre at 6:30.
Shortly before Monday turned into Tuesday, the team trainer of Bruinz Jim Mora said: “In the three next days, these men wait for meat.”
The fact that the National Study Association rejected the training of two times a day, which was planned to reduce the load for players, in fact their working day – at least before the end of the reviews on Thursday.
As a result, the first three training team of the University of California in Los Angeles was appointed at 7:15 nights to be placed in and without the fleshly schedule of players.
The absence of two trains in the day has become more days with one training, and Bruins has started a camp nearly a week compared to the last year and trained during the summer school for the first six seasons of the sea in Westwide.
According to the schedule, they should take 18 trains to 20 August, including before starting official training for the first game in the sezon against the Technical University of A and M in September.
Mora said that it supported the change of the rules by the National Sport Association, despite the fact that it had been another point in the fleshly schedule of players.
“In three or four days, we will give them this huge burden, that is a serious test,” said Mara.
“ And they just overcome him, they're working, they're wonderful guys.
I think when we live up to Saturday and we'll have more time, it'll be really healthy."
When the camp ends, the California University in Los Angeles will train closed; it is a slight task, since its field is in a direct visibility with a relaxing park and from the neighborhood Laskin Center, a cheap hotel that has already been in the bombs of football legs that have been protected by the doors.
Bruin's games should be employed with these weekends, but Mora allows that when rooms are free during the season, there may be a problem.
“ We'll be safe,” reported Mara.
“ This is a serious problem, and I do not overcome the danger, predicting that someone can get out of the room, sit there and record a video training.
If you have videos of training, it's very serious.
But we're gonna be safe there and we'll be safe at the park number 8.
We'll do everything we can do with what we have.
I'm not gonna be too worried about this.
We have a plan."

Facebook increases the facts of waiting to combat factual news
Facebook will send more suspected texts to an independent expert and show their arrests under original posts, declared in the fourth largest social world network that is trying to fight such factual news.
In the statement on its website, the company stated that it began to use improved machine trainingalgoritmos to recognise possible artifications, send them to verification, and may show the results of the waiting facts on the origin.
Facebook was criticized as one of the main ways to disseminate such factual news, which many believed that the presidential elections in the United States were influenced by the presidential elections in 2016.
This issue is also actively discussed in Europe after French elections were made wrong with the presidential elections in May, and in Germany before the September elections, they said that the support of the social networks would not be operatively removed withdrawals of hate.
On Thursday, in a single German declaration, Facebook reported on the testing of a new fact-expected algorithm in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.

She adds that Facebook will continue to test the function of "associated articles" and work on other changes in the newsletter to address the problem of factual news.
Create a Roman-Comics: One shell in English history
In recent Scotney's crocodile store, there was a squeeze musical squeeze, and in the 1970s and the 1980s, the Margaret T.
But 700 years old from his widespread place in the river of Buil, in Kent's graphic, he watched the white history around, and now he inspired James Rods, a copy hair widespread and historic documents in roman comics.
"I think it's so beautiful - look at a man who died 300 years ago," he said with encouraging.
"You're feeling that personally when you keep this letter into your hand."
The "Shame in England" covers the period from the mid-earth century to the era of Evardia and tells about the families living in Scotty; each story has illustrated one of the young British artists - Izek Lenkewit, Brian May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book of Rods based on the archives: in 2014 he wrote "Dead Man and Other History" - a Collector on the documents of the British Library; the project was unexpectedly cut it into the depth of the soul.
"My man could cut a simple print on the edge of a letter written in the 1700's by a double agent who worked on the knobs," he says.
"This is the impression of his finger."
And the letters will always shoot, because in that time for lighting the fire was burned.
And 300 years later, in the future, you think you're too there.
Oh, like I love the archives."
For a man who has been covered by such a suffering to old bums, obtains support from the National Fund and the English Arts Council and lives in the shell of four months "Verily, I have a little fun there" seems too good to be true.
The Rods's whole days studied a "new" victorian shell, went to the archives and considered a number of counts of names and old things, for example, the heads of the shoes or bottles that persist in the wheel.
He went to the park and on the distance of the old rock, talked to forests, gardens, and sometimes with artists who worked over the illustrations of his book.
Then the night he said, "He sweared the whiskey and sit down to write."
Scotney's stories have not been very studied because the National Fund had been fully accessed to it only in 2006 when the last heritage, Elizabeth Hassy.
When Rods came there for ten years, the officers just started to find a archive, which he describes "what the aristocratics cast out for centuries."
Thursdays, letters during the British Empire, maps shown to whom he had: "You think that land disputes are missing, " says Rods, "but here two families were struck over this beach.
That's right, guys."
In some stories, the shell collection is an extensive point for broader research in the English history: for example, in the Rabotinian, the hero is only a building rock to join the Krysian Revolution in 1381.
"They have information about the burn in the shell in 1380, in the book called Kent and Saxes," says Rods.
"The cristian resurrection began in these places, and I thought that the burnt was a suitable start.
Maybe they were connected?"
Other surprises are strongly linked to the store, for example, the “Peace of the Priest”, in which the Darrell family has seven years hidden himself during the English reform.
Or "Contrabandost", about the 19th century contrabandist Arthur Darrell, who, as they believe, raised his own horns, murdered stones (this was discovered after a few years).
Darrela is a loved family of Rods from all the people who lived in Scotty: "My men seemed to have been perfectly slaughtered forever and lost money that couldn't allow themselves.
In various generations, Darrela had solved their problems with debts, marrying rich older women, - I represent them as a company of sympathy men that can be able to swear the heritage of great states."
After finishing the work in the Rods Chamber, others are looking for a unique writer experience.
He lived two weeks in the Finnish wheel, where he wrote a graphic novel about Elmingia, a place where he was satanator at the beginning of the XX century, and then he grew again in the forest.
But Scotty remains a special place for him.
"I was sorry to leave," he said.
"I felt like that, shit, I have to go back to real life."
Fiftieth larger banks will choose Russia.
The conflict in the Russian Bank Association (ARB) is developed: following Sberbank, WTB, VTB-24, Alfa-Bank, Gazprombank, Russiansk, Benbank and FCC, still seven credit organizations are going to leave this public organization.
Thus, at least 80 per cent of the market will be higher than the ARB organizations.
However, this is not just the outcome of all banks claiming to break up with ARB, leading to negotiations with another public organization which combines credit institutions, the Regional Bank Association of Russia, which is known by Anatol Act policy, Chairman of the Financial Market Committee, acknowledged as a result of the last session and the most effective leader of the thinking committee and the deputy on the event of prepared legislative projects.
The conflict was started within the ARB during the discussion in the Federation Council when the Interregional Bank Council considered new legislation projects, in particular providing a new classification of banks depending on the size of the capital.
The President of the ARB, Garganyn Tossanian, said that, as a partnership, this draft legislation was adopted for the benefits of larger banks that thus try to limit the possibilities of small and medium-sized banks in the regions by encouraging their customers.
Among other recruitments, it sounds and critics in the address of the Centre, which, in the sense of Tossane, has not always been correctly called for licences in some banks, so that, in fact, the representative of the CBI was reflected: many leaders of the overtracking banks, in particular the ARBs, had entered into the guidelines of the ARB.
It seems that this exchange of interrelated views in a very sensible relationship with the main banking environment and became a matter that the 15 larger banks, claiming an inconvenience with the ARB policy, began to be prepared to enter the Russian Association, noted that "the effectiveness of the work of ARB is at low levels and the constructive dialogue within the bank community is not actually implemented".
The employees will be better.
What's the case?
Let us immediately respond to the main question that occurs with a small deal or a conflict in the banking area or close to it: there will be no threat to the banking system's reverse.
It means "Russia" Anatoly Axacks, known as its expertise in all the interests of banks and customers, Professional high-level, which is high-quality in the Centre: almost all CBI guidelines are present at annual associations activities, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator are through the expert evaluation of the "regions".
In the care and organizational plan, it is apparently not to be expected that special strikes are not expected.
Indeed, the ARB is in an unfair financial and administrative situation after the remaining of such powerful and influence participants with their contributions and lobbyist opportunities.
However, in this older, in 1991, the organization of the banking community, there are poor capacity to continue to improve bank legislation and the area of monetary and medium-sized treatment in general.
It is not possible to say that the Russian Association has been ready to take on any conditions of new members, judges on the response of its leadership, Anatolia Aksa, "also much wishes"), which still on 21 July in the press centre of the Parliamentary Press, stated that "earnestly on the next day of the representatives of the banks above, asked me to consider the possibility to generate our Russian Association".
Their proposals are to increase the vote of bankers in the Association Council and more attention to new bank technology.
The negotiation process is now under review of the proposals for both parties is prepared for an external association in Sociation in the middle of September under the International Bank Forum.
We'll be determined there.
Anatolius Axaks also stressed that the " lock is not holding " was called the possible new leader of the updated Russian Association, Georgia Luttonski, who leaves the Vice-Chairman Center's Vice-Chairman, high-hargaging his business and human quality in September.
On August 18, Anatoly Aksacks, who is now resident in Cruz, plans to stop the vacation and arrive in Moscow at the foreign meeting of the Russian Association Council, which is urged to consider the agenda of the " Russian intermediate entry " .
Introduction of benzine engines in Russia's large cities will not be limited
The Vice-President Nicola Assaul stated that, instead of the communication of media, the entry of a benzine engine in Russia's large cities would not be limited.
It's a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept, which must be progressively improved by environmental class.
And there's a concept to move immediately to nucleus emissions.
I think we're not ready for this.
Question more: From what year?
It's the same level at the fraction slog level - let's go forbidden.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
The whole city is closed?
"I don't know about 20 years of age, maybe it's going to happen", brings the "Playm" word of the Minister.
The previous newspaper of Izverya reported that, on August 17, the Vice-Premier Arcadia Dwardkouk was mandated to study the proposed options of the management of electric transport submitted by the PAO Camaz Sergee Kyogy.
Among the proposals, newspaper information, the use of the DPS machines in large cities and cigarettes.
Washington changes the grincard rules.

The plan provides a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 per year, a more strict rules for the receipt of temporary work and the limitation of family visa.
New rules are proposed by the Republic of the Republic and are supported by the President.
The draft law will be discussed in two rooms of the Congress.

The Law will reduce the ceiling migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new process of submission of claims will provide advantages to candidates who own English has money resources that allow them to contain, and have ability to benefit our economy,” said Thramp, according to the American media.
The exhibition of sex workers is real, and that should be worried about us.
We did not think that 2017 could not be worse, and a new report on technological success was issued in the production of sex-fabrics.
Mood.
Sex robots are now in the centre of attention.
The Fund has recently issued a report on sexual development in the nearest 5 to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharky, a professional of workshops and the artistic intellectual of the Shefffield University and the FRR co-operator, we should be able to give up their exhibition.
Users will choose the color of the views of the works, the form of the clips and the leg type.
"Their chemistry are about this, but the companies are already sent them to consumers, and we will soon see them much more", said Sharke, presenting the new report.
Modern sex cubes have evolved from their sweet assemblies in work with heat sweet hair, and almost human snakes that are artificial intelligence.
Users can also "set" their jobs in their sculptures by choosing all the colors of the eye and shapes of the work to the form and the footsteps.
But that many works have 'liness', compared with which the Stepford Gen would be very progressive, worried more.
Current sex cucles have become workers of the silicon hair.
For example, the RealBotix robot company allows users to stress quality work that they find, for example, attractiveness.
There are still sex works of Roxxxy Gold developed by "True Companion", which are set out with the already programed individuality, for example, "Chood Farra" produces an impressive impression, and "Dhaya Vendi" has a "small" character.
"The Roxxy Gold has a charity that is beautiful to you," says the website "True Companion".
So she loves what you love, does not love what you don't love, and so further.
It changes the vision during the day like the real man!
She may want to sleep or smell, or she can "be in order".
There are many concerns for sex workers, not in the last time because they replace real relationships, but are worried more about the subordinated woman ' s subfiguration, association with the force of the Cold ownership (read: opposing) Fara.
On the True Companion website, Roxxy is compared to the elector only for men.
"If a woman (sic!) may be elector, why cann't a man have Roxxy?" says the website.
But these sex robots are not just fetiches or just new sex games.
Their appearance and all the increasing complexity indicates something more dark and deep in our culture, as a disappearance of gender equality towards the desire of sex with the submission of an optional addition.
Of course, most men will not purchase sex workers, and even though FRR notes their growing popularity, they remain on the peripheral of the consumer culture.
But what happens to us from the peripheral may be very learning about the meanings of the era in which we live.
And many people are not stupid and not aggressive until the free market will give them an opportunity.
This is not a convergence - that these complicated sex-fabrics appeared just when women ' s rights were threatened in the world when the Belarus house is the President who rejoices with what she is coming to women.
The most horrible television "Services" is not graphic images, cuts and eye eyes, namely how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Galaad is an overwhelming, but now it doesn't seem to be the biggest.
The purpose of sex workers is to achieve such physical likeness to real women (except pornographic proportions) which allows technologies.
Their creators want to look like people on the ocean to copy the movement of the human body.
But they're not like the real women.
They can't leave with their partners or leave them.
They have no life or biography - nothing that could indicate independence or anything else that could destroy the illusion of full dependence.
Otherwise, they are beautiful slaves.
Or, as he says in 2017, he is a servant.
The born of Los Angeles Yunjin (Puh) Jeter, who speaks for the collection of Ukraine since 2013, does not help our national team at the Basquetbol Championship of Europe, which is the final part of which starts 31 August.
In the port, BeBasket reported the general manager of Sine-years, Andrey Lebedev.
We tried to agree with Jeter, but, unfortunately, he will not come in the family circumstances.
We're going to the Euboasket without a natural player, because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This will give opportunities to our youth players," he said.
Remember: In the direct participation of Jeter, the Ukrainian collected the sixth place in Euroacket 2013, and first entered the Bacteball Champion, which was not able to overcome the group stage, and the U.S. summarized at a medium of 15.4 o'clock, made 3 boards and gave 5 ships.
Jeter stopped speaking for the collection of Ukraine from the end of our national team, Michael Frathello, who left the post in 2015.
Mann Ebolaket-2017 will take place at the same time in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will carry out its group tourners on the earth promised.
In the support of the Murgin Group B, there will be five units: with Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
In the course of the preparation for the tourist, our husband’s collection held two control units in which the Dutch and the Belarus entered.
The great trampa ship?
It seems very wise to imagine Mita Romney.
In the era of the Trampa, a common place was that the political disputes polluted by the American elderly were a micro-electronic disappearance of some families.
Among the Thanksgiving Day and Birthday, the American newspapers regretted the columns of how to address the horrible parents that voted for Trampa.
It seems that we're all pressed soon.
Decreased the ability to connect the family to Trampa.
I'm going to write this because my cousin, the left poeses views from Chicago, who was on the foot of the Republicans in his family, came to New York for this week.
She recalled me that the unity in the fight against the common enemy could have a strong effect.
At the Trampe House, all those she know, including a Republican brother with whom she discussed the policies of decades, were immediately and strangely found on one side.
It is, of course, good at dinner, but I can't think that in a broader context it may be pretty dangerous.
The tramp has leaked the strength into the left flank, but the deforming effect of his governance can all lead to the right.
When we talk about Tramp and "Normalization", we mean that we're not likely to have a chance that one time we'll stop to struggle it.
There are, however, more doubtful scenarios in which the Trump "Normalizes" of the most legal Republicans, which are unexpectedly shown in the background of his standards.
I understood that I was very lacking today by the oldest desire of Mitt Romney, with a machine shopping dog and a 14 per cent tax (but at least we knew how it looks like his tax statement) - compared to the Trump and the other seems very small.
When the Tramp goes, the next Republican candidate will be enough to be in his own heart to see a great step forward in it.
When my cousin went to the center, we went with the kids to the carsel in the Central Park, the biggest carsel in the New York Park Department, and the best way in the city to lose $3 if you don't need coffee.
The shoes of the sounds and large, the pictures of the sleeves on the central barbaron, are sweet clouds and animals that are shocking in the shock of the shock, and the smell of the music, as it's strange, brings a shock.
Such a lot of known things in this city are discovered: the species of skys are slow, the buildings have come too much to cause trips, and the reality of the city is not a dream.
Twenty-five years ago, and I still worried on the day when I learned that the Suiss Cottage area is not actually a Swiss swimming swimming pocket (Yee Olde Swiss Cottage) but a large circle crossing in North London.
And the carsul in the Central Park is still an incredible, magnificent place in which a child is two years old, a child of 11 years and two women for a fourty-year-old.
If I could put a review cursues, I would put five, but, happily, no one asked me about it.
And in the university this week, I was asked to take a terminal card, to evaluate my "experience" purchase in the scale from one to five stars.
In the coffee around my street, the same more option to comply with the 15 per cent of the cheese evaluation is a order for the standing.
As a result, it is not only a neutral interaction, but also a personal relationship to the situation that does not provide.
The poor soldier in the university was smilingly until I was examining my experience in her credit card in five stars.
The Oscar Pistorious was transferred from the prison to the hospital because of the illness in the prison.
Pistorus leaves a prison because of the visit to the doctor for the second time.
Last year, he was transferred to the hospital to treatment of shocks that, as a result of the arrestation, he received a fall in the camera.
Pistorus was sentenced for the murder after the appeal of the prosecution for the original sentence for an unproduced murder.
He killed Stefan Camp early morning of the Valentin Day in 2013, shooted in it several times through the gate of a toilet room in his house in Pretoria.
Pistor said he took his friend's friend for the nightmare he was hidden in the toilet.
The Prosecutor stated that it was intended to make another protest, to this time against the six-year term of Pretoria, which, according to her words, was too milk.
The General Prosecutor stated that the appeal to the South African High Court and appeal would be considered in this year.
The term of Pretoria may increase by 15 years if the prosecution is successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.

Two Bolgarian citizens were detained in Greece for the illicit palace
As the Bi-T-Vi TV reported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bolgarian citizens were detained in Greece for an illicit palace store.
On 1 August, a group of people in the Palestinian place was detained, including two Bolgarian citizens.
They were left on the same day, while the consequence is still.

According to the Ministry, the Court may designate a trace.
IMD Russia accused the United States Vice-President during the "Fruit War"
Declarations made during the European Tour, Michael Pens, US Vice-President, were criticized by the Russian Middle East.
"That is regrettable that Washington is still more deeply covered by the predetermined ideologicalized stamps during the "friendly war", says the Russian external state.
Thus, in the MID, they reacted to the words of Pensian “Russian threat” and the attempts to forced cross-border borders that were mentioned in the Sub-Green.
The Russian MID indicated the destructiveness of the election " or with the West or with Russia " and the inevitableness of the thesis on the ways of the inopportunity of the whole South-East Europe in NATO.
The Russian diplomates also recalled that the United States had violated international law, applying the force to delay Kosovo from Serbia and thus set up another consideration of tension.
"The American colleagues urged to stop Russia's smuggling and its external policy line, which is unlikely based on respect for partners and the preparation for joint constructive work, on the mutual basis of interests," states the Russian MIT.
Feldsher suffered from the DTD with a "speak" in the Sub-Mobile
The DTT occurred in the Sub-Stopino, resulting in the cutting of foreignmarks with the Score Help Cart.
Today, about 08:10 msq was cutting Misubishi's car with rapid assistance in the city of Stupino Moscow.
"The result of the mounting of the machine has turned back to the TASS in the Moscow Press Service.
The SDT works with law enforcement officers and the circumstances of the event are explained.
In the Odesan area, a woman was taken to the building of her newborn son and returned to the packaging.
On August 3, the police office reported the local residential that he was found in an uncommon private home with the girl.
"In the place of the event, lawyers and doctors who were operating for children to the medical institution, " reported in the National Police Head of Odes.
Medicines determined that the child was born for a few hours before his discovery, which proved to be a publicity.
During the initial operational and investigative events, a 36-year-old local residence was established.
There are also three young children that women have.
As noted in the chapter, the family guards had not previously fallen and had not been particularly taken into account.
The police are currently established in the situations and reasons that women have taken to this action after the processing decision was taken.
Now the girl is under the physicians' guard.
As previously reported, a 21-year-old-old-old woman dismissed her child in the museum.
Gregory Leps: "I'm in battle, but 55 is not 30."
One of the most persistent artists of the Russian estrade Gregory Leps, in the nearest Sunday, is divided into his 55-year-old.
Before the shop, the slaughter told the slaughter of the slaughter.
I remember your "potinant" noted.
The Special Chair in the Luxury, Gloria Gaynor's shirt for a renown, powerful slaughter over the Moscow River.
You'd like to shoot your next fifth.
Have the purposes happened?
If we talked about professionals, it was a lucky period.
I worked a lot, three times I went with the guests of the whole country, giving up to 120-130 percent per year.
Two bad albums were released.
Of course, I'm not the one I'll say 20 years ago.
Biological times do not lie.
Get as I smell in my 30s, it's all weak.
However, I'm riding in the battle, but I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, I think I'm on a different level.
You and the new album, first in three years.
Yeah, I'm working on him now.
Indeed, we've already registered in my study and now we'll send it to Los Angeles.
It's called "What are you serious?" on a song that was written together with Timothy.
She's not completely ready, so we haven't trained her anywhere.
We'll do this later when we'll click on her.
And we're presenting the album in November to the series of my jewelry concerts in the Moscow Crocus Steve Holle.
You've got your new plastic, and you're putting the hands of a class American slaughter Chris Colman.
You think you wanted to join him in your strict composite?
In my view, the Colman is one of the most excited slaughters of the world today.
He came to me to the studio, recorded his party.
I invited him to enter into my group, and Jeremy Colson (known rabbin participating in various projects. - " News ") proposed.
But for a long work in Russia, they moved, slowly, excessively.
It's about gonorrs from €35,000 to €45,000 per month.
Then I thought that in the post-commerce space I'm looking for pleasant musicians.
And I found the great slaughter of Max Malesheva.
Indeed, it is better to smell.
Sometimes, I want to take some of them to be shocked, not for what.
For example, the guitarist of the Fodor Dosoms is highly quoted at the international level.
It writes western musical magazines and invites it to various hysterical festivals.
Steve Way, listening to his game, said, "The new generation of guitators, with another executive technology."
Your album is in Los Angeles, the American musicians are working with you, but you're still not going to the United States?
Are you trying to remove this ban?
Now, honestly, I don't do anything.
There are a number of lawyers who do this.
As a musicer, I'm really sorry that I can't get to America.
I didn't tell you I know there.
As much better contact with the real professionals, it is more useful.
We're not hunting them, but we don't have such experience, schools.
Before the artists of our popular music for 70 years, the tasks that were always solved by American musicians were not perfect.
They tried to have a maximum quality sound.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now, why and Britain refused me to go for ten years.
But every year I'm going to give a visa documentation to the British Society so I'll be allowed to travel there and the main thing is to work there.
The last Europe is good to me.
And you're planning a concert in Monaco, not commanded, but athic, right?
Yeah, there's a good Sport Hall in Monte Carlo, I've been talking there once.
Now they were invited again, and as I know, all the tickets on the port are already sold.
You're going to go to "Raime Wakele" starting on July 20, July?
She invited me, and I, of course, called.
Lima is a wonderful beach and a beautiful woman that can give herself and a beautiful ball, and even a shoe.
After the guests and the jubilals, as I know, you'd like to turn to the Creation of the High Witness.
Two albums with his songs are already in your discograph.
When will the third go?
Maybe in the next year.
But he'll be done to another thing.
I want to record the 80-90 song of the High Summit in the same way as he did.
Just a voice and a guitare.
There's no other warning.
Acompanying me will be our famous musicer Tim Wederners.
I intend to participate in the album and Alexander Jacoblevith Disenbaum.
I talked about this topic, we've got a good relationship, but he's busy, so let's see how it's going to be.
You and the songs of Boris Guckenshick have been slowly in your repertoire.
Maybe you write his album?
Boris Borisovic is a beautiful man and a beautiful musician.
I sneaked with him several times and asked, ‘ Can I sleep that song or something else?
He said, "Grigory, I'll write songs that they're doing."
Please try, come on.
It's probably interesting to write this album.
Until I have no such task, but in the future, two years later, if Boris Borisovic isn't going to be reflected, I may have done that project.
If you don't concentrate fully on your producer centre.
I think you did not sign the contracts with all artists you interested?
There's a whole range of executives I would have dreamed of having under my ship, but they're self-deserved.
Do you mean Sergey Lazareva?
I invited him.
I can't agree with his repertoire, but he was professional and has its development strategy.
And in my center, there's Alexander Panyots I've been in Holos.
We concluded the treaty and work with him.
In our pop music, such skins are rare.
It'll be sincere if he won't reach the heights that he has.
I'm trying to make him a repertoire, I'll take the clips.
I hope it's good.
I'm also trying to move on other artists of my center: buy them songs, smiling poets, sometimes their tracks fall into telephone and radio anals.
If they don't reach the greatest height, I'm still going to make our cooperation to the logical conclusion.
They will receive the album, a few clamps.
And then, if they want, they can go on my way, and I'm not waiting for them to get back to their money.
Although I'd be glad if some of them get commercial success and pay for me the percentage we agreed in the contract.
But if this doesn't happen, I'm not going to make anybody up of oxygen.
Let everyone work, kill, prove how I've ever shown.
If you're supposed to make a guest tour to Ukraine tomorrow and make sure that you're coming to the country, you're going?
I'm still invited.
It is mainly about closed events.
And what's about a big tour...
I am a man of my country, a Russian, because of my confidence, flying to Syria on the same plane that then disappeared.
If tomorrow you'll tell me that you're going to fly to some other point in the interest of the State, I'll fly.
And I think I'm thinking about the bloggers and other critics.
I am so sorry that this situation has come to Ukrainian.
Because I believe that we are one people and must be together.
I regret that it is not possible at least in the nearest time.
I've been giving a year to Ukrainian 40 to 50.
We met anywhere.
It's very grateful.
And with several Ukrainian artists, Ani Lorak, the World of Lobod, Artem Loak...
In Ukraine, the mass of the gifted people and sincerely regret that they cannot now be fully able to spend their talents to a large Russian audience.
Musicals should join and develop people.
I would be pleased to invite a classic Ukrainian executive in Russia, such as Slava Vacarchuk, and made a joint concert with it.
But I think it's not likely at this moment.
Andrea Ojokock moved with a spaciol
As it was known, the technical director of the Eastern Space Andrey Oikokock began working in the State of Space and Production Center (GCNPC) named Kronochev.
He was previously employed by the Middle Eastern space, but because of the diversity of the management of the Headquarters of Land and Space Infrastructure (CANKY) was transferred to the Employment in Moscow Fields where the production coordination was taken.
Mr. Ohokoki will not be: the position of the technical director, probably, is disrupted and the functionality is dismissed by the CAN.
The technical director of the Eastern and Vice-Chairperson of the CANC on Technology Development, Andrew Ohjokock, moved to work in the CCNPC named Cronchiva, said the "which" of a number of spatial industry companies, as well as the Government's machine.
"He works for a new post for a few weeks," said the partners in the room.
The operational comments of CANKY were unable on Thursday, and Mr. Ojokocks did not have a comment.
However, information has been officially confirmed in the CRC.
He decided to move to the Director of the Coordination of Production, as he said to the company. — Andrey O'Huhkock, which was put before him, has completely implemented the first Eastern Space launch.
Mr. Ohjokok moved to work in the CANKY in 2013, with the headquarters of the space armies, in particular in Bayconu, and in Plezeki, the first committee of the Commander's headquarters.
In 2009, Andrew Ojokock became a criminal act.
It was therefore accused of taking it as a result of his responsibilities of regional commerciants for dismissing the complaints, but did not comply with the obligations taken for the purchase of separate missile parts in the Arkingue area and the Republic of the Commission.
In 2012, the court acknowledged it innocent.
The technological development responsibilities were distributed to various projects, but most of them were the structure of space in the Forest.
The Federal Space Agency of Oлег Ostapenko in the interview said directly that the situation in Eastern " was critical already in October 2013".
The case was a strategic error when planning was made: the completion of the struggle and the first launch of the Union 2.1 reporter was planned at the same time at the end of 2015.
In order to comply with the end of the year, the strike decided for a half years ago and the deadlines were delayed from December to July 2015.
In order to accelerate the process, the CANP specialists started a parallel mount of technological equipment on unbuilding objects.
The main part of this idea was Andrey Ohokocks.
Despite the existing risks and all the resulting transfers (instead of December 2015, the Union was only 28 April 2016), the idea was justified, said the source of the "this wouldn't have been implementing any start from the East and would work a structure.
Vice-Premier Dmitri Rgozin, who smokes the creation of the space, called Andrea O'Cookock his "space Suzanial", but he was almost always asking for information about the stroke period.
He recalled Mr. Ojokocks and the direct: For example, in the interview, he proposed to stop the Federal Agency for the Special Construction (Special) status of the only Executor in Eastern and directly working with the sub-sistent: "Why do we all have to compose of the eggs in a special corner?"
This idea has found support in the Government.
Since 2017, the CENKY has taken its duty to the general contractor to complete the building and monetary work on the age and technical complex planned in the fourth quarter.
According to Mr. Ohjokok's new workplace, there was a difference with the CENKI leadership on the way to complete the construction of space and complexs, as well as the methods of work with substantive organizations.
"It's been determined that it will be better for all," said one of the mini-members who participated in the Middle East Review.
The Government Agency officer, on the other hand, calls out a strange decision: "He was one of the best specialists, finding him a equal replacement will not be easy."

There is a two-specific education program in music schools
In the future, students of children's music schools will be able to receive two specialities at the same time.
According to the director of the Department of Science and Education of Mincultures, it is possible to overwhelm the recycling disciplines, and the issue of other jobs on second-specific basis to decide with special grades, is transmitted to the RIA News.
"The Ministry of Culture has taken this issue to control, and we are together with the experts community to develop a mechanism that will enable two specialities, but will not at the same time contrary to the legislation in the field of education, " said Gouvinko.
The past Thursday in the "Needs conversation" of Wormim Putin with the teachers of the Child Center, Mary Andreeve, teacher, reported that it had to pay the second special objects on the second speciality in the Moscow Conservation.
The girl told her that it was learned by the script and the forum and had the rewards of competitions in both directions.
The Head of the State acknowledged its issue very active and promised help.
The 17-year-old Russian wall in Mexico is detained
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian Kyril N., who is on the wall of the high building, reports the Port El Universal.
The university occurred in the capital of Mexico.
The young man, using two unknown men, passed through a three-mile board in the territory of the official buildings of Nestle company, and he was self-released to one of his bathrooms.
He did not use any special insurance, insurance and credibility.
The young man has been detained on the shooting.
The Ministry of Public Security officers left him to the ground on the helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Migration Institute.
It explains whether young people are legally on the territory of the country.
Sometimes, a video with a young man who is higher, became popular at the Internet.
Users called the young pope.
The media writes that such experiments are the hobby for it.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate can help to facilitate GDP.
Red meat and chocolate are accepted to consider a shock for your drinking trace.
However, recent studies relate to the reverse: a dieth, rich with milk whites and milk products, can help to facilitate symptoms in those who suffer skin diseases.
This is an inexcellent disease that causes approximately 1,3 million people in the United States and 300000 in Britain, leads to skins and injuries of animals, chronic or bloody food, weight loss and extreme decline.
Normally, the symptoms of sickness suggest to avoid meat and milk products, but researchers from the University of Washington have established that the main triptophan mixture of white triptophan has contributed to the production of immune cells that increase the tolerance of the skin.
Dr. Marco Collonna, a feed researcher, explained that immune cells in the kitchen are monitoring that the medium microbes of food are not in the body.
Cells that are able to launch the breathing process are equivalent to cells that increase tolerance, protecting the body, and indeed are not harmful to feelings.
If the equality is too strongly violated by the repayment, it may lead to smooth disorders.
Experiences have shown that the mouse with a certain bacteria in the pocket appears to increase the tolerance of cells.
And this bacteria needs a triptophan, one of the white building elements, to start the appearance of these cells.
Professor Collonna said, "We have established a connection between one kind of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuter, which is part of the normal microbiology of the kitchen, and the development of the population of cells that increase to tolerance.
More triptophane was in the museum food, more of these immune cells had."
He suggested that the same will be working in people: the combination of L. reuters and the rich triptophan may contribute to more tolerant and less cycling in the kitchen.
The interview of Dr. Louis Servantes-Barragánwas, studying the diversity of immuno cells, found that one group of these cells was experienced, and the other group belonged to the same line, but was not individually contained.
She suggested that the difference could be called by microbies of the mouse shock -- bacteria, virus and crystal communities, which are usually living in a iron and skin tract.
The cell of the mouse was seen, and six kinds of bacteria were found in the mouse with immune cells but without the mouse.
The muscles generated in a styl environment that did not take good microbiom and not developed this kind of immune cells have received L. Reuter and immune cells have appeared.
To understand how bacteria influences the immune system, researchers increased L. reuters in the environment and then moved small portion of iron, without bacteria, to the unexpected immune cells from the mouse.
Immuno cells have become more tolerant cells.
When the active component was separated from iron, it was a sweet product of triptotan reprocessing known as independence-3-moleated oxygen.
When researchers doubled the number of triptophans in the museum, the number of cells increased by about 50 per cent, but when the triptotan level has been decreased, the number of cells also slowed to two times.
Dr. Servanthes-Barragan explains that people have the same increased tolerance of cells as the mouse, and most of us have L. Reuters in their sweet and swimming tract.
Inconsistent, whether triptophane products in L. reuter development of cells have been found in the same way as the mouse, but people suffering from smoke diseases have found defects in genes related to triptophane.
She says: "That cells may be developing us and must be strengthened, since these cells depend on the smooth processes on the internal surface of the skin.
The high levels of triptotan at L. Reuters can potentially lead to the expansion of their populations."
According to Joseph Mourinua, “Manchester Yuntead” was a guiding in the face of Nigeria Matich
"Manchester Yunuit" launched a 'ganie' in the face of Nemania Match, and he believed that George Mourini, after the defenseman was in the massacre against the Sampдорia in the middle of the night.
The game acquired for 40 million feet in the Chelsea began with the winner of 2-1 in Dublin in the last presidential shop of the University before the Supercube of WEFA against the Real Madrid in the Tuesday, and was imprisoned in the role of the Mediterranean, while the games in Pogby and Andréa Transior were first shocked when they were grateful.
However, as Mattich did not participate in the presidential Chalse Tower in Asia, he was seriously uncomfortable to play, and he was only 45 minutes old, as it said, Mourinia requires the processing before the first-level season.
“He needs time, but his experience, mind, gentleness in his thinking, he thinks of the football,” said Mourin.
"We will help him prepare soon than late."
Like Matty, his new partners, Victor Lindelèf and Romell Luke, began playing at the Aviation Station when Mourinia began to form its main composition at the beginning of the next season.
The Independent newspaper reported on this week that Mourini wanted to take three other players, but underlined that the club had already achieved fantastic results, taking three of the four players that he wanted to first play.
“I thank the club for he has won three of four,” he added.
"I think more if they get me four of four, but they have already been very hard for me."
The former social-democratic leaders of Lithuania agree to remain in the right coalition
The former social-democratic party of Lithuania, Ex-Premier Algirados Butkawits and Gemininas Kirkilas, as well as the former seed of the social-democratics Chaсловas Ursinas, called for one party to remain in the rule of coalition.
As reported by the Parlementary Journal, the Union of the Crisis and the Greens, the Social-Democratic Party has initiated a debate on whether it should remain in the legal coalition.
And here, three elderly experienced partners called to one party with an open letter, which says: "It is understood by the disappointment of the members of the election party, but the coalition with the "Creatives" has created for us a slow and not very easy, but still conditions for further implementation in the goals of social justice, which are provided by the Government's programme, and to maintain the political domination of the left centre on the legal parties."
According to the view of the former party leaders, in the discussion, "developed an expression of no specific arguments".
The writers are afraid that the unplanned action of their party could bring Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
Anton Mamaev’s Disabled Strikes were appointed
The Mosgourd stripped the punishment of the disabilities of Anton Mamaev, from the four and half years of the death of freedom to the slaughter, to 200 000 rubs.
Previously, the sentence was released from the AIDS.
In that regard, Mosgourth reaffirmed that the accused was a criminal, because he organized a disfellowship and a strike of the motorcycle in the former specialist.
The Moscou decided that Anton Mamaev was sentenced to 2000,000 rubs.
"Mamaev is a organizer of disgrace, which is also a composition of crime, and, accordingly, a person should be engaged in criminal responsibilities," explained the "own" secretary of the Moskow State of Ulian Sokova.
In that case, the court had been taught on the health of Mamaeva, the fact that the case had not been undermined.
Furthermore, the Court applies to p. 64 A.R.R.R.RF, which would be attributed to punishment below.
With regard to Mamaev Vasilia of Serostano, the court had not established circumstances that would have become the basis for changeing the illness of the convictions and the change of the convictions.
Anton Mamaev himself stated that it remained unfair with the Moscow decision.
I am disappointed by the court's decision.
The only legal decision would be justified, and it would continue to fight for justice.
His lawyer Andrey Orlow did not exclude the complaint of the case in the Moscou Court and the Supreme Court.
"We will use all markets to affect the European Court of Human Rights," he stated "Riah News".
Remember, the 28-year-old mosaic Anton Mamae, who suffers a permanent muscle astrophy, has become a criminal case on Saturday of the last year.
Inspatid claims that you bought a motor driver in acquaintances for 160 thousand rubs to sell later.
However, the owners of the motorcycle, among which the former specialist, claimed that disabilities and his assistant, Vasili Serostana, had chosen their ownership by threatening violence.
On 30 June, the Moscow district court condemned Vasilia Serostana for three years of colony, and Antonio Mamaev, four and a half years of punishment, with the removal of punishment in the colony of the general regime (s. 2 p. 162 AIC).
After disabled disabilities were placed in the SSSO, the General Hall, the Prosecutor of Human Rights Declared by President Tatiana Moscow.
As a result, in the midst of July, Anton Mamaev was released from the SIDA by the same decision of the Timorville Court.
The protection, on the other hand, condemned the decision of the first instance in Moscou.

The Reception for the White House was awarded to the payers in thousands of dollars
According to the reports of the TIME magazine, the White House decided to heat the Southern Sea Sea in the field of the United States Industrial Production in the last month, $24,000 was funded to payers of total $24,000.
The White-Green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Mariine One and the President of the ship, became the central element of the United States construction programs in Belarus on 17 July.
President Donald Tramp, Vice-President Mike Penns and the senior officials of the White House reviewed technology products from all fifty-first States.
The Vertolette in Connective was sent close to a fleet from Man State, a flight car from Viscossein and a Mississippi car driver.
According to the first escape of marine helicopters (HMX-1), the HMX-1 office responsible for the helicopter managing, the White House's Army Office was equipped with the presence of a helicopter in a private order, or “FRAGO” only 36 hours before the helicopter was landed on the Southern Heaven on the case of an “negative” event.
“I just wanted you to make sure that you know, because it's an uncomfortablely wide extensive expansion in the press,” wrote the commander HMX-1 in the electronic letter to your chief, the first Vice-President of the Sea-Chair Corporation, referred to the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive to the Southern Meeting at about 7 p.m. on 17 July to participate in the event designated at 3 p.m. and remains there before the gas will be released between 6 and 9 at the same night.
The letter adds that if the shipment is delayed from the White House, the second escape is required for the return of the police in accordance with the limitations for work time.
The first equipment was a helicopter during the event, and the security officers remained close to the aircraft until it was on the ground.
The records received by the TIME magazine remained unexpected whether the second escape was needed.
The Hatcha Act prohibits federal servants to use public property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 clarified whether the event was not contrary.
“Any otherwise we asked whether it was a violation of the Hatcha law, and they answered us that no,” wrote the commander.
“ It seems to be a place where you are, ” answered the vice-president.
The activities “Overed in America” were declared by the White House as an official event, and the Hatcha law was not distributed.
But even official events have political nights.
During the event, the President made efforts to promote the reform of health reform, which was at the time in the development of the sun, and encouraging the attempts to regulate the Government ' s decisions.
Use of aircraft named “Marine One” and “Air Force One” for political purposes is not a new manifestation.
The Chairpersons are required to use them for travels.
But to ask them only for photos.
Tramp was the subject of the discussion in February when the President's plane was on the back during his first predicted minute in Melbourne, Florid State, and his accommodation in Twitter was engaged in communications with the complaints for the use of the President.
“The large house in the resort from the ‘Feated in America, ’ which was presented by 50 American workers from American materials,” said the Vice-Secretary Press of the White House Lindsey Walters.
The HMX-1 Equipages often perform training policy around the Washington Aglomeration and the Southern Sea in order to train the President of the United States in the White House with precise precise precise precision.
When Tramp was at the G-20 Summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 conducted 58 train stations in the Belarus House.
According to one of the officials, the police was carried out for the event “Only done in America”, as a result of the necessary training police for month.
The officers also had 11 additional hours in the context of the Non-President support tasks.
According to the White House, the taxpayers did not read the expenses for any of the other expenses submitted to the event.
The representative of the Sikorsky company reported that the company had not taken part in the demonstration organization of the South Sea.
HMX-1 does not take into account the budget for the Presidential positions and determine the exact amount of the events that are difficult.
However, according to the time rates of the Ministry of Defence for 2017, the return rate of the Ministry of Defence for VH-3D is $24,380 per hour.
The unit records confirmed that the aircraft time was 30 minutes per minute each side of its aircraft base on the Kuntico Sea Railway Base in Virginia.
The White House claims that the real value of helicopter use is much below the rate.
“Reasoning the value for payers, based on an example of reimbursement rate, fairly wrong,” says Walters.
“These examples include personal composition, services and many other unreasonable costs, including annual allocations”.
According to the investigation carried out by the RND Corporation in 2015, the reimbursement rates do not include the value of the personal composition, but, in fact, take into account the value of the hot, services and expenditure specified in the treaty.
At that time, the former secretary of the White House Shon Spaceer expressed the protection of the hypothesis for events.
“ The idea to demonstrate the things made in America this week,” said Spaceer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the Connectics company are very proud of the fact that they contribute to national security, and that they exist, I think, hundreds of people, if there are thousands of people who are more working in this area.
And I think, as the majority of the Americans, that we're all proud of this helicopter and another military technician, which has worked so much Americans.
Surely it is appropriate for you to take care of this."
It was unreasonable if Tramp had interacted with a helicopter, obsessing the South Sea during the event, but he was exactly located on a driving place in the flight car.
In the White House, Tramp called the representatives of the Sikorsky company, searching for the subject of his own company product fleet.
"I really know Sikorsky," said the President. - I have three of them."
