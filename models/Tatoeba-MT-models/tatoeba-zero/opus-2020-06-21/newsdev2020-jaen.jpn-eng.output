We're gonna buy safety to the snake and the snabble.
Travel accidents happening because of a driver.
There's an increase in the accidents of Blake and Accel's shock by the old driver.
It's like, if you're going to be a panic, you're going to smell the axle.
There's a new car with such a driving driving support, which is incredibly covered, but there's a switch machine that can be placed in the swallowing cars.
That's how the shooter pulsing engines develop, sell an emergency prevention and prevention system.
I want to show you what characters we have.
Axle and Blake's pedal are low at the same time.
[e-ACCEL ALARM] In a new point of view, Pedal's fault is developed by Pibot's "e-ACCEL ALARM."
It's just that we're going to shut up the Pedal's bugs in the alarm.
When you stop or slow walk, you're going to switch the axle-pedal as you need.
Instead of reacting to the sound, reacting back the axle, to avoid rapidly recognising the errors.
Accel's error is efficiency, even the age drivers that are able to know the sound changes of the engine.
The clothing is put into the OBDII container and the body is cut by both packs.
And it's a slightness that it's the prices, the taxes, the slightness that you need to set.
But I don't want to watch the World Wing in September, but I don't want to observe the Axel Blakes wrong-defence device.
I'm just going to go back in front, and I'm going to go back.
When the accel pendars were slowly switched and retreated from the time of the stop (and less than 10 km/h), they detect the tanks and the Blake signals of both sides of the cars, strippe the opening of the accel and switching the speed.
When the accel pedal is wrong, not telling the signals from the axle, and checking the switch on a moment in the clip loop.
It's also the functions that can detect about 5 km/h in the retreat at the time of the retreat.
It's just a simple division processing with caplane.
The basic price is 300,000 cents of taxes.

There was also the desire to build a system that can share in real time.
She said, "The weather was changed before, and the last time it was okay, and he wants to have a major relationship with small engineers and people and a disaster. "
The Mediterranean speaked: "The opinions made are also thinking of speaking to the government as a organization."
Boris Johnson's relationship with women, Jennifer Archuri.
Police Office (IOPC) now examines whether Johnson should be investigated if the infringements in the office of London's headquarters have been violated by a criminal offence.
The GLA of London (GLA) announced that the officer of the GLA was registered in the case of the Prime Minister's "Actions".
GLA says, "The matter of acts exists if there are information that the crime may be done."
It's not that it's never proved.
IOPC's going to consider whether this matter is to be investigated.
This problem was accompanied by the IOPC, but it is an organisation that corresponds to the accused of the UK and Wales police.
This problem was addressed to the police office, because Mr. Johnson had a job that was similar to the Vice-Secretary.
Mr. Johnson rejects the injustice related to the relationship with Mr. Archuri.
In the first place, Johnson said that he was "that's wrong", but he said to follow the London Council's order to ask for more information on the relationship with Mr Archuri.
The statement was received by Sandy Times, but in the report, the US Archuries, who moved to London for seven years, had been paid 126.000 pounds from money to the department of London, three times with Johnson and the foreign trade departments.
Afterwards, the government frozen 100,000 pounds of aid to the Hacker House under the research company.
The company would have a question of the investigation process that has been done before the payment is paid.
Mr. Warman, Minister of Digital Minister, said that the company has a phone number of British.
However, many reports say that the phone called on the number was transferred to the office of California, where Mr. Archuri (34) was now placed.
The partnership between the Prime Minister and the Women's Employees was public secret.
The GLA movement to join the police office has touched the angry of the Prime Minister.
The government headquarters say that it was "the attack based on the political movement" and that the timement, before the Defense Party's night, was a very partial interference.
"In spite of any assaults, the Directorate gave evidence, but the report was late Thursday night, the Prime Minister did not have the opportunity to respond to the Authority. "
The nation and the Mascomi will soon be seen as a sweet political.
Previously, the Standard newspaper heard that the friendship with Johnson and Kalifornists, supported by the London Tourism and the Division Training Department, was "public secret".
Unlike those who were thinking of Mr. Archuri's company at the time, the former officers of London Anders (L&P), Mr. Arquiri said to have the right to take part in the foreign trade negotiations of Mr Johnson in the capital of the city.

Instead, he heard the exhibition from the director of the Deputy of the Deputy (Photo) in the Deputy.

What do you think about this 20 years, now?
It's just that in the history of 20 years, it's been a lot of thoughts and powers.
I'd like to thank you very much for all the related people not only with the power of the "Find."
It's also a slight fund, which I'd like to say, "Found supports the ownership of the general life."
I've been able to do this.
If all the people are discarded from money's worries, the world will be light from the foundation, and they will encourage them to work every day.
In the long period, the use is not going to walk with the beneficiary.
It's a lot of money.
I feel that we want to understand the message that we're offering from the time that we need to support the company in the world.
It's the reason why it's been a long-term fund for 20 years, and it's because it continued to be the right system that can be reached directly in many ways.
I've opened all the investments, money and costs in the last month reports.
It's a black box, but it's all opened.
And that's why we're all trusting.

Nigeria's 9-year-old child, mobile game 30-year-old games
This 9-year-old kid is making me a free programing guest, named Scratch2.
If you use scratch2, you can make games, animations, stores, etc.
For the time, Mrs Bazir has created more than 30 mobile games.
The games today are programed to hide cowmoy.
The player gets the point to catch the cowmory out of the hidden place.
I learned how to make the games in the short-term talk.
Mrs. Bazir said to the CNN, "I've spent time to play when it's ridiculous."
In March, my father requested her 5-day session for children from five to 15 years of age.
The codefeast International Organization's talk was conducted to give children such as Bazir the opportunity to touch new technologies such as robotic technologies and virtual realities.
According to his father, Mrs. Vasil has grown in many mobile games.
"Basil has always had a phone game, and he purchased the tablet when he was four.
Candy Crash and Temple Lans did so much. "
But since it was shocked about the games, the 7-year-old Bazir's game schedule was higher.
He said, "As a day, I'd always do a tablet like a day, but I was dreaming too much of the game, so a little foolish."
He was shocked and said, "I'm always playing, but what's going to do with others to play?
When I said that, I didn't think Bazir was really interested."
Since then, the Bazir, who was trying to learn how to make his game, asked his parents to buy the laptop and registered the first step to learn the game creation.
Mrs. Vasil, the future wants to be a scientist, has a name on his own game.
One of the games, Mosquet Mash, can be purchased in the Gugplay Store.
Africa's youth population is the highest and African innovation has the lead of young age like Bazir.
Recently, the 12-year-old two-year-old children have been designed a robot that uses program codes to eliminate their homes.
In May 2019, at the Robofest Concept, the Ghana's High School team wins a boxing robot programing.
Involvement in the African Google and Micro-Soft Technology Company has increased, and Bazir and the children of the same years are trying to become a star of future programmement.

According to the court documents submitted on Thursday, the former committee of the Northern Republic of Northern Republic is expected to acknowledge a false prosecution against the federal investigation agents involving the principal political donor.
On a list of cases in the Federal Court, Robin Hayes is sentenced on Tuesday next week.
He has been prepared as a part of the legal deal, based on the fact that he was signed by the lawyer of Hayes, that he was self-reaching that he did false statements against the FBI in 2012.
The actual legal documents are signed, and they did not clearly accept the fact that Hais's sentences would be acknowledged.
Hayes was sentenced first for conspiration, injury, false false injury.
The investigator accused that he had participated in the plan of the assurance company, who had already paid the elections to the State Insurance Director as a return to a special await.
Greg Lindberg and two employees were sentenced to the officer of the Insurance Director of the State.
Rindberg is a manufacturer of insurance and investment companies, which has contributed to the State and federal candidates and committees and has recently been the primary political donors of the State since 2016.
Rindberg supported the ideas and politicalists of the Republic, but gave the Democratic Party.
The lawyer in Rindburg asked for comments on the e-mail, but he didn't answer.
On Thursday, the lawyer Carnes Davis, who asked additional comments on e-mail, did not answer.
On Thursday, the court document was written that Hayes had false statements to the FBI in August 2012, but he said that he hadn't spoken with Cozy on the state of security staf.
However, according to the fact that Haies was actually talking about a person's appeal from the State Insurance Officer and the Insurance Office from Lincoln.
He said he had helped Lindberg's application to meet Cozzie, and he had talked directly to the advisor.
The appeal in April suggested that Lindberg was planning to make a special awaiting of his insurance as a result of more than $200 million to re-elect 20.
According to the prosecution, this conspiration was involved in the appeal of the officials who investigated the company of Lincoln.
The Republic of Korea reported an uncertainty of income to federal agents and helped them.
I didn't have any suspicion for Corsey.
In a conversation including Lindburg and Koshea, it was reported to Haise to send $250,000 to the re-election of Koozi.
On a case, he had first opposed that he had been cut off in the conversation if he could move so much money.
He said, "All you want."
All right, let's go.
The Federal Inspector's reporter asked for more information on the legal deal in the e-mail, but he didn't answer.

If you learn the patterns, you're going to be able to live in a rat because it's like this and the brain's being organised for you.
I think I'm still evolving every day, not just if I'm going to be "mote".
That's why I'm not shocking to live.

Well, you're going to be alive to say, "I have to do so."
Because I don't change people and society.

Now, just three weeks after the EU Headquarters, the deputy of the Headquarters is on the side of the department's concerns that the Prime Minister is missing the time to take a large stage.
Boris Johnson is on the rebellion of the internal secret who asks to join the EU with a compromise.
The negotiations have been understood with a new tax scheme for the backstop dealing with the Irish borders, and the EU is not able to execute Mr Johnson's alternatives.
High Ministers are expecting to suggest that the EU's Black Stewards, the German Prime Minister Angela Melkell, are able to establish a three-year remit for the backstopping party.
The Sun's newspaper heard about three of them, who would have decided to fight the Prime Minister after the Defence Year of the Congress held at Manchester next week.
They are going to claim that the Prime Minister would ask for a "extraordinary" strategy, which was designed by the European Union of Caming's High Ministers, and to accept the proposals for the EU for a short-term time limits.
One deputy said that it would be an illicit decision that the Supreme Council was held on Thursday, but in the event, "We are the only way to get away on March 3th."
We have won't winn in the counts, but they oppose us.
The Prime Minister must be useful than the steps.
The Camings plans are clearly missing.
I can't be able to fight in so many areas.
But if not, he promised Mr. Johnson to speak to the Deputy Prime Minister.
The Prime Minister said, "If you need, Boris would talk to the terms' agreement back to the hospital. "
That's why the numbers are over, and everyone's trying to finish it all.
If it is unexpected, Boris will be finished, and we're all.
Lord John Mayor accused Boris's negotiations not seriously.
The Prime Party's Defence Party is a hard speech, "the Prime Minister wants to join EU agreements.
But we haven't seen the Prime Minister at the meeting with the EU and the agreements.
Instead, we have seen that the primary minister in Scotland is struggling with a bottle, checking the eggs in Wales, and discussing the people in large streets. "
The Prime Minister acknowledges that the agreement is still before the last day, "if anyone reaches the goal not to think, the road is still long. "
However, when the newspapers are still able to defeat, the Ben's three-month provision for the redistribution of our negotiations is greatly weak in Brussels.
The reporter said, "But sure this law is hindering our negotiations, but the Prime Minister and his colleagues are trying to continue forward, despite the fact that the law has been implemented. "
Steven Berkley, Minister of Departure of the European Union, is returning to Brussels today for the EU's concert with Michel Balnee.
They discuss a document on how the area of all the islands of Ireland operates on food and vegetables.

And Kelly turned out the news that was shocked in the heart and cleared that the shock of Dunbleen's fire was "was very hard."

I'm going to Joanna's funeral, and Pam and I have been a friend since it was.

I'm not sorry for my husband.

Zimbabwe, Chiwana, who fears the snake.
According to the government director, Vice-President Constantino Chiwenga rejected the proposal of the Presidency from the President of Robert Mugabe in the Middle East in November 2017 that would be an inquiry to accept the Military Department of November 17.
The Zimbabwe Dipendent reports last week, while negotiations are continued between Mgabe and the Defense Army.
However, Chiwana rejected the proposal, not because of the concern, it was the cause of Mangana to use Chiwana in the world's leaders and African Union to know what they had been slaughtered by the government.
Mugabe, who has been under the "37 years of government, confirmed that the government was the senior President of Jamwana, is the subject of the government instead of emerson Mungagawa, and that it was reported that a huge negotiations were held on the subject at the time.
Mgabe, who had lost the power, has organized contacts with the embassy from Chiwana, and the governments say.
According to the government official, the military commander and the President's interview were done by three people.
President Spoxman, George Chalanba, had been involved in the negotiations, and he reported that Aaron Nepera and Roman Catholic Bishop Fidelis Muconoli, the Central Intelligence Officer, had taken part in the negotiations.
Gideon Gono, the Supreme Court of Preparation of the Bank of Zimbabwe, was a member of the Mugabe's role to give the presidency to the Zimbabwe Defence Army (ZDF).
Mugabe, a symbol of Africa after his death, tried to condemn the African Union to engage in leaders of the African Union.
It was not due to the previous election of the President of the CDF (Mgabe).
"It was a disappointment for the part of the president's family, and it was an act of a decline to save a dangerous and rapidly expansive situation," he wrote.
It was just a little political shock of the President that, at least diplomatic, he wanted to change the flow.
If the Constitutional Order was destroyed, it would have been conflicting with the African Union's views, but the commanders would remember that they would have declared that they wouldn't blame the Constitution.
Because (Mgabe) the President hoped that Chiwana, the former military headquarters, was slaughtered and claimed that the Constitution was not violated.
Because President Mgabe wanted that the African Union, which could decide whether the entire situation would still be placed as a counter, would finally be called the Kudetter only as an appropriate military demand.
That was the purpose and calculation of this proposal.
When the Defense Army realized that they couldn't protect themselves, Mgabe moved, and the authorities talked.
It's warned to be sentenced to the military office of Kadafi, and Mugabe didn't have to write the department.
The military commanders told Mgabe that even if they entered the presidential house called Blueluf, they wouldn't shoot the citizens.
At that time, Mgabe said to protect his family, and wanted two of the military forces to prove to be slaughtered.
The commanders and commanders of the time read that.
In the words stated by the President's deceased message (Gono), it was strongly used by "Isla Tiri Bemakovapa Macawapa (We belong to the Camofrau, or the military group), and we are not only in political competition, but not only in political competition".
The army told the Foreign Commanders of the region to remove the "criminal" to cut him instead of falling in Zimbabwe.
In addition, Mangangagagawa tried to call back to the same way to talk about Kudetters and Residents in South Africa.
In addition to the negotiations with the military, Mgabe needed support from the region.
As President Jacob Zuma was the Communist President of South Africa, not only the economic and regions, but also the powers of Jacob Zuma cleared that the key of this process, the South Africans, who had been rejected, were threatened by the return of the military invasion to the Presidency soon as the South African army was sent to Harare.
"It wasn't been supported by President Putin and African leaders, so it wasn't realized." reports the Independent newspaper.
The United Nations's twenty-first bombs claimed to be nuclearly banned.
The 26-day meeting of the United Nations headquarters of New York was opened to the World Without Nuclear Weapons, the Red Cross Hospital at the first bombardment, the grand daughter of the president of New York City, and the two-food-weapon-to-leading path (63) of the Nation.
In this new day, five countries were criticized in the nuclear prohibition treaties, and the criticism became a total of 32-land regions.
The treaty will require a critical of the 50-land regions.
The meetings and critics were held in accordance with the 26-day International Day for the global destruction of nuclear weapons.
He expressed a strong concern that the Director-General Gutterreth has made a movement against nuclear decline and disruption in recent years.
He stressed "I'm going to get away."
China needs a powerful leadership, or if you don't have a policy document.
China needs to have a powerful leadership by the Communist Party, and nor will the country be slaughtered, and the Chinese government has said that in the 70th anniversary of the Middle Democracy, the Political Document announced on Thursday.
The Chinese National Journal Organization said that since 70 years ago, the Communist Party has undergoing the government was due to the leadership of the party.
China is wide, and the state of the state is complex, but it's little to see control problems.
If there is a powerful guidance, China will go to disappearing and disappearing, and the world will be a disaster.”
The Chinese authorities have long justified the need for national stability to address the problems as the democracy movement in Kuwait in 989.
On Thursday, the powerful native council of the World Economic Representative of the Second World Economic Countries has strongly strengthened the party's rule and reacted people to the party in the middle of the year 2012.
He also supervised the modernization of the military program that threatens the region.
China does not want to export its country's development models, nor will it take other models, but only to pursue peace instead of the rule of law.
There is no invasion or world rule among the Chinese citizens.
In the past, China has been cut from a strike, and wars and confusions have left a deep pain with its pain; China will never be able to hurt the suffering of others.
China has faced difficult problems such as slow-scale and anti-government movement in the Hong Kong when the country is instable.
The white book says that China never allows nuclear benefits to "absent" and that security and sovereignty are harmful.
"The tax that continues to be threatened to the threat of trade war is not a solution to any problem," says the White Paper, "in connection with the trade conflict with Washington.
China is the completed industrial system, the complete industry chain, a large market space and a strong economic development country.
"The white book has never been weakening in the trade war."
They are convinced that China has the difficulty to face, change the crisis into opportunities and opening a new world.
In China no longer wants to fight the United States, but I don't want to replace the United States, so the United States had to make the Chinese development quiet.
The United States can not control China, but the decline of China's development is less possible.
If the United States do so to prevent, press, and move smoking out of the country, they will never keep the strength.

The Homosexuality Court of Auditors, which expands diversity: the North Sea Journal of Hown electronic version
In the case of the case of the same gender, the Court of Justice has demonstrated that it would be accepted.
There are more than 20 countries who accept homosexual marriages, and no legal power in the country, but its own body, such as Cyprus, is a wide system to authenticate homosexual partnerships.
The decision took this and accepted the practice of two women's real marriage.
It's the first legal judgment that he accepted legal protection for homosexual couples.
The case that the country does not recognise homosexual marriage because of the rule of civil law or the rule of laws, such as the law of laws, is under five cases, such as the laws of the country.
I want to develop a decision on a more understanding of sexually smaller rights and a further discussion of the legislative systems to accept a variety of families.
Women have been together for about seven years, and they got married certificates in the United States, but the prosecution was disrupted by an injury, and the prosecution requested the harm of their former partners.
The decision was accepted by two income, as well as “the reality of men and women's marriage.”
It's a temporary decision that extends the same gender, and the reality of marriage rights, such as social insurance.
Furthermore, it is important to show an interpretation of the Constitution of the 24th Constitution based on the "Free of Marriage" as the "the only one of the two agreements".
And both sexes were said, "It was not estimated by the time of homosexual marriage, and it was not resolved until the sweetie that rejects homosexual marriage."
"The Constitution does not measure homosexual marriage," and it is expected that it will be an evacuation of the case of homosexuality everywhere.
On the other hand, as the "legal benefits of women's legal protection" was not accepted, the problem remained.
Does it not interfere with the right to be protected by accepting the same practice between men and women?
The public's consciousness has changed over 7 percent of those who have to accept homosexuality in law by the national parish investigation.
While the diversity of life styles continues, the law is linked to the traditional family images, we will take the rights of those who do not get it.
The fact that the marriage is not a "conciliation" of the law, there is a few restrictions, such as non-impossed tax controls, and no community rights.
In the consideration of homosexual marriage, we need to re-educe family laws, even though homosexual marriages are enhanced, with a variety of views, including the expansion of the legal laws of real marriage.

STUDY SPECIAL 27 September
It's a serious contamination in popular tourists, and it's clearly in videos.
Sidney Harber is the largest head of the Opera House, Cercle Key, Lunapark, and the famous Harbridge of the Australian economy every year.
But there's a terrible truth under the bridge.
Sydney's famous port is one of the worst waterways that flows about 15 pounds of olympic poles each year.
With this fearful statistics, one of our largest tourists is called one of the most poorest places.
According to the new video titled Sydney Harbor, in Australia, the most popular waterways around the city are shocking, binary powders, pet bottles, shoes and oil clothes, and also many flows to animal snakes - all of them are flown into Sidney Harbar from the rainy water that flows in the street.
It's the biggest factor in the waterways.
A video published on the World Tourism on September 27, namely, Sydney Herber's vice-premier research program, Dr. Katherine Daphron says "This is Paradox."
It's really beautiful, but it's one of the extremely changed and contaminated rivers in our country.
According to CSIRO, every hour of 1560 km of plastics are flown into the waterway, most of which are flowing to Sidney Harber through rainwater.
"The great rain slowed several times, and Sydney Harber was... very tragic," said Dr. Daphron.
Two thirds of the contamination are flowing out of the rainwater.
But as one of the eggs, there is a larger problem of 70 percent of the plastic flowing to the sea under the waters of Sydney Harber.
"I really don't know what there is, but I don't know the truth what there is,," said Richard Nichols of the Deb Center of Manley, who was to get some 500 miles of plastic legs every year.
I think that if many people know more (which is under water), they're going to be sweet.
It's pressing, but more than half of the whole thing we're discovering is binal.
So we're going to have a switch.
The Sydney Harber is beautiful and soon under the water, no one believes that all these plastics and skins are flowing.
One of the producers of Osan Protects and the director, Jeremy Brown, said that there can also be some placed populations and tourists to reduce the plastics and skins in the waterway.
He said,
We need to spend more conscious about what we're going to get to the sea because we're going to reduce the plastic use, recycling, and finally flowing into the sea.
The 50 percent of the oxygen we smoke from the sea, and the pain of the sea is to kill ourselves.
The ocean is 30 per cent of the coal carbon, and the food source.
But we can restore Sydney Harber and return to the ancient appearance, it's very simple.
The sea is killing humans.
It has also been published a new study of the video and incidents of the Ricycling Company, as part of the activities that have aware of the reducing effects of the alcoholic and natural environment, as a part of the activities that have been funded by the Australian people, as a result of the financing of the video and accidents of this month, on Plastic and Mental Hels.
According to a new investigation, from 12 to 18 years of age 546 children, 82 percent have a desperate desperate about the plastics, 25 per cent thinks that the plastic smuggling problem is inflicted by adults.
In the study, the parents also said that the Plastic Cover problem was lanking at the fourth level, and that 551 parents were investigated, 93 per cent of the Plastic skin in the ocean.
The majority of the students said to want something to be plastic, but they did not know how to change.

Scientists found that the same process happens in Tasmanian Deville and Hit.
This discovery is expected to create new ways for cancer treatment.
What's the common point with Tasmanian Deville and Hit?
It's a cancer that's not visible.
The research team in Melbourne, including research teams in Peter McColumn Cancer Center, has discovered greatly the possibility of changeing the treatment to the cancer if there is no reaction to immune treatment.
It may be a key to the high mortal face tuberculosis that threatens the future of Tasmania Deビル before the destruction.
In this study, a number of cancer cells in the tyre and skins have been reacted without reacting to the use of a PRC2 protein, and the immune system stopped attacking cancer.
This is a major problem for the treatment of a small cell pulmonary tuberculosis, nervous cell tuberculosis, a mere cell skin cancer.
Professor Mark Dawson, in Petermack Colour, said to AAP: "There is very important in this project that we may be able to reverse the process for patients who have the resistance to immune treatment".
We can re-use the functional treatment, reactivate the protein known as MHC, and the immune system may be able to identify cancer cells.
"They have a great effect on pulmonary patients," said Professor Dawson.
"The pulmonary cancer is a world-wide disease.
And maybe you can be treated in a very nice way.
Researchers are expecting that the discovery will finally be used by the treatment of Tasmania Deビル face tuberculosis where the cancer cells are escaped in the same way.
"The same process happens to Hit and Tasmanian Devil Cancer," says Professor Dawson.
"It was very slow to treat the tumor of Tasmanian Deville.
But if we can use a pharmaceutical devil, it may be helpful to control the tuberculosis. "
And the scientists are shocking on a large planet around the extreme stars.
Scientists find the sun system that covers the current understanding of the planet of the planet that around the small stars called Red Sternes, around 30 lights.
On September 26, 2019, the great gas planet GJ3512b was published around the red stars of the throne.
The star is normally larger than the largest planet around it.
But in this case, there's no difference in the size of the stars and planet, and the researchers said on Thursday.
The star called GJ3512 is about 12% of the sun, but the planet around it has at least half of the size of Jupiter, the largest planet of our sun system.
"Yes, it's already surprising, "Fan Carlos Morales, a physician of the Catalonia Institute of Scientific Scientific Institute, who has led this study in the Scientific Journal of Science.
The theocratic models show that the normal low mass stars are to be a small planet like the Earth and the small planet.
In this case, we found a large gas planet like Jupiter around a very small star. "
The planet consisting of gas, like Jupiter, has been found using the telescope of Spain's color Art astronomy.
The planet is around 204 days around the stars.
So that's what we're going to do.
GJ3512 is just about 35 percent larger than Jupiter, not much smaller than our sun.
It's lower than the sun, the temperature of about 3800 degrees of Kelvin (680 degrees/3527 degrees).
"There's a red color, so I'm doing a red color."
There is a shape that the second planet is now around the stars, and the third planet may have been released out of the star system in the past, and explains the circle of the Yumas planet, and Mr Morales said.
The planet is generated from the same circle that produces the slopes of stars and gases that are rounded by the stars.
In the most powerful planet-based model named "Coa recovery", the circumstance of the objects produces from a solid part in the circle and the atmosphere of its planet's eggs is atmosphere.
It's like, if you're using the model of an anti-static model called self-frequencies, you're going to explain this rare planet system.
"In this case, the initial planet circle with the just born stars may have been lower than it was thought. "
It's a circle that's not stabil, so it's likely to appear some deep high zones.
And this is the one that we're going to grow to the planet.
Delivery workers, a complaint to eat a cowboy dip to their colleagues.

The secret of the Royal Family: The frequencies users of the king's room are identified
The Royal family must travel hundreds of times in the world as a public part.
Often, it is easy to use its own machine to move the kings around the world, the king's own instruments, the king's own instruments.
Of course, there's a right to have a own machine.
It's not possible to keep the long columns of the country input, and it's not limited to the number of loads, and the Loyer family seems to be able to invite and invite the guests, including the extraordinary passengers.

Ms. Obama, who really knows the pressure that spotlights in the world, was advised in the Google House Keyping magazine.
Sometimes the pressures from themselves and around people are too large.

Trump Hotel ornamental.
The Alcohol committee in Washington, Washington, was denied with the claim that Washington should re-examinate the permission of the sale of alcohol in a local Trans-International Hotel.
The committee has lacked the appointment for the committee on Thursday, Senators, First Judges, two Jewish leaders, and most of the prosecutors did not have a fixed property to the state of Washington or to the state.
According to Washington Post, the complaint to eliminate the alcohol rights of the hotel is secondly based on the State law which requires "approximity" for obtaining alcohol permits.
The first sentence sentence in the summer last summer tried to be violated by the State law by the President of Transp's attacks.
The prosecution was rejected from the fact that the authorisation was already approved.
This second complaint is formed in accordance with the update of the authorisation certificates.
It's the first snake of the snacks of the snakes of Bentley's snakes!
It's a sweetheart of a phreng Bees.
In May 2019, in the Crue factory of Bentley, the British Bentley factory, the grain was started, and the first heat was slaughtered in September.
In the cluster factory, we gathered more than 100 cups from a cup of cocktails.
And then we're going to get a swimming snake in a snake that is built in a snake.
I want to see this!
I'm going to get the shirt with the Bentley.
Peter Bosh, the manufacturing officer of Bentley, comments:
"The first year I set up a nickel in the largest land of the Crew factory, with a purpose to contribute to the entire biodiversity of the region.
They watched the wheats from the forests and the neighborhoods that planted in the land.
It's really wonderful that this place is suitable for the powder, and that's the first year.
Bentley is through the crew factory and its business and has a wide range of activities to be the top of a high-scale car engineer, and it's part of it.
The staffs also have a positive support.
It's very glad that you have received the first grace, and the next year is planning to set more boxes and to increase the size of the grain.
We're going to make a small step, and we're going to keep our biodiversity in the region.
In May 2019, 120,000 skins of Freng Bees launched in May 2019.
And in September, the summer was finished to take a nickel frame from the nest box, strike up the nickel to a distance distance, stripped the hatimits cut down.
You can see the balls and the packs of the shoes and the packs.
The label design was responsible for a designer, Louis Mash column which is responsible for the innerity of Bentley.
It seems to be a gift to the important customs and guests, not only to the staff.
The United Kingdom is a country where the thy time is important.
It's a swimming phenelty with a hammer, of course, with a shock of "Flineg Bees".
Cleveland police, the worst English newspaper,
The inconsistent police was imprisoned by the inspectors in England.
Cleveland police was designed with an incorrect report on all areas.
In Cleveland's police, Phil Gomley's police office says.
In the police, in six years, five police officers have been replaced, and they're looking forward to calling new solutions.
According to the report, the crime stopped, arrested the suspect, striving to protect social weaks.
Phil Gomley, the police director, said, "We have continued to have a serious depression since we've been investigating the last time we've been investigating."
The police officer Mike Vill was dismissed for a month without department, but it was "severe," but a number of unpublished arrests were investigated.
Adrian Roberts, the vice-president, has been arrested by a ill-related arrest.
Inspector Simon Harwood's legal investigation committee was held last year for the reason why he was employed to do sexual acts.
He's departured the police.
The Defense Party's head Ben Hautine said, "It was officially verified that the police was broken.
Now it's when the Department's involvement.
Richard Louiss, director of police, said, "I have been improved, but I'm all the responsibility to progress reform."
Nancy Peroshi: William Bar became a criminal, and the Conciliation has to be decided.
I don't know what's going on.
Now we think we're involved in the cases that we've hidden in hiding, and there's a chance to take time in the investigation,” said Peroshi in the federal parliament against the CNN's reserve.
"I'm going to work on the basis of the time to find the facts and facts."
In the record of the White House this week, Mr. Transp has been able to investigate the President of the Ukrainian Wolodimill Zellenski, President of President Jou Viden, 2020.
According to the conversation record, Mr. Trump also asked Zerenski to cooperate with his own lawyer and lawyer Ludy Juliani.
Mr. Trump refuses the injustice.
CNN was the lawyer of the State Security of the Ministry of Justice in Tuesday, who first noticed the internal prosecution against the transaction in Ukraine over a week ago.
The Deputy of the Court of Justice, who was accused of the information-related persons, decided that Mr. Tramp's phone meeting would not take place in political financing violations.
In response to the question that Bar should be witnessed, Mr. Perroshi said on Friday who decided to be a witness committee.
But Mr. Peroshi adds that Bar was thinking of being a criminal.
I know, the bar was so long ago.
"The name of the finish bar was given," Mr. Peroshi said that Mr. Tramp called on July with President Ukrainian.
It's interesting that Mr. Bar will be able to make a decision on the end of the accused accused.
Mr. Peroshi was very worried about the domestic advocate who had been informed, Mr. Transp attacked the complainant on Thursday as a spy, and in the past, "he was very worried about the different treatment of the spy".
I think the President's statement is too unresponsive and dangerous.
Mr Peroshi said that the internal advocate plays an important role in the public exposure and publicity of the Government of the United States, "and the President said that it was not possible to do so, that the government's injury is inevitablely harmful."

Easternders, Netavale:
In Eastern Enders, the unexpected bomb news of Hoytney Dean (Shawna McGarti), the Columbia Heights (Tony Clay), and the columns returned to their loved ones, and the heat intensity of the columns and Ben Mitchell (Max Bowen).
But if two of them start to break this hot moment?
Since the column helped Ben, the problem of Bobby Millner Russell, they think that the relationships have been slow, the columns are recently slow, and Ben's weak, and they have been glad to have seen a pleasant place.
Tonight, he'll feel better than before he's going back.
It was clear that she had been very effective just after a sudden marriage and a folk person had to be shocked.
Hoytney's home, he's going to talk to the column and the hungry.
But soon, Hotney adds a new fact to the column.
The columns are shocked, and Jay Mitchell, James Bosswick, are worried to see the columns of Gab drinking in Queen Vick.
The emotional columns spend into Ben, smell all that happened, and blame Ben.
Ben accepts the angry of the columns peacefully and spends comfortable words, and soon two people smell the smell of the column turns to warm.
But what do they do from this?
They tried to spend the next week, but Ben was given the material that was thinking about the relationship, and all that he tried to do together.
But the new pillars of self-reliance against the gay's father decided to fight to bring their own demanding things.
This chiss-episode in Easternder is sent to BBC at Tuesday 27 September at 8:30 p.m.
If the slaughter has 9% of the gallery, is it true that it would be a donation from the slaughter?
It's a problem of the main business of anti-social power-based business, and it's also closing the challenges of gallery.
At the 22th meeting of July 22, he said, "The company is not one of the talents in nine," but it is reacted to the snakes.
On the percentage of "9:1", 9 per cent of the books, there was a donation from the slaughter to the shop, and the investor's view is also flown on Twitter, and more than 30,000 times it has been tweeted.
If the gallery was "9:1", it's going to be a donation tax.
I heard the Task Force.
● The lawyers are not taxes.
I'm going to answer you from the tax position.
It's not a lawyer. It's not a gift tax.
If you have a 100 million job depending on 9-1, you're going to have a total of $1 million, $1 million, $10 million, you're going to be $10 million.
It's the taxes of law.
Of course, it's supposed to have a tax dealing with the taxes.
And if you were thinking about the department, you're not saying that the money that you really have to do is different from the money that you have to do.
And I think I'm pronounced as a sale.
The donation is that, if you don't recognize it, it would not be a gift even if your partner is a person.
It's a problem to calculate taxes.
But the third one will not decide what the taxially suitable prices are to be, just as we are, as we are, about what they're talking about, as it's, what's going to be the one who's going to be.
I think it's a circle of payment.
After graduation of the University of Banks, taxist registered in 2008.
The university teachers, the seminars, the writers and the works are wide.
It's a precise exhibition for the primary.
The white house, the ball legs, the big panics.
The white houser explained that this is a "great panic" in the week when the slightly plan to address the reality of a new democratic party has been struggling.
The next person in the White House said that the Interior Prosecutor's offering can't strive to the President and some surrounding persons.
He said, "I don't have a lot of reality."
The white houses had no clear plan towards this situation, and it seems that the President could not apply the normal action that the President had ever done to discuss, because this proposal was very serious, and it was not convinced how it was possible to go forward to the news reported. "
Another person on this debate expressed the "a great shock of the white House" circle when the president was shocked in the long-term shooting question.
Another information shows that the president's press was observed every day and that there are some sides near the President who are seeing the "smiling" behavior of the president.
There is more inevitable acts of transactions that are worried about the possibilities that can be severely attacked by an unexpected means, and they are concerned about the President and political environment in the election year.
The trumpet was directed to the biggest threats that weren't ever before in the presidential period, and it turned out to restore the strategies that it was effectively estimated and defended during the Russian investigation.
Trump tried to slowly look at the President of Ukrainian who wanted to cooperate with the political enemy, to spend interest in the activities of the candidate Jo Viden and to defeat the internal accusers when there was a partial combat.
But most of the white houses have suffered from the probation of the Molar investigation, and the next time they began to feel a difference.
The President of the Force was Brand, but a more detailed person spoke about this situation.
Trump did not seem to be an inclination to answer the questions about the Russian suspicion.
While internal advocates have found the fact that there was no information directly with the President of Ukrainian, the President of Transp and Volodimir Zelenski, who claimed that it was a fact that it was not possible to communicate directly with the President of Ukraine, and some are convinced that the defence can be reduced.
In addition, if the President is attacked, it will increase the support force to defend such facts.
However, a delegate strategist near the White House notes that the fundamental support rate of the President will already be very high, and there will be no effect on the new supporters obtaining by the gun.
In particular, if the gun is hindering the legislation, and the news is independence in the middle of the fourth month, "No advantage is to concentrate on the President's pillar."
Another information is that those who claim to say that the ball would be helped by the President did not completely understand how uncertain the president's response would be.
The worried white houses are calling for advice to build a shock-related team.
According to the leaders who explained the bones of this plan, this action is still the beginning, but the strategic decisions rooms are still not clearly implemented.
But it was recognised that there was a need for a clear leadership to organize public activity in order to combat the critical internal proclamation document and its publication against the force given by the Democratic Democratic Volunteers.
According to this situation, there is a detailed point of information that the Director of State Mike Pompeo and the Officer Steven Munuzin expressed that the long-term strategic spectrum of the communication with the President of the Ukrainian president was not publishing a document after 48 hours.
A person who is involved in this case is more pressing than the time of Robert Morler's investigation by almost unexpected investigation, and a person who may participate in the expansion of the guns is called the outdoor Pitble of the Tramp, the former director of the Electoral Office, Corlie Ruandouski.
But Ruandouski said to NBC news that he would not be sure that he would be a leader of such action.
"I've done all that I can support the President and the President's policies in the past five years, but I never talked to the President and the sides about joining the false shooting team. "
The foreign lawyer Jay Secrow at the Molar Tramp Research also participates in the squad.
With regard to the NBC news record, the secrew answered: 'The problem is to be treated properly'.
Emmit Flood, who has led to the Clinton Bay until Morler's finish, left the White House, and the current white home adviser Patt Sipolon, who has experienced this unfortunate experience, is now lacking a lawyer in the White House.
More information about the White House's strategies, in particular, said that the associants are far away for the construction of materials and strategic teams, but they are organized, and that they all need materials to lead to political combat.

The Democratic Party of Transp's Need Photo.
Senator David Nuness (California) seems to be patient to the idea that President Donald Trump is investigated.
Thursday, in the comments to defend the President, he accused the Democratic Party who tried to shoot the President's photos of Nud.
The Deputy Deputy Director of the Democratic Intelligence Committee proposed the committee of the judicial election of the President Jou Viden and his son's internal prosecution.
The senator said that the Ukrainian suspicion was made by the left and its "grote show", and the Democratic Party was accused of seeing all the pictures of the President.
"The Democratic Party of this Special Committee has already been negotiated with people who are considered ukraines for the purpose of entering the Nud Photos of the Tramp. "
Why would the Democratic Party have the opportunity in a year to shoot this president, and all of them will be asking.
Once Senator Nunes ended, the chairman of Hafpost, Genephar Benderly, was able to find out whether the democratic democracy is trying to search for reality.
Only Senator Jim Hams, the Democratic Democratic Party of the Connetchat State, is questioned if the answer of the democracy for many other partys is a red reality.
Medicine Dotcom estimates that the comments of Senator Nudist are more than "inconfirmed details" that are written in a debated style document.
This is a shock report of an ex-English department Christopher Steel, which has collected an enthusiasming provision against the trumpet, mentioned in one of the hotel rooms in Moscow, which shows the transmissions of the prostitutes, and the existence is shown in the "Foood Battery Band".

Orrigami and Orrigami Network partners have an effective use of data-based data, such as sales-based data and non-structured society, and their data recording, processing, and analysis, and their effective uses.
In Origami Technologies, as well as Pay's decided data, the structuralized data of the company, supports and analyzes of non-structuring data.
Effective data uses and contributes to the promotion of new business models using digital technology and data (Digital Transformation).
Origami, Director of Representatives, says: "There is the key how many companies are assembling a lot of data to create customers in the next feast."
"I want to create data on the Origami Network and to create a feast's innovation with a number of company's data."
More details of the specific service content will be announced.
Otherwise, in Origami Conference in 2019, Origami provides useful technologies, such as raining, such as raining, to bring Kupon to Smaho.
In addition, it is still doing full payment on the Origami Pay, but it is cleared as a system as a standard of use.
He also urged them to work as support in cooperation with the Tourism Association.

The possibility of gas decreasing with reproducible bio fuel research.
In recent years, electric vehicles, tesla trucks, and semi are free of news, the only thing that flys, the only one that can not get to the power that can be renewed is a plane.
However, Professor Alberta's University has developed technology that can be used as jet fuel.
Professor David Bressler, Alberta Agricultural Environment Science Department, started this project in 2003.
Professor's laboratory develops carbon fuel from oil feed from the restaurant, vegetable rhindaling and canna oil.
This technology is different from Ethanol and other biocarbons, used low-quality oil fat for production, and carbon distillation can be used by other industries in the process of production by less than 85% of the oil-based fuel.
This technology will re-establish carbon hydrocarbons that exists in oil-based fuel.
Dr. Bressler said, "In the first generation, this technology has been achieved (hereinafter generation) is a carbon hydrocarbon of the disesel gas molecules."
The new choice of biocarbon use is that the low and unstabilized bio-based biotechnology has a serious problem in the aircraft movement of high levels.
Dr. Bressler said, "It's a jet fuel problem like a dilemma.
I don't know what's like, but there's a higher conditions.
Dr. Bressler's laboratory is now looking at two options as Jet Bio combustible.
First, it is necessary for low-risk approach, to process differently in carbon biocarbons and to add hydrogen.
The second option is to continue to investigate chemical reactions to maintain the stability of fuel.
Dr. Bressler said, "I can also try with a atomic reactor to change the second option."
This option is a high risk.
As the airlines, Canadian and the United States armies increase the investment in the options that can be renewed, the child Forge Hydrocarbons at the University of Alberta is working to produce.
He said, "They are predicting that anybody will put carbon taxes in the future."
I want you to prepare your appointment in the worst case.
Today, the Forge has worked in the test factory near the Edmonton Resider Center, which has recently provided $2,5 million to build up a $4 million from Rockyd Martin in Ontario.
The factory is planning to produce about 19 million litres of bio fuel each year.
Dr. Bressler believes that carbon recursion is 85%, but it is reasonable to reduce the levels of fuel transport and production.
"I'm a technician," Mr. Bressler says.
My job is to make the options that you can do with decisions on the explanation.

In India, the flow of the monsons and the slaughter in many regions.
The Monson Season in India has been a long-term swimming month, and the buildings are destroyed by unexpected rain quantity, and the deaths occur, and many of the creatures began to be corrupted.
Normally, Monsone in the north of India has weakened strength at the start of September, but this month's average rain size is up to 37 percent.
According to the Indian Mediterranean experts, if the situation continues a few days later, the most late period of the past decades of Monsone will be slow.
In many regions of India, rain is still unexpected, and in recent information, in Pnee in the Western India, the buildings died in Thursday and Thursday, and the number of people died.
The houses are invaded, the people cross the waterways, and they are normally seeing only the most wide range of monsones.
In other cities such as Corcata, Raknaw and Hydelabad, there were rains.
In the northern Uttarra Cand, there are large damages to the houses in the long-term rain.
Monsson's coming too late.
In many regions, the farmers had a deficiency of water.
I don't like Monson's long-term for farmers.
It's not normal in this time.

At the horizon, the three recently Rig wars were shocked "5 points, but the overseer 45" said: "The players have powerful and showed us a battle practice."
The past was home 8 July, the club Warst smokeed the eight-spots of the game, and the 5-hour of the enemies.
Now it's an enemy in two.
The three sides on the fourth shirt now are proud of 48 points in the Rig's position.
"Third point FW Marcosjonior (26) is waiting for a slightly FW-flighter of the 7th Aasist, 27, and a japanese representative, 24th, and a swimming CB-combine of the bands of the brazilian Fdziago Martins (24).
The overseer said, "Attachmental playing is enriched, and there's a speed CB, and he wants to protect compacts and fight with self-respect."
The Chief's first winner was "8 days, J2, and the rest of the League War Section 8.
He said, "I've lost my regret, and the most important thing to get up from there is now."
I'll show you the results that I've planned in the pitch.
-Yes.
And that's what we're going to do with a lot of farmers, and we're going to make the risk of cardiac diseases and heart attacks.
The latest research shows that the risk of cardiac disease can be higher when we work around high levels of farmery.
This is the result of the investigation of the Japanese American Krup in Hawaii for over 30 years.
In comparison with a man group that did not work around the farmer, researchers found that the risk of heart diseases and heart attacks is 45 per cent higher.
"In this study, it is important that, when you are exposed to farming, you can use personal protection tools, write therapy of farming exposure and reduce the standard risk of heart diseases," says Dr. Beatrice Rodriguez.
Dr. Rodriguez is a professor of older physicians at the University of Hawaii (Manoa).
This is the result of investigating the data taken from more than 6,000 men in Oaf, who participated in the Kuaquini Honoral heart program.
The researchers say that this study is only in Japan, so it may not be possible to apply to women or other races.
The farmer has been long-term, and the effects on health are possible for many years after exposure.
In this study, the greatest impact in the exhibition of "0 years."
"The results of 34 years of survey, the exhibition of farm products in the work, the relationship with heart diseases and heart attacks are not very important." Dr. Rodriguez reported in the report.
This may be because other factors related to ageing have increased the importance, and the relationships in farming and heart diseases in the night are hidden.
Scientists found that the exposure to low and medium-sized farmer diseases and heart diseases are not significantly related to heart attacks.
I'm going to get into Polochenko at the Zelensky Lamp phone meeting.
The president Donald Trump in the United States was a huge week on Washington's political issues.
For the political primary Volodimir Zellenski, he wanted to avoid being drunken into political scandal.
But what do you know about the Zellenski phone lamp problem, and how can Zellenski affect the wide range?
At the beginning of the telephone conversation, the trumpet speaks to Zelenski that the U.S. is more than the other European countries.
In detail, the communication records from the White House are not language, and the transp had criticized the talk of the Prime Minister Angela Melkell and the other European headquarters.
Zerenski's responses to 100 per cent of the trumpet is being reacted to the controversial.
Zelenski added that the President of McKlon and Melkell did not have enough support for Ukraine.
It was touched by the conversation, and the politicalists, especially the Ukrainian festivities, discussed in social media.
Peter Polochenko wrote that President Ukraina did not have a previous example on Twitter.
In other words, Pološenko tweeted the support of Russian invasion and economic assistance in the EU.
Other political politicians in Ukraine, Victoria Vaticaka, are able to negotiate again with Germany and France, and some other politicians express concerns.
The following trumpet is to strike military assistance, to fight Zerenski, and to two investigations, the first towards the winner of the Jo Byden son, and the second to show that Ukraine had involved in an unfair invasion of the Democratic Democratic Democratics during the election of 2015.
This is untransparent to hinder the European relations or put the backwater to the French and German brain.
I don't want to say anybody's bad.
"Zerrensky's General Assembly in New York has been thankful to those who have been announced and supported."
Zerenski is planned to meet the Russian, Germany and French headquarters in the Norwegian 4 Samits planned in October.
Ghana, get two prizes for the International Aviation.
At the 40th International Civil Aviation Meeting in Canadian Montreal, Ghana gained two prizes.

On the other hand, the ICAO was finished by the World Security Report of the United Nations Aviation Organization on 3 April 2019.
The results of the security premiums accepted that Ghana holds the principles and arrangements recommended by ICAO on security at airports and in its own states.
These prices were created by a part of the country's Zero Campanion support.
Furthermore, "6 certificates for security and 7 certificates were granted to the ICAO countries who have improved security standards.
The premium was Joseph Cofi Adana, Minister of Aviation, Simon Aloty, Director of Inter-Aviation of Ghana, Nii Ikoi Ottou, Canadian Ambassadeganna, Yau Kwawawaa Aeroport Campaña.
In the presentation, the President of the International Civil Aviation Organization, Olmuiwa Benad Alive, stressed the need for air security in the country participating.
The President said, "In this innovation era, the air security and security and sustainability are still the fundamental priority. "
In addition, Mr. Ada said that the rewards are the unfortunate effort and perseverance of the sector, which is the gift of Ghana's efforts.
He also said: "Aviation is often likely to change our lives dramatically", and the air industry has a great future to develop national economy.
There are social benefits, but all of them are safe and security that we have achieved.

Washington, white House announced that President Donald Trump sent Peter Gano to the Federal Emergency Office on Thursday.
Mr. Gano, Vice-President of the FEMA, was at the position of the headquarters of the government's disasters, such as the holcans and the mountain fires.
His office was inconsistent since March since Mr. Block Long's departure was denied by the Senator.
The Department of National Security of the FEMA decided that Mr. Long had been incompatible with government cars between Washington and his home Carolina.
Another recommended by Jeffrey Viard was shocked with doubts of drinking and slaughtering by the results of the investigation, and the end of the discussion was deleted from the beginning of this month.
Mr. Gano's head office was expected.
It will require approval by the majority of the Senate.
Before I was employed to the FEMA Vice-President in 2018, Mr. Gano was at the emergency administration in Road Island, and there was a marine soldier, said White House.
CBS Los Angeles, the police closed the illegal marijuana Bayping company of San Gabriel Valle.
The police closed the illegal marijuana Bayping activities of San Gabriel Bale on Thursday.
After the police's investigation order in charge of the illegal marijuana Bapt sale, at 4 p.m.37 p.m., there was found a large piece of Btanhney Oil in the 900 bridges in Telster Street.
Inspector Christopher Cano of the Police of Elmont said that the investigators found materials that strike up Bay Cartridges.
"This process is very dangerous," said Lieutenant Cano.
Lieutenant Cano had previously been involved in the drug investigation and said that there is a possibility of fuel in the process to extract oil used for baby products.
"The only electricity from clothes is possible, and it causes explosion not to fire, but to shoot."
Moreover, if there were several instruments such as the explosions and the fires, all the buildings could be shocked.
The Risk Training team was collected into a free office, imprisoned illegally dangerous materials.
The prices of the materials and materials were not soon published.
A anonymous information was received, and the investigator said that it had encountered illegal activity to the orders of the local investigation.
The investigators are still looking for who the illegal babies activities are.
The police said that the office was locked, and the chief thought that he had a shop in the office.
When the investigation continues, the police said that the recent news that is involved in the risk of Bayping would not go back to the illegal babyping products.
Senator Cano said, "It's the real or real ones who have purchased without knowing."
The product may be mixed with other harmful substances.
It may cause a great damage to our communities and children, so the police always warns people to not approach such activities.

Refugee training at the palace Hall.
It was estimated that the earthquake occurred in the end of the consorts, and there was a real type of evacuation training in the hall of the palace.
This training has been undertaken every year.
In the stage, it's the idea of the playing by the Municipal Defence Corporation, and in the course of the song, there will be six tremendous earthquakes.

Elizabeth's lost clothes at the Humpton Coat palace.
It was sweet with the greatest sleeves of Camlet silk, with plants, beasts, and snakes.
Historical Royal Palestine's clothing-collector, Ellie Lin stated that it was a point.
This shooting smell of a small church wall that Lin's seeing was placed there for 100 years and is part of the slaughtered clothes from the Ocean Dance of Elizabeth.
Elizabeth's lost clothes will be shown near the House of Hampton Cout in the next month, as a result of this magnificent garden of the church in Baxton in Helefordshire for more than 450 years.
"There's only one other clothing in the sixth century, and it's the important foundation in the whole Royalace collection.
There was no perfect evidence that Elizabeth was through the clothes, and three years of research, the experts convinced that the clothing was not related to the king's ownership.
Instead, the grain used by the "grain grain" was prepared only in the king rooms, but also indicates that the owner was a high-quality person.
The clothing is estimated to be the price of the Tutor House at the time it was made.
Moreover, at the end of the 1590s, it is estimated that the Queen would have been more threatened to the other women of the palace, as well as the Rivale would have suffered for such pleasant clothes.
Mr. Lin is important to publish him, and he came to see his colleagues.
"There's a shock," he said, "It's all seeing the wheel, and it's always very glad to see one of the Royalレス. "
One of the long secondary clothings that were used as a sanctuary of the Holy Feast of Baxton, unexpectedly, seemed unexpected, but not so much.
Baxton is reported in the village of Bransh Parry, who served as women during the long-term life of the Queen Elisabeth, that the legs are related to Paris for a long time.
The clothing was more than 1590 years after Paris died, but the experts believed that Elizabeth was a family of Paris or church slaughter before he died in 1603.
More than 1,000 hours of reconstruction, the high-speaked high-speaked high-speaked samples, using a special Silk and a slightly surgery surgery, are planned to be displayed next to one of the most popular pictures offered from the Hatfield House during the show.
A large space that is only renovated in the Humpton Cout area, which is mostly done here and leading to work, Libby Thompson, is really respectful to the historic workers who made it.
When you look at the table and the back, you see a very great respect for the one who made it.
I've never seen this sweet work.
Elisabeth's lost clothing will be held from October 12 in the Humpton Coat palace.
"The area of the customers' searched for women's disappearing weeks, the guards have lost the volunteers and the men of volunteers.

MAX HOWE WORKS THE MUSE AMSHANGHAI
It's not the most popular characters and sweethearts.
Somebody has a LINE stamp or a keyホlder?
He's assembling the topic since she's opened to the beach and the kitchen.
On October 2019, by January 20, 2020, it was opened to China and South Sea.
The SHANGHAI meeting is a larger range of 703 m.
The contents are like the country's museums, and the large-scale-scale of the large-scale bowlcano flows from the large-scale, and the "unstagenik area" of the "unstageenian area" which can know the wheels of the world, "unterligence Area" in four areas of the Antarctica Area.
Some who have ever seen this good thing, "Why do you think it's like a musical sweetie?"
Look, touch, play, play, and play, and we're going to join the world?

The biggest truck Giga, the newest model to the world first...
In Tokyo Motorshow 2019, a number of cars will initialize the world's world's world's most new models "Gigga".
The flag switch model of several trucks, Giga, is added to the new advanced security devices, has newly slowed the driver's reducing equipment.
The drivers and bicycles are also identified by the Preclash Blakes, the brain-spot monitors supporting the invasion of the left shuttle accidents and the switch-spot monitors and the switch-speed LeD-head lamps.
It also contributes to the reducing of the driver's driving drivers through all the cars that follow the train cars and the new high-leaf cable.
In addition, the MIMAMORI system also extends the vehicles and transport systems.
Safety devices also monitor newly, supporting safety work.
In addition, the future fluid network was expressed as a show model "FL-IR" for World Premier.
FL-IR looks at the similarity with super-sound conversations, acting practices, and connectides, and strikes.
Ecsteria takes a biodesign with an effective mochif image of a robot, which is a style of shadow in front of an organic shape cable and a slippering air device that covers its circle.
The intellectual is using the design of the desktop to change manually and automatic driving modes.
The tables are placed in the center and have comfortable operations and housing.
Similarly, the world's initially released, the next generation's small-scale driver ElfEV Walksruban.
Of course, the Zeroemissions and low-speed sounds, and because of the EV, they are able to integrate the wheel structures that have been achieved, to ensure the effectiveness of the driver's working environment and collective work.
The driver's driving is driving the rotating sheet, supporting the movement in the driver's car.
And in the security area, the electronic miller systems, and the 3D sugar multivisions that can be checked around the whole car.
In other words, the first hybrid bus, Elgaduo, and a large improved small truck, Elf, and the dizel4JZ1 engines, which have implemented both costs and burn.
In addition, the work support "PREISM" and " natural gas vehicles" will be presented in videos and exhibits.
In family spaces, you will prepare a lot of tracks that can be used in videos and photo boots that can be displayed by track drivers.
I'm going to get the universe base.
It's an international spatial station, and it's the "8-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a
The robot's smuggling from the left down.
The International Space Station has succeeded in the catch of the 8th aircraft, and the JAXA workers, who are welcomed by JAXA.
"JAXA" a planet-in-children, which carries funds to the international space station of approximately 400 km high levels, "28 nights, 28 nights, near the station, and astronauts cast a robot shooting.
A complement was made up 25 days from the Zone Island Center in the Inc., which has gradually increased the height of JAXA in control of the JAXA space center.
Finally, flying in the same speed of the station, nearly 0.0 m.
It's a flow of 7-6 meter robot ass.
The supplier has some 5 to 3 tonnes.
After we got to the station, the aircraft's shipping loads.
A third of the United States's internal drugs in the Mexican drug headquarters.
The CBS news was shocking the drug traffic as a day in Chicago West Side.
Brian McNights, the DEA, clearly revealed what was done with the white-day rooms.
In Chicago last year, about 800 people died with excess of drugs.
McNite said that "9 percent" of drugs in Chicago were likely taken from Mexico.
DEA is noted at the Mexican Drug King named El Menchomeno Nemezio Servantez.
The Mexican park agent Matthew Donahudea said, "Mencho is the most priority of the US Federal Legislative Organization."
The currency called for El Mencho will be up to $1 million.
With the help of Donahu, a few decades of drug production in El Mencho.
The drug cartel of El Mencho, Harriso Nueva (CJNG) is involved in at least three of the drugs put into the United States in the land and the sea.
According to the Ministry of Justice, the same cartel has sold cocaine, methanephetamine and fetanical heroin.
El Mencho's head has $1 million.
Ironically, Mencho lived in California 30 years ago, but was arrested by drug drought and sent back to Mexico.
That's where I started a violent drug cartel.
There's a huge amount of weapons, a skilled rockball, a 50-radio gun.
Donahu said that he really owned his own special agents.
From six deaths of the Mexican military helicopters, the Helicopters of the Helicopters in the public punishment of this summer, El Mencho died without punishment.
In recent years, thousands of murders caused by drug cartels.
According to the Mexican government statistics, there are some 94 murders on one day.
In Chicago, Mexican drugs have strong toxicity, and they have to use defence clothes when they are treated.
On the point of production, the cocaine bottles are printed in a delicate salesman.
More than three minutes, El Mencho's drug cartel.
Donahu said, "Mencho is involved in the invasion of harmful materials that are slaughtered by women and children."
Donahu said that when a child died, the drugs from El Mencho's organization are high likely, and he said.
Last year, more than 67.000 Americans died from excessive abuse.
"At one year, the newspaper at Atteses, slowly swallowed to the UK in the great snake of the monastery, the coara and the grain of the snakes. "
The coara coala of the Great Paradise for the Prostitution of the Great Beasts, Ark'=28.
Those of the children who write to the "Ark" posting meeting of Coala=28.
On the 28th day, the Royal Beast's temple opened a meeting of the Coara Arch, the only hero that grows in the Lake.
In the meantime, "0 years of payment to the British Animal Garden for the Middle Sea for the Prostitution" has been decided to be returned.
Thank you, thank you.
About 600 guests gathered before the coal area of Yukara, where they lived.
Arc is two years old.
In 5 to 20 years, the life of the coala's inheritance is endeavoured to complete the lives in the United Kingdom that has entered.
He's not going to smile, but he's sweet with the "It's not going to smile to the coara's heritage.
Sonny, play Station 4 news, and PS4 games are in the past.
Sonny cleared the contents of two parts of the PS4 for sale.
As a part of the recent state of the playing news, Sonny announced the date of February 20, in the last series of Last of As.
A part of the shocking video of this new action game has been exposed to fans.
More details have been announced after a number of days of advertising of Rust of Ass.
Sonny and Northdog are likely to return to the old wind.
There's a lot of time since PSワン's time, Last Ob As part 2 is sold on several disks.
In the wonderful telegraph record, Neil Drackman, Nyr Drackman, announced that the main game has been evolving in one of the most important games.
"In other words, Storey is great and complicated," Drackman said.
And I thought that there was a lot of people like this to talk about Storey.
I didn't want to make the biggest game in the history, but I've been evolving there.
"The user has a moment to feel the end of this strike, but actually it's starting and seeing that all the other sections are starting."
The game was a two-speak disks, unlike one of the blue rays.
In other words, the two parts of Rust Ob As includes the east Egg through Gamespot.
I don't want to cut this surprise, but Ieter Eggs in the game have a sweet noticide link.
It's better to know if the two parts were sold at the limit of PS4 on February 21, 2020.
Those who have PS4 have a switch up the Last of As Rimasterd on the PS plate and have the next relief.
Sonny recently announced free PS4 games with the preceding noticidg works.
The MLBza Shaw19 is also sold in March for the members of PS Plastics.
Sonny has already published a number of versions of the popular analyzer of Ellie's backpack and Bresslet Repressa, including 12 cm Figure's versions.
The Council has tried to sell the movement of the Power Islands and the people will continue.
The ageing slowed, the 26-day swimming islands of Seven-stad, and the "African Islands" and the Council's movement began.
"In the test until February, the wagon car was shocked by daily products, food and food, and the first day rounded the Cities and the half-century meeting.
There's more rapidly complemented goods than expected, and there was a voice to continue to ask for the choice of things.
We've got 0 points, such as green, cities' sweats and washing.
As you can eat for your own life, the cut-off-salades, the sweet vegetables, which are divided into the pack, sweethearts, and the prices of the skin.
In the Middle City, there were groups of people and sales of salt and sugar.
The Congress has shown the surprising appearance that Mrs. Moore did not think it was possible to sell it.
He usually hoped that the tsunami of the tsunami in the city where he drives and purchases her husband's husband's driving and purchasing, "the prices are safe and profitable. I don't know how long the father can drive, and I want to continue. "
The user's order was made, "not coffee coffee, but he wants to smell coffee on himself."
The Council's going to consider what was needed.
Now, only a combini shop is on the Capital Island, and the Congress tried to move to save "a buyer weak" in the Congress.
"To February, the 20 cities meeting in the island can continue as business since the next year.
The Prime Minister Scott Morrison declared that he decided about $1 million additional support for the people who were affected.
The financial aid policy for farmers is extended, and the existing farmers will also be revised to the width of simplification.
Additional support is estimated to a population support institution that will receive more than $3,000 emergency assistance.
As a relief programme, the maximum of 13 self-related bodys will be assisted by over $1 million for infrastructure and slow-scale measures.
In addition to this support, the government has already funded more than $7 billion as a wide support.
Ronald Le Haskel: the murderer of his former wife in Texas
Ronald Le Haskel (39) was sentenced to kill four of the five children in Spring in Texas (2014).
Hasskel said that, on July 9, 2014, he entered the house of Stay, and asked the location of the wife of Merany Haskell.
Mr. Melanie was inconsistent, but my sister Kathy Stey had a family.
Hasskel was shot, Steven Stay (39), Katie Stay (33), 13, four-year-old sons, 9 and 7-year-old daughters, and the Harris police announced.
In the family, only one, a 15-year-old, Mr. Cassidy Stewart, was the only life.
At that time, the authorities reported to Mr. Cassidy that he was serious, but then he completely restored.
Thursday, all jury has denied an innocence by the loss of Lonald Le Haskell's heart.
The jury was dismissed for Monday until the date of Monday.
"If you choose to disappoint us, you never let us."
Have the complaint of a girl who triggered a voice been smiling to the country leaders?
The warming of the planet increases the seriousness.
At the United Nations Climate Atmosphere Samite in New York, "the six-year-old environmental activist Greta Tumberi, Sweden, has spent a project for enhancement.
It's a fire-in-law in the world, such as boicot and sit in front of the Congress, and it's been a fire-in-law that spreads the school strikes around the world.
Young people who were struggling with anxiety were protesting worldwide, including Japan.
They've been able to join about 4 million people in more than 50 countries.
I'm going to go through a message table.
The threats of climate change are close to you.
Paris's International Framework, which begins in 2020, is the goal to reduce the temperature from the industrial revolution of 5 degrees in the past half of the century.
Evolving countries, without distinction of developing countries, will take action towards each country participating.
However, the adverse climate, such as high temperatures, rainy, is in every area.
The warming of the fast peak is required to be intensified.
A Samit, which has been achieved by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to enhance the crisis, expresses the goal of 77 countries to be real Zero for 50 years.
The other 70 countries tried to get the target.
On the other hand, the United States who dismissed from the Paris Convention, China and India were unexpected to a new goal, and the smooth movement of the U.S. was formed.
It's a deep criticism to Japan's book that has firmly enhanced carbon energy.
The government's long-term strategy has a short-term emission of zeros in the past half of this century, but it's a larger distance between countries with 50-year-old countries.
I don't have a chance to speak Japanese in Samite.
The Small Environment Minister, who expressed the Japanese environmental developments in the Environment Association, said, "Thank, cool, sexy should be played".
The apple's not denied, but it's too poor than the complaints of the girls.
I'm not going to oppose Mr. Greta now as a symptom of environmental movement.
There will be no illness to the "change of the point of view".
Instead of the warming measures, international society must respond to the common crisis.
I don't want to have enough efficiency for every country's efforts.
There are many young people behind Mr. Greta.
There's a grown man to do so that you don't take the future.
It's a step to the quantitative internet reality.
The results of the United States military were close to the achievement of quantitative internet.
In this Internet, it may allow the security, measurement, and time functions that could not be possible in a traditional network.
According to the Center for Military Exploitation Center of the United States Military Force Development Center, researchers in the University of Insbruck have reached the record of the materials and angle-englobal transport – 50 miles (50 km) using light fiber cable.
The entailment is an interaction that is generated in the quantitative realities, such as quantitative bits.
If two quantitative bits are in angle state, and the measurement is taken on one side, the other quantitative bits are physically far away, and the other measurement results in the measurement.
"This distance [50 km] is a real distance to start building a city-interface network, which has been more than the past." Dr. Ben Lannion, a physician of the Insbruck University, who has announced the success of the project, says.
The city's quantum network is a network between the physics of quantity bits, although large distances are in the angle state.
The researchers say that the distribution of this entail is absolutely essential for the achievement of the quantity of the Internet.
"This proof is a great step to achieve a broad-scale enhancement", says Dr. Sarah Gamble, the vice-president of the Military Programme, who supports the research.
The entailation of a fiber output also maintains sufficient quality to meet the number of conditions necessary for some of the most difficult quantity networks.
The research team started experimenting with the calcium atoms captured in Ion Trap.
The researchers use the laser light lines to write the quantitative status on the ion and encouraged them to release the quantitative information saved.
The result is that the quantity of the atom and the light particules have become an entangle state.
The challenge is to send the light on the light fiber cable.
"The wave of the calcium flows from the calcium ion is 854 nanometers, and the light fiber cable is soon slow."
And there's a doctor's team who first sent the light particules through a non-lineal cristal that lighted the strong laser.
The wave length of the light was converted to 1550 nanometers, the highest length of long distance transportation, the current distance communication standard.
And then I sent this light through the fiber cable of 50 kilometers long.
Measuring results, the atoms and light particules, although they moved long distances through converting wave lengths.
"Calsium atom used to catch the calcium with high quality "clock" quantitative quantity, so this experiment results can lead to the reality of an atomic network in the long-term clock.
The vast entangle clock network is a very important area for the militarys from a certain measurement, the law, and the measurement of the time. "
