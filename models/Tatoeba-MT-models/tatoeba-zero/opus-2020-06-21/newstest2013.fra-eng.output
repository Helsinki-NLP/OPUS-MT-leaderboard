A Republican strategy to combat Obama ' s selection
Republic leaders justified their policies because of the need to combat electoral fraud.
But the Brandan Center considers this as a myth, claiming that election fraud is rare in the United States than the number of people killed by the crowd.
In addition, the Republican lawyers noted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States for ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will be mine in part the American Democratic System.
In contrast to Canada, the United States are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
In this sense, a majority of American governments promulgated from 2009 of new laws which make it more difficult for the registration or vote process.
This phenomenon has taken its extent after the elections of November 2010, which was added to 675 new representatives of the Republic in 26 States.
Consequently, 180 draft legislation restricting the exercise of the vote law in 41 States were introduced during the only year 2011.
The new election laws require the elections to present an identity card with photo and evidence of American citizenship.
Furthermore, these laws reduce the periods of vote by advance, invalid the right to register as a elector on the day of the election and to retire the citizens with their right to vote.
Before the elections of 2006, no US States requested elections to submit a photo identification card.
Indiana was the first State to make such a requirement.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirms in 2008 the Constitutionality of the Indian Law.
The Republican authorities pressed to extend this practice to other States.
In the past two years, they were able to provide legislative projects in 34 States to force elections to present a photo identification card.
It is important to note that, in contrast with Quebec, American citizens do not have universal identity cards such as the ill-assurance card.
In fact, 11 per cent of American citizens, 21 million people age to vote, do not have identity cards with photos issued by a government agency of their State.
In addition, five million new electors in 2012 do not have such identity.
However, it costs more than hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card.
New restrictions affect young people, minorities and low income disproportionately.
Indeed, 25 per cent of Africans, 15 per cent of people win less than $35,000; 18 per cent of people over 65 years and 20 per cent of electorals from 18 to 29 years do not have the required identity card with photo.
Awesome.
Students, electorals consider more voters for democratic candidates, are not allowed in several States to use their identity card with photo issued by their institutions.
In contrast, these States authorize the members of the fishing and chase clubs that vote more from the Republican side to use to vote on the cards issued by these clubs.
Before 2004, no State had required evidence of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to submit such a requirement.
Since 2011, twelve States have adopted laws that require elections to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Spanish vote.
However, he learns that two Spanish electors in three favour the Democratic Party.
Furthermore, the Republican legislators discussed in 2011 the laws entitled to the registration of elections on the day of the election in eight States.
Moreover, they have limited the right of persons and groups to provide assistance to elections wishing to be included.
These restrictions are not without prejudice.
For example, at the general election of 2004, election campaigns contributed to registering about 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced 17 per cent of the registration rate of new elections in 2010 by 2006.
Furthermore, the Republican legislators adopted laws in five other States to reduce the preceding vote period.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33 per cent of the elections voted in advance were Africans, while these were only 13 per cent of the electors of the State.
He went along with the Spanishs.
They represented only 11 per cent of the elections, but 24 per cent of citizens voted in advance.
On the contrary, 76 per cent of the electors represented only 46 per cent of the elections voted in advance.
The Democratic legislators and their supporters, of course, opposed the adoption of legislation restricting the registration of elections.
several legislative projects have been blocked by the veto of democratic governments.
The United States Advocate General is in place to suspend the most controversial laws.
They could be limited in part.
For example, only 16 of 34 States have adopted laws for the presentation of a photographic identity card.
Nevertheless, the new rules implemented will, indeed, make more difficult the exercise of the vote law in 2012.
Democratic critics denote the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted, and they see a clear goal to influence the results in 2012 in key States.
A report from the Brandan Centre of 2011 shows that States that have adopted these laws are 171 of the 270 votes required to the election colleague for the return of the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with sure that these legislative amendments at the electoral system will have significant impact on the result of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will be mine in part the American Democratic System.
Prostate cancer detection: pass the test or not?
Indeed, the APS test would sometimes present wrong results, with false negative results or even positive false, resulting in unnecessary medical interventions.
What to make more hesitation of men already reiterate to pass tests of detection.
Pass the test or not?
We asked two specialists.
In the United States studies, there were much contamination among witness groups, therefore it is difficult to interpret these data and have strong recommendations.
Another study, in the European, concluded a difference in mortality between patients who have discovered and those who haven't had.
This study also showed, with a follow-up after 12 years, that between 30 and 40% of the chances of having metals if it is not determined.
I therefore recommend the test from 50 years of age, or from 40 years of age if you have a direct parent who already had a prostate cancer.
Afro-American men are also more risked.
The key is to take the right decision once you have detected a cancer.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent.
The patient must really understand the risk level of cancer by offering the possible options, not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not lead to long-term life, and instead, in such cases, to be actively monitored for disease.
Today, many men who are detected cancer will not be treated, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
They will suggest to be monitored actively and if the disease is progressed, they will provide treatment.
Furthermore, criteria for decision which should or should not be treated are determined with specificity.
So I recommend even to pass the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with his doctor to determine whether we should pass it or not.
In collaboration with the International Urology Society, Movember created a tool that allows to evaluate the for and against the APS test.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately there is no wonderful receipt to prevent cancer.
Despite research progress, the adoption of good live habits remains the best way to reduce the risks of suffering.
It is estimated that if everyone eat well and moved sufficiently, 30% of cancer could be prevented.
"If nobody smokes, this rate would be at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, the parliamentary port of the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the contrary, approximately 10% of cancers are caused by heritage.
Many remain totally unexplied.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the reduction in the number of smokers.
Cigarette is linked to 85% of the powder cancer cases.
It also represents a risk factor for several other.
This night is greatly about people's health.
"Another day, there are 1,5 million smokers in Quebec," lamented André Beaulieu.
Encouraging donation: 10 years after smoking, the risk of death of cancer falls from half.
Weight
Abbonpoint and obesity also promote the appearance of disease, according to the CCSC.
They would increase the risks of cancer of inch, collon and rectum, oesophage, pancreas and uterius.
"The research shows that the regular practice of physical activity during the whole life protects coal cancer," adds.
Food
The body also recommends to limit its consumption of red meat.
In too large quantity, it strokes the risks to be reached by a colorctal cancer.
The characters also, and they should be avoided.
The maintenance of the flesh by smoking, seating or salary may lead to training carcinogenic substances.
"The last may damage organ cells and lead to cancer development," it explains.
Vitamines
In recent years, several scientists studied the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not concluded for now.
Vitamine E studies are contradictory, according to the CCS.
While one of them observed a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly established.
Furthermore, Mr. Beaulieu stressed the importance of talking about his concerns and his families with his doctor.
"As a test of detection, it doesn't give cancer."
Higgs' Boss decorated
The advertising of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson has created a total emotion, the last summer, and for cause.
It is actually believed that this boss is involved in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Univers, nothing else.
And then it is the last part of which the existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "that worse" explanation of the nature and behaviour of the material - but that has not yet been observed empirely.
But for physicians, it's not yet completely sure that Higgs is good.
We know, without the shadow of doubt, that we have a true new particule, and that it seems very like Higgs' boson predicted by the Standard Model.
Furthermore, new data dismissed this week at a large physics conference in Kyoto seem to be confirmed, but there is still lack of data to be perfectly certain.
We also suggest that it's good about Higgs, because the chances of misleading seem to be mine, and let's see what's happening.
There is, in this world, a factly unconscious law that wants two things not to be found at the same place at the same time.
It's not the way to break this rule - and don't try too strong, you're going to make you bad.
But even if the physics of particules is a strange world, it also seems to have a law of such kind: Pauli's principle of exclusion, which states that two particules cannot take the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantial status" - this "status" consisting of a great way in some of their characteristics.
From there, physicians classify the particules in two categories.
In a round, there are good citizens called clomions, who are wisely obedient to the principle of Pauli.
And in the other way, the bosons, a salt band of anarchists who have no respect for nothing - in any case, not for this principle, what means that they can be nice and well found at the same place, at the same time.
These bosons are then divided in two groups, according to the site (except extraordinary, otherwise) The Particle Adventure, the Berkeley Laboratorys: the bads that we do not discuss here, and the "power parts" by which the great forces of nature are promising and the higgs' boson would appear in some way.
These bosons, we need to stress him here, not all of them are so exotic animals that we could believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronic, it's thanks to an extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "light part" that is the "messenger" of the electrical force.
When, in fact, a particule with an accelerative electric load or direction change, it "depends" on the electrical field in this specific place, a little like a lock launched in an etang.
This "delimitation" generates an electrical place (of the light, or the red infrastructure, or ultraviolet, etc.) and this where nothing is other than a photon - and therefore, one of the "fighting ports".
More Stables Champion
It's the same thing with the Higgs' boson, so close to this difference that it's another field, the Higgs field, which must be "delimited" so that this boss appears.
But, this Higgs field is much more stable than the electricity field; to exciting it, it must be reached very, very high energy, a little like it was a gentle edge whose only a very large rock could ride the surface.
That's why we need a large switch of particules like the CERN - the Grand Hadron Collider is a 27 km circumference ring! - to reach such energy.
The analysis with the electrical field is again useful to explain the relationship between Higgs and Mass.
It is not in fact all parts, nor all materials, which interact with the electrical field.
Some, like lovers, do it, but others don't - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold himself on a cold.
And in the same way, it is not all the particules that interact with the Higgs field: those that do it have a mass, while the other (such as photon, tens) do not have it.
Now, what's "to bring" all these research, Mrs. Plamondon?
For science, this makes it possible to verify the validity of the standard model (MS) and it also allows physicians to check all differences between MS observations and predictions.
They are also several to desire strictly that we find it, because the less difference could open a door on a "new physical" and move some troops of the model.
This, it is necessary to say, has still huge carences, proposing no explanation for gravity (oops!) or the dark material, which forms about 80% of the material of the Universe (re-oups!).
But there were no such distances in the CERN until now.
Impacts
The impact of these researchs in the daily Mrs. and Madam All-Mondo, they are, more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to predict that there will be no one.
Hold on: At the beginning of the 1960s, the Laser pioneers, in the Bell Labs, did not suspect the revolution that their work would be delaying.
They were interviewing scientific applications, but nothing of the rest.
In fact, we already said the physician Willard Boyle, who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself put the first continued laser (the first was pulled) in 1962, the laser was seen instead as a "gadget of labo".
Imagine...
And then, applications can also come from all the instrumentation that runs to search.
For example, the same Willard Boyle set a small light captor in 1969 during its optical work.
This captor, although it wasn't all its original intention, now serves "ooil" to all digital photo devices in the world, and he evaluated the Nobel of Physical 2009.
This doesn't really mean that LHC's activities will necessarily transform our lives, but this means that we never know...
Palliative care - The best way to die...
With its Commission to die in dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate must be renewed when a draft legislation is prepared.
But in this essential area, many remain to do.
Dever tried to look closer to it.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still alone in his apartment in Monteregie.
The prostate cancer that would cut him had left him a two-year-old replica.
"They gave me five years to live, I did seven years," he said, mid-rabbin, longed in his bed at the house of palliative care, Victor-Gadbois, Beloeil, where it happened.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for that," he said.
Sickness makes its work: a huge weakness that prevents her to become alone at the toilets, and even to eat alone.
Attracted before a dinner, he agreed to allow himself to eat, resigned.
The courageous one is even smiling, talking to the unknown who are around him, bringing his medicines to him, offering a bathroom.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest desire is that we cure me of diarrey, it is humility," he trusts.
A few hours later, the team found a cure to this bad.
"In our life, a man is learned that it slowly, " says Peter Brodeur, psychologist at the house Victor-Gadbois.
Putting the child’s stage, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
" This depends on the ability of the person to accept the punishment, it finds that.
Because, in the opinion of several people who act in palliative care, there are great moments in the heart of this punishment.
Patients who are in the palliative care house Victor-Gadbois suffer all of cancer.
They have a maximum life pronotic of three months.
At this stage, " physicians and nurse teams who are around no longer cares " curative " .
For Ms. A., 89 years of age, the worst fear is to die " conscious and stumbled " .
But illness made me discover my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I have no more desires in life," she says, before accepting that we put him a mask to help her breathe.
In the next days, she waits for the last visit of her son from Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, with a voluntary group, the care of the body and the food assistance are made.
It's palliative care, which is given when there's nothing else to do.
To make the death more comfortable.
In Québec, there is a palliative care bed for 11 700 people.
It's very little when we know that we all end by death a day.
Here, life continues in the best conditions possible, explains the Christian Martel, one of the doctors of the house.
It is at the level of physical, emotive or spiritual comfort.
In the death, it will be accepted to promulgate brandy or Pepsi, according to the request.
Diabetes will not be required to control their sugar rates.
And death is part of the daily life.
Last night, we served a bird at Mr. X, deceived during the night.
This morning, it's her son who will end the bird at the foot of the fire.
" We are helping closers as well as patients ", says Nathalie Savard, the Head of Training.
In the Victor-Gadbois house, the days follow, but they do not look like it.
At the side of a 93-year-old man who saved his last family assembly in the court, well calmed in his ears while a young man of 36-year-old died tragicly, around his parents, his wife and his two young children, after having all tried to survive.
"For six months, there are still three to five beds that are employed by cancers under 45 years of age," the Christian Martel Dr.
53% of patients who have been administered to the Victor-Gadbois house arrived from their home, 47% from the hospital.
Availability of palliative care
77% of Canadians have no simple access to palliative care, i.e. treatment designed to eliminate suffering when a sick sick reached at the terminal phase of his life, which is at home, hospital or in a hospital.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois house and the Great Montreal Paliliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in cancer care.
This is precisely the great deal in whatbecois health care that fears several specialized doctors in palliative care the adoption of a law engaged in euthanasie and suicide.
Since October, a manifest, signed of the sommities of palliative care, including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, is circle to witness their opposition to such an initiative.
According to the Christian Martel, the quantitative health system is not enough to ensure that everyone has the right to quality palliative care before it is accepted to process euthanase.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient passing 14 days at emergency, in great pain, without doing what is necessary for it.
I am afraid that patients do not want to die only because they do not receive adequate care.
And parallelly, several employees reach their patients until the last day, despite the worst pronotics.
Helen Richard's hope of survival was already minimum when she abandoned a testing chemotherapy.
When I announced to my grandmother that I stopped the treatment, she answered me that she regreted me to stop fighting, did she tell me.
However, she told me that I was finished!
None of all powerful cares
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the sick people who ask to die thank those who have not accessed their request after their suffering was undermined by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, the director of Palliative Care to the Grand Montreal Palliative Care Society, patients would be refractial for pain treatments in 8% of the cases.
At the end of the life, doctors have so often recurred to palliative seedation, which return to sleeping the patient until the time of his death, or in a sporadic way, or in a permanent manner.
There is no longer a similar way to not hear this part of suffering.
Furthermore, unsubjected disease will have the possibility of having this palliative sediation.
The diseases that are not understood always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But this doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to eat me ", that means "I want to be stressed ".
The implementation of this report was made possible by a newspaper board of Canada's Health Research Institutes.
Great Width Scanda in Quebec
It is a day after they know what they know of a forming "system", which is the building industry, officials, politicians, syndicalists and mafioso.
One " industry " which costs much for whatbecois contributions, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's curious as the system has been struck since we have taken great means", Ironians Jacques Duchesneau, deputy in Quebec and the former police leader of Montreal.
It was by him that the scandale was declared in 2011, by a fund investigation on the injury related to road work contracts in Quebec, where the first Liberal Minister of the era, Jean Charest, was only allowed to return.
Duchesneau report was a direct link between industry, oculte financing of parties and corruption of officials.
“At the beginning of the investigation in 2010, it stressed that the only transport department would have paid a billion dollars on contracts,” some replied their instincts to touch a quota!
The Charbonneau Commission has already dropped two bathrooms, and he adds, expecting that it can "demonise the strategy behind individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, also accompanied with its Government's army of checkers, investigators and analysts.
More police officers from the Marteau Scout since 2009, who had led to the Montreal's "evolution Cartel" to put the sweet pedale on contract smugglings...
In the past few weeks, she carried out in series of investigations and brought charges for fraud and corruption against municipal elections, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, master of a bathroom city.
The next list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who came to depart from his master position in Laval, the third city of Quebec.
It is suspicious that you have put up public contracts again.
They are formally accused of technicians at Montreal shipping and Italian origin entrepreneurs, including Tony Accurso and Lino Z area.
The latter felt that the Committee explained the mechanism of the "system" for the obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal with a mafia-related intermediary that turned money to the Montreal Union, the party of Master Generald Tremblay.
Mr. Zland settled all winds in the 2000s, providing more than 88,000 Canadian dollars ($68,000) to provincial parties, especially for the Liberals at the time of power.
He also agreed to have organized an illicit collection of funds for the former Liberal Prime Minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Exemptions contracts which the expenditure income costs
In Montreal, the "the system" of corruption worked around.
Gilles Surprenant, an ex-technician in public work, was well-detailed before the Commission: in ten years, he received giftal construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tours, restaurants, hockey matches and $736,000, in exchange of expenditure contracts.
Other officials of the ship have admitted that the pack had been burned by 30% to 40% of the factures, by extra false.
Then a master's organizer, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of having delibly closed their eyes on a parallel budget to feed his boxes with salt money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay was released early November, pushing Montreal into a major crisis.
Cantal Rouleau was one of the first elections of Montreal to throw the alarm sun.
Made of the Rivière-des-Prairies Arrival, on the east of the island, has purchased $5 million since 2010 against the sale of a municipal land purchased a total of $5 million and returned... 1,6 million to promotors, in full real estate boom.
70% money sold in election campaigns
The survey that will finally be established, she says "shoot on a fil to understand the operation of the system, infiltrated by torches, to stop gangrene and escape the faults".
The process, she says, is "awesome but positive".
We are being cleaning the plague but there would be a clean investigation unit in Montreal and a vel, not seeing back doubtful practices.
As we do the house.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes on his side that "the officials slaughtered hundreds of millions of dollars," but especially worried about the role of "elected to know the strategy" when they did not throw in the shooter!
When he estimated 70% of the money sold in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he said: "We said that it was only a piece of reflection of the reality."
The Government of Quebeco proposes to limit the donations to $100, but it will not change the woman, according to him: "As it will not be strictly limited to electoral expenditure, there will be money sold in policy."
He provides a complete review of the system of granting public and financing contracts: "We can't go low; go back to the background of things with courage, will make it possible to rebuild the house on stronger bases, with more controls and laws."
If this story comes to the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who haven't seen in their own court...
"The PSG is not the Barcelone FC!"
This season, you took a new invergence with the PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by individual conscience, but also by the new PSG dimension.
Great players arrived.
Every day, I'm progressing on their side.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
Every day, these elements enables me to embrace my level of game.
And, in match, it's easier.
Everything's going very fast in the foot.
But I don't fly.
From my beginning at the INF Preformation Centre to my passage to Saint-Ethan, I have always expanded by pairs.
So you will benefit from the competition installed by Carlo Anncelotti...
The recruitments of this year are used to discuss high-level matches.
They also know that each training is crucial.
What makes a player like me wants to face and provide the maximum.
Furthermore, Carlo Anzlotti brings me much about my positioning.
He's shooted by advisers like Claude Macelele, who played at the same position as me.
Is Annlotti the man of the situation?
Of course.
Anncelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, it is not equal to Ligue 1 and is part of the best European trainers.
He has a great experience and won a lot of titles with hupped clubs.
He cottoned great players.
I think he's going to bring other titles to Paris.
In January, I had a comfortable discussion with him.
I was out of a series of wounds.
The confidence he agrees to me also explains my performance.
What look do you take on the first part of the PSG season?
In Liga 1, Lyon took us the leadership place.
But we're still embuscated.
One of our major objectives is the Championship Link: we are qualified for the 8th end in the way.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We'll try to go so far.
Now, everything can happen.
But we will say to face very good European teams.
We first want to finish our first pool, before Porto, to be able to receive at the 8th final return.
Can the PSG become a large European club in short terms?
He already has the budget...
In order to become a large European club, Paris needs to report titles and to be registered in the period.
Today, that's not the case.
Financially, the PSG provides the means to achieve the project.
In Liga 1, do you not return the title, as the last season, wouldn't it be a big failure?
Of course, that would represent a great deception.
This year, we really have a heart to push this champion title.
The last season, we didn't pass away.
In May there was a deception because we had the quality to complete first.
We've done a very big season.
We've been finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we should be champion...
But another team, Montpellier, has performed an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think that's the good thing.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are in the battle for the title, I think we have weapons for it.
Do you think media are waiting too much from the PSG?
It's normal that we're waiting for many of us in view of what has been invested and players we have.
We totally accept it.
Then, when we win 4-0 homes against Troyes and find things to reprove us, it's sure that it's a little frustrating.
We ask what people expect more.
We can never win 4-0 all weekends.
We're not Barcelone's FC!
We're trying to set up a game project.
A team built with time.
It was tested in Liga of Championships that we could answer presents.
Look at Manchester City that hasn't arrived from two seasons to qualify for the 8th end, they also made great expenditure!
In view of the stages invested, we imagined you with 15 front points!
It was to shine our opposites and the French Championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well in the last season, were "bood" by this new PSG.
This shows that Liga 1 is passioning.
I hope that, in May, we will be able to smile to say that, despite all the difficulties, it has been finished by importing it.
The PSG seems to be entirely dependent on the operators of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
It's better that we say there's a "Zlatan dependance".
That means that Ibrahimovic is very effective and that it brings many goals.
He came for this and proves he's the star of the League 1.
He showed everywhere he was a great player, a world star.
In the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men he has around him.
What he did is really exceptional.
This emphasizes others to embrace their level of game.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders of the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How did you live the Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like a deceptive.
I had a heart to participate in this euro.
Unfortunately, my wound prevented me playing time.
I saw things there, and I've been strengthened.
Today, I am able to realize good games in selection.
That's what I hoped since my baptism with the Bleus.
We have learned about what happened in Ukraine and today we have to have an exemplary behavior.
What look do you take on the first months of Didier Deschanmps at the head of the Blues?
He has the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualified group for the Worldwide.
The selectioner is strict, near the players, and inspires the win.
Like it was Laurent White.
But I don't want to compare.
White had reached its goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschanmps will lead the Bleus to Brazil.
The good null (1-1) slaughtered on 16 October in Spain is a founder match?
This match gave us confidence.
Everyone fighted for everybody.
Before this shock in Spain, I never lived like a match in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
The contrary to current monetary exchanges based on central banks, identification of transactions and treatment costs among the stakeholders.
Furthermore, as often in these technologies, a political vision is pumpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, bank monopolies, leads to financial crisis.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (Pseudonyme), is both a virtual currency (not convertible in dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol in BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of pairs of files.
About 200 000 transactions have already been registered by 150,000 computers on the network.
A small thousand web sites accept bitcoins as gifts or as payment means.
Bitcoin rate, after reaching a sum of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, falls to $2,5 months later, before returning today around a decade of dollars (in the Bitcoincharts.com site).
Nothing very impressive, compared to global exchanges in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the most successful success", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "conventional currencies".
Bitcoin distinguishes other types of virtual currencies like "credits" used to progress in a video game that is winned by playing or buying it (and sometimes exchangeing back).
The Facebook social network has also developed such a system.
But each time, a central authority controls and treats exchanges.
With Bitcoin, all the network nodes are both deposittive of the account book, checkers, monetary issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two electronic addresses in a way of e-mail.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, ensureing the anonymate so.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double key encryption system.
The network can thus check the authenticity of the transaction.
Through the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the changed bits exist well in the public account book distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It is through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to the computers, and which the winner, as an interim central banker, will be the privilege to add this additional line.
This is a file hachage phase, i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique digital press.
Computers "accepte" the new transaction and add a number before "having" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that gives a special print (more of zeros at the beginning).
Once that number has been found, the other nodes are clearly checking that it's the good.
The transaction is then undestructively linked to the line of all other transactions; any change would change the press.
If one user wanted to pay twice with the same very fast money (minutes ten minutes), one of the two transactions would be valided by the network - the other remaining orpheline because both have different impressions.
The computer resolved the challenge is 50 bits.
To avoid inflation, this reward is regularly divided by two, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bits in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divided up to 100 million, which leaves the margin...
The challenge is also highlighted at each increase in the calculation power.
The life of the network has already been high and low.
Web sites provided for Bitcoin services have been attacked and shooted bitcoins.
"It does not apply the protocol itself," says Peter Noizat, who comes to launch Paymium, a pay company in real currency using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also provides opportunities for money whiteing through this anonymous service.
But the cash also has this default.
Weight actors like Wikipedia reject the gifts of this nature.
Others, such as the WordPress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the account book and showed that about 80% of the bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, "good soldiers" were launched.
"twenty thousand dollars have been changed." Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, was converted to gold bitcoins.
Peter Noizat, also author of a pedagogic book on this currency, believed the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which becomes less costly.
The carrier has more identity and may therefore be an anonymous.
The system is easy to implement in goods, which do not need to install new terminals or software.
They are sufficient to communicate a address that a phone can "fotograph and recognise" specifically Peter Noizat, which ensures that thousands of users have.
There is a general movement for heerarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"Bitcoin will have time to impose, but 2013 may be a tournant," he predicted.
The ECB, in its report, also intends to revis the different risks, currently considered high, in case of success of this currency.
We went from Afghan.
And after?
The French troops left their responsibility zone in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
The State and the Americans should follow the end of 2014.
It is time that the Afghan army returns to its territory and the Afghans choose their future, without waiting for us.
These are especially the Afghan countries we have punished them as terrorists.
And we himself, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the blessed, the mutilated.
Taliban is composed of foreign extremists, former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often countries who reject the foreign army presence, as soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, elderly and archaics, even if they have been joined by jihadistes, Pakistanians, Arabs, Ozbeks, Tadjiks.
Tolerated, sometimes helped by local insurances, will no longer be when the Western will become more discreet.
The department of the French troops of the Nijrab base, which I have observed from the top of the jungles planted by French credits, took place in the order.
Tracks and blind chairs joined Kaboul without being attacked, overwhelmed by helicopters.
There will be no defence of Taliban on Kaboul since the end of 2014.
The circumstances changed since their irrestaurable progress from 1994 to 1996.
Kaboul was then empty, the fire and bloody country because of struggles between different factions.
Their country's control was then identified as a type of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price of the absurdity of these countries exceeded by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not been improved today.
Older moudjaidin, Afganist and current Taliban government are joined in the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main remarkable anti-Soviet war was returned to the power in 2001.
They moved in businessists, sending government lands to build them back to land to refugees income from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from a large number of American sub-training contracts.
They have discovered themselves; most of them did not fight themselves.
People, as I heard in the campaigns, seek to be a government that is not a shooter.
Many young people want to go out, as they will go to those who have benefited from large Americans: capital flying is considerable.
Young people are inflicted by war and their ideology.
They covered the modern world at their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated the benefits.
About 65 per cent of the population under 25 years; Kaboul now accounts for 5 million people, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, government schools are full, girls as boys.
The work should be provided to these young people who do not want to return to the obscurity of old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
All, including armed opponents, are phone flights; television, and Turkish sights that present a modern world, are follow-up.
The army is present now.
Will the commander's authorities be considered legal?
Ancient anti-soviet commanders are already concerned about reconstituting provincial milices, which will escape central power.
Afghanistan, the mountain countries, the strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization, in the image of Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, eliminating the position of Prime Minister, which was from the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially at the time of the elections planned in April 2014.
But his country has been depending on foreign aid since the 50s and so far.
No industry has been relocated on the road, no barge has been able, no important irrigation system has been repaird.
All is imported; nothing is produced except fruit and fruit.
The priority is left at the private initiative.
In a country destroyed by thirty years of war, a government control on infrastructure would have been needed.
The smile was dispersed that Afghanistan had mine-related plants.
It was just to add to the feeling that the Westerns were just to stop it.
Without energy to handle the iron or copper on the place, nor transport means to export it through the mountains, there is no mineral exploitation.
The Chineses have almost left the mine of Mes Aynak, letting the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to gather the buddhical site and remain the most important employees in the province.
There will also be a day when Afghanistan and Pakistan, whose imports and exports are widely dependent on normal reports.
The department of French fighters finished on November 20.
The new Cooperation Treaty provides for the continuation of traditional support: girls, boys, French department at the university, French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, support for the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, to try to win the hearts and spirits and to achieve the impossible task to co-incite offensive aid and actions, a service of "military" action from the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), removed in 2012, has carried out, and done well by a small French NGO, many works of collective interest and agriculture reconstruction in decades of mountain villages.
These works, in hand-d's works, helped to contain the insurrection: irrigation, powder, potable water, reboat, fruity trees, soil protection and increased cropable surfaces.
What will we leave to remember, after two billion euros of military expenditure?
A more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, very hard in these valleys, often located up to more than 2 000 meters of height.
The Ambassaded received several decades of written requests from small agricultural achievements from local communities from the province of Capisa.
In order to pursue the insurrection conducted by foreign groups, what the farmers wanted to say to me, small civil aid should be maintained in favour of them, well controlled and directly touched.
A Force Constitution in Egypt
It's a new poker poker of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the Constitutional declaration, which is providingly granting the full powers, he decided to play all his way.
He, taking all the shortly, announced, merger, that the Assembly would vote on its final text next morning.
Only one week ago, the Head of State had granted two additional months to the Assembly to end its work.
It is about two years that Egypt is supported in a provisional text, several times amended by institutional stability and leads to legal burdens.
This new initiative has only increased fraction in the country.
For its opposites, the President continues to "train his word" and "Petite the right".
On the side of his parties, it is a way to end up soon with the institutional and political crisis by accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be organized within 15 days.
A very short time lap that obliges the Brothers to reject their project to explain the text, article by the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to find popular and democratic legitimacy while the contestation is rare in the whole country.
Mohammed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote favorably, as he stated in an interview with the American Hebdomary Time.
As this appeal to a preceding vote is finally to the Egyptian people: "You vote for my text, or I hold the full powers," those who will be able to end after the Constitution.
It is in a strange environment that 85 members of this Assembly, which, in large majority of Islamic majority, voted the text last night.
Most liberalians missed the call.
Middle November, just before the Constitutional declaration, they closed the door, estimating that they couldn't justify their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done the same.
In order to reach the necessary quorum, 11 persons, replacement members, have been added to the harvest, last morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
Without surprise, it's the most common to the unilaterality that articles have been voted.
Moreover, commenters were pleasant that one of the only differences in the day was expressed around... at the time of prayer, some members of the Committee thinking that the debt of the constitution was badly regulated.
The text, still being voted last night, includes 234 articles.
Objects of all attention, article 2 remains finally identical to that of the Constitution of 1971, suggesting that "the principles of charia are the main source of law".
The salaphist parties, for which the "Islamic Law establishment" is a major return, would hope to replace "principes" by "the rules" which would allow a more strict application.
For Islamics, the fact that this article has not been amended is a reward of their good will and respect for the other components of the Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisia", they answer the liberals, which only see a piece of communication.
Because they believe that the Islamicization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They see, in particular, article 220, which confers to the Al-Azhar university a consultative role, especially for the purpose of verifying the compliance of laws with the chariot.
According to the Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, it is worried because "the people called to pronounce themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see the premices of a theocracy."
The fears of liberalians are also understood by the fact that the next rector of this university should be well less moderate than the current.
"To the time there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution, we remain in the framework of the Civil State.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not closer but university, for some formed in the French system" temper Alexis Blouet, which prepares a thesis on Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he recognizes "that there may be ambiguity around article 220, because the terms employed are replaced by the religious vocabulary.
This is reference to the "fiqh", including [islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question could be found at the future in which measure civil judges are responsible for proclamation above."
Besides its religious aspect, the last voted text is very criticized due to the extensive powers he granted to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers claim that these are clearly reduced in comparison with what they were under the former regime.
Another strict point: the powers confined to the army.
In accordance with military desire, the review of the Defence budget will not be submitted to the Parliament but to a National Defence Council.
No more will be prohibited by civilian proceedings in military courts, as requested by human rights defence associations.
These are also part of their concerns about the text, which they judge freedom.
The blaspheme crime is maintained and the insulto is now prohibited, which might have serious consequences on the freedom of expression, including the press.
Furthermore, no article does no more behaviour for the protection of women, emphasized by Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to it, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by article 36.
The word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President had to express himself last night at the television, manifestations are expected to be held in the afternoon.
The support of the Head of State will develop them, Saturday.
In Israel, in holy places, the World Center and a sea of Saema are waiting for the Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Earth joins the greatness of Bible truths, modern comfort and wild nature.
Argumenty i Fakty took five major reasons to make you in Israel.
Go to worship the holy places
Return unto you: the rivers of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone who strikes these "doctrine fonds" will be touched by the Divine Great.
As for the Galilee, it is the earth of the miracles of Jesus: where the water was cast into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he washed the beast or still where the fish was wonderful.
This is the exact place that Jesus appeared before his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it is good in Jerusalem.
The believers and parked the Street of the Suffrance or the way of Croix (in Latin: La Via Dorosa).
This path begins near the strong Antonia (the pretoire), where the process was held, then leading through the streets of the old city to the Church of Saint-Sepulcre on the Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to the one of the Peter of the United Nations and the place of the Tomb.
Here is the Christian center of the world, symbol of the salvation of humanity.
According to the Christian legend, the monastery of the Cross is established at the place where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus has been crucified.
Jerusalem also opens the most holy place of the Jews: the Wall of Lamentations, which is the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in the year 70.
According to the tradition, people of different condemnations leave small words accompanied by prayers that are then listened.
Travel in height
Visit the ruins of Massada's strongness, old refuge against enemies built by Herode the Grand in 25 April. J-C. for his family.
These ruins are located on the roofs of a mountain at 450 m above the sea level.
Only the alpinism amators can make it their own means.
For the others, a telephone brings them on this full sum of history.
In the north of the country, between 1 600 and 2 040 m height, the ski station of Monte Hermont is accommodated by many winter tourists.
A ship can drive you from the foot of the mountain.
The ski tracks make a total of 45 km long.
Old believers want to live in nation gods as the top of the mountain.
Visit the unique museums
This country opens about 300 museums.
Unable to visit them all during one stay.
This is the five most interesting ones that are really valuable to the distance.
First of all: the Museum of Israel situated near Knesset (the parliament).
He opens the very old manuscripts of Qumrân, or manuscripts of the Death Sea, found in the larges of the wilderness of Judah, as well as about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological objects.
To see also: the Museum of Art of Tel-Aviv.
There are mainly the tules of the impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
At Acre, Hammam Al-Basha waits for you with its Turkish bathrooms composed of moulds of visitors and overseers of the time.
Once in Caesara, enter the only Ralli private Museum where you can admire Rodin's sculptures.
There's no guides or memory shops.
The entry is free and donations are prohibited.
The fifth Museum is the Yad Vashem Holocaust or Memorial Museum, located in Tel Aviv, which returns to the most dramatic pages of the history.
The most tragic part is the memory of children, built at the memory of 1,5 million children exterminated in concentration camps and gas rooms.
You're in and spend in total darkness.
Single stars.
Then you hear the names of the Jewish children and the names of countries where they are dead.
Ukrainian has also mentioned it.
Health and well-being
The three great Balneary stations of Israel are located on the rivers of the Mediterranean sea, the Red Sea and the Death Sea.
Each of them offers pools, aquatic parks, delphinariums and giant aquariums.
Note: You can swim in the Red Sea even winter, because the temperature of water does not fall below 21° while the air can reach 23°.
The Death Sea is even warm and you can spend it all year.
For this reason, this is the only sea in the world: it takes the lower point of the Earth, or 417 meters below the sea level.
The blue water contains sweet and swimming the bathrooms very easy, even those who don't know naked.
The landscapes around it are a surrealist beauty.
There is a basis of salt water treatment, limon, curative bottles and to treat different diseases such as democrats, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthrite, bronchites, diabetes, but also for all of them.
Discover the secrets of the Ancient
They are guarded by the old town of Tel-Avi, Jaffa, on the edge of the Mediterranean sea.
It is passed through the famous Via Maris, which links Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in the Greek and Egyptian legends of the Antiquity.
According to the legend, it is here that Noah built his ark and that Persée saved the beautiful Andromede, with whom he himself sees here a long and happy life.
Tourists especially love to walk in close rule that call the name of the zodiac signs.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street that corresponds to "You" signs, the destination will care for you.
In Jaffa, you can believe young husbands who came to make photo sessions of all Israel and even other countries.
In Caesarée, the city of the king Herod, you will be able to ball in the Roman theatre, "conquer" the strongness of the believers.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarée was the main city of Judah and the residence of the Roman Prosecutors, including Ponce Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is currently used for evening concerts and opera spectacles.
Tourist note
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russia.
For your trip, it's better to prefer the euro dollars, because they're easily exchangeable in shells ($1 is now equipped to 3.8 shells).
For the city transport, these are mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tramway and Haifa has the only metro line of the country, consisting of six stations and able to connect the lower and higher parts of the city.
This is almost a subterranean funeral.
Trade in all types of common transport costs 6 shells and allows you to make changes during 1:30.
In Israel, Jewish tradition wants to celebrate Sabbath on Saturday.
From Thursday night at sun beds, markets, shops and public transports stop their activity.
And the working week begins Sunday morning.
Many coffee, restaurants and hotels serve only from casher food, which excludes sugar, sea fruits, stable fishes and plates composed of milk and meat.
There is a multitude of sheep and bottle plates, soups and deserts based on coco, but also the homous, the traditional juvenile, different skins, the mould fish balls, the balls, the fruits and fruits.
There are no wrong dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
On the contrary, there are many well-friendly chats that walk highlight.
We can see them sleeping on the teaters of guarded cars on the night.
These felins love passing places and do not refuse to give them a gift.
The location of a car varies from $37 for $24 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 the day.
Louer a vel will cost you 15 shells the day.
A museum entry costs average 30 shells.
The language of the figures
Three million worldwide tourists visited Israel in 2012.
It was especially persons who came to travel and relax from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8.000 Ukrainian tourists entered into Earth Promise from January to October 2012, which was 51 per cent more than 2010, before the revised visa on February 9, 2011.
"What's the language goes in Moscow": migrants economize money to learn the language
While the deputy and human rights warrants over what will be given to the law on binding language tests, fraudders of "fake" certificates have already appeared in the country.
Each year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time are central Asian citizens: Uuzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkey.
Their only goal is to win money to help their families remained at home.
Since 1 December, a law has entered into force and sets out that each migrant worker should take a Russian review.
At the time, this rule refers only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing, private services and sale in detail.
However, with the time, the Federal Migration Service promises that tests will be binding for all immigrants.
Furthermore, the knowledge of the language should be validated, but also the history of Russia and the legal foundations.
It is necessary to validate its language knowledge in Russia to obtain and renew its work permits.
They are exempted only from the people of the countries where Russia has the official language status.
Persons receiving certificates or educational diplomas before the U.S.S. dismissed in 1991 are not more interested in this law.
Benefit, negative attitude and rights protection
The network of review centres will be under the auspices of the Russian language Institute Pouchkine, the University of People's friendship, the State University of Moscow, the University of State of Saint Petersburg and other higher education institutions of Russia.
Immigrants will be able to overcome the reviews in all the cities of the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the territory.
This review initiative was supported by Members of the State Douma and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law entered into force, the defenders of human rights have already made the issue in press many times: what will it be for?
What is the obligation to know Russia to change the Russians and immigrants?
First, they respond to the representatives of the migrant service, which will allow to reduce the number of persons suffering from the slavery to work.
Many speak about the rights of migrant workers, explains the Director of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of rights must begin before they start.
Only one organized selection system will allow for 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
The problems are posed by migrants without professionals, without training, those who do not know the language and who have no medical certificates.
Without the understanding of the language, Sebelev certificate, the future migrant is intended to believe malhoneses who, under the pretext of help, will provide a "cover" in an overwhelmed house where he and the decades of his likely people will be turned into for months without food and paper, and they will have to spend between 12 and 14 hours per day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"It is promised to them, and when they arrive, they are tromped, they take their passport, and they do not touch the planned salary," confirms the Head of the Office of Migration Services for the work of the Migration Service in Tajikistan, Tolib Charipov.
Don't talk to me, Mr. Police!
However, many people from Central Asian Republics who want to win money in Russia are convinced that they do not only know the language of the country where they want to become, but also write difficultly in their own language.
It's certainly not their fault, but their disaster: little of Turkmeniens, Ouzbeks, Tadjiks may allow to follow only a passable primary education.
Indeed, their families do not even have anything to eat their children without talking to them correctly and to earn them for school.
Since they arrive to adolescence, these young people are going to win the money as long as the opportunity is present.
It's difficult when we don't know the language, they trust.
"You're feeling slow and loved."
The Defenders of Human Rights notes, however, an important aspect of the language law.
Reviews will be used only to migrants who have legal status.
Without the status, there will not be a review or official work next.
However, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
Welcome or defense in
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason? The administrative barriers and these language difficulties.
Moreover, the legalization of money costs: between 12 and 16 000 robbery.
And then, we can get a false record quickly for only 1,500 robbery.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we have not registered, where the cases of extortion.
"They ask us 100.200 robbery to buy cigarettes from the tea," gave journalists Oumed Khouchkadamom, a member of Tajikistan.
"Do so fast, don't less and buy a beautiful art work."
Since the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it was found that the registration papers of migrants were not the only to be false.
several false language review certificates have already been confined by the employees of the Federal Migration Service.
False papers are out of a normal colour.
Of course, their new owners did not have them for anything: every migrant who would like to facilitate the task of reviews had to decrease seven thousand robbers for this document.
It is two times and half more than the official procedure: it will cost the employee migrating three thousand robbers.
The representatives of the Power and the Defenders of Human Rights agree to say that the short-term goal is to protect the system against corruption so that it is impossible to just buy these "papier bottles".
The authorities may provide migrant workers who have not been able to validate the first time to follow language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russia will be proposed a work in areas which do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of Internal Arms does not care for the arms market
The part of legal weapons involving crimes is very low
The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs proposes to decrease the law against civil weaponsporters.
This is the reaction of the authorities to face recent incidents: it is the tyre of marriage or murder organised by the moscovite judiciary Dmitry Vinogradov, who made seven dead.
The police wants to prohibit ball arms ports in public places and raise the legal age of the arms port permit by over 18 to 21 years of age.
The idea was supported by the Chief of the Douma Security Committee and Combat Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the Amendments to the Weapons Act would be introduced to the State Douma next.
Everyone is not satisfied with seeing that the Russian authorities try to solve the problem by "sharing the vis".
A open letter appears on the Net, where his authors, representatives of various tired centres, require "insensitive hardship".
The percentage of crimes made with a registered weapons is minimum, stated to the Russian Vasiliy Lesnikov service, a judiciary and specialist of the BBC crime.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Interior, at a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a police fire weapons, while 1,168,000 crimes were registered during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are that the strengthening of civil weapons laws will not prevent criminals from providing themselves to the black market.
According to them, today we can find any weapons in Moscow for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of Interior claims that it controls the dissemination of illegal weapons.
Provision providers: of the officer
The weapons' black market is provided through several channels.
The main channels are five, reported by Victor Baranets, colonial for retraiting for ten years to the Ministry of Education and the General Quartet.
Screen capture from a site taking arms commands
The first is "the military trace", namely the weapons that were shooted during military operations in Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by the Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians," explains Baranets.
The second type of weapons in the black market is those defeated by criminals to the order forces.
Baranets explains that it is also shooted weapons in the police stocks as well as those slaughtered directly to the representatives of the order forces.
The illegal weapons are sell from military shippings.
Many of these recently have often suffered explosions.
"The evidenced versions indicate that some fires have been deployed to dismiss the deficit", explains the former military man.
For Baranets, weapon manufacturers are for something.
"We see private weapons manufactures that do not revalue competitively on the international market and spend weapons on the black market, including in Moscow," said one expert.
One of the other sources of the black market is the contraband.
A significant part of weapons and metrollattes come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzië.
"We find a local production, sometimes artisanal, a mafia has formed and organized the supply", adds the former military man.
Where's the weapons coming?
Experts evaluated the nearly part of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on this issue was established in 2011 by the Challenge for Problem Analysis and Research for Public Administration.
Specialists analyzed the reports of the Ministry of Internal and Rosstat, criminal records and public data on arms ports.
The large majority of illegal weapons, explaining researchers, come from the army and the order forces.
The half of the weapons presented on the black market were found " by the fault of employees whose work is linked to the weapon", explains the report.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of the weapons come from military conflicts, 14 per cent are stolen at the time of manufacturing, and 5 per cent of the "infant fires".
A soldier and consultant of a weapons requested to keep the anonymat assured that for a long time nobody purchases the weapons found by these clandestinian specialists; they are too old.
The most frequently he said that the sellers will search for the new goods in military loans.
The person buys a unit, for example, a TT gun.
We're free of him by passing the goods by a grilling.
"He transported the city and returned $900 through the unit with two loaders," he says.
"It is true that the police is aware of all matters, so when crimes are on the subject of being elected, it is a control purchase to illegal weapons goods", added the soldier.
"Come in a luxury bottle"
The buyer and the buyer are generally found by the skill of knowledge.
I have consulted websites, blogs, until a guy shows to me and proposes to come to the Begovaya car where someone would get me into a "coin" to walk.
The weapon price was given to me on place.
Victor Baranets and military observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explains the seller, I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are sellers on the markets, but there must also be come by saying, "On the part of that person, who asked me to transmit that her daughter had lost a dent."
Now I even buy a pair of American pounds through a person I trust.
He's just booking them to me because he knows I won't give him.
The new ones are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military Victor Baranets tried as an illegal weapons purchaser in the 1990s when he was prepared to publish an article on the subject.
The schemes, according to him, haven't changed.
We gave him a album in which there was "all we want."
"I believed in a luxury boutique," the military remembrances.
There's no secret for the buyer, explains Baranets, we can try everything.
As a potential customer, I don't like to buy, we're going to go with the boss seller and we're installing a target.
"We let me shoot, and when I am convinced that weapon walks well, we start to negotiate," describes the expert.
A boutique from his canape
Search engines show websites and groups on Vkontakte where weapons can be purchased for different uses.
For this, we need no document and no one to meet.
"There is enough to have a precise amount of money," it is published on the site "Buy a gun or a mine of fight."
Users leave their request and ask their questions.
And we're sell to minors?
"Sans permission, of course," requests the user "Ivan" (conserved orthograph).
"Buy TT. Moscow," wrote "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has distributed a wide range of false sites and put the people wishing to buy fight weapons on the skin.
People smile on food as famined loups and then come to operate carbon in Siberia
Victor Baranets, observer and former military observer
I heard about this type of schemes: generally the site is registered outside the Russian law field.
People take the commands.
The buyer performs the payment on the automatic bottles.
"He receives a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden", explains the secretariat of the association "Deliver a weapon," Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets states that if you make a request on the site, you can find out without weapons and behind the bars.
The Federal Security Service has distributed a wide range of false sites and put the people wishing to buy fight weapons on the skin.
"Those smile on food, such as hampers, and then they come to exploit carbon in Siberia," he says.
A Makarov for $100
The purchase of an illegal fire weapons, estimated by experts, can cost from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov from the "Weapons Train" association, you can buy a Makarov gun for $100-300.
We'll have to wait for about a month and half.
It has been out of long-term leaflets through the direction of these medium size loggings.
According to the official data of the Ministry, in comparison with the period January-October 2011, the number of these crimes was totally decreased in Russia of 7 per cent, and 22.9 thousand, while the accidents of flight and extortion of weapons, munitions, explosive substances and bombs slowed 7.8 per cent.
United States: Employees of fast food and supermarket are in green
About a quarter of American adolescents passed by a shopping work at McDonald's
These last days, a protest vague is mounted against the low salary practitioned by the Walmart supermarkets and the famous rapid restoration chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the moment, no one can predict if this vague is going to take the width or sophisticate.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left associations.
In comparison with the increase in modest salary resulting from basic employees in Walmart and in the rapid reconstruction chains, manifestations organizations want to obtain the creation of trade unions.
This sector is not now covered by the syndical movement.
46 cents per year?
The manifestations started last week, after Thanksgiving, the "Break Vent" at the time when a defeated rain of money escaped millions of people shocked in America and sometimes turned out clouds.
In that day, some employees of the Walmart company, who are employed in the world by 2,2 million people, left their place to organize green pikes with trade unions and left activists in the shops of the society whose products are intended for consumers of modest and medium-sized classes.
Walmart markets all: chass shoes through car batteries, aspirators, eggs and milk.
The products are averagely 8% to 27% less cherished than in large overmarks.
That's why many injured employees in Walmart do their courses only on their place of work.
The price and choice of products made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to the critics, Walmart may be allowed to sell its good market products, in particular because of its employees' salary.
These are also difficult working conditions, such as the lack of heavy carriages or portable scanners.
The participants of the "Noir Vendredi" demonstrations requested a payment increase, as they claimed that the price of medical insurance provided by the company had increased from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
For the basic employee at Walmart that touchs $9.5 of the hour, it's a sum that he can't allow himself.
Scientists from the California University of Berlin show that if Walmart increased the average payment at $12 per hour, it would cost $3.2 billion.
It is 1,1% more than what it is now expenditure.
If Walmart would transfer all the payments to the consumers' sleeves, each round in the shop would return to 46 percent more.
They will cost only $12,39 more than now in one year.
Walmart's partisans welcomely noted that protests have been held in only nine States and had no prejudice to the group.
"The Black Vent" continued in the winters at 8:00 p.m. on Wednesday, and Walmart sold 5000 items in this period at second.
His boxes performed in total 100 million transactions for the "Noir Wednesday".
The company's talking port Dan Fogleman in an interview on the left Huffington Post, which in all "min of five" employees of Walmart had left their posts and that protest was only a "coming operation of both other" from the organizer trade.
" Next Client!"
Protections continued this week in New York and were not more concerned with the Walmart shops (from this progressive city, they are not very appreciative, so they were not yet implanted) but the McDonald's and other good market restaurants.
McDonald's advertising to sell billions of parts and after they don't even give you illness and pay you the job you have done honestly!
Jumae Williams, member of the Council of New York
Today, the minimum payment provided by federal legislation and New York law is $7,25.
Speed-food increases them with time, but in a little bit, its basic employees at New York $8,90 at an hour.
Nobody touchs less than they're in this city.
For me, it's unconceptable to live with this sum in New York.
It was a time when almost a fourth of the American adolescents worked at McDonald's after the school in life with their parents.
Many people saw their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a while.
Today, I'm finding to interview the employees of McDonald's workers who are pleasing to live with this salary and sometimes have to eat their children with them.
On the Wall Street Journal's forum we find comments that it's irresponsible to make children if you don't know with what you're going to eat.
The manifestants who started on Thursday at 6 p.m. near McDonald's 40th Street and on Madison Avenue required that the fast-food chains and kitchens be paid at least 15-hour, or a multiplication of more than two times than the current minimum payment.
They also asked for the establishment of trade unions in the rapid recovery sector.
The United States law prohibits the administration of the ban and punishment of the protesters of an unity by brimades or licenses.
However, the administration simplifies their life rarly.
For a syndicate, avoiding rapid restoration remains a difficult task, and that's for concrete reasons.
One of the main ones is the extraordinary rotation of staff.
They're not agreed
Other turbulent manifestations were close to several other rapid restoration chains.
The fair moment of protest was the mid-day assembly near the McDonald's di Times Square with the intervention of several local democratic policies, including Jumane Williams, members of the municipal Council, which said: "McDonald's announces to sell thousands of portions and after they don't even give you sicknesses and do not pay the work you have done honestly!".
The manifestants have been supported by other New-Turkey Democrats in view, in particular by the candidate to Master Bill De Blasio, who stated that "we must all support the employees of the fast restoration to obtain a fair and economic well-being that mere each New York.
The New York Times characterized this manifestation as the most important to know the rapid restoration sector in his whole history.
But only a few hundreds of people participated there without knowing that they were not all fast-food employees who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It's very difficult to say if this mass movement slows.
"To the moment, it's just a medium-in-law to mislead the brain."
Lastly, the fans of the new technologies were used to understand the increased reality through special lunetants.
At the beginning, Google revealed this was his current model at its annual conference and in November, we learned that Microsoft had made the request of patent.
However, he is in the maintenance with the director of the 3D interactive technologie group of Microsoft Cambridge Lab Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this society, the lunetants are already from the ancient history.
They are tried to handle virtual objects in the cloud air by creating open virtual spaces.
- Can you tell us in some words what your research group does?
- We work on the interaction between men and the machine and try to expand the borders of this interaction.
Humanity in its whole has remained for the time on the plate screen and sometimes on the tattle.
We want to look at 5 to 10 years before us and become the radical changes that will happen with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in the command by geste.
- What are we reserving the future too?
- While the Kinect has made the physical interaction, many things start on a plate screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance is not really true for now.
We're trying to change this, and we're working on 3D image systems that operate on different technologies, including projecting technologies.
We need to get out of the IT world in our, in the physical world, to make it more tactile.
For this, however, it must be identified not only the user, but also the space that is around it.
Thus, we can complement the real world by virtual objects in a more practical form.
And to begin, let us get out of these stupid boxes of virtual reality!
- What do you think of the vocabulary command?
She's appreciated, but isn't she not overwhelmed?
It is not possible to say that it is a problem of confidentiality because it is not always intended to inform others of his actions or intentions.
In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but everyone in his neck.
For example, to command the devices in the public places, we had a project for which we are pensioning to gests, not wide gests, but not discrete, limited.
The gests were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet covered to the hand that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is now large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it at the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: geste + voice.
- What do you mean?
- For instance, how would you ask me to pass this box?
You would do it with the word and the gests.
- Normally, I'm just talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognise.
- So, do you want to force users to adapt according to what the machine can or do at a given time?
- Not bindingly, but it's a mutual approach.
I think that soon we're going to work for the development of new types of sensors that will enable us to better identify human reactions.
For instance, the laser captors can act, they produce a sufficiently deeply well-resolution and it is very important.
- If we're interested in your work on the Xbox Kinect captors, what do you don't like in modern cameras?
Do they miss a resolution, a deep or another thing?
- In principle, it's on the current generation we're based on our work on 3D recognition.
Of course it would be good to get about 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not their own megapixels, but the quality of the matrix and depth.
As far as this point, all the current technologies are pretty good, this increases the work of the designers of algorithms.
Resolution should be maintained in mind in accordance with the X and Y axis, but also Z.
Speed is also much, the number of frames in second.
Human movements are sufficiently dynamic, and 30 c/s do not really suffice, especially for gests.
Steven Batiche, of our Redmond laboratory, gave a regular delay of treatment between 1 and 100 μs, the current sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Everyone does not understand how this affects the interaction of man and machine.
I would well need a device of this type in my work, but not to touch, to have more frameworks in the second.
But don't you have to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect has today three "cameras", which one is actually a infra-red and the second, a receptor of the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a normal sensor of the visible field.
It does not serve to define the depth of the object.
Many of the cameras could solve this problem...
Or Imperialize it by increased the volume of calculations required.
It would be interesting to create a soft product similar to Kinect, play with the camera curve and see how this could help to define the locations.
- As I remember, Microsoft, at the difference of Google, did not present his lunetts to the public.
Do you not think that daily use of the increased reality technologies are one of the most prospective platforms?
- Of course, walking all the time with a smartphone, it's not practical but this is what I think is: the best option would be an increased "transitory" reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to pass lunettes to smartphone.
The lunettes are a very personal instrument and that's what makes their strength (personal elements are those you are only to see) and at the same time their weakness: the increased reality from lunettes will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Imagine a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is not more accessible than Tony Stark in Iron Man, but also the simple mortality.
There is a problem about which opposers to this idea point the duty: there is no tactil sensation!
The hands don't feel anything!
What answers will your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my course, I often say that the increased reality is the seventh perished in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could be very well the scope of tactile feelings.
For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve image support.
She records the pressures perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are really intended to allocate palpacity to these "images in the air": for example, the interference of several ultrason radiations leading to a specific point where the duty is found and that gives you the feeling, for the time still low, of an air suffix on the dogs.
There are also bracelets on the skins that affect nervous conclusions, and they are also a work axis with perspectives.
- And you tried to wrong the brain?
He believes he feels what he should normally feel at the time he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We've still tried.
There is still a task below which will still be bad: the way to believe in someone who is physically in a very small space that walks in an open space almost unfinished - we work on the concepts of the course mass (residents to see those found in the Fitness clubs), mobile platforms, and also genital balls.
For the moment, it is only medium-sized to mislead the brain, there are still many years of work.
That's what works on the virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many are still in the absolute state of fecondation.
The rule of the guest and not the culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues to the "World Garde Petersbourgeoise" project described to citizens who are in advance, at the previous garden of culture and art.
This ultraselective list has already been welcomed by employees of the artistic scene of Saint Petersburg whose achievements are beyond the border of the city and who have found a recognition in Europe, after being known throughout Russia.
The new "Rosbalt" hero is Kirill Miller's extraversive painting.
All the city knows Kirill Miller, this man instead of barbue, all red clothes that can be crushed near the Russian Museum, the summer garden or even in the fragrated festivals.
Kirill Miller's tables are always assembling the crowds, whatever their exposure place.
It's one of the petersbourgeous containers, a socially and philosophy, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is an enormous representative of the Petersbourgeous Warden at the end of the 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, his appearance makes the people smiling and make them a good humor.
He has recently taken in his hands a Barbara's orer and became the symbol of this instrument in Saint Petersburg because he had been sufficiently mature for this difficult role of his existence, his philosophy and his image of bohemia.
- Kirill, why are you walking the city in red, not in yellow or Turkish blue, for example?
- I chose the red as specialized kitchen in the look and image.
In this world, red is a commitment between the painting, the image creator and society.
Even if in society, everything that is not green causes aggressiveness and negative agitation.
But my provocations are intended to take the debate.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to the debate.
- And when did you understand you should be clever?
- At the exhibition of the Palais of the Nevskiy culture where my work was found.
I realized that it was my way.
So, the vague of old non-official paintings was passing and the new, free, in my kind, were incomprehensive.
I started to join friendship with the new vague paintings, with the postgazonevchtchina who gave birth to Pouchinskaya-10 and then there was no more vague.
I'm interested in the theatre, mode, music, for all kinds except for words.
And all this was found in your artic clinic... it was important for me to find me in the centre of Saint Petersburg culture where the best creative forces must be gathered.
In 1995, I took place in Pouchkinskaya-10 that opened before the works a musical and artistic club, a bohemen club, the house of Petersbourgeoise.
Many have been born there: NOM, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arrives with the "The Van Gogh's ear."
Chnour and his friends were sing easy play-back songs in mould maillots, they were among them Igor Vdovin, composer today in mode.
When the group began to produce life, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg was not ill of emissions before Hali Gali time.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and that's when his great carrière started, but his training and basic education, it's at our home that he received them.
Galleria "D137", the "Griboedov" club: these are the impacts of the artic Clinical Clinical.
Our employees have gone as a housing.
I'm a hero of the last century, from the time the culture wanted to mean something.
In 2000, a study was organized in the press: it was the "The Personalities of our city".
I was called "First of the Year" and that's when my government ended.
It is not easy to work in a new time with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honestity and culture of the last century.
Today it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, it can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by an acknowledgeable style.
- Many of my tables are shocks, they have a very strong news and a very strong acuity.
I'll have an exhibition programmed "The Russian Museum through the clouds".
Crowns belong to a modern category.
Before I was a social person, today it's bad and it's afraid of being so.
But with the clowns, everything works, the tragic falls.
I love the bigsk, I have big ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through the total and binding guiding.
Today, this is the matter, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not in the inside of the person.
Maybe we can't give him the hand, but instead we need to smell him.
And the lie will be dismissed by the disguise.
- Recently, we have seen you in the role of the Barbara's hero player. - An cultural city must have this type of hero.
Whoever else can play him.
- But maybe the commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Today the commercial art is to be careful, delicate, smooth.
An integration of culture is being denied.
Before the people were shared in flocks, the partyrs of the good loved one thing, smell them another.
Today, everything is divided into micro communities, it is difficult to enjoy everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollars ticket to enjoy everyone.
Today, we need to think about who you're going to join.
Everyone see 100 fans.
- But several thousands of people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- It's people we've got to see it, that's the sexual and social side that walks.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 100,000 will not come and at the end of the account is less management, money, all depriving.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to fail them, not to smell the lives.
When I was young, I was talking about the tables that a collectioner rose around Falk or Larionov.
I started with the tables that usually are those we paint in the end of life.
Today, we are often confusing the ideas.
It is said: there is spiritual culture, consumption culture.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to see.
I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew up with the example of the paintings who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who rejected the money just for the painting.
I'm for this culture.
- Kirill, what's lacking in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the cultural official.
But everyone can't work in culture.
Under the rule of the good tsars, it wasn't like that, the tsars did not understand well the culture, but they understood that they had to keep the good experts.
In Moscow, there are good advisors today.
We have people here in Saint Petersburg that could be experts, but they are discarded, because there are higher experts who will be assessing these experts correctly and driving them a way.
Today, it's the "good's rule" that flying.
The same Erarta, but they differ in this sense, they say honestly that they do not take all the contemporary art, that there are paintings that must be found other museums.
- For you, what is this St. Petersburg?
- Saint-Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a land for it.
And on our stones, the art has a bad powder.
We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, that's bad.
In Europe there are many curriculums to see exhibitions, concerts.
In us, this bag is very good.
We have to make art in the mode as it was the case at the beginning of the last century.
Project implemented with the support of the bourse of Saint Petersburg
Log in space
Earth is in danger.
Climate refrigeration or collision with a killing asteroid.
Space boats with landscapes start to search for a rescue planet.
To save humanity, there is a great question: how to continue to make our species live in a spectrum or still on a relief planet?
I think there's a lot of choice.
In fact, there are two real planets that can be conquered, only by hypothesis.
"This is Vladimir Sourdine, researcher of the Astronomic Institute of State P.K. Chternberg (GAICh).
If on Mars the conditions are more adapted to life, the temperature at the surface of Venus is 500 .
It's only a very high height or the orbit of Venus... in the space.
It began to focus on the blooming issues of the space.
Another half years ago, there were experiences on plants.
Four generations of small fish grown on orbit did not vary in any way of the Territory Diversities.
Then, insect orbits, small drosophiles were put on reproductive muscles.
In 1979, ball eggs were sent in the space to see how an overwhelming embryo was developed.
We get a powder in the outdoor as well as normal.
Then the problems are starting.
" The problem is linked to the fact that the powder must find a support, put on its patents and begins to move " , explains the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Biological Medical Problems of Russian Scientific Academy (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
When no support was found, the powders were disordered.
And at 10:00 p.m. the new births saw their instincts fully atrophish.
The powders did not react to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would just die for four days.
"We missed them two times, then we left, because it's just impossible to work with them there," explains Vladimir Sychev by observing the failure of experience with powders in the space.
The last "miniature ark" with animals was sent on orbit 16 years ago.
Experiences will continue early 2013.
However, the " Bion " biosatellite would shoot only species of the same sex.
There was an experience with rats sent with their fetus in space.
In principle, we have found nothing of supernatural.
"There was still biosatellites, and then it's the only experience. This kind of research needs to be done," says Vladimir Sychev.
After the shooting, the rats of space gave birth to their age.
However, it is not possible to make playings directly in space.
This isn't a misleading case.
By losing their habitual environment, animals are no longer able to achieve their sexual instincts.
In contrast to the beasts, man is capable in principle.
Homo sapiens has the abstract thought, it is able to create a convenient emotional background.
This type of experience is not performed for ethical reasons.
But women have been in space for 50 years.
The largest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the woman's body is what humanity has too precious.
Our swimming pool was shocked, and nobody on Earth could tell if he was keeping after a flight in the space.
If she could give birth to a child after the flight.
"Nobody answered this question ", explains Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, retreat of the fuse sector and space.
In June 1964, just one year after her flight in space, the first cosmonaute woman Valentina Terechkova was born to a girl.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolaiev, was also cosmonaute.
In 1988, the second cosmonaute Svetlana Savitskaya, who had been two times on orbit and even worked in extra-vehicular environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risks are losing.
We have little, even very little cosmonautes who have nothing and who give birth to a full healthy seed after long flights.
"And if they are longer, this presents a danger even during the orbite flights, " concludes the pilot and cosmonaute, the soviet and heroes of the Russian Union, Valeriy Poliakov.
However, humanity must find new solutions in biotechnology, radio protection and creating artificial gravitation.
Cosmonate Preparation Center Hygiene Laboratory: Compulsory flight preparation stage.
There, in no flottability, the cosmonats lead to extra-vehicular outputs.
Water bleeds the swimming shoes.
If for adults, water is comfortable but a foreign environment, for food, is their real element.
Small amphibian men seem to be confirmed: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
As the baby evolves about 9 months in the lymphatic liquid of his mother’s skin, it is easier to live later in water.
It's in a logical principle, since his birth to his first bathroom, it's only 2 weeks.
"It's very little to forget," explains the Nation Instructor for Food, Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the child who comes to birth academy is a more natural state, the woman needs gravitation, a weight force.
Instead, the wind muscles, the bassin muscles are very rapidly attracted, the baby’s weak capacity is lost.
All right, let's ignore this by supporting us on the simulators of companion.
Of course, we can prepare a fellowship in a special room, and the woman will get out of it.
"And then?" asked Valeriy Poliakov to invite you to consider this complex issue.
On the other hand, the child also needs an artificial gravitation.
If it does not feel the earthquake, the body does not form squelet or muscular system.
No food can be found as an adult with special combination for training.
He's just gonna be private of his vital needs.
" And this experience we considered in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will go back to the Earth of a disabled child, completely disadvantaged, " provides the Director of the Committee for Bioethics of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of Russian Science Academy Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space is still the theory.
However, with time this will become real, when the Territorys will turn into their ships to a remote planet that will become the housing of their descendants in the space.
The Head of the ICC (Summit of Public Finance Control Institute) said: " The control of the independent pseudo work (in Czech " system Švarc " ) failed to be caused by politicians.
In the field of public markets, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation, but it is on the basis of its application.
That's what Miloslav Kala said, the Vice-President of the Supreme Finance Control Institute in an interview for Update.cz.
"The law will never be perfect but its application must be fair and, in my view, it is what is default at us, " said Kala in his comment of the current situation.
A jointly conducted control by Czech and German inspectors suggests similar conclusions.
He quoted as an example of abuse the approach of the " system Švarc " by Petr Nečas.
Mr. First Minister recently stated that ODS would not import entrepreneurs with controls; is it therefore permitted or banned?
"The law must be applied in a manner or otherwise, if it prohibits anything, even the Head of the Government may not prevent a authority to go to inspect to require respect for the law," states Kala.
At the meeting of the Committee on Control to the Chamber of Members, you have proposed a Czech-Deputy project in which the public market legislation of these two countries have been compared.
What was this concrete question?
This is a parallel control which we have started about two years ago.
In simple terms, the European legislation provides how to manage public markets and specific national legislation, as well as a practice which is fully referred to.
We gathered all this and even though this control procedure has not yet been completed, very interesting differences have occurred: generally speaking, our legislation may be "a more severe and better quality", but, according to certain parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This therefore confirms that it is not sufficient to continuously develop more detailed rules but that it is necessary to dedicate itself to the application of the same law.
What can this project help you and what does it result for you?
A common control of this type should only contribute to what we stop trying to clarify the laws, decline and improve the tools when it does not have a real positive effect.
The principle of good management means obtaining the matter to a reasonable price (what does not always mean the lowest) in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But by striving the markets, this goal will not be strongly achieved.
This system could be so submerged by the paper, that those who are looking for the fails will find much more opportunities than if the floor remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems relating to the implementation of public market legislation.
How does the control system operate in Germany?
Is there a similar institution to our ISC or a different organization mode?
For institutions, as well as ISC, the Federal Computations Court, which is similarly organized, also has a little differently constituted advice, but these two institutions are fundamentally in similar ways .
The skills are also similar, however, with a weakness regarding our system: Germany is a federal structure, and it also has a course of accounts of this type at the level of the different countries.
The BRH can only control the federal money, which corresponds to state resources.
The public funds managed by the regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of countries' accounts.
With regard to national legislation, is it more simple than we?
I do not want to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas, Germany is often appointed as a model but it is certainly not possible to say that it is better in all areas.
Maybe they have better inspectors?
No, of course not, but I repeat, I don't have comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country that we consider is a model is also faced with a number of problems.
Unless they had no advantage to cooperate with our institution, did they?
What does national legislation mean for you, as a institution, the amendment of the public markets law? Do they already feel?
This amendment has been in force relatively recently, it has no effect on our control operations.
As we do later controls, we need to be counted with a certain delay.
Our observations relate only to the preparation process for future controls - we have launched a new instrument for the "detection of the risks of wrong management" with which we have been in the crystal nearly 14,000 public markets - and these changes will have been heard, because the instruments have been changed, as well as the conditions of certain types of offering procedures and so on.
Will you therefore consider the adoption of this law instead of a benefit or as a load overwhelming for the administration?
I think that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that can happen is that these rules become more serious and that it is not possible to respect them.
The provider (e.g. the Regional Council, in the case of regional operational programmes) remained under the scheme of previous regulations, imposed the subjects controlled to accept that any violation of the market law means lack of budgetary discipline.
Is it, therefore, really useful to make the law more severe in this way?
No, I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack the system or to abuse, but not punish those who do formal errors without income on the decision-making process.
Such a system will benefit from administration pressure.
So what is the solution to get out of it?
Let's see where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that ODS would not import entrepreneurs with controls of the self-destining system - what does that mean?
Is the Švarc system prohibited or authorized?
The law must be applied in a way or in another, where it prohibits anything, even the government head may not prevent action of a authority inspecting and demanding respect for the law.
He may declare: "We will change the law and authorise it " but it cannot say that we will act as if nothing was.
The market law contains relatively strict rules on formalities to be implemented, just to protect offers.
But it is also tragic that a submissioner is only eliminated because of formal deficiencies.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair, and I think that is what is default in us.
The roads are by heat places, but most of them remain practical.
At some places of the Czech Republic, the roads are heavy and also engaging.
However, the network remains most practically, at some places with increased monitoring.
Karlovy Vary region
In the Karlovy Vary region, the roads were practitionable this morning, but by heavy places and also heavy.
Temperature dropped and oscilled between -5 °C and -10 °C but they should slowly return in the day.
The neighborhoods stopped in the region and there is only one end of neighborhood.
However, the crystals of the Metallifer Mountains (Krušné Goldy) are some 30 centimeters of snow.
It provides data from the regional road maintenance service that, because of the browillard, the visibility was reduced.
The R6 fast road and the national roads in the region are now without difficulty.
However, monitoring remains in place, for example, on some points of which the revestment can be heavy and slow.
All departmental routes and third-party roads, including mountain routes, are also practical.
There are still some of their thrones of glad nest rests and by places cut by traffic.
Overall in higher areas, drivers must strengthen their monitoring.
Pardubice and Hradec Kralové regions
The Trade Directorate and Authors reports on its website that some roads from East Boome are threatened by the training of greens and that traffic skins can be found on roads in mountain areas and located in height.
Rail maintenance services are maintaining conductors against the risks of clothing training in the areas of the Pardubice region located in the height.
There may be green around Lanšcroun, Ustí nad Orlici, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Möto, and this, mainly on the headquarters and third-party roads.
The routes I/43 and I/34 to Svitavy's neighbors were chemically treated.
The neighborhood is mainly located in the mountains of the Gentes (Kkronoše) and the Mountains of the Aigle (Orlické Hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Knśnou and Trutnov, a swimming neighborhood is presented on roads in areas located in height.
In Eastern Both, the time will be today sec, most commonly rewarded, with potential weakening passages.
It will swim a weak wind and temperatures will generally swim between -3 ° and + 1°C.
Pilsen region
The routes in the Pilsen region are now practiced, although, by places, there should be a increased monitoring and adjustment to the meteorological conditions.
He throws this morning, the temperatures between -3 °C and -9 °C.
After the latest sneeves and the refrigeration that followed, some communication ways may be by heavy places.
The drivers may expect to cross brouillard areas, but visibility will be progressively improved.
This is what it provides for information from the regional road maintenance services.
The D5 route is almost uncomfortable, but rail communication services recommend an increased monitoring between 80 and 131 kilometers.
The revision of most of the national roads is sec and gentle.
Some thrones can be heated in the district of Pilsen-South and in the Tachov district.
Departmental and third-party roads are humid and, in this case, the guarding of the heat throats is applied.
The drivers must be monitored, especially on the less frequent roads in the Šumava region.
Olomouc region
The drivers in the regions of the Olomouc region must now be counted with a swimming nest and swimming cloud on the roads.
This shock remained on the colle said "ervenohorské sedlo" and on the road in the direction of Videlský kśí, after chemical treatment operations.
The neighbouring snakes imposed this night the maintenance staff on the ground; according to the swimming service, there was more than three centimeters in the district of Šumperk.
In the other parts of the region, most of the chaussures are without difficulty.
" On the heights of the district of Šumperk are rest of snow.
The circle drivers in the direction of Jeseník must wait to meet a neighborhood swimming swimming swimming swimming swimming snake, "hearly, the chief of road maintenance services in the district of Šumperk.
Their colleagues in the area of Jeseník also took place during the night; according to these lasts, after the chemical treatment, roads are now displaced and displaced, even in the highest zones.
In the Olomouc district, roads are uncomfortable, but the drivers should, however, be aware of the throwings in forest areas to shore remained in the district of Šternberk.
Labem and Liberec regions
Since this morning, road maintenance services have reported several difficult throwings.
It provides data from the police, which in some places covered by snow or green, the mountain road from Telnice to Kniniice in Ustecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain under zero lower height, and there is no problem, and roads are generally seed.
No movement difficulties have been reported at the time.
Rail maintenance services reported the presence of gloves, including the shoes around sqtti.
According to meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal to their training: rain and nest source during the day, swimming and glad during the night.
Since the main areas of movement, difficult conditions are also reported on national road 13 to the border between the regions of Labem and Liberec.
The closure of the traffic between Telnice and Knínice is due to tree branches that have been covered under the weight of the neighbourhood until the shock reached.
Šimon Ornest said: "In concert, we want to collect positive energy. "
What do you think that in less than one month this should be the end of the world?
It's just one of these alarming news, the kind of pieces in which we like to fall.
In our group The Tap Tap, we are in place and it is said that we are the only able to collect a positive energy rest to retreat or prevent the end of the world.
Furthermore, you're taking a very unique project in December: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you more detail this project to our readers?
It's a caritative action that we have been preparing for for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential at the end of the Maya calendar announced for 21 December to 11 p.m.
The vel, on 20 December, will take three concerts simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will almost end at the time when Maya will end on the island of Kiribati, which is located in the peaceful ocean, on a temporary gun over 12 hours in advance for us.
Who had that idea?
At first I think that it was my idea, then we designed everything with our Creator, Honza Augusta.
Besides the fact that we want to collect sufficiently positive energy to save the world, we want to also, together with the public, to reflect the state of the world that we leave to our children.
At the end of Maya calendar, we created a collection of unique objects, including chains, T-shirts, sacs and original keys against the end of the world, buying them online on www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap Group also recorded a hymne against the end of the world, titled " End of the Annual World " ( " Conec svśta zrušeno " ).
She is already very popular on YouTube, will you also understand it at these qualitative concerts?
Of course, at the end, finally, if we get successful and the end of the world has not been done ...
It will be songed simultaneously by all the interpreters in the three concerts.
Hymnes will also be joined at a given moment in the context of a direct, indeed uniquely, from the Czech TV.
The words of this song were written by Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X and also sing...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We cooperate with other personalities of Czech-biz show, due to the fact that we organize many charitative concerts and events...
We are trying to intensify them to participate in these projects.
It has noted that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that they are comfortable.
What will benefit these concerts against the end of the world?
Equipment of the Studeo training centre that is available to those who work for the achievement within the Jedlička Institute, with the Tap Association, and that has been six years.
Teachers regularly become among students of the Jedličkæv Institute and propose activities interesting and encouraging them.
The students themselves do not have the way to go to course, we try to help them in this way.
In the context of the completion of the construction of the Jedlička institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
A number of music and interpretations groups will go to scene at each of these concerts?
According to what criteria, have you chosen?
We have tried to develop a programme that is addressed to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, they will go to Chinaski scene, Lesbian Support, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jií Suchī.
You will find all the details on www.kpks.cz.
Do you also prepare other " mega events " in the future?
In May, we will play the first time in the Prague's spring, and we will certainly prepare a quality program with interesting invitations.
We would also like to play the next year in the Czech Republic's house in New York and personally, once in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimumlists, for example you have played in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
However, Tap Tap is a group of persons with disabilities.
How will you organize the organization and logistic of your tours?
It's not so terrible that it appears first.
We have five electric bug members whose ships have to travel on board, naturally we tribble too many bags and instrument boxes....
As far as everything has been more or less well than ever, ŠSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything happened without problems.
Thanks to your foreign journeys, you can compare with what these countries vary for accessing people to reduced mobility, the attitude of public views regarding persons with disabilities and so on.
What were your experiences until now?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than our homes, we have just been witnesses in Moscow that it's still only in a initial phase.
With regard to Prague, Moscow is still very little access to disabled persons, and there is not yet aware that a person is only moved into electrical facility in the centre of the city.
They still not considered a proof of giving priority to an injury person in a stakeholder.
Unfortunately, there is also a association that is trying to draw attention to the problems of disabled persons is being created.
What should we still touch the most developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're still late...
It is important to mention that improvements and improvements are always depending on efforts made by the persons concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is very common that people with a weak disabilities move themselves alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilets, at the museum, anywhere...
It is never even very frequent in there that a large number of persons with disabilities participate actively in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are instead of progress!
The respect of the public and access facilities is one thing, but the situation will really begin to change when we are among us sportive, artists, actors, politicians or famous lawyers.
For now, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap Group is currently very popular, returning back a few years, what has you put in 1998 to create this group?
I started working as a teacher at the Jedlička Institute, where I have found many young people who are ready to invest in something.
And as I am myself musician (I play, inter alia, saxophone), with a colleague, we created a musical activity.
And then, with the time, as our modeller Láśa Angelovič said, a little lost the control of the situation (rires).
Success has happened only in the past few years, if I don't miss me?
It is true, the creation of links with known songers and actively working in the promotion of the group helped us.
We understood that, if a work is not visible, it is like if it wasn't in the background.
Thanks to the Union's subsidies, we can also enable us to have teachers of quality, equipment, and so on.
Did you go to reach such a level with The Tap Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt there was a potential to change things.
The business show is full of things that copy each other.
In some way, it is logical: everything new is accepted with care and it's long.
Rare are the original projects, and I can confirm that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally the mercy, it's natural ...
But mercy is totally unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering, abandoned from all, which we must take.
These are people who can live a whole life and live, provided that they have the necessary means of certainty.
I often say that when people with disabilities arrive to realize something, it's not only a advancement for them but for the whole society.
Is your success not also required by the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we must be intransigent in many areas and require certain discipline.
But I think that's really normal.
Some people come home with a romantic vision and the head in the clouds, and when they realize that they must come to repeations two times a week, follow the preparatory courses and pass a lot of time on the roads for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But this works in each group who wants to work and achieve objectives.
The Tap Tap Group currently accounts twenty members.
How many of them were there in 1998?
One, the only, the ́s ́s Angelovič.
We're a open group, people go and go, we can't do nothing.
Our doors are always open to those who want or wish to join us.
This will be the event of the planned day of the end of the world, on Thursday, 20 December 2012 from 21 hours.
This action was conducted in Prague in the Incheba Arena, Brino in Fleda and Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of 12 groups and other musicians of the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relaxation when they will be sing together the song of the Tap Tap Tap Group "End of the World " .
The aim of the concert is to assemble financial resources (a higher than 25 million CZK) to equipze the multi-functional Studeo training centre in Prague in the Jedlička Institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, the entry is free for children up to 12 years, the ticket prevention is open in Bohemiaticket.
Poland and cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was appointed as the twenty-fifth member of this Agency, it is the second Member of the former Eastern block (Czech Republic became a member of all 12 November 2008).
Poland had undertaken close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and in the years following a number of Agency projects.
However, the road from Poland to space began much more early.
Before the second world war, the passionate Polandians worked on space flights, and they did not always meet understanding.
For example, I would like to discuss the A. Šternfeld conference at the Astronomic Observer of Varsovia on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas from his previous guard book, entitled " Introduction to the Astronaut " .
The developments of this young engineer (in 1905) left cold auditors, and years later sternfeld recalls that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld obtained the price Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for his book "Introduction to the Astronaut".
The Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) became a large propagator of astronomy and astronomy.
He published hundreds of articles in Poland newspapers and wrote many books to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski has become a propagator of the world's rename astronautic, and its contribution was particularly rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of the claters of the Moon's hidden face.
Since 1925, a drastine was built in Poland to be equipped with a fuse engine.
Unfortunately, no author or details of this project are known.
It is not clear yet if the shooting should serve to propulse or slow the drastine.
The only information known about this dryine is those of the press of the time.
From 1933, the Polandic artillery began to dedicate smokes.
The research was conducted by the Comorka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
It provides records that this investigation had reached the test stage.
Of course, with the arrival of the German army, research has been interrupted.
In 1937, the plans of a photo shooting shuttle, designed by the engineer Rohozičski, appeared in the specialized press, and the next year was published the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by a author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
These two projects finally had a military use of smoking engines.
Just before the war, all projects for the use of fuels were conducted by the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczawy Committee Doradczo-Naukowy) which coordinated all the works.
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war at the end of its activities.
After the war, other works dedicated to the aircraft were published in the Poland press, thanks to the Polish Astronaut Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, it is questioned of a company in the number of November 1954 of the Problème newspaper, where four more detailed items are addressed to the aircraft.
In one of these articles, written by Professor Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a company dedicated to the astronomy.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that the area of space research had the future.
At the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronaut Society (PTA) has made efforts to enter into the International Astronal Federation (building in 1951) and after the automn, the PTA became a regular member.
The next year, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), Kazimierz Zarankiewicz, became Vice-President of the International Astronaut Federation.
He keeps his function until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has contributed significantly to the crooned development of RM meteorological fuse (Rakieta Meteorologicalczna), which became the first Polandese fuse to carry out scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch was held on 10 October 1958.
The smoke of a 1800 meters was a width of 80 cm and weighted a fewer than 5 kg.
The following was built a improved version, RM-1A, and, during the summer 1959 flight tests at two stages RM-2 were engaged in the wilderness of Bledov.
This fuse had a length of 1.4 m and probably weighted 11,5 kg.
The following prototype should be able to carry out concrete scientific works - RM-34 fuses should have a portion up to 14.5 km and serve to observe the wind in height.
But in 1963, all development works were stopped.
The Meteor-1 fused during the period 1962 - 1965, succeeded in the first RM fusions.
The smoke, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and a initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (named Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were different from the sizes of the space reserved to scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A fuse had a space of 0.4 litre volume, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 litre and in Meteor-1C of 0.62 litre.
The maximum portion of all these types of start was 37 km.
During the 1965-1968 period, Meteor-2 fusions were set at the aircraft institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 fuse had a initial weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a useful load of 10 kg to a height of approximately 60 km.
Then the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
Poland's entry to COSPAR (Commission for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
In the framework of the Interkosmos programme, Poland also participated in space exploitation on artificial soviet satellites, and in 1978, pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimír Remek, the second non-soviet cosmonaut of this programme.
The abrogation of the Act on Public Utility is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court abolished the law on public use.
This decision highlighted a life-debat in public opinion.
It is no doubt interesting to consider this issue of a broader view.
Economic systems towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalization are based on the principle of more non-regulated economic competition.
This means concretely that different economic entities and national economic systems are continuously conflicted with each other.
This results in the principle of the freedom of trade and free movement (less limites) of private capital associated with an unexpected financial speculation.
The considerable differences in the work price (payments) generated a price tension.
In that term, the following meaning should be set: a producer is endeavoured by importing goods sold to residue economic competition by " making the competitor's price more valuable " in order to remove a larger part of the market and thus increase its own benefits.
This means for most entrepreneurs: transfer to foreign production, buy at low price, or disappear, and the result is an important unemployment in countries where labour prices are higher than other economies.
As the private capital has no responsibility for social view, and the responsibility for the unemployment as it is inherited, the social charges of the State are necessaryly increased.
All this situation intensifys the perfect wicked will of employees to pay taxes and thus compensate the economic and social damage caused by the whole society through the course of benefit.
This situation is at this point of public notoriality that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
Privacy-capital practices generate in different economies a situation in which governments of different countries are able to start in mutual competition in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population in order to attract their homes to the foreign capital.
In other words, governments put their own population to the goods of private capital without taking into account social expansion.
This is mainly expressed in the amendments of the Law in force.
The objective is to impose its own population to accept the dictate of private capital prices, including in the field of payment.
This results from a system of long-term unemployment and, on the other hand, by restriction of the rights of employees in the field of labour law.
It results in growing poverty and the deep differences between the rich and the poor.
In RFA, there have been years of public food distribution points for poor people who can't respond to their needs with their own work.
The number of those persons is already accounted for millions.
In the context of the increased competitiveness of the German economy, employees receive such salary as the State is bound to pay a supplement to achieve the minimum vitality.
For example, such a scandale was updated in the case of employees working as assistants in the Federal Parliament.
The economic measures of almost all the Southern EU Member States are certainly a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophy of society, people are obliged to emigrate or emigrate (such as the smoke in the 19th century), or to live with poor salts, at the margin of the society, in hope that a day the private capital is invested in their country.
The following question is to be addressed here: from where will this capital come?
If it comes from other EU countries, poverty will go from one country to another; this capital can not come anymore, or a Chinese, a India, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Morocain, an Egyptian or African will continue to work for a fraction of a European wage.
This also concerns the whole Latin America.
The liberal theory and media argued that the State cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the leading economy leads to an economic disaster.
The private capital defends the idea that the State cannot be involved in the economy by regulatory interventions.
It should then be asked whether the private capital does not influence and even today do not direct, according to its own selfish interests, policy and the whole State.
The answer to this question is no doubt.
The evidence is that there is almost powerful and present lobby in all States.
It results in a desperate situation in corruption, through mutual advantages, in legislation, where everything is condemnable but not punishable.
In RFA, the situation is such, as the lack of financial means, national delegates the development of law projects with closely-related lawyers.
These legislative projects are then adopted at the Bundestag.
The totality of the power is not from the people, as the Constitutions of Western Type declares, but of powerful financial groups serve their own interests.
It is clear that the democracy directed to liberalism now looks rapidly faced with the situation described by Appianos in its book entitled "The Roman Empire crisis at Caesar and Pompée time," "the State was in full delicacy and the functions were assigned by violence.
The powders, the favors obtained illegally, and the stones and the swords were also used to obtain these posts.
The low-detail and corruption would be proliferated without limits and the people were making elections with already sold voices... "The honest people were not trying to obtain functions, it resulted when the State remained unconsistently." "There is really starting to say that the remedie to this difficult situation was an autocracy and that there was to choose an energetic man"... It is true that Africans had the Spirit Pompée, but it is Caesar that turned irreversibly democracy into absolutist regime.
In conclusion, as in the antiquity, the present society is based on the preference of personal benefit, without regard to the interest of the society in its entirety.
In its substance, the private capital is no longer able to understand and value the interests of the company in its entirety.
It has resulted today, as soon as, of a decade without previous eleites, without any effort to implement deep reforms.
We should therefore search for the causes of emergency of fascists and communist regimes in free liberalization of the economic systems of the XIX and XX century.
In the current state of things, the disappearance of these systems can be considered by the benefit of liberal democraties as a kind of pause before a new step.
The fact that the current eleites fully ignore the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future losses in human life, the humanitarian and social crisis that we are now witnesses, as well as the crimes against humanity, such as we know them from ancient and recent history.
The abrogation of the Act on Public Utility is not a solution, at least a long term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both at the international and at the internal level of European level, the Government of the Czech Republic will continue to search for ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is systematic.
The solution consists of sociopolitical reforms, which will strengthen State capital investments in the economy, will increase the influence of citizens on the government and enhance the position of private capital in the company for the benefit of the State.
Israel: Chaos lab.
"Never will come out of violence and never be able to" says Sting in the song titled Fragile, whose main verses of recurrence are "no forgotten how fragile we are".
"If my son wouldn't want wars, there wouldn't be", said Gutel Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on his death bed in 1849.
Following the last vague of violence between Israel and Gaza flag, as normally, many reactions have been higher.
Some take the party of Israel, arguing its right to self-defence and putting Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support Palestinians, calling for the racism of Israel's State, the genocide committed against Palestinian Arabs and considering Israel as a terrorist state.
I don't want to think about the question of knowing who is guilty and who is victim in his recursive murder vagues; overall, the current people of Israel, including those of the autonomy territories, are born in this political situation and have not lived in the start of violence.
I would like to offer readers a point of view that is “tower the rideau” about the whose mainly benefits of tensions that are already lost for more than 95 years (from Balfur's Declaration in 1917) in a small bout of Middle East.
Some of these reflections are supported by historical facts available to the study, other are of my own understanding of that, or more precisely of the individual group, which is the main inhibiter of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is first the history of a fight for power.
At every time we can find an Alexandre the Great or a Napoleon.
This is not so obvious to know whether these individuals act independently or if they had to do their throne acts to someone who directed their acts on the basis of pre-defined objectives.
We must admit that we live at a time when global riches are connected between the hands of some individuals and that this financial concentration that generates certain powers could not be done during a single generation.
Among the families with a astronomical riches are particularly different from the Rothschild family, which could be considered as the head of the skin (I don't know if these families have a leader but I do not exclude).
Peu is written about them.
Sure.
Since the 1990s of the 19th century, they acquired the first World Press Agency (Reuters) to put an end to the establishment of links between their name and serious criminal acts to which they were matured and which always meaninged for them strengthening their power, increased their happiness or both.
They have major participations in nearly the majority of the world's central banks and prepare or bring wars against countries where they have not yet such participations (for the invasion of Afghanistan, the number of these countries were 7, after the Iraqi invasion of 5 of Kadhafi only four times, Russia has placed the Russian Central Bank under the control of the Russian government).
Everyone who tried to fight against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Central Bank at the Bank of America of the Rothschild and began to evacuate his own money during civil war (governmental, I hear well) and was killed in a theater in 1865.
JFK began to evacuate the own money and wanted to dismiss the FEED, he was killed in 1963, Mr. Louis McFadden was empowered in 1936, while he wanted to try to make a case against the EDF to have deployed the great economic crisis in 1929.
Their sovereignty at the world level led in 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three global wars by Albert Pike, a smooth franc-mazzon launched in the 33th degree, was the highest level.
The first war was aimed to eliminate the major ethnic monarchies in Europe, the second should remove colonialism, including the British, and the third should reduce the global population between 1 and 0.5 billion individuals (as a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), creating a unique universal religion (ocumenism is nothing else than the love of such solution) and, finally, obtaining absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the most rich families to their head is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the following order).
These solutions are false and are always leading to a degree of the situation (see the establishment of the EDF aimed at avoiding that they do not repeat crises such as those they caused in 1907).
After having successfully launched the first world war by the murderer in Sarajevo de Ferdinand, Habsbourg's heritage in the Austrian-Hungary Throne, they destroyed Russia by provoking the Bolchevian revolution.
The first world war was slowly completed by a German capture without economic and military justifications (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Tasarist Russia) and it was followed by the morbidly Austria and Hungary, Central Europe.
For a more easy deployment of the second world war, bankers left the political leaders to establish a late conflict situation: they, on one occasion, have set to Germany for familiar war repairs that generate the conditions of radicalization of the appeal masses (which is sufficient to place a sufficiently energy leader, showing the debt of guilty, proposing simple solutions) and, on the other hand, establishing a Czechoslovakia composed of various nationalities, including a German minority that played the role (which effectively) of the fifth column to put fire to the powder and a war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothscöls inspired the creation of the sionist movement, including one of the branches in the creation of a Jewish State, of preference in the region of the historical Jewish region with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The Declaration of Balfour mentioned above put the basis for a massive Jews migration to Palestine and the first flights with the Arab local population began.
Terrorism acts were made by the other part.
The Second World War is difficult to appreciate if Hitler had broken the chains in which the international bankers had initially held it; or if everything he had been planned, the fact is that the suffering of the Jews in the concentration camps created the basis for accepting a Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, as the war repairs in Germany were originating in the second world war, Israel's foundation of the state of Israel had been a home of fire that could cause a third world war.
If international bankers can start this war, the Jewish population will be like it during the Second World War, the first victim of the battles, as well as the Arab population or generally Islamic population in the Middle East.
Israel is like a large laboratory, the source of discorde and chaos, not only in this country, but at the international level (which is enough to see how people are breathly divided between parties and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is victim in the Israeli-Palestian conflict, where a torment generates another torment according to a circle of unfinished violence and where, as a result of all, finds the vulnerability of some individuals and their desire to obtain power over the whole world?
The difference between the simple citizens of Israel and their leaders must be done here because, as well as our home, international bankers do not propose people to elections but to their own candidates.
The present minister of Israel is a typical example of political, loyal to international bankers, which makes everything to develop a war with Iran, which could, due to the accession of this country to the Shanghai cooperation organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) being extended to become a global conflict and, as Iron controlled Ormud's deceit by which 20 per cent of all the world oil (the naval corridor has a wide range of only 2 thousand) and leads to a destruction of the global economy.
Under what light now appears to the proposals by David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which an aristocrats of finance is served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every new birth is seen to birth an electronic pocket that makes it a completely controlled being.
"If they bound all individuals, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves to bring a mark on the hand or front, so that he may not buy nor sell the name of this ferroce beast or the number of his name.
It must be understood that those who have good sense account for the numbers of this ferroce beast.
This number calls the man and is six hundred sixty."
Argo film: When everything goes worse, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a number of Islamic students composed of the Islamic students attacked the American Embassy of Teheran and retired 52 diplomates.
They had to be released by Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, went to the United States, who supported his regime for several decades.
The situation was not offered to the American Administration of Positive Success, and it could actually not abandon Shah, because it would have seriously raised the confidence of its partners in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had been delayed on the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was not able to obtain the freeze of otages.
It was a hard cut for the United States prestige, and later aggressively aggressively by the failure of the force-free-free-free attempt.
The sequent diplomates were finally released 444 days later, following the negotiations organized by the Algerian Government.
Their exhibition caused by the United States a vague of solidarity and an anti-iranic feeling.
The Iranian devaluation has strongly contributed to the disaster of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The cinema Argo from the actor and skeeper Ben Appleck describes a episode of this story that offers a small victory in America.
Only before she was busy, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After complicated perceptions, they found themselves in the residence of the Ambassador of Canada.
In cooperation with the Canadian authorities, the CIA has made them out of Iran thanks to a rocky cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as a member of a tourning team to make reserves for the touring of a large spectacle of science-fiction film.
Gender combination
Tony Mendez's expert plan requires the collaboration of Hollywood.
In order to make the most credible legend, specialized books took the status of this film project, press conferences were organized and a fiction production company of real offices.
Operation details remained secret for a long time, the film was based on Tony Mendez's memorys.
Affleck's film is an insolent combination of several kinds.
It is part of a realistic political stripper designed but also a "moking cap", the account of a success, of a traithry - for example, in the Trilogia of the Ocean's eleven, twenty and thirty-five.
The ambitions succeed: the sequences of Teheran's documentary style (in the subtitled sequences are presented with iconic photographies of the events during the time and the way, through these photos, the same situations have been re-scribed in the film, there are no major differences);
less lower passes of Hollywood, treated with irony and a bit of exageration,
And then scenes from the CIA General District and other institutions with skilled men discussing the situation around conference tables, balls and phones.
Ben Appleck succeeded to restart his career in a marvelous way.
By a ridiculated actor, it became a respected scene metal and his actor game stopped to highlight iranic comments.
Argo is his third long-term metro after the police shadow "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the "The city" (2010).
It's also the first film of Afleck, which does not start in his original city, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the features that placed his first films above the Hollywood standards.
Appleck also shows this sense of the atmosphere in Argo where the role of Teheran is "heritated" by Canada.
The best scenes of the movie are launched in streets, while reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the embassy's fall is impressed by its clearness that also suggests the confusion and inconsiderability that happens when, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Appleck and his collaborators have similar effects in the fixed scenes (the false turning team in the Teheran's ball).
Too many places
The scene Metaphor had to satisfy a subject offering only a few palpitants scenes, in the cinematographic sense of the term.
It seems very well, sometimes adds some elements to the reality and there, the result is not always so elegant (the scene in which the threat to the crisis at the airport of Teheran is disappeared by a phone cut in America, and the continuing on the aircraft piste is sufficiently driven by the hair).
Argo's weakness remained in its dismissed nature, due to the need to show too many different events.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their role of Hollywood co-operators, their personalities would have been a larger place and aren't, far from there, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's movie misses a little dramatic tension, he leaves to see with a moderate interest by appreciation of the achievement and the red style of the 70s.
It leads the spectrum, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a story still, in a certain manner that has been incapaciated to this day, and as a illustration of the exagerate character of representation of secret services as omnipotents and all-known, it is the case.
Rules to gonfle balls, bananas and circles
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which takes every year a public survey on the most absolute banking costs, has now decided to start the support of the regulation or ideas from the most absolute EU academic.
"The fact that the EU thinks, in recent times, of adopting a quota of 40% of women for the direction of the major European enterprises has been due to our decision", said the Pravo newspaper, the organizer of this investigation, Patrik Suer.
Among the absurdness mentioned, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify the insurance primes for men and women.
Eventually, women were benefited for life insurance rates because they are objectively representing a less risk for insurance companies.
People can sign up to the end of the year any other unbelievable idea of the EU's stage.
"The vote will be held before the end of February 2013", reported Nacher.
For example, among the EU's controversial regulations are the obligation to add bio components to fuel, which have weakened consequences for the environment, or the prohibition of use of fiable thermometers to mercury, only because they contain relatively low amount of a dangerous substance, or even the directive on the size of powders, which caused the increase in the price of eggs.
Critics have also been issued by the past against the prohibition to use the expression "bourre to tartiner" or the retreat of the sale of classic ampoules.
Quality bananas must have a size of 14 centimeters.
The European Administration is often under pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are normally defended in Brussels by a State or a group of States (which the Czech Republic currently implies the requests of its banks by threat to use its veto right).
The interests of pressure groups, for example, are also due to the fact that bananes in the Union must not be less than 14 cm or to present a "anormal curve".
The European Commission was defended by argumenting that it was only to harmonize non-homogeneous national standards that complicated trade.
The standards on fruit and vegetables have been implemented, despite the opposition of certain States, which claims that existing directives lead to gaspillage of foodstuffs.
The first price may be decreased in this investigation to the EU Regulation of the last year, which must contain on the tangible balls a warning that the children under eight years do not have to join without adult surveillance.
The EU refers to an American survey that the balls are among the games the first cause of child death by shock.
Similar restriction applies to children under 14 years of age to smoothing in horses.
In the same way, we have weird ideas.
The following rules on European officials themselves is absolutely absurd: due to the sensitivity of this topic for Greece, every person who has an official function within the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and must, on the other hand, speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the "Lass Faire" association grouping liberal economys, the Bankovnípoplatky.com service has been appointed in this investigation, and also certain absurdities mentioned above, the EU Regulation on the volume of food reserves in the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had fixed maximum volumes for food reserves that could be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volumes fixed for the chambers in the preserving and, therefore, risked a large number of amendments.
The organizations of this investigation considered interesting the idea of paying money to some countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subvention to request the grant of subsidies.
However, these ideas are not originating from Brussels but from Prague.
"The fact that we have no sea is disabled.
We will ask the European Union for a reimbursement." In 2004, he expressed the Minister of Agriculture at Jaroslav Palas (SSD).
He argued that, due to our bleeding production, the State was recovered with full stocks that he had to then export.
According to the Palas, the EU had to pay us millions of euros because the Czech Republic is far away from ports.
Finally, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech demand and organized a call for offers for the purchase of bottle from countries without maritime access.
Subsidies for the obtaining of grants were proposed to the Commons by the Ministry of Local Development guided by Minister Pavel Nśmec (EU-DEU), which should, in concretely, serve to address subventions requests granted by Brussels.
The EU says: "Weird regulations are rare."
If the regulations are often critical in Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the functionality of the Union and in the field of its general development, are instead efficacy.
For example, it is more serious, according to experts, the problem of the use of EU subsidies for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with the strengthening of European integration, but which was imposed by Member States during budgetary negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other countries of the Union, is struggling in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (which is not always winning) causes emotions in the Czech Republic.
If in the end of six years of battle against the Germans and Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomoucké tvarčky" for the name "Tuzmskу rum", which retreats us in the 19th century, our producers had to replace it by the name "Tuzmák".
Only cancer sugar products, and not on the basis of improvement sugar, may have the name of rhum.
In the official list of EU registered products, it is currently found in the company of worldwide known fertilizers such as Feta or Gorgonzola, Lübeck's masspane or Parme's feet, the carpets of Karlovy Vary ("Kalovarské"), the Pohoṣṭelic and Tśebo (Pohoṣṭelickī to Tśeboský capr") and the bovine of śatec ("chmel").
Pardubice's epic bread ("Paardubickī pernik") and the kitchen called "Hośice Cornets" may also be proud of their Community mark.
People want me to save the Republic, but I am just a amateur, Mr Okamura declared
Mr. Senator, how do we have the idea of presenting the presidential elections?
It's not to be Senator or President that accounts for me.
If everything works without problems in our country, I would not be a candidate.
But I don't support to see how the country has been thrown since the past twenty years, that the fleeters are not under the cuts and taxes and age of the departure.
I had no ambition to become political.
But when I see something that doesn't ask me, then I try to make a solution so that it changes.
And as I have more than 40 years and that I am independent, no party member, I have no other solutions to influence the situation that I have to present to the presidential or senatoral elections.
You've entered the Senate but you're fast on the road for the Chasseau (N.d.T.: presidency seat).
Doesn't you turn that way to those who have chosen you?
I always said I will start in the battle for the Chateau according to the results of the senatoral elections
Then I explained that if I was the Senator, I would present the presidential elections.
My goal is not the function, that is just a tool that I can realize my vision.
That's why I need the largest influence and the largest mandate.
The problem is not only as a nation runs to the bar or to our television post, but we also ask all those who try to make changes.
This adds the press that casts the reputation of people and confusions the freedom of word with the freedom of lie.
For instance, I have stated that I support journalists or that I have been Jiśí Paroubek's adviser.
Let's come to your visions.
You have undertaken the fight for the Chateau with the subjects of material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive fiscal statements beyond twenty million [CZK].
You have to change the law to this end.
As President, you do not have such power and only the Senate in its whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When as a citizen, I made pressure that tourism guide activities are a liberal professional, I gained a cause.
The problem is the policy: when someone comes from the left or right with a good project, it is quite rejected and it delays the citizens.
Independently, a member of no party, I have much more chance to obtain support from all Parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of power, without categorization and partisan dogma, to take from each party what is best for our country and to apply it.
You're going to be a right man or a left man?
From a Czech point of view, I have the impression that people put me on the left.
For me, that it's a little left or right, it's not really important.
For me, the importance is that we're going out of before.
What I mean, it's not that people are left or right, but assembling people.
I always support any solution to the common well, even though it is proposed by the Communist Party or the ODS and I did so impartially against bad ideas.
Do you smile when someone tells you that you are a popularist?
But what you said not prove it?
When you develop a planned business in a company, you also have a certain best goal and a vision.
You're trying to approach it.
Some may call this about popularism, but all the proposals I have spoken have been applied by the world and by the experts recognized it.
But without the support of the Parliament, you are only slogans.
You're not going to survive in policy with this.
Do you think if you're going to see people and talk to them, for example, you'll be able to impose material and criminal responsibility?
I don't have any other option.
I must be convinced by politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to raise them into my camp to put it on.
If I was elected by the President, it would not be a problem to send my request to the Presidents of the parliamentary parties to legitimate the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, officials, judges and lawyers.
They should then explain why they do not want it.
When there is a strong personality that identifies abuse, it will be possible to pressure on the political scene.
For example, take the election of the President to the direct suffrage, which was obtained by the pressure of the public opinion.
I am pronounced, without ambassador, to be a amateur, not a genie or a intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I have been launching my policy and I try to obtain the support of the majority for my programme.
I'm trying to advance things alone, and if it doesn't go, I'll stop in six years and I'll go back in the private sector.
It's a little like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that only one person can't do the difference, so I'm going to see a number of personalities to ask them to also present the senate elections.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
I have at least supported the research journalist Jana Lorencova who revealed fraud at Saturday.
I was presented to me because people are really miscontinent, but now I'm hospitable.
Six percent of people have not voted and, mostly, they gave their voice to a representative of the stablishment.
In Senate, we are only two independents.
People have chosen a Senate that could difficultly imply changes.
However, I will fight for my vision, for example, the election in the direct demand of maritimes and region preferences.
Are you thinking of founding your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have the time to check if the past of each potential member is uncompensed and then I don't have the financial resources.
I have no more money for my presidential campaign, I have just twenty thousand on my "transparency" account.
You don't have money?
You're talking about fiscal statements, what's your?
I consider about 60 million the value of my personal goods.
I have in Prague a terrain of a value of 25 million, a apartment of a ten million, another apartment valuable 8 million, an art work collection of about 10 million, a Aston Martin that values 3,5 million and a skoda Superb of a value of 1 million and a few million on my account.
I had a Aston Martin, because it was a child's dream: I always loved James Bond, who runs in the car, was galactic with women and fighted against the evil and abuse.
You run in Aston Martin, you have a patrimonie of a value of 60 million and you don't have money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but don't you want to invest your own money?
It's not very convinced.
I don't have 15 million for this campaign.
Should I tell me?
I have already invested 2 million and half in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsor shows well that my program does not cause a great interest.
I don't have the obligation to pay this campaign of my pocket.
My campaign costs are overall covered by the reward that I receive as Senator.
But I couldn't live, for example, pay the English school of my son that costs 300,000 per month.
If my only goal was to win the money, I will not present any election.
So you will continue your business activities to live?
Have you not stated that you would put your activities in the Sudden?
But this is not linked to the amount of this payment.
As I promised it, I was partly reduced my activities.
For example, my advisor will take the direction of the travel agency at spring.
People want me to be a Samaritan who save the Republic.
But I have to live with something.
What was your normal month salary when you were entrepreneur?
I won and I continue to win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I was the president, I'll finish my business activities.
You will find this interview in the Sunday edition of the Prava newspaper.
The MVRDV office architects demonstrate that the real adventures are not only a imagination case. To convince it, it is enough to observe Spijkenisse and the mountain of newly established books - 2 photos
"I think that this building is marvelous, it makes very future, finally something interesting to see," Lisette Verhaig, a passenger on the lowest coast of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computerist in a big neighbor company, said to us, "Yes, it's really nice, this building."
But I ask why we still need a library today.
Everyone has the Internet, a iPad and e-books.
Today, nobody else goes fully in one of these ringard libraries, isn't it?
Spijkenisse, a village town that has nothing to cross to Rotterdam's gates, has a very special record.
The community of 80,000 souls shows the lower education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to give some neurons to the brain, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and to reproduce the seven fixed bridges that contain the euro tickets in the form of sweet small beton-weapon.
The success of cultural offence has remained limited.
This is how the city's authorities realized that there was only one way to get the hand on statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, from the Rotterdam MVRDV architecture office, was the manager of sweet and slightly and often cynical buildings, accepted the project with its usual flag and presented the competition in 2003 with five books under the arms and a switch on the face.
And while the jury members still looked out, unconcerted and shocked the shoes, Maas, shooted it, slowed his selection books by order to make a pyramid, and ended his standing talks of active arguments by a "Community Chief!"
This is my proposal for the mountain of Spijkenisse books, or, as we say, the Boukenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros have been covered by land.
The building is included in a revitalization project also includes a suburban parking, a supermarket, a post office and a few mixed buildings and houses for a total of 50 rooms.
On November, the book mountain received the second price "Best Library of NL 2012".
Moreover, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is how this small tern bourgade, which until now has nothing more to offer only a postmodern area and a swimming swimming layer, whose white façades invited to think that they open a lattery, is enriched by a contemporary architecture work.
The most important is that Spijkenisse has now the first public cultural building of his history.
The long way to read
First impression: Eldorado of the book under ring ring.
Of course, a staircase transports you to the heart of the massif, but the real joy of reading and architecture opens to you when you multiplie the ground of the building to discover its topography.
The whole internal drink is light and clear, the land in Dutch rings and the elegants speak without equivalence the language of municipal public places.
Urban atmosphere is perfect.
We are already searching for public banks, dogs and kids and girls playing at the bathroom.
And all books, books and books.
"Only, library radios are along the façade and in the middle are a large and dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal," explains Willy Maas.
We have completely buried the classic space configuration and opened internal read spaces to outside.
The inside of the books mountain has been adjusted: the offices, the Internet library, the missing club, the environment centre and the building's technical center.
A special beauty resides in the black rays of the library, which are soon lambris, soon balls, soon scatter rampen.
A new experience for the view, touching it and smell it.
Even architects and engineers of the endurcis building do not want unknown materials.
"We want to work with recycling materials", explains Joop Trouborst, the head of the project at the City of Spijkenisse, in an answer to the Standard.
This is how one day we found in a fresh agriculture company a ad hoc dechet from agriculture.
In the Netherlands, the synthetic membrane of a millimeter of distances is used as substrate in the shoes and fields for years.
It's a good market and we're winning time.
The membrane end is used for one or two seasons, then we can throw it.
For the library, the membrane was captured, for the first time in such quantities, in plates of a four-century distance.
Under the effect of heat and pressure, the " Landbauplastic " (KPL) changes color and transforms into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, including a new car and sport chains.
At the top of the 105 walks there is the top of the mountain.
At about 500 meters, literary coffee offers us an impressive view on the city, but also the Dutch crochets and pool fibers.
These are creating an atmosphere, but especially contribute to the maintenance of the ideal level of humidity of the literary mountain.
Gifts for the New soul
"This is amazing, but despite all the surfaces of view, this building is a model project on ecology", says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is regulated by geotherapy.
Although the mountain of books is located under a drink ring, the sun illuminates just a little time inside, even the beautiful days of time.
The wooden powders mounted through comparison to the green façade serve for sun, intercepting a large part of the radiates.
The environmental atmosphere is very pleasant.
fully automatised stores are loaded of the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the top-intelligent, has already been risked to enter into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already here.
Cynthia Bogarde, a traditional Chinese physician professor, describes even the Boekenberg as "the finally found soul" of Spijkenisse.
A few weeks ago, during the inauguration, every citizen was invited to give a book from his personal library.
This measure allowed to compose the empty of the library that was not yet completely safe (which accounted for 70,000 books today).
The concept is a success.
Radios are out of all parts.
For architect Winy Maas, " there's nothing worse than a widespread library."
"I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between each citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's only for decoration."
This is how MVRDV reached the master's discipline, called, in the professional garden, "the creation of identity".
Spijkenisse wrote a new page of literary history.
Even if it can appear young and little educated.
It is finally a new start point for the birth of identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a greater role."
Germany has chosen the abstention during the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, the expert of relations between the United States and the EU, this decision put Berlin into a delicate political situation.
German Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had announced its intention to vote against the request of Palestinians to obtain the observer state status to the United Nations.
But then she chose the abstention.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve what the Israelites did in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be careful, since it has special relationships with Israel.
But I also think that it does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to confirm its independence, however, to be too critical towards Israel.
When the insurance in Libya of March 2011, Germany had also chosen the abstention during the vote on the establishment of an air exclusion zone.
Finally, NATO implies that measure.
Is Germany difficult to adopt a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason is that Berlin is in revision of its external policy, trying to get away from a policy to thus defined by the Americans and to establish a German external policy.
Furthermore, the lack of coherent and common policy within the Union complies the situation.
The Germans therefore have a number of fronts.
We are waiting for them to play an independent role, but they are not habitats there.
I believe they still thatone to find this role, but they are on the way of a foreign policy "more normal".
A external policy such as in France or Britain
What then exactly means the term "normal" for the Germans?
It shows the will of adopting independent positions from the United States and European partners, including in respect of national documents.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, therefore by exports and relations with certain regions such as Russia, China and the Near East.
The German economic interests are in a certain measure different from those of the other major powers: this is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests affected Germany ' s position for conflict in the Near East and the abstention in the vote of the United Nations?
Germany had first important parts in the Near East, especially in the Golf countries.
This is why Berlin must be guarded not to defeat public opinion, but also to the elites of the Arab countries.
There is no doubt that this is a determinant element.
However, I would not agree to be too important, because it is not just a single relationship.
But in any case, it is a determinant element in the German strategic reflections.
Is Germany night with his relations with the United States by choosing the abstention when important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think Europeans and Americans understand perfectly the German position.
That is why I think that fraction is not so serious that it was in the case of Libyan matter.
Maybe even Germany will be more respected.
Indeed, Germany showed that it should be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests should be taken into account.
In Europe, the opinions on the Palestinian initiative are different.
On the contrary, the United States announced their voice of a clear voice.
Are these opinions different between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences because of the American internal political scene.
I believe that the Obama Administration is secretly proving a great understanding about the European position.
But in view of the country's political configuration, the government cannot, of course, defend its position publicly.
I think the real differences of opinions are not so large that they always look like it.
If you look at the relationships between Obama and the first Israeli Minister Netanyahou, you will not be able to observe that Obama is far away from enthusiasm towards Netanyahou's policy.
Is Germany difficult to conciliate its close relationships with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the large European partners, on the other hand?
I think that's not easy for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little more simpler for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, but today it is not the case.
They cannot therefore be inscribed in a broader political line and have to confirm their unique position.
That is what they do today in the question of the euro.
I believe that Germany will take the future a role of locomotive and encourage Europe to adopt a European position.
This is not simply for Germany, in particular because of the relationships with Israel.
This question has always been delicate.
But I think that the Germans are well aware of the fact that they must play a role that marks more their independence.
Is Germany looking at playing a role of weight actors on the international scene, and Germany only wants to play a key role?
Or do it always have difficulties to play first plan roles?
Germany has not always been habitat, and it is still uncomfortable, and for evident reasons, the country is still trying to play a more important role.
For instance, if the euro crisis is seen, it is noted that, at each time Germany decides to worry more, many anti-Americ feelings are heard.
It's not easy for the Germans.
In fact, it is always the same problem: we do not want to be covered by hostile countries.
Germany is in a very delicate position than the United States.
It must compose with neighbors and very different opinions, and it is not easy.
Today, the impact of the United States on European policy is only to reduce, but now the EU does not comply with this empty, then who is it?
The Germans will simply play a more important role.
And even if it's not pleased to them, even if it's unpleasant to them and if they are just less appreciated, it's life!

"Marke Protection" in China: when Puma and Armani becomes suddenly Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are known in the world.
Armani Polo... what's really the matter?
Next this name is hidden an officially put mark in China, but that has nothing to see with the original company.
The brand played such a protection as the enterprises who carry the name cannot be complained.
And even if she could, it's not sure that she would win the cause.
"It is more difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," explains Thomas Pattloch, lawyer of the Taylor Wessing Office, specialized in violation of the right of ownership in the eastern East.
Each week, a new file arrives on my desk.
The imitators need only a few additional letters to be able to register their brands.
Thus, instead of Gucci, we register Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, we register Prada-Kny.
German enterprises are also copyed in all the legal equality, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sports articles.
Pattloch opens a class in which the records were made at the Pekin Marks Office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company posted the Zegna DF Puma mark, a firm name which was artificially created by a part of the name of Herménegildo Zegna, the mode house.
It is known that the Chineses have become the champions of the world's copy and violation of the intellectual property.
In the large cities, commercial centres are found at several floors that are only sell in contrafactors.
However, Pattloch's cases are different: his commanders are loading to attack the fact that the Chinese Marks Office officially confers to Chinese enterprises the right to use a namement that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speaks of "Bang Mingpai", of the parent mark.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
This is the term that women are appointed to marry with rich men.
Chinese authorities say nothing to reprove.
"That's bad for business, we need to fight this trend," says Pattloch.
"The brand is edulcorated, the uniqueness is disappeared, the reputation degrees are huge."
Financial losses and justice costs are in millions for the sectors concerned, especially in respect of cost-free farm products.
According to the CLSA market analysis company data, China represents, with an annual volume of EUR 15 billion, the third world market of luxury products and the most rapidly developed.
However, it is not easy to raise the suspicious records of the mark register and costs these procedures.
These lasts can duration up to nine years, and the waste is never certain.
Pattloch reported the proceedings in which the court rejected the complaint, as after a long period, the criticized designation became a "market reality".
Pattloch explains to us that if the complainant has no chance, it may even be obliged to pay money to the plagiaire because he would be naked to his mark in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.
Religious cases also relate to graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the Sany channel machine manufacturer, the same company that came to save the manufacturer of beton Putzmeister pumps.
This is the reason why Chineses can use a emblem that is similar to the Mercedes star.
Geely, Volvo's purchaser, used before a blue and white logo that remembered the BMW. The conflict was resolved and Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste Model House had lost against Hong Kong and Singapore's plagiarys that had reorientated the view of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of nothing.
However, the CTMO Marks Office in Peking admits that there were some difficulties in 2010 because of the lack of staff and space.
However, the office would be held in the last year of a "emergence situation in the labour movement to a recovery normality".
Thus, the number of non-trained opposition procedures would have decreased by 22%.
About 57.000 cases of this type would have been closed, which represents an increase of 75% compared to the previous year.
However, 81.500 procedures remain afflicted to the office.
Cost action
As often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1,4 million mark deposit requests, almost a third of which was more than 2010.
According to the office, it is a record and this means that China is the tenth consecutive of the classification for the number of new deposites in the world.
This would also be for the total number of legal marks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the office would have accounted for 1.8 billion yuan registration law.
In other words, each record reported in average EUR 1,280 yuan, or EUR 160.
A more legal battle costs, such as the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For over seven years, the company fights against a Chinese plagiaire.
Of course, the Germans have obtained that the illegal manufacture of vehicle components should be suspended.
However, the employer could maintain his Chinese rights on the Freudenberg mark.
"This is our fault, because family names cannot be protected in Germany," Hanno Wentzler, President of the Directorate of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Marks Office therefore rejected the objection of the Munichs.
Freudenberg has certainly gained a cause from the following two institutions, but the opposite party continues to fight until now.
Surveillance is placed
Today, the case is in possession with the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is trusting, he believes in a positive issue of the prosecution and benefits the professionalism of judges.
However, he adds: "The procedure is long, tried and costs much time and money."
It is also difficult to evaluate the internal costs. Archive services had even to review the acts of the last hundred years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg had even proposed a "grand sum in euros to six figures" to resolve the crime.
"This is what we see what this represents for us," says Wentzler.
The dangers of the Extreme-East are even threatening to disappear to Europe.
This would be the case if the imitators of this region would be the exploitation of non-protected marks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to put the name of Freudenberg in Germany for a chair and kitchen production company.
The company had long abandoned this sector, but she had even been able to prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "The monitoring is deployed."
Pattloch and he advises German enterprises to prove a great carefulness in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough to fill to the international marks law, foreigners should, instead, "register all that is possible to be protected," says Wentzler.
The costs may be much more important than those in the register.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses the battle during the last act of his legal drama, the company should pay license rights to the counterparty for the use of his own name, as explains Wentzler.
Or then we lose our place on the market segment concerned.
World Day of fight against AIDS: shooting, sing, help
Chorale Imbongi repeated in Heidelberg, and the AIDS orphans of Swaziland are pleased to come.
This is the story of a link that is much more than a distance of 8.733 km.
First, the feet is shooted: cowboy bottles, baskets, scarpins for ladies and mocasins for men are looking for the rhythm in touching the ground of the feet. They find it so fast.
One, two, three, four.
Then, the voices of the songers are slow - high, low, dark and above -, they bring themselves, swimming and follow.
Fiete Hopf, 29-year-old orchester chief, almost lost his shoes when he directed the orchestra with his skins of a wild sweet.
We are Thursday night, Chorale Imbongi repeats a new song in the music room of the Heidelberg Medical Psychology Institute.
Fifty songs and songs from 23 to 69 years of age have come from the genetics in human doctors at home.
"On'Obani" is not an easy piece, each chorist has different words, all in a very exotic language: the sallou, a language speaked by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and in some regions of Swaziland.
Be helped to help
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, estimates that 34 million people around the world are attracted from disease.
23.5 million live in South Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 infections.
Furthermore, over 40% of the population is severe.
180 orphelins of the AIDS village of Esitjeni found parraines in Germany thanks to the "Voices for Africa".
70 of them are frequently a secondary educational institution.
For 15 or 20 euros, it is possible to be parrained.
This sum guarantees the child's money for school, a school uniform and a warm daily food at the Gogo Centre.
Imbongi means in slaughter "contor of history" or even more "good songer".
Nobody can speak well the swimming language in this region, but everyone can sing it.
For nearly 10 years, the chorale repeats the songs in this foreign language that she brought to Germany to make it to its national region: South Africa.
Because at 8,733 miles (8,733 km) from Heidelberg Island, northwest of the Swaziland Kingdom, it is the village that depends on the vocabulary power of the German chorale.
40 per cent of people reached
The village has about 2,000 people, some living in a modest swimming ball or land and most of them are children.
More than 300 are orphelins, since HIV has brought their parents.
In Esitjeni, there can be a smaller scale of males that enable Swaziland: the highest HIV infection rate and the lowest life hope in the world according to UNICEF.
Population is almost never accepted by male circumcision, a measure which, however, guarantees a decreased reduction in the risk of half-infection.
More than 40% of the population in Swaziland is deported from immunodeficiency virus and it is not rare to die in the middle of the trend.
When a group journey in Africa in spring 2005, the chariot was able to discover the village. The Imbongis especially saw many children in the street that had missed not only parents’ care but also all: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without school diploma, there is no prospect.
At the beginning, only some persons who were able to pay a few euros every year so that they could send a child to school and provide a warm food a day.
But until a year later, the chorale founded "Voices for Africa", a association that has been careful for almost professional ways of the AIDS orphans.
Feeds on sexually transmissible infections
What are the most common sexually transmissible diseases?
Among bacterial ISTs, syphilis, clamdides and blennorragie (or gorgeed).
The current IST is HIV, human papilom virus, genetic herpes or hepatitis.
The powder and the galle belong to the parasitarian IST.
What are the mainly relevant groups?
Syphilis and blennoragie often appear in men who have sexual relations with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute believes that sexual contacts between men are at least four cases of syphilis on five declared in Germany.
In the heterosexual adults, infections related to chlamdides, trichomonase, candidasis (fongic), blennorragie and human papillome virus are commonly transmissible diseases.
The rate of HIV propagation between heterous adults is relatively low in Germany, however, some 20% of the new HIV infections are observed in this group.
In young people, there is a higher rate of infections related to chlamides than in other population groups.
According to European residents, the three quarters of all infections relate to youths from 15 to 25 years of age.
Moreover, in Germany, human papillome virus is common in youth.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not obliged to declare all sexually transmissible diseases.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of cases of syphilis has been more than a double in 10 years: the number passed from 1.967 in 2001 to 3.698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections decreased.
In 2011, there were about 2.700 cases.
This represents a decrease of a tenth compared to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of sexual disease?
Infectional diseases can cause abuses at the level of genetic organs, urinary pain, white losses, low wind pain, and the appearance of buttons and cuts.
However, they do not regularly cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How can you protect yourself?
Preservatives may reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect to 100%.
The reason is that pathogenic agents of sexually transmissible diseases may also be transmitted by lubrifiant infection or by close corporate contacts.
As a result, experts recommend each person who often changes sexual partners to regularly review.
The majority of the rapidly disappointed ISTs can be healed and the late sequences can be avoided.
Thanks to the discussions, donations, but especially to the funds that gather the shoes through the whole Germany, the means are cumulated.
"In all, we already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, Association President.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a safe woman of himself and who always gets what she wants, managed the money from Germany.
It also ensures that orphans are well achieved, in one of their grandmothers, for example.
Gogos, so we call old women in saloo, are the village pilars.
Some of them welcome up to 14 orphelins, they offer them a toilet and carefully make them a day-day time at school in their uniforms.
The orphelin that has no more is welcomed in a safe place, at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as well as the two cushioners who prepare them every day for more than 200 children afflicted.
Furthermore, "Voices for Africa" has created a colture school and allowed the construction of two polars. With the concours of the American Health Organization for PSI, the association organized HIV detection test for many people.
This will not be self-employed, as even if disease is well visible in the whole country, it remains a subject of tabu.
One king and his 14 wifes
"The AIDS is a true table," says Annette Lennartz, "for this is a subject that touchs sexuality."
It is quite curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wifes.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive life style.
Poligamia in place of democracy.
These rights sanctioned by the State, among others, are responsible for the rapid propagation of HIV observed in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also disassembled the virus through the country.
However, there are preservatives at each street round, adds Annette Lennartz, "but almost no one uses them.
The culture is different, flesh against flesh."
In order to promote some cultural exchange, the Curiests of Imbongi go together on their way every two or three years in South Africa and emphasize the emphasis of nostalgia, courage, confidence and dark identity that number of inhabitants of the black continent still know the time of the apartment.
The bus filled with whites sing in African language is a sign of recognition, such as it generates not only good humor and joy, but sometimes smells a laugh to a few redoutable border guards.
The bus always brings them to Esitjeni, where the kids visit their girls.
Even if it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni Valley.
"Come to Esitjeni, you will find the light there," people say there.
And after a trip of 8.733 miles [8.733 km] of bird flight, back to Heidelberg, the shooting shooting shooting in the Bergheimer Street, it is also found the light.
Messenger: NASA will discover the glass presence on Mercure
The Messenger's survey reported evidence of the ice existence on the Mercure planet.
The glass swimming pool could reach 20 meters of swimming.
The NASA American Space Agency has proved the existence of ice on the Mercure Planet.
Although this planet is nearest of the sun, it refers to the heat water, as explains three studies published this Thursday in the specialized "Science".
The Messenger's survey reported evidence of the existence of a glass cover in the shadow area.
This cover would be a spacing of at least 30 cm that could go up to 20 meters.
The water is probably from cometes or maybe asteroids that had been heating Mercure.
Nevertheless, there is no link between the discovery of water and the hypothesis of a life presence on the planet, explains the scientist in head of the Messenger son, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercure can reach 426 degrees of Celsius.
The discovery could help to understand how water and other essential elements of life have occurred in other regions of the sun system.
Unexpected people of our planet, sounds, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, such as small interstitions through which the infinite is observed.
The image comes from a photo device developed by German researchers from the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our sun system, as well as the native planet Cerès.
As Pluton, who orbits around the sun behind Neptune, Celeste is not considered a planet, according to the new definition of the 2006 International Astronomic Union.
This detail of a infrared photography taken by the telescope Spitzer shows a "faming port" of innumerable star generations: the oldest stars are in blue and the red points, more difficult to identify, are the "new-borns" in the universe's accommodation room.
The telescope Spitzer discovered this region where the stars are born, baptized "W5", a well-known name, in the constellation of Cassiopée, at 6.500 light-year-old years.
The NASA Spitzer Telescope photod the flamboying star of a star in death.
The circle in the form of beignet is composed of elements that the star designed when it dies.
In the Nebulous Trifide, at 5.400-year-lights of the Earth, gas and powder forms new stars.
Spitzer's telescope has photod this galactic accommodation room.
The Pleiades, stars loved also called "the seven sisters", can be observed at the null eyes during the night.
However, the telescope has more colours in value.
On this red picture, Helice's nebulous, like a red eye, look directly at the spectator.
It is a 700-year light-year in the Verseau constellation.
His similarities with a earth-wide continent have valued the title of North America.
The combination of the normal photo and the infrared photo allows to observe a thick spectacular.
Only the infrared detectors of the telescope Spitzer could capture an image of the new star in its entire beauty.
One of the largest emblems of the astronomy is about the creation of Saturne's rings.
One theory is that the ananals are the remains of a Saturne's moon that disappeared 4,5 billion years ago without leaveing traces.
One of the largest and net photos that have taken the Hubble telescope is the of the Tourbillon galaxie.
According to the thickness, photos of spiral galaxies may become true art works.
The photo published by the European Australian Observer shows the Trifide Nebulous in the Sagitator's constellation, a number of thousands of light-years.
The name of Trifide comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divised, shared in three), because three powder tranches divide the heart from the place of birth of the stars.
Astronomen photod the prims of a cosmic characterization in the Serpentar constellation: at 400 million light years of the Earth, two fusion galaxies precipitate to each other, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble Telescope observed the birth of these stars in the spirale galaxy M83.
If you don't like technical abreviations, you can use its "Austral Fire Road" surname.
The photo of the spatial telescope Hubble shows a detail of the nebulous of Iris, in the constellation of Cephée.
The nebulous is 1,400-light-year-old and is composed of powder grains that are a hundred times smaller than the current home powder.
This photo was developed from the optical and radiographic clips taken by different telescopes.
There can be seen the circle composed of black troops that is located at 430 million light years of the Earth.
Space Telescope photod this group of galaxies baptized Arp 273 for NASA.
Scientists named the largest spirale galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebulous, youth star group is the most luminous of our lacquered way.
The heavenly beast always born new stars.
These star clouds, which are linked to the Rosette's nebulous, also create young stars to 5,000-luminous Years of the Earth.
In this galaxy on light radiates and lost from a small black strike, there is no powder yet, there is only gas.
Scientists think that he's born little after the age, when the universe was composed of hydrogen in most parts.
Our view on the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope would have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galilee uses it a year later to observe the stars.
Since the views of optical telescopes have not stopped breast-feeding and thanks to them, it was possible to see more far in the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Palomar Mountain Observatory, near San Diego, was the largest telescope of the world.
The look on this image had a diameter of five metres.
In Arizona, in the United States, the Binocular Telescope Large.
It allows to observe the universe through two views with each diameter of 8.4 metres.
The wind of the Great Canary Telescope in La Palma, on Canary Islands, is great. The look at him only reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The view of South African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmentated in order to make economies.
The diameter reaches the same around 11 metres.
The inconvenience of the economic construction method is that telescope is set at the vertical angle, which is limited to mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also set at the vertical angle level.
His personality holds its great light collection capacity.
Despite a relatively small spectrum diameter, this capacity is approaching those of the largest spectacles in the world.
Scientists listen to the universe to search for extraterrestreat signs through the Arecibo Radiotelescope (Puerto Rico).
This radiotelescope is 305 meters diameter.
Any owner of a computer can help the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "Search for Extraterrestrel Intelligence") by helping its machine calculating power.
See the Australian European Observatory (ESO), in the Chinese Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("too large telescope"), a dignified installation of his name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can light the average infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the ESO site in Chili.
His main view should reach the impressive size of 42 metres. It will be composed of about 1.000 views elements.
However, the telescope will not be able to take clips early before 2018.
By 2007, Keck's two telescopes on the Hawaii volcan of Mauna Kea were considered as the largest in the world.
They were wooden two looks of a diameter of 10 meters each.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observation that observes the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A new gigantic telescope should also be built on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of his mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration allows you to administer it.
However, the images of the most important space are from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he delivered images of the distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler is looking for exoplanets, mainly those who are habitable.
NASA announced on 2 February 2011 that she had found 1.35 candidate plans since the beginning of the mission.
This photo illustrates the last preparations before the launch of the space telescope Kepler.
Space Telescope James-Webb (JWST) will be sent to the space as early as 2018 at the edge of Ariane 5.
The first view of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
The telescope will, in particular, be able to find the light designed by the first stars and galaxies after the swimming pool.
Scientists think that the South Mercure pool also opens the glass.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, as Messenger orbits well closer to the North of Mercure pool.
Radar data have been identified for decades of ice presence on Mercure.
Thanks to the launching of the Messenger audio in 2004, the first to orbit around Mercure, scientists now have the certainty of it.
Get daily bottle drink, and live until 168 years
In the South of Azerbaijan, many people reach dignified ages of the Bible's patriarchs.
There is even a museum of long-evity.
An investigation on a country, where there is still a relatively young to 97 years.
In the South of Azerbaijan, many people reach dignified ages of the Bible's patriarchs.
There is even a museum of long-evity.
An investigation on a country, where there is still a relatively young to 97 years.
The journey in the Talysh mountains is a scattered romanticism.
Over the many rounds of the road, the small bus swimming along the bottled collines, torrental rivers and modest firms.
Everything is green and fat, we would almost believe in the Black Forest.
But we are here in the deep South of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is just a few miles [2 km].
It is here that the Vatican ethnical group of Talysh's name, about which we don't know great-chose, if they are perfectly talking about Persan and Aéri and they have a very long-term evity.
Lerik.
The small cities with its too aggressive architecture of the Soviet era that does not agree with the pintoric mountain landscape.
The European tourists are rare here, the traffic from the capital of Azerbaijan, Bakou, is too punishable.
We need eight hours to pass the 323 miles [323 km] because the road is only one way.
The province has not yet benefited from the legendary riches that the country must have its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48 years old, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist.
"Bakuu has become famous in May thanks to the Eurovision concours, and the next year, there will be the festival of the oldest people in the world," explains Fatulayeva.
It is direct from the museum of long-evity, the only museum of the world.
We can discover the life of about eight decades of Talysh in the region that have more than 100 years. Fatulayeva shows us a black and white photo.
Here's my grandfather, he reached 120 years old.
Against a child at 136 years
But the opposite star of the museum is Shiirali Muslumo, a herd who had 168 years of age.
However, there is no act of birth.
And when it is thought that the oldest person documented had 122 years of age, Muslumov's age seems more than doubtless.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," Specific Fatulayeva.
The man would have married three times and had 23 children, 136 years old, he would still design a girl.
Should Shirali Muslumous be inflicted in a few decades by calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Rostock Max-Planck Institute, also heard of the man at the great age of Central Asia.
"Their wonderful old people also live in some regions of China, Japan, or in the valley of Hunza in Pakistan," explains Scholz, "in Sardinia also there are men who live unbelievablely old."
However, it is impossible to establish a scientific evidence due to the existence of documents without having a civil status register.
Each day, a fonded barbecue drink
It is, however, that people in the Lerik region often reach a dignified age of the Bible’s patriarchs.
Today, 20 people have more than 100 years.
What is therefore the reason for long-evitation in the south of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the arari tourist guide, explains that Talysh has special genes.
On the contrary, Fatulayeva, the museum leader, thinks it's a matter of food.
However, it does not seem to be pleasant, from a nutritional point of view, that the rich foods in the Talysh heat, which loves flesh, bread, and especially milk products, and whose many drink each day a fonded drink, are good for health.
Or is this the simple life mode that preserves youth? In Cengemiran, a small village near Lerik city, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
With 97 years of age, she is relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wood house, as it is typical to see it in the whole Caucase region.
She's sit on the ground next to a west, which shoots the content unlawfully.
Eight people live here under a single toilet, among which one of Mirzayeva's sons and a girl, who are for years adults.
Two little kids also play in the house.
In the kitchen, the tea is prepared for invitations to serve in typical weapons as a ventre.
The white dents of Mirzayeva are perfectly aligned, and under its folk they hide long treasures of a blond that his son reveals us with fierity.
I always laid my hair with milk, and so I never lost them and they keep their color.
"I never used shampooing," adds Mirzayeva.
The monthly retreat is sufficient to live
She has always eating what comes from her own firm: tomates, land pommes and small fish.
For all my life, I never bought the smallest food in a supermarket.
Then she talks about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after World War II.
But everything improved when the "good father" Heydar Aliyev took the commands.
The language of propaganda is in the mouth of a old woman.
However, the worship of the paternal figure of the nation, a man who, however, directed his country as a dictator, did not know almost the limits in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, his son Ilham succeeded after him.
Whatever it is, the older people of Azerbaijan do not know the pain.
Mirzayeva receives 1 monthly 230 manits (circa the same amount as in euros) for its retrait, a sum that guarantees a good life train in the region.
And maybe the son of Mirzayeva has reasoned: "the elderly are playing great respect in our culture".
They are the center of the big family, they are loved, careful and happy.
That's a good reason to live as long as possible.
Human Rights Opposed in the Constitution
Revolution renews Cairo.
Rival manifestations reveal the deep part of the country.
The project of Constitution based on the chariot is violently controversed.
The Egyptian President is not aware of emotions.
We have to be successful.
"And this success is my responsibility towards the people and to God," he said to the state television.
His speech was intended to the whole people, but especially to the Christian Cops, the Liberals, the Light and Lay.
Because all members of the confusion and unsuccessful opposition are afraid.
They fear a theocratic on the Nil in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brothers.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost apologizing, having temporaryly limited the competences of the Constitutional Court and extending the "to save the revolution".
However, Egyptians and the world do not really know what to save this 61-year-old engineer, titled by a doctor of the United States University of South California.
Does the judicial power be turned into?
The 234 articles issued to the host by the Meeting constituting more than 100 Islamic persons at a night force tour of 15 hours are effectively worried in a certain measure.
As in previous constitutions, the project prescribes that the jurisprudence refers to "the principles of Islamic law".
But what really does the word "principes" mean?
It was and it remains a question of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that Islamists use the vague formulation and the margin of legal handling which is dealt with to apply a more strict interpretation of the chario.
In any case, it is that it takes a new article introducing that, as regards all the subjects touching the chariot, the Al-Azhar University must be consulted. The institution is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its eclairs on the entire Sunnite Islamic world.
This may, however, not forcedly mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative instrument, which would actually lead to the entire establishment of the judicial power.
Many points in the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation
Another questional aspect is the likely maintenance of the military court.
During the rule of Moubarak, these courts were employed to repress the opponents.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The State must also be read in the project, protecting "the real nature of the Egyptian family" and "promoting its moral and values".
From a legal view, the formulation is so slow that State institutions may even control the content of cinematography and literature.
Of course, it would only work with censure.
Furthermore, no article guarantees the equality of men and women.
Instead of that, another article prohibited to open or disseminate the prophet Mahomet or his sentences.
On the contrary, the article does not define what is a crime or how it must be punished.
Any doubt is the formulation that lets you hear that it is prohibited to "open people".
Is it enough to draw a load of the President or tell a slaughter in the detriment of a lawful man?
Many points are therefore to be interpreted in the project submitted to the vote, which, according to his own words, will be the subject of a referendum to the Egyptians.
"The Revolution turns back."
The opposition has been mobilized for weeks against the digital summer of Islamics.
Thursday night, tens of thousands of manifestants gathered together in an inhabitual agreement on the Tahrir place in Cairo, promised to break the chariot before she entered into force.
"The revolution renews and we will win", launched Hamdin Sababai, reaching the third to the presidential elections.
The Nobel Prize of Peace and former Chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradai said that the Constitution project was "to go into the peoples of history".
On Twitter, the immediate message service, he accused Morsi's parties to want to promote a "putsh against democracy".
"If he declares the referendum, we're going to his palace and we'll turn it back," says Jasser Said, a opponent.
"We are not yet fatigued, the blood of our brothers is not yet lost," said the Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a political man and a member of the opposition.
In addition, several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, which would lead to its nullity.
"The Coran is our Constitution."
On his side, the Muslim Confrère, well organized, called to an anti-manifestation not on the Tahrir place as a precautional precaution, but on the other river of the Nil, where a great prayer was organized before the University of Cairo.
Women who were buried and partisans of the salaphists, who participated in them, scanned: "The people claim the application of God's law."
"Lift our country!" they asked Morsi, claiming that "the Coran [their] Constitution."
A battle for sovereignty on the symbolic place Tharir, where all begins, would soon generate a similar situation as a civil war.
Of course, that's what Morsi's partisans wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brothers stated that the opposers to the Constitution project, as well as its parties, were expressed high and strong.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide by the directions of the country to take.
The project of Islamics will certainly bring the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned only once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry against this constitutional process which had had to extend until February and include all social forces.
The Advocate of Human Rights of 48 years and the President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOR) had defended the Muslim Brothers when they were in prison or before the courts under Moubarak.
He did not because he shared the world's design, but because human rights are indivisible for him.
That's why he was slaughtered, judged and imprisoned.
"And now, the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution," he regrets during his interview with the world am Sunday.
Morsi's enlargement to the three powers has disappointed the lawyer.
These measures are critical towards the democracy rules and will generate a new dictature in Egypt.
"In the place of enhancing civil society, the President denied all his powers,” said Saeda.
However, a democracy cannot work without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels long-term, including the international community, which looks at the battle between the various political ideologys on the Nil border with a mix of curiosity and nervousness.
That could be paid.
A demonstrator on the Tharir place holds: "You're coming to a monster that he's no longer possible to control you."
The Norwegian Rafisk: is it the most horrible fish in the world?
The five million people in Norway benefit from one of the highest levels of life, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Can the secret of the country ' s success be linked to the appeal of locals for extremely oweing fish?
Take advanced dusts.
Place them in the midst of a smooth and salt foot clothes.
Wait a week.
And you get the deranging shooter of the rakfisk, one of the most arrested targets of Norwegia.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, around 3 hours of Oslo.
He neighbors, the landscape is spectacular - and this odeur, all-represented, imprisons the air.
The rakfisk is composed of salt salt and fermented in the water for a period - according to the owl you want to exhale - that can go up to a year.
When the darkness is installed and it is cold, the Norways gather in mass to attend a festival here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this unbelievable culinary speciality.
"You eat crudely, then you'll have a aquavit drink," explains Havard Halvarsen, full-time local pump, which is also called "Raakfisk General", responsible for the festival management.
We're around, people get small pieces of fish and cover a large amount of wood.
"Child people prefer aquavit to the Rafisk", adds Havard.
The wood kills the wooder.
I'm trying some pieces.
If you can avoid taking it under your nest, it's not bad - it's going to think about a suicide that had been over a long hours in a bus.
Rafisk was far away at a time when Norwegia was poor, before the refrigerator was invented, the fish was shocked in east water barriers, then slowed in autom.
Then, during the winter, once well fermented, the fish is out and - without any doubt with the senses of amedindris by the alcohol - eating.
At the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mainly migrating to the United States.
Today, populations are rapidly developed - more than 13 per cent are immigrants affected by full employment, high wages and a full health system.
The Swedish, their old rivals whose country was not so rich than Norway, crossed the border to come to work.
The rakfisk is considered something important, a vital element, even though, of the past of Norway.
This is part of the cheapest plates.
But everything is nice - a small blue pipe or a sandwich will cost you 10 € each.
Norwegia does not often speak of it in international times, but it is not for him to move.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the extremely right racist who attacked 77 people, including women and children.
When they say this murder, they talk about "the incident of July 22."
Norwegians have been angry to accept that in their peaceful country, one of them could have made such a barbaric act.
Since the beginning of the 1970s, Norway has to be rich to its oil and gas industry, one of the most important ones in the world.
"But the oil is not the only reason that justifys our success," explains Anna, our servant, the blonde hair and the eyes of a transparent blue, the image of the northern well-being, with a rakfisk plate in the hand.
We are - how you say - careful people.
His English, as the majority of the people who live here, is perfect.
We're disappointed, we don't like to note.
Norwegia has managed its oil riches with a lot of prudence – all, except a low amount of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries spend the money through the windows, in the years that have led us to the international financial crisis, Norway has maintained the cordons of its well-bears.
"When we can ski in winter and make the randon in the past, we're happy," says Anna.
"It's to forget the rakfisk," adds it to an insofarable ride.
I'm cut down under the snow and I'm doing the cheese to buy me what to eat - I had my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a hamburger composed of alan, a real discovery, is excellent.
But tonight, the fisherer's all over.
The hotel in which I stay is one of the many places where we serve Rafisk for dinner and where we can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the most hot among them.
There is a TV emission where the presenter takes a pavillon, rounded by rakfisk seats.
We would believe in the competition of the Eurovision.
"What score have you given to the best fish in the mountains of Thor-Juergen?"
"Here on the point, Havard."
We hear rise and applause.
A man fell from his chair, maybe because of aquavit abus.
Or maybe it's because of fish emanations.
Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto knows a difficult start.
While the President of Enrique Pena Nieto is prepared to take his functions in Mexico, Will Grant, from BBC, is interested in the difficulties expecting it and the expectations of the people, which are many.
The road traffic in Mexico is particularly bad at the current time.
In a town where shipments are legioned in normal time, a security bar has been established since Monday, blocking several key road access in the capital and caused real chaos on the roads.
However, the goal was not to prevent people to make up their work but to prevent the manifestants to reach Parliament.
The next Saturday, the new President of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidency to become the new President at the head of the nation.
A complicated task is expected.
The economy of Mexico is well-established, the results of the President-in-Office of Felipe Calderon, but the country is under drug war which has already costed about 60,000 people in six years.
"My Government has made the commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," Mr. Pena Nieto said to President Barack Obama in the Ovale Office this week a few days ago.
I will propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal.
Before counterparting the President of the United States, Mr. Pena Nieto was a Governor of the Mexican State.
A very poor and tentative state that enters the capital. On his prediction land, the opinions about this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the bucolic Common Valle del Bravo, for example, it is registered in the memory of all.
Locations are attributed to the development of tourism and infrastructure in the community.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new authors of Mr Pena Nieto, a significant improvement has been made to these roads, then bosseld and full of crevas.
wooding plates of his name are increased outside a new sportive complex and a impressive interactive museum that describes climate change.
"We count on him to establish sustainable changes," said his friend, Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the Congress and part of Mr. Pena Nono, the PRI.
In terms of security and economy, in particular, we hope a real change that our country needs so much.
After 81 years without the power, the PRI was developed in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The member of the Congress Olvera admits that, after 12 years old outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are a lot of expectations within the party regarding Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the criticism of opponents reproaching the new Chairman's lack of charism.
He's a whole, very active man, with a great vision of the country.
He's an excellent stateman, and he can, above all, listen.
However, it is not always the image that people of their former Governor have.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known under the name of Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the swimming streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more flavoring.
Cached under the autophones of the authors, it is, in particular, a bathroom of the city of Mexico.
And municipality problems are also concrete and urban.
Before the year, military forces were called to fight drug gangs in the neighbors, and women's violence is particularly serious.
In a narrow area, the body of tens of women killed in the past two years was found in the shipping area.
More than 1.000 women were killed in the Mexico state while Mr. Pena Nieto was dominant, a higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez, a tristely famous place for the number of innocent women who have been killed there.
Mr. Pena Nieto's delegators say that instead he has failed to end the problem of murdered against women when he was in function.
In worse, they accused its administration of refused to see the reality in face.
In a beton house, typical of this swimming neighborhood, Irina Buendia fights to keep her laugh when she shows me photos of her swimming daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version was a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
"When I came home to her, he seemed to me that his body had been laid", says Mrs. Buendia.
Signs indicated that she was struck, and the body strict was already loved.
While his mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana has the wall, next to a cross where the word is: Justice.
However, this is exactly what the family has seen to refuse.
The authorities treated me as if I was a old manner, a problem fault, a smile.
They want us to accept what they're saying and we're kidding.
"But it is not normal that there are so many irregularities and oppositions," she stated.
When President Pena Nieto receives its samedie escape, the President will comply with a very responsibilities.
Decades of thousands of families were affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years, and the new President promised that it would be priority during his mandate.
"I hope he'll be so good as the President and when he was a Governor," Olvera said in Valle del Bravo, a member of the Congress.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza are worried most.
Bradley Manning has not claimed to be badly treated, claiming lawyers.
Prosecutors try to oppose maltraction revendications that Bradley Manning had been victim of the detention.
The prosecution is on the detention of Manning in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
Defence wants to classify the case as a reason for the sequestration of Manning in extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of having issued thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to demonstrate, on Thursday, that the soldier Bradley Manning -- accused of being the largest fleet of confidential information from the whole history of the United States army -- missed many occasions of complaining about the bad treatments he claimed to have been subjected to his military detention.
When an interrogator with Manning, a preliminary hearing at Ft. Meade, Maryland, the Procureur of Maj. Ashden Fein stated that weekly visits by officers received Maning during its nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia did not reveal any complaint on his treatment.
The counter-interrogation -- during a hearing, the defence submitted a request for the Maning case to be classified by the reason that the sequence has been made in extremely difficult conditions and made sufficient punishment -- took place a day after Manning demonstrated his will to suicide during his detention.
This analysis of military information, arrested in June 2010, was accused of derogating thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was their source.
During the Friday hearing, Fein examined with Manning the forms that the officers were filled after their meeting with Manning during his detention in the military prison of Quantico, where he was submitted to a maximum prison isolation of July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked questions to Manning and reported their answers.
When Fein expressed the forms, Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment that he had reserved his guards was "excellent" and that the treatment he had had had in the prison was generally "too professional".
The formulars do not have any complaint for bad treatment, although the officers directly interrogated on his carceral treatment, said Fein.
Manning answered that he had orately expressed concerns about some problems and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and said that they would take care of it, but they did not realize the problems.
"They wrote "no problem" (only addressed the concerns), and so it did not mean that I had not raised problems", said Manning.
The military judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not been complained of his treatment during a meeting in January 2011 with the Special Committee that was meeting to evoke the suicide thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months before.
Manning answered that his intention during the meeting was to modify its restrictive status indicating a "risk of damage".
Military said that they had assigned him this restrictive status - a level below the monitoring approached for the risk of suicide - for the protection and security of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was fine, and I wanted to take this status to benefit from a better quality of life of my view," said Manning.
Manning witnessed on his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was arrested for about two months before being transferred to the military prison of the Military Corporation in Quantico, Virginia, July 2010.
He said that he was thinking of suicide when he was in Kuwait and was shocked once because of heat.
He added that the fact that it was not held to know what he would happen or what happened in the rest of the world was very anxious.
"My world was reduced in Camp Arafjon at this castle," said Manning, Thursday.
I thought I would die in this cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning said that he had passed the most clear time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only objects he had was a math, coverage, tongues, clothes and his luxury.
He tried to stay moved, because sleeping or staying long during the day was contrary to the regulation.
Manning also explained that when he tried to sleep, he had a light in the eyes, slowed outside his cell.
If the guards didn't see his face when he returned the night, they wake up to see his face.
The lawyer of Manning issued a formal complaint for the treatments taken by Manning in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, April 2011.
On Thursday, the judge also put questions to Manning about a allegation reported in his Tuesday witness -- that after being forced to sleep all night in her cell in Quantico, it was forced to keep up for the gardens and other detentors a morning during the call.
Manning showed that at any time he was not allowed to cover with a cover during the call.
During the questions of the judge, Friday, Manning said he had decreased the order of his guard that he had to leave his cover that would have been able to hide his nudity, but he acknowledged that no one had commanded to shoot him.
Manning witnessed on Thursday he had been forced to sleep in the past night, because he would have tried to prove a officer that he wasn't a danger for himself.
Manning would have said to the office that he could use the elastic of his slip or his tongues to hurt, but he had not done it.
In that night, Manning witnessed that his subventions, his tongues, and his lunetts had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take account of the experiences he had experienced during his detention and that it would considerably reduce his sentence if it should be recognised before a martial court, a case which should be held in the beginning of the next year.
Defence stated that Manning intended to be punishable for the less serious crimes and to fight for other extreme loads.
The hearing should be re-examinated with contractors who should argue that the detention conditions were justified.
Pentagone confirmed that Manning was incarcered in accordance with the Regulation which regulates the conditions for all detention in Quantico.
The chiefs of accusing against Manning include the flight of public goods or documents, the confusion with the enemy, providing the illicit publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information on national defence.
If all guilty leaders are reserved, it supports the perpetual criminal reconciliation.
My identity crisis mexico-American
He said many have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
The Mexicans tend to blame those who have gone; they remember the difficult periods in Mexico, said it.
Navarrette said that the Mexicans have been taken among two worlds.
When a recent journey in Mexico came to the hall, before customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
The panks were two ways: one for the "Mexicans" ("Mexicans"), one for the "Extranjeros").
I remained immobile for several seconds, don't know what file I'm leading.
I grew up in the centre of California, where I was called "Mexican" all my life.
This is an ethnical qualification, as well as the one that my friends of Boston use when they say "Ireland", or my friends of New York when they say "italy".
Then I became a Mexican American.
But here, it was Mexico.
And, on the earth that saw birthing my grandfather, there is no need for special qualification or union trading.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, enough to manage a content in one or another language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of an aunt, and I can't lose my American accent.
Then I took my American passport and I went to the "Strangers" file.
I thought at that time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their predictional themes are immigration, drug and trade.
Pena Nieto also wished to speak about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why the Mexicans could stay in Mexico instead of risking themselves in the United States.
He wants to go to the United States and Canada, and to create a Union for Trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, although he had not provided more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complex and filled with amertume.
Most Americans probably have never thought that in 1848, the United States assaulted Mexico and forced its leaders to cast half of their territory in writing at the point of fire.
But for the Mexicans, which reflect in the terms of centuries, and not for minutes, the memorys are all over.
So, as an U.S. official makes the less critical towards Mexico, you're starting to hear -- in Mexico's press, and among the elites -- complaints about how Americans have reached their neighbourhood.
And Montezuma's children are looking for the bagar.
However, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is the country with more than 35 million Americans living in the United States.
Do you want us to discuss the issue of the ambulance?
There's a lot.
Mexico has its winners and losses, people for which the country offers opportunities and others for which the country does not offer it.
The only reason that explains the great number of mexican ancients in towns such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at a given moment, in our genealogic tree, a person, perhaps a parent or a grand-parent, has found no opportunity to Mexico and had to go to the North.
And most often, this person corresponded to a type of profile -- a skin skin, little taught, it was a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we live now in the United States dream, we're going to good schools and we have good situations, we must never lose the American dream that we live, not the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes struck, but our loyalty is obvious.
We agree to the United States.
Furthermore, we know that a part of the mexican elite among the leader class does not love us.
The feeling is reciprocal.
We remember them a humiliating defect and they have us like if we were less and not sufficiently mexican individuals.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our relationship with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonym of failure.
If our families didn't have failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never be left.
And we wouldn't find out of the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but as lost souls.
My wife, born in Guadalajara and who legally emigred to the United States while she was a child, recalled me that there are frictions between Mexicans and Mexico, because the Mexicans are more stronger towards their identity and the Americans.
Although she is an American citizen, she feels to be part of two countries.
Furthermore, many Mexican Americans I do not know have the impression of being part of a country or another.
We worship the music of the Mexican group, the North Tigres, but also the Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of the two worlds, but we're not raised in any of the two.
In Mexico, we are considered as Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered as Mexicans.
And now, to make a little more complicated the relationship, as I learned during my stay, some mexican leaders and a part of intellectuality want to draw close to Diaspora.
They want mexican Americans to work as a rewarding embassy for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should explain to our American partners that Mexico is a superbe country that must absolutely visit and put pressure to political leaders to strengthen the relationship with Mexico.
Yeah, of course.
That won't happen.
There's too many amertumes.
And, if we consider the inequality of wage, corruption and drug-related violence, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to disblow you alone, friends.
It's normal.
If some Mexican people are still not ready to forgive the United States in the way they treated Mexico a century ago and half ago, they should therefore accept that some Americans always want to ensure how their family members have been treated so long.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Sweet, new Middle East
The stopping fire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Can there never be a sustainable peace between the Arabs and the Jews in the Middle East?
Another blood flow seems to indicate that such hope is simple.
While the same arguments were continued to know who started, ten buildings were reduced in powder; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelites were killed. For the first time, the slaughtered rocks of Gaza came near Tel-Avib, the Metropole of Israel, and the city of Jerusalem.
However, although the Israelites and Palestinians seem to be blocked in their former conflict, every around them, the Middle East is in full change.
The Arab spring has completely been flying in shocks, and the sweet or not, the Palestinians and the Israelites are trapped by this regional balling.
Maybe their fight will be a little more intensifying.
However, there are all reasons for thinking that this could help them to get out of this mortal impairment.
A war that does not lose nor winner
First, it seems to be difficult to prove optimism.
Even though the stopping of the fire was granted on November 21, the battles of this week have strengthened the force party, both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement in Gaza since 2007, will have forced the Israelites to abandon, even if Gaza has been cut off.
Having killed some of his leaders and recovered the 1,7 million of Gaza populations in one of the most poor and overwhelming clouds of the planet, Israel did not have succeeded to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas wins the land on the Western Jordan, the other part of Palestinian currently in their hands of the Fatah rivals, the other most moderate Palestinian faction.
The Hamas leaders could also say that time is their alliance.
The influence of the Arab Islamics in the world is increasingly stronger, and Hamas has become rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a regional power in full shore, once the most closest Islamic alliance of Israel, has taken and caused Hamas, as well as the Qatar, one of the most rich and most dynamic states in the Golf.
The Hamas members sworn and say that the credible Islamist is around Israel, from Lebanon, north in which Hezbollah mixed his domination, passing through Syria, where Islamic rebellies can turn Bashar El Assad, and to Jordan, where Hamas allies threatens the king.
And the most important, on the south flank of Israel, the mount of the Muslim Brothers under the Presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, from the nearest and most central of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the depot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to dedicate to Hamas.
Instead, the Muslim Brothers are cousins of the Hamas, and their leaders make it easier to the public opinion.
In the future diplomacy, Hamas can be evacuated as an important actor that could not be anymore excluded by Israel and America.
During that time, the parties in the hard line of Israel will take the contrary conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was transferred to box.
The Iron Dome interception system has proved its effectiveness and many Hamas mixes have been destroyed.
The Israelites will be able to sleep on their two ears - for a certain time.
In the terms of diplomacy, America renews its indefect support; and many European countries have emphasized Hamas to be the origin of the last vague of violence.
However, in particular Israel prospered, in particular under Binyamin Netanyahu, the first minister, who fully ignored the peace process.
Although Gaza's shoes have killed some 30 Israelites since 2004, Israel was dispersed by the suicide attacks, in particular through the separation barrier that implies on the West Jordan, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and which protects the Jewish colonies that continue to expand despite their integrity in international law.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose party Likud has fusioned with a more Belgian party, the of the leader Avigdor Lieberman at the approach of the election of January 22, has the nice party.
Why should these Palestinian fichs strive to give them a state?
If they were leading to West Jordan, wouldn't they launch rockets, as their companions did in Gaza?
It is preferable to keep them behind this wall and shoot them while they get out of the head.
Maybe the parties of the hard line will import it; but it may be that the Arab spring changes the woman.
Although Islamics taking the power in Egypt and otherwise appreciation for little Israel, their priority will be to address problems in their own countries.
The Israeli defence budget is more important than that of its four Arab neighbors meetings.
Starting a war with local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to arrange their economy.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get the fire stopped what is good - and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelites should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world that becomes more democratic, the free of the Palestinians from their right to self-determination could create a powder that is intended to explose one day in Israel's occupied territory - a little like the bus that has explosed in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression has already been democracy in the Jewish state, and the demography is exacerbating this problem as Arab population increases.
Blood missions against Gaza every two or three years to smile the Hamas will have a diplomatic price.
The two sides need to be put on the outside.
The response remains assigned by reasonable people from each side and by most of the outside world and by the newspaper: two states, with a stopping territory by Israel in exchange of security.
A small and short-term hope is that the stop of fire will give the opportunity to external people to defend this cause.
The Egyptians, who now have to end the weapons movement to Gaza, as the same as Turkey and Qatar, is better than ever to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the borders of 1967 with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs of the Foreign Countries should also make pressure on Hamas and Fatah to join themselves.
This would contribute to the creation of a Palestinian state than the next proposal for a pseudo state to the United Nations.
Mr. Obama also interested in what Israel accepted to negotiate.
During his first mandate, he did not present his own peace plan.
Returning to the White House, it seems also reiterate to establish one.
It's a very strict vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital outcome for America.
This is through a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
The laws for neutral cigarette packages have entered into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of sick organs recover the dark green packages that are all identical, whether the mark is
This law entered into force in Australia is a worldwide first, logos and colors were replaced by a dark green olive and horrible photos of sick organs and representations of children and children whose diseases were caused by the smooth smoking of their parents.
Out of different photos and health warnings, the only difference between the packages since this Saturday is the name of the mark, printed in small characters on all packages.
It is the most strict regime in the world in the field of smoke packaging.
The Federal Government stated that the goal was to dissolve young people from smoking by removing any glass representation.
Studies showed that if people have not started to smoke before 26 years of age, there is 99% of chances that they never start.
"Women when they are very young, children understand the message that the manufacturers' manufacturers have been checked through their brand image," said the Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plibersek, quoting studies, for example, that children associate the coron of a logo to a princess."
Although Australia records the lowest rate of smooth smooth in the world, and if these changes have a few effects on the benefits of multinationals, other countries consider a similar approach.
The smoke industry has pressured this law.
Tabak manufacturers said that this would restore the black market trade, which would facilitate access to less chere smokes.
"The negative consequences will develop from this legislation," said Scott McIntyre of the British American Tobacco Australia.
China's and Indonesia's false cigarriers will produce more contraface cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others said that this law had dynamicized their activities.
Sandra Ha de Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, stated that the request for smoke students, including in silicone to mask the horrible packaging, has been strongly increased two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tubacco had reacted to the law and lost before the High Court of Australia.
He stated that Zico has sold 6,000 pregnants and is expected to renew stocks.
For us, the business is good.
The only innocent, the experts say, is the popularity of social media and the planned population trace.
After a series of Australian laws prohibiting TV advertising, sportive sponsoring and the obligation to dismiss the cigarettes, the marketing of smoke is currently online.
Australia prohibited advertising on the web by businesses and local sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites to do it.
"If you work in the smoke marketing and you have only a small vitrine to promote your products, the Internet is the uncontrolled place by exception," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in the contributions of some Lambda citizens to marks on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We should ask if this is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and who has been sentenced to make a video, or whether it is an agency's marketing campaign?
British American Tobacco Australia stated that the industry focused on the new regulation in force instead of marketing.
The industry went until paying Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to respond to these new decisions of justice - these countries said to WHO that trade is injustly unfair, although no of these countries had significant trade trade with Australia.
A WTO decision should be taken in 2013.
Plibersek said that the Government had held discussions with other countries on similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to obligate the packaging warning photos in 2001.
These warnings are present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Clearest laws are currently studying in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
Photos don't worry about me.
I'm ignoring them.
"You're taking a cigarette and you're sharing the package," Victor El Hage said at the time to buy a package on which the mouth tumor photo is.
To be frank, the only reason why I'm gonna stop, it's my little girl.
James Yu, generator of the "King of the Pack tobacconist" in the centre of Sydney, said that the uniformity of packaging makes it difficult for the packing range.
"Before, I need a hour to load a colis, now, I need four hours," said Yu.
"The government was only forbidden for them a good time for all and we would say OK, it's good, we stop and put the key under the door," he added, upsetting the arms into the sky.
In a constantly connected world, it may be good to cut off.
I passed five hours in a airport during the Thanksgiving period, because our aircraft had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the arrival of another aircraft.
So I had enough time to think about the theme of the poor.
I won't lie you.
Passing a half day in a airport to wait for a flight is quite sweet, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (as you can forget the shops of free duty).
However, even more, some universities and experts specialized in child development make the slowness.
It's perfectly normal for us - and our children - to spend time in time, they say.
This forces the brain to take interesting ways, or to feed creativity.
And as most of us are constantly in front of several types of screens, we don't know the benefits of it.
So should we welcome open arms?
Yeah.
And not.
But I'll be back.
First of all, in the sense of many people, I thought it was a new phenomenon, in particular since we had more time free.
But this is not the case, Peter Toohey, Professor of Greco-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"It's very far away," he said.
On the walls of Pompei are Latin graffiti that speak the smell, they return to the first century.
Then there is the definition which we give to the innumeration.
The problem is that he has been defined and discussed in different ways, John D. Eastwood, a generous psychology professor at the University of New York in Ontario, Canada.
After having paid many publications and submitted the idea to a group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have defined their experience as an experience that "to want to do something, but without reaching themselves in a satisfactory activity."
What differs of the apathy, he says, is that the person is not in taking a job well as she wants it.
With the apathy, he says, there's no desire to do anything.
What is in the heart of the nervous, has he said, is "the interruption of the attention process, associated with malnutrition and the feeling that time passes slowly."
The nervous can be strongly like a depression.
But Professor Eastwood stated that if the two can be linked, people who are inclined to think that the problem comes from the environment or from the world, while depressed people think that the problem comes from them.
Sometimes it is possible to think that we're nervous while it's actually a concentration problem.
In the context of their study, "The Uningegged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" published in the Journal of "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues showed an older experience in which participants listened to the castle, the voice of a person in reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard, from the left room, the too high sound of a TV emission that had no report, others just heard the TV emission, and the third group did not hear the sound.
Those who heard the TV at a low-speed sound level said that they were more angry than the other two groups - they had been worried to concentrate themselves, but they did not know why, and assigned this problem of concentration to the nervous.
When you are trying to concentrate on a difficult or pregnant task, an attention interruption can lead to the nervous, said Mark J. Fenske, an accepted professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
Instead, when you do a smooth task, "Come looking at objects on a mounting chain, music can help you not smell you."
In fact, he says, now, we know that when we are tolerated or struggle, these gests, often considered as signs of renewal, are actually a good way to remain physically more alarmed.
"The studies showed that children who are allowed to gigate learn more and remain more information than those who are forced to stay without movement," said Professor Fenske.
We every day or the other - the late of my flight, a locust with a monocorn voice, a specially sweet movie.
But some people are more likely to be injured than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a "predisposition stage" in the 80s.
The scale includes confirmations such as: "Over the tasks I do, many of them are repeating and monotones", and "I have so many interest centres that I have not the time to do."
Using such a scale, researchers found that the boys tend to smell more often than the girls, Stephen Vodanovich said, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and especially need many and varied stimulations.
But in general, adolescents are slowly broken.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a individual and community development professor at the University of Illinois, conducted an experience during which he contacted about 400 adolescents and their parents seven times a day through a beeper.
He pointed out that 32% of adolescents would declare to school and during their home duties, while 23% would be declared when they were not at school.
Instead, 3 per cent of the parents declared that they were denied.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentages of today's income, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that " adolescence is a period in which it reaches its highest level", including because children and adolescents do not have a lot of control on what they want to do.
If I ask my question, is it good for you?
At times not, since in its extreme form, it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, to parish or to abuse some substances to pass time, as the study shows.
Instead, many philosophs and writers, speaking of a link between the innovative and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, which has studied the problem for over two decades.
"The nervous is the way the brain found to make you know that you should do anything else," said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at the N.Y.
But the brain does not always know what is the most appropriate thing to do.
If you smell and use this energy to play guide and kitchen, it will make you happy.
But if you look at the TV, it'll make you happy in short terms, but not long-term.
So if your child's smells and you give him a iPad, he will no longer be shocked, but he won't learn to take care of yourself alone or to self-regulate, says Professor Fenske.
And "this is authorizedly passes from a situation to another," he says.
Your child is not only learning to divert, it has more control of himself in other areas.
I don't think we should be glorified.
As I do, I do not think that we should criticize it.
Easy feeling outside the swimming area is that they generate activities and technology is the goal to which we should get.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
"We need to smell us more often, but the smell smells an accurate and fronistic desire to be connected to something that has a sense," he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and appreciation the time of stop.
"In a environment where we are constantly hyperstimized," he added, "that is difficult to find ways to start in something when the sound stops."
In the Colorado, there is no directive on the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19-year-old, student in a Colorado university and foot player, is accused of something that will soon become legal in his state: the possession of marijuana balls and a skin used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said that one day, in September, he and some friends were on the board of a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a comparison to the ownership of drugs and materials that could serve to its consumption - smaller crimes, each composed of a $100 amendment and a comparison date.
"We are treated as criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is it one?
During the weeks of incertitude that followed the Colorado's vote to legitimate the consumption of small amounts of marijuana for his personal use, the answer to hundreds of businesses involving a low use of drugs depends on more than the law.
Here and in Washington's state, which adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving marijuana use have been classified immediately.
Police services have stopped infringing adults of 21 and more for smaller marijuana possession, since the law will enter into force in the coming weeks.
But contractors who are in the most conservatory situations of Colorado called to accelerate existing marijuana matters and continue to blame those who have it.
Similarly, several cities from Denver to the Western mountains are currently voted to prevent the opening of marijuana sales in marijuana approved by the State in their neighborhoods.
"The things evolve so fast that I don't know what we're reserving for the future," said Daniel J. Oates, the police chief of Aurora, east of Denver.
The Government's regulatory agencies are also unfair.
They are searching for directives on the installation of an authorisation system, authorized to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell before the date of 1 December 2013.
They say that the Colorado, which is sweet or not, is advanced in most states of marijuana regulation, first of all regards the use of therapeutic purposes and now in terms of personal use.
"The Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, recognize Mr. Smith, can do more than suggesting what works.
"No previous reality we could be based on, he said.
The Washington law, called I-502, takes effect on 6 December, which leaves a legal vide of one year, in which the permission system will not always exist, while marijuana ownership will be legal.
During this time, practical questions remain in suspension: how to balance the state mandate that guarantees adequate access to the approved marijuana and prohibits the installation of cannabis sales in a 30 km radius around a school, a park, a game field or a crystal.
"There are no more difficult places than the urban areas to install an authorized sale of cannabis, including in the Metropolitan Zone of Seattle," said Ben Livingston, a chair to the Cannabis Legalization Centre, a recently formed research group.
On November 21, the police head of Oates, Aurora, sent an email to his officers announcing that the "City attorney" (representative of the Public Ministry) would no longer continue to the 21-year-old persons who have small amounts of marijuana, and that the police had to stop infringing persons for this kind of crime "in immediate effect".
Head of Oates said that the police would apply the new justice decisions that regulate the activity of marijuana to medical purposes, and that it would continue to continue to pursue drug traffickers and dealers.
In the United States, in the north of Colorado, the "Atorney district" (Republic Procureur), Ken Buck, is a more strict vision.
After the vote, he said that his office would continue to take care of marijuana's owning business, mainly to make pressure on users so that they could be disintoxed.
At the present time, 119 people are inculcated in possession of 56 grams or less marijuana, but many of them do other infringements.
" Our office has the obligation to make progress against those who have committed a crime that, at the time of the facts, was a recognised offence," said Mr. Buck.
Reactions were even complicated in rural places such as Mesa Council, where voters rejected the initiative for the limited consumption of marijuana.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the cottage, does no longer compare adults for the possession of limited quantities.
The representative of the Committee Public Minister, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to classify all matters of marijuana detention.
"I have no impression to lose my time to continue to apply the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 per cent of the voters of Colorado have supported the measure, the provision of a legal and government framework for marijuana's personal consumption is not an adjustment.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in different American cities show the deep ambivality among local officials in terms of legalization of marijuana.
"This is a cultural barrier" with the representatives of the public Ministry, said Sean McAlister, a lawyer of Denver who represents the accused consumption of marijuana and expressed as local portal of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws).
"There have been a good part of their lives to continue in justice with those consumers of marijuana, and they also have bad to accept that it is legal," he said.
As the first states to treat the limited consumption of marijuana at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and the Washington state are able to become a case of drug legality.
While defenders and representatives of the State prescribe a new border of legalized sales, they are concerned about the directives of the federal government, which are always the sale and culture of marijuana as federal crimes.
The defenders of marijuana's legalization hope that the Ministry of Justice will be enforced.
Despite certain mediated arrests of patients under therapeutic marijuana and sellers, the federal government has particularly allowed marijuana sales to work in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
If it's true that the police is not probably going to put the doors into small drug sacks, it's strong to see that it is opposed to marijuana sales authorized for personal use authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, an elderly political advisor of Obama administration.
Many Colorado cities have not waited for federal authorities.
Before votes, some local authorities have approved moratories on the creation of the new trade in marijuana, even if it is only a report of one year.
Last week, the city of Montrose obtained a 6-month moratorium, and should impose this ban on the next week.
"We don't want to find us in a situation where a permission is granted to someone and then find us faced with a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal Council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community instead of the vote of the State.
Many of the questions are put.
Petronella Wyatt: I was dismissed and excluded from Oxford, because I was a "Tory" (conservator).
This is not only the students today that are attacked for their opinions.
So far as I remember, I've always resolved to enter the Oxford University.
My father and my old brother studied in what was a great place for me to know, a kind of Greek amphitheater of modern times that encourages the two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
However, two weeks after I was installed in Worcester College at the end of the 80s to study the story, I decided to make my arms, caused the first scandale of my life.
My dad was smiling and smiling.
My friends were discovered.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed I had left this university because I was objected to the fact that students of the first cycle had sexual relations in the room next to me.
The author A. N. Wilson declared with facency that I was part of after being forced to drink in deceived taxes.
The truth was less funny.
I'm gone.
Yes, I went, because I had been victim of intimidations and made the object of constant brimades.
Not because of my name instead of otherwise, or because of the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for a single reason, and in this sweet of self-destining, I was victim of a racist and barbaric behavior: my regret father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influenced advisor of Margaret Thatcher and I was part of the Conservator Party.
Why do you say it today?
However, recent studies revealed that a new generation of right-to-left students suffers the same type of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hate of students Tory in Oxford is as the last week, some of them required protection of their rights, as well as gays, disabled persons and ethnic minorities.
The conservators of the students room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College said they were "isolated, personally attacked and felt unwanted" because of their political opinions.
They want to have a representative within the university Committee for Equal Opportunities so that their opinions can be expressed freely.
They were not facilitated by the recent documentary on BBC 2 "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("The country of wonders: Youth, Intelligence and Right"), dedicated to the policy at students, which deployed "Tories" as extreme and neonazis.
In particular, student Joe Cooke, former President of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), moved to Rolls-Royce, wooded a completely armed and moved with a chromeous head channel.
In other universities, conservator students say to be treated as emitted legs for the establishment of higher school costs."
Luke Black, 20 years old, Vice-President of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, stated to a Sunday newspaper "what there has been a left-to-left party in universities.
People think we are like the Bullingdon Club without even have met us."
Samuel Roberts, 21 years of age, student in history in Corpus Christi, who proposed a movement for more protection, said that such a climate is "inconfortable" and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years old, President of the OCCA, said that there has been a deterioration of the attitude of JCR members towards those who are in the center of the right.
"This is a obstacle to the freedom of intellectual discussions, as well as to the well-being of members," she stated.
I was the only one to think about this during my first weeks in Oxford.
I entered in September 1986, then I was 18-year-old and a paralysing timidity.
The hate of the conservator party was very virtuous.
Last year, the university had voted to refuse to agree to Margaret Thatcher - an old student - a honourable title, due to the reduction in the financing of higher studies.
The atmosphere was charged by stalinic vibrations.
Since the first days of the week of arrival, when the new students learned with others and teachers, I had a prejudiciary of what would happen next.
I found that teachers did not only participate in sarcasms to the students of Tory, but also enjoyed them.
It was like the policy on minors, the privatisation and opposition of the Government to sanctions against apartment in South Africa in the wood of class halls.
The first sarcasm I was victim was about a translation to the English of the 18th century texts, and I was not prepared there.
"My Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt, "before translate the first paragraph."
I lost my feet.
Pitt, a small man in the shocked face, was easy to import.
"Is that the Cherists refuse to learn the French or are just stupid?" asked he.
Other students have rid.
The laughs burned my eyes.
"I suggest you to take French courses during your free time - finally, if you're not too busy to make friends," he launched out of a thrilling.
I'm back to my room, unconfortable.
When I was dinner tonight, I was sit alone, and I felt a slight card on my shoe.
It was a second-year-old English student named James, who presented himself as an OCA member.
"I know who you are," he said, well.
I'm so scared of it.
Everybody suspected to be a Tory (conserver) is taken for target.
It's already hard for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so that's gonna be harder for you.
The majority of the young Tory claims to be workers (travailists).
Afterward, at the local pub, I tried to hide me.
I stressed the fact that I did not agree with all that Mrs Thatcher said.
This strategy failed.
One student in the first year of philosophy, political and economic sciences who had, ironely, studied in Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pork."
You're contaminated.
Other students repeated the recurrence.
I was perversive, selling.
"How do the Tories do love?" asked one of them.
They throw each other down, isn't it?"
I feel like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the sixty years.
Could I only conduct a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people who share the same views only after the night's fall?
Should I become Labour and restore my opinions?
The next three years would be like a purgator of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Professor Tory was Norman Stone, a modern history teacher, who taught in my university.
He was hated not only because he was a conservator, but also because he was advising in external policy of Thatcher and one of his speakers.
He wasn't almost there.
He hated this provincial and insignifiant place, as well as his membership at the point of view of the marxist-determinist history.
In 1997, he accepted a position of professor at the Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not gonna be happy here," he said to me.
I started to make the ship between Oxford and the house of my parents in London, finding refugee with my family and my most open quoted friends.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and I explained why.
He was incredible.
During his studies in Oxford, in the 40s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said patentally.
They wouldn't do this, not in the city to dream cloches.
Even my communist friends had unreproachable ways.
He was laughing in the eyes.
Let them have a chance.
I'm sure it's to taquin you.
This would smell my heart if you left Oxford.
Faced by my frequencies traveling to London, my emotional resistance has gradually deteriored.
A friend, also Tory, succeeded in pressure and rejected his convictions.
During a working meeting next week, when another teacher of history suggested the most seriously in the world that I was "a enemy of the people", I decided to do so as much.
I was admitted to be victim of the brain lavage of my parents and the traider of "old fools".
The recurrence was short-term.
It's my father who cut the last cloud of my oxfordian circle.
At that time, he wrote two columns in the Murdoch press every week.
My door was locked.
I stayed in my room, and in five minutes my continuers left.
When they're gone, I've done my bottle and I took the first train for London.
I've never come back.
You can handle me with smooth powder.
But no 18-year-old child should be victim of such intimidation in a school institution.
The most tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 first Ministers Tory, but also benefits from an incredible reputation of equality and freedom of thinking.
"Valentino prefers the eligance to notority"
In the context of the Exhibition "Valentino: a Master of the Couture " inaugurated this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian coast.
Somerset House, the ancient residence of Elisabeth Ire of England, is the only place of the British capital to welcome an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The cowboy acknowledged it during the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of the Couture", a prestigious retrospective retrospective that gathered more than 130 high-cover models for his kitchen house over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his enemy Italian accent.
This exposure is the honour point of a story with the only protagonist is "the Lord", Garavani, which could not be written without his famous customers.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and by the nobless.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until 3 March, there is a impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the artism cream, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing by the princess Maria-Chantal de Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exhibits his personal memorys like the troops of his social ascension: the modest coturist of the city of Voghera, north of Italy, at the island of the international jet-set.
There's nothing bad to love the kingdom.
"Anyway, they do not store their cigarette megots on your beautiful buts as it makes some stars of pop music," says the barone Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 70s, we both lived in the Alpes, and we were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives generosity and elegant.
"We all worshiped to be invited in its gstaad chalet," explains the ex-fema of "Heini" Thyssen, a friend of the past beauty as Marella Agnelli or Eugenenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always prefered the eligance to notority.
And even so, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, with a Valentino model
The argentine mannequin, Valeria Mazza, has no longer forgotten the charmism of the cottage.
several years ago, after a delay on the Place of Spain, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were a twenty-five people, among which Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We saw and resented his mind in each detail of his apartment, in decoration, food, music.
"After him, each invitation felt important and appreciated," the "top model", which began working with him during the week of the High-Corture in Paris in 1995.
"He will never pass in mode, because its creations are works of art," it ends.
Noblessing Line
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsessions but shared love.
He loves the higher people and with the largest titles, and they also love it.
One of the Sorset House's galleries was transformed in a wide glass of seventy meters, which proposes to exchange the roles: the visitor takes the place of the mannequins and must develop on the podium to admire a "public" of Valentino's main creatures, such as the sizer that Jackie Kennedy had chosen for his marriage with Aristote Onassis, the cost of Monica Vitti in the "La Notte" or a sleeve in the meat and snake belonging to the imperial Farah Diba.
Among this public of mannequins, you can find names like Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria van Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norwegia, Rosario de Bulgaria or Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and cottage in 2006
Many of his customers say that the first clothes of Valentino are like the first love, "unable to forget".
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pantalonia, a chemise, a "gilet" gilet and a clothes of the auto-winter 1971-1972 collection.
"It's a gift he had done me," Naty Abascal said, one of the kitchen museums.
"I prefer him to all others for his feminineness, his great love of women, and because he highlights our beauty," adds the former Feria.
I love the colors he uses, they're lighting and lighting the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and modest Patricia della Jovpaola de Arenberg can, however, forget the first time she brought a Valentino model.
When she was adolescent and lived in Italy, she had the age and the opportunity to take one of her night clothes...
Finally, it was possible at the end of the 1990s.
I purchased my first Valentino model for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard of Line.
It was a red evening wheel, with a flight sweet, a drowned busting and a shock to fall.
"This was a dream becomes reality," said Rodrigue of Arenberg's live.
"Valentino is indifferent to the mode, it is obsessed by the modern," explains the Italian aristocratic who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess of Arenberg keeps the dinner wheels with "the greatest care, because a night rabbit is not just a robe, it is also the whole memorys that it is in the car."
The "king" of the mode
The great end of the Sunrset House exposure is Mary-Chantal Miller's marriage robbery in her marriage with Paul de Greece in 1995.
There have been four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the cowboys calls its kitchens) to realize this swimming wheel wheel with perles, 12 different kinds of teeth and a trail of four metres and half.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the top authority of the specialized press, this robe represents a historic fact of the high cover of the end of the 20th century, "the return of the customers of the high society".
Obnubiled for years by the "alsoing" of nobless, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavalère di Gran Croce (the largest distinction in Italy), Cavalera del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letter, decoration from the Legion d'Honor, Garavani cumules both of the honors that every marriage of its customers.
"On refination, his calm, his careful and perfect aspect have always saved me in the eyes," recognizes Arenberg.
The last time I saw it, it was a month ago a dinner of gala at the Orsay Museum.
He was sit on the table of the Ribes Comtease, one of my big friends.
"He was unconscious, the years have no effect on him."
If it's a princess...
The hardest work in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, Indonesian volcans risk their lives and health by taking 70 pounds of soufre through scharted stone roads.
There are people for whom the work is a hell and other who are literally working in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 minors who win their lives by taking the suffering of the Kawah Ijen vulcan in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It must work every day until the clause, where the sulfuric gas that emits the earth is solidated at the air contact.
After he collected large soft rocks, which hold up over 70 kilos, he installs them in two bamboo shops that he loads on his shoes through the shooted roads.
There are only 250 meters up to the top of the volcano that culminates at 2,386 m, but the swimming ports put more than 40 minutes to gravize this distance, at a tortue height, watching the balance and measureing their steps to not strike and drop into the precipitation.
They know that a false could not cost their lives, as it happened to a French tourist who struggled the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
The smaller Kawah Ijen wins € 5 cents for each km extract sufre.
Once on the top, there is a path between tourists who picture them as if they were circle beasts, and punishing the heavy carriers, they walk into the 3 miles (3 km) to the balance that a mineral company has installed a little in contrabase at 1.850 meters of height.
This is the PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that operates the volcan since 1960, and it can be said, its employees, to which it pays 662 Indonesian rupes (5 hundred euros) per kilo of sufre.
It then sells it to the petrochimic industry as this mineral is very present in daily life and is used to manufacture bottles, artificial fires, cosmetics, dynamics and even white sugar.
"When we transport about 70 kilos, we win about 46.000 ropees (3.8 euros) to each trip," explains Anto, which generally performs three trips per day.
Everyone takes three hours and ends, but it allows it to win 138.000 rupies (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a poor for such a human effort, it's the trial of what he would win in the fields.
"The income of minors is very high here, where the coffee collection is paid by EUR 15,000 per day (1.20) and where the average monthly payment is of two million ropees (167 euros), says the portor who had worked as a shop on the Bali tourist island.
On the basis, his wage was of 75,000 euros per day (6,20 euros) and the job was not so difficult, but Anto returned near his family to Banyuwangi, a neighborhood of the volcan village, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is so indiscrete that it was that I was married to a young Bali girl, where they were Hinduists, and I returned to Java so that she turned into Islam."
Anto suffers of asthm, breath with difficulty, everybody constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gas.
To 27 years, he was three of his life to shoot the danger on Kawah there, but the sufre has already started to pay the facture, even though he covers the face with a mask and the doors of special gants.
Anto suffers of asthm, breathing with difficulty, everybody constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases rejected by the volcan.
That's the price he must pay to continue his dream.
"I'm going to work more than two years, because I want to open a boutique or study Spanish or French," he promises in a English more than acceptable.
Unlike life, this young sympathy and intelligent could be a tourist guide, server or receptive in a hotel, but, instead, he does the work of a mule.
He shares an insaluble wood mass with other portators every day at two hours of the morning, as the sufur does not stop jattering the night when his blue and brilliant color becomes blue and light in the middle of the darkness.
Under the darkness, Anto descends in the clause by lighting with a small lamp set on his castle, that he himself purchased himself with his own money.
Some 400 portraits load the swimming cart on their floors from the slaughter.
Despite its comfortable benefits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of the soft to economize costs and does not provide any equipment for the drivers working in their account and are payed to weight.
Moreover, they do not touch any more than EUR 30,000 rupees (2.50) by photos, more than the entry of EUR 15,000,20), that the customs of this natural park are factory to tourists coming to photograph the volcan and its human mules.
"This work is done for the beasts, not for humans," Madrusin protested a 42-year-old counterparty who works in Kawah Ijen for thirty years since he left the college.
He can take up to 110 kilos, assure that he will not stop working "as far as he can", because he needs money to get his three sons from 10 to 18 years of age.
I won't take my retreat, I'll die here because the volcan is my whole life.
Although the skin hurts the skin and shoes the eyes when the wind turns and smells the mines in the shoes of smoke, they are so enduring that no one suffers serious diseases... to whom obviously adds their usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, pain in the genus and shoes, deformed by the weight of the carriers.
By balanced the cart on the sound, Uninik, 53 years old, can only be loaded 50 kilograms.
Each day, his companions and his companions earned 15 tons of vulcanic soft, which three cars carrie to the Tanzari park, 18 miles [18 km] from there by a shooting shooting shooting by the bad herbs.
"I will not take my retreat, I will die here because the vulcan is all my life," Oneinik says by opening the mouth well, cutting several missing dents.
The elderly of his five children, 30 years old, also works as a sophisticator.
The time passes, but the persistent poverty of generation is one of the most difficult workshops in the world: the human mulls of the Kawah volcan vulcan.
Singapore child research to save the economy
Singapore is responsible for the lack of children on carriage, stress and the cost of ownership access.
"The population of Singapore must be developed."
I'm a husband and a patriotic, you're my wife and a patriotic, fill our civil duty and give us life!
It may seem unforeseemable that these words come from an advertising for menthe pills, but despite this, or perhaps thanks to this, the video has grown as a YouTube powder snake in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The words are from a rap group that uses local references such as "Please a polychinal in the fire" to move from Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the video advertising agency, hopes to take attention to the problem in a pleasant way thanks to this advertising.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, stated that he wanted to use the music power so that people would "deserve their national duties".
It is intended only to the Internet, so we could make it fun and pleasant.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of birth, so we felt that it was a theme we should do.
We knew that the government had tried several things like starting parfums to the pheromons or organizing speed-dating nights.
Many of these ideas were creative but they were not forced.
So we have said the following thing: what more creative to solve this problem than to make a rap song?
1,2 children
The Government of Singapore does not take it as far as light.
It costs $1,300 per year in policy to encourage his citizens to have more children.
A measure of the Government for marriages and fathers grants up to $15,000 per child, increases maternity allocations and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effects.
Singapore is a rich and high-east-east technologie, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore’s birth rate, in accordance with its national population department, is currently at 1,2 children per women.
The last time it was found above 2, which was considered as the renewal rate, it was in 1976.
So why do the Singapore have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of Marriage and the Family of the National Population Division, argued that it should be "a better education" and "a larger choice of career opportunities".
"This allowed people to have a larger range of options in terms of life and priorities, outside marriage and the constitution of a family," she explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to the increase in the number of individuals and to the delay of marriage and birth, resulting in a decrease in birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aimed at radically increased immigration to combat the reduction of the population has created a resentment within the local population.
In Singapore, there are web sites that enlarge a degree of xenophobia against new immigrants, especially against the Chinese who are accused of shooting the loans down and do not integrate.
The increase in immigration is also identified as one of the reasons for which the party in Singapore has known its worst electoral results since independence.
Since the elections, they tried to correct the problem with the establishment of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the loss of the birth rate has known on the economic growth of a country, tax revenue, health costs and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, this began to touch the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities began to control the number of small apartments, known as the name of "shooting wood", which can be built in certain areas in the city.
These apartments have a surface of 46 meters and their sales have a lot of success.
However, the authorities are concerned with the fact that they can promote a lifestyle of citizenship and discourage the promotors who want to build large families.
But Lim Yew Soon, director of the real estate company El Developers, claims that its "shooting boots" is much more quickly than the largest accommodations.
They are more popular, in the sense where these accommodations are built much faster than those of larger size.
For this reason, it's much more rewardable for our treasure.
However, he acknowledges that new standards provide clearer instructions to the promotors, which were put forward to cups in the wheels if they would like to propose too small housing in a project.
Trop of stress
Singapore is a city of State.
While these new regulations could be a step towards the increased national birth rate, discussing with the Singaporeans working in the centre's financial district, it seems that they do not seem to have a lot of effects.
"The people are extremely stressed, the houses are cheer, as the education is, so people get it later," says a young framework.
Other people may have children.
"But for me, it's important to be able to have my money and my time," we say another youth of twenty years.
Man and women mention their career, stress and cost of access to property and education, such as reasons for preventing children.
Thus, although the Government tries to convince his citizens to have children, when it is about to make children, they are the Singapore themselves who have the last word.
What is private outside line is online
Confidentiality
In accordance with the Dictionary of the Royale Spanish Academy, it is the quality of the private domain or "the area of private life we can protect from any intrusion".
What is the private domain for less than 16 years?
How can this definition apply in daily life and social networks?
Does it understand the dangers he expressed on the Internet of events that he would certainly not share out of line?
The periodic newspaper interviewed five young boys, aged from 10 to 15 years of age, frequent users of the toilet.
In four of these cases, they associated the term "what is very personal" on the personal and "password and user name" when they applied it to social networks.
"I will not declare my most personal secrets in one post," says Jorge, ten years old, when he tries to explain the meaning of the private term on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has a account for two years.
"This are very secrets, my mother can know them but not everyone," he says.
On FB, I post the favorite images or games.
I'm also talking with my friends.
"I will not share one of my photos or someone who would do the wicked," he said.
The young man recognized that it was bad to publish obscene photos, dishonored persons, crimes, or to write humilious or violent comments.
Jorge ensures that he knows his 35 friends on FB and his nine members on Twitter.
Most are family.
Her mother actually is part of, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just post them," he adds.
"Social networks are pleasant, I can speak with distant parents or with my friends, rapidly," he says.
He claims that he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
He won't trust anybody who would recommend a foreigner.
The case of José, 14 years, is different.
The adolescent has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask on this last, he admits not to know 20 of the people registered on his list of friends.
"I don't worry because we have something in common, for example music," he says.
According to the young boy, no one made advances to him nor requested him his address or phone number.
"If they put my pressure or demand it, I would just remove them from my account," he recognizes.
José was subscribed to Ask after reading a Twitter recommendation.
The experiences today known under the name of cyberharcely are not foreign to the youth.
A neighbor of my friends was racked on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knows who it was," he assures.
The victim, according to José, did not close his account.
"He only passed it in private profile."
It then explains a series of manipulations to set its account safely.
In the difference of Jorge, this young man would post photos of knowledge in uncomfortable or pregnant situations.
Yeah, I would do it if I was hamper or exercised.
"If I know it's cyberharcelement," he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, professor of English and licensed education and learning, believes that, in order to orientate children and adolescents, it must be understood that the objective of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has been a way to search for information but, with the appearance of these sites, the game rule has changed", says it.
Porras states that the Academics Marc Prensky, who has a pedagogy master in Yale University and author of the book "Natifs and Digital Immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The numerical natives are they, children and young people who are born with technology.
"We are the numerical immigrants who have to teach them there, while we're on the way to learn," she says.
He acknowledges that the theme is complex, 'for we ask them to have a criteria defined on what is appropriate or not to disseminate, publisher or tell to a age where they do not have the maturity necessary to do it'.
"We also ask them to be selective, while what is the most important of them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach confidenciality to children and adolescents is to use issues that make them think.
"If you don't say to do it doesn't serve anything," she says.
Then, Porras records some examples: there are things that you wouldn't tell a foreign man, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would that like you that they publish a photo of you as the of a friend you published?
Do you know what the others publish on you?
When you identification photos of the party, you ask others the permission to identify them?
And also, do everyone need to know what you're doing at every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they must act online as they do it out of line.
That's the same rules.
"In the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, this must be similar to social networks", says it.
Surveillance
Stuardo Guardia, professor of university, primary institutor and educational adviser, says that parents are essential to raise awareness of the social network conditions.
They will have solid bases to discuss with their children about the implications of opening an Internet account.
"For example, the age and what it is allowed to share or publish it," he said.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remember the children that the foreigners do not need to talk.
The Summit of the Unasur ended without the Lima Declaration
The VI presidential summit of the Union of South Americas (Unasur) has been completed today in Peru without that the Lima Declaration has been public, although it has been previously announced and theoretically adopted by the seven representatives present.
Efe had several times tried to access the document signed at the VI General Meeting of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency reported that it would be released after the end of the Summit, and then stated that it would be published at one moment on the Internet site of the Peruvian Government.
When they were asked on the text, they reported that his content was exposed by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief statements at the press.
The access of journalists to the Summit information has been constantly limited.
During the day, only the video without the presidential assembly's sound with the message "private session, limited audio" was distributed in the press room.
The few information that were circulated between journalists were given by the press attachments of some of the Governments of Unasur that attended you, with the exception of the Peruvian parl.
The only document published during the day was the list of the Chairmans, which caused a certain male in the hundreds of journalists of various national and international media who claimed more important information.
Later, the Peru Presidency sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the Summit, but was the discussion of President Humala, and not the official document that concluded the Summit.
In October last, the Peru was the host of the third South America Summit (ASPA) and, at that time, although this was requested by the press, he had not published the statement called Lima also, as it had previously been announced.
On the official site of the ASPA, it is possible to verify that the document was published in the last March month.
In the two international ways, the Peruvian authorities have tried to establish safe transmission systems for all journalists, but have limited to the obtaining of information.
The Summit also concluded with the Chile and Peru ' s joint agreement to accept a judge of the Hague Court, which has a different border between the two countries.
The Presidents of the Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chili, Sebastián Piñera, were meeting at the regional performance and said that they would respect the decision of the CCI to hear the plaiders of the two parties in the proceeding which Lima tried to fight Santiago and that began Monday at the Hague.
"We shall respect and execute the greed that will resolve the differences we put today before this international court," said President Humala, next to his Chile homology.
"The Chile has always been, and will continue to be a country respecting international law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and tribunals," added President Piñera by giving a hand-in-law to the President of Humala, next to the two countries.
The confirmation of the two Chairpersons submitted to the CCI has been held after the Columbia announced this week the Bogota Covenant by which it had accepted to submit to the decisions of the International Court, after a decision on maritime limits with Nicaragua that it would be seriously wrong.
The Summit held without the presence of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
The Paraguay, suspended from the Unasur since 2011 after his ex-president Fernando Lugo, has not participated in the form of you.
The host President, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for opening the debates in the morning and closing the sum after midday in Lima.
The mandate reads the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that 31 project lines were established among South American countries for a total of $17 million of investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he pointed out that the UNASUR countries would establish “important steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship by developing agreements on residence permits”.
He informed that actions would be made to improve the cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions for better accessibility to medicines, access to the Internet to the whole of South America and to assess the risks of natural disasters together and effectively."
With a crisis Europe, "Economic consolidation (Late America) must not have a triophalist matrix but must help to increase our productive matrix and enter a better future for our populations", concluded the President Humala.
"We have decided to have a group of 31 embryotic projects that improve the connection of South America's spaces, particularly in rural and border areas, together with our countries and generating new economic circuits," said the Peruvian President at a talk.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five were related to Peru and were on the cross-border axis of his territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two were seeing a more important connection with the Equator, although it had not given the most details.
Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation of Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process of this country will allow its reintegration within the United Nations Union", which is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and well-related relations with its neighbors, is another theme addressed at the sum.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said, before starting the regional render, he hoped to meet his homology of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, the next Saturday in Mexico to discuss the calming of maritime difference through a judge of the CCI requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (same), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega", said President Santos.
"We will review all these ways, they are not exhaustive, including the Treaty with Nicaragua that will ask for a debate with this country," he stressed.
"I hope I can tell President Ortega that we will resolve this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," added President Santos.
The Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they planned to assist the new President of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, in the framework of the Summit, the Ministers of the Bloc Defence will soon gather for the approval of the 2013 Action Plan, which tries to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chili, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of the Unasur, although this last country is suspended.
Peru ensures the Presidency for the time of the regional block.
"The South America must learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship", says Rafael Correa.
The Equator President, Rafael Correa, stated today that the creation of a common citizenship was a goal for which "South America, in this case, had to take example of Europe".
President Correa, who participated in the VI Summit of the South American Union (Unasur), located in Lima, declared the State TV, Peru, that the Europeans were "interviewed at the Second World War" and at other conflicts, "but now they were almost a patrie."
In this sense, he defended the draft establishment of South American citizenship encouraged by the Member States of Unasur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved in any South America country, as is the case for the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactional areas that we want to make in the past." he warned.
Furthermore, the Equatorial President has demonstrated the reconstitution of the United States of the United States (EEA) in order to reduce the impact of Anglo-Sexon States and to take into account the signatories of the Covenant of San José on Human Rights.
Those who distract the ears never compromise nothing, instead, we, the South Americans, have all signed it.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Human Rights Commission is in Washington under the financing of the United States," he stated, expressing the political asylum granted by the Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correctly, he does not regret his decision, because he himself did not trace his principles, but, on the contrary, he respected his "democratic values and human rights."
He concluded that at the time, " there were suspicions found that Assange would be extracted to a third country and that his proceedings would not be respected."
It also criticizes the Swedish justice that requested it to submit on its territory to a presumed sexual offence, while "the Sweden's own legislation allows to do it by videoconference, which could be done since the Equator's embassy in London."
Correa stated that there was a risk of deterioration of the mental and physical health of Assange.
"I did not talk to him since he was in our embassy, but the embassy told me that he had a small pulmonary problem, but nothing serious," said the Equatorian President.
It is possible to deteriorate its physical and mental health by being closed in a small space without being able to exercise free air.
"This works on health of any one," he concludes.
Correa states that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Equatorial Embassy of London, which would be the assignment of an extra-conduct that would allow him to become in Ecuador, is among the hands of the Great Britain, Sweden and European Judiciary Authorities and stresses that he had debates in London to find a solution to the opening of the WikiLeaks founder.
We are not negotiating with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there are permanent discussions.
"The solution to this problem is available in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European Judiciary authorities because the lawyer of Asanga, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a series of procedures with different European authorities," said he.
And he thinks, "If Great Britain would grant the out-conduct since tomorrow, that would end."
And if Sweden, as it makes it possible, and as it has already done in other cases, asked Mr. Assange in the Embassy of Equator to London, or asked it tomorrow through Skype, the problem would also be resolved.
Correa benefited from reaffirming as a defender of the freedom of the press and explained that what he would not tolerate was "the mediumcrited, the bad faith and the lies that deny the freedom of expression".
"The largest enemy from the freedom of the press are not the wicked or perverse political men but the bad journalists at the wages of aviation, changing and extortion," he stated.
Under this angle, he welcomed that this is not the type of journalists "not the bankers, nor the heavy and bourgeois countries that domain in Equator" and, instead of putting in front of his choice, "he would extend the revolution to continue the way and trace the good way".
Correa also supported the decision of maintaining the vegetation on the Paraguay within the Onesur at least until the next elections, arguing that the "organe should be firm and not tolerated the opportunities and attempts of deceived state cutting", since, in fact, "he destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguay democracy".
Moreover, the Equatorian President considers the desire of its colombian homologue, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime limits between the two countries by the judgement of the International Court of Hai, which will strengthen Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
At the time, this judgment is not respected.
It is a problem between South America and Central America.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be exceededed by the will to advance together.
We need to solve them in their whole to overcome them and go before.
At the same time, he stated that the right resolution of the complainant on maritime borders opposed to Peru and Chile within the same court was "which benefited that Latin America introduces international authorities if the two countries agree to accept such a firm judgment."
In reference to the possibility of his presentation as a candidate to the future presidential elections in Equator, in order to submit a third consecutive mandate, he stated that it was "with much optimism and joy, although it was sometimes sufficiently difficult".
Correa assured that, if he lost the primary of February 2013, he would be removed from public life.
At the personal level, the power has never interested me, but in situations as injust as the Equator, this socio-economic poverty can only be solved by political power.
"My political movement believed that it was me that guaranteed this possible victory but we must accept this responsibility," he stated.
If I win, this would be my last Presidential mandate and I will then get away from political life.
If I never forgive us, I'll do it too.
"This is my decision," he said.
Correa also refers to the new medical treatment of the President of Venice, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I came to discuss with the Vice-President of Venice Nicolás Maduro and he told me that a routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a rejection of the health status of President Chavez," he commented.
The Equatorian Head of State has now participated in Lima in the VIe Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the United States of South America (Unasur), which has concluded by a call to better regional integration in order to support progress, equality and security.
The diseases related to AIDS are today caused by a late detection.
Fabrizio had 21 years when the test result was confirmed: seropositive.
"It's like if the sky had fallen on the head," he said, referring to himself at the time of the advertising, that the doctor had tried to make "my punishable" in vain.
The young man hid him to his family.
He decided to load himself alone of his sickness and began to inform himself about his subject and his loading was as he was to celebrate his 43th anniversary.
It is, without doubt, one of the older patients in the HIV Unit of the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), where he was found in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio lived with human immunodeficiency virus (VIH) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s, where there were many doubts, few treatment choices and more stigmates.
So even the director of a clinic of ISS avoided telling him "for he was without voice."
At that time, having AIDS was synonym of death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, while ignoring their illness, many people still arrive when virus has already caused damage, "uppressed" their immune system and are victims of opportunist infections.
31 years after AIDS appearance in the world, in all cases after the first cases reported, "the great victory is now that the survival of a patient has started an appropriate treatment and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same," reported the Head of the HCG Unity, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, and is referring to the validity of this information in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
The infection and experts in HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists concluded that AIDS was no longer a mortal disease, but that the number of years of survival and life quality depended on the effect level of the immune system presenting patients at the time of diagnostic, with better prospects for those who did not consume drugs: up to 30 years of CD4 from 200 to 50 years for those who have a rate of 500 CD4.
To speak simply, this means that for someone who receives a positive HIV diagnosis for 25 years, "as it will remain under control, he can live without problems until 75 years of age," explained the questionned scientist.
In order to replace this progress in its context, it is necessary to know that the hope of life of Mexicans is now a mid-76 years old.
If it is true that mortality has decreased significantly in the past few years, in Mexico, the number of deceased AIDS followers has occurred in 2007 to 4,862 cases in 2011 (see UNAIDS annual report), but 60% of the patients reported on the national database are decreased.
Only in Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011 and 187 deaths had been killed until May of this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs is universal since 2005.
So why is there still death?
I think the problem is not from access to treatment.
That's how I see him, that's what happened in our hospital.
In the last 12 years, we have never missed medicines, the problem is that patients arrive in very advanced cities because they do not know that they are infected or then learned to advanced disease cities.
It gives us an indiscutable fact "9 patients on 10 are coming when they are already present a opportunist infection, which is necessary to have a greater impact on global mortality, is to realize more precoce diagnostics and, therefore, to propose massive detection tests, to all persons requesting it".
The specialists and members of the Council of State for Prevention of Jalisco (Coesida) agreed on his proposal, as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who had to do his detection test in a private laboratory, just because a friend had done it and that, despite his young age, he was already AIDS and suffered from the Capsian sarcome, a cancer tumor that is one of the current complications.
Every change when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, it's better than I get three times a week," they say, it's not my case.
The change has been benefitous, I eat well, I do the exercise, I take my medicines.
To this day, his parents only know that he suffers cancer.
I have a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, travel, I have an active sexual life, but co-responsive, I take care of me and the other person," says Fabrizio, who accepted to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his witness, those who have fear today, at the walk of the World Day against AIDS.
They do the test, if they have taken risks, more they will know if they are serious and better that will, and if they have the diagnosis already, they must know that we can live as everyone, as responsible.
His message resumes the slogan of AIDS fight in 2012.
Conservations on the shopping
There are many fosters between health programmes and ordinary citizens, supporting Ricardo Salazar, a journalist of Guadalajara who has discovered the cause of HIV.
And the largest residence in prevention.
In all places given to this, "we have actually increased the distribution of preservatives, before we had given it one or two, now we are given 100 packages, which is very good, but it has resulted, that there is still, some have no access to preservatives," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to the new infections, adolescents are found.
The question: "What are you going to do?", made with sarcasm and valuable judges by social workers, guidance advisers, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that adolescents do not want to hear, guarantee the journalist.
It proposes to re-exhibit this inefficient distribution; not only the preservatives are sold to shops but also find them in the distributors of public toilets and in places that are frequent for young people.
It is not to encourage promiscuity.
It is no longer to pay the girls and motel, as the Governor Emilio González answered when he was asked if there was a distribution of preservatives within his administration.
"This is not how sexuality works, the best is providing preservatives to already sexually active persons", he stressed.
Numbers in Jalisco
13.435 cumulated cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
The State is the fourth country State in number of new cases and cumulated cases of AIDS and 13e for HIV diseases.
92% of contamination is sexually, 6% per bloodway and 2% per perinnatal way.
50,000 people live with HIV, as for each case, there are 4 or 5 persons who don't know.
A ratificated judge by a United States Court ignores the restructuring of the debt of the Vitro group permitted by a commercial failite in Mexico. The scenario causes a predecessor for all national companies with ramifications in the neighbouring countries and with problems of solventivity.
Consequently, the procedures for survival of companies authorised by Mexican laws are not valid in the country on the steeled bathroom, in contrast with international agreements.
On a practical point of view, the sentence sent to the judge made on June 15, last by the Court of Faillites for the Northern Texas District, lets Mexican society without defence against the possibility of embargo of their properties outside the Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow the main manufacturer to see Mexico to introduce the United States Supreme Court based on three inconsistence.
First, while the judge of the cause states that creditors must register in accordance with the United States Faillites Act, the Fifth Court of Appeal, settled by the New Orleans, claims that the main procedure is the formalized commercial failite in Mexico.
The first point would include deniing international procedure cooperation in cases of insolvency of enterprises with transnational profile.
Indeed, the United Nations model law for the Uniformity of International Trade Law has been established to this end by taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrary.
Secondly, the judge states that without inter-social votes recognized in the critical mass of the trade failite, the debts contracted by Vitro towards the mother society, most of which would not have been obtained for restructuring.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan.
There is a half-douze examples, including Agremex and Commercial Mexico, whose Federal Institute of Commercial Facilities had guaranteed debts.
Furthermore, it is certain that, since the votes of the branches remained, Vitro's creditors who were fighting against this in the United States courts, namely, "vautour" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, were not obtained by the majority.
The vote would be 45 votes against 37.
A data is omidized by the call court.
On the other hand, Vitro was burned for the difficult situation that he had seen since 2008 without stopping the serious economic crisis faced by the United States to affect the costs of the country.
For this moment, the family company Gonzalez Sada will interroge the same call court to ensure that the vote takes place in its entirety, namely with the five magistrates, since only three were voted.
The insurance appeal shall claim to be insurance and require the revisation of the proceedings by a superior instance, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The most serious is that the Court has ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of the Curiay friend ("ami of the Court") in which Vitro was detailed the procedure followed by the Act on Trade Faility, reporting that it was free of conventions signed by the two countries to put it at the same level as paragraph 15 of the United States Faility Act.
It also notes that the country has added the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, namely the rules for cross-border insolvency, which guarantee equity for debitors and creditors.
Charming of two parties: they take Vitro and take the country.
General balance
The complaints of the Aviation Society of Mexican Aviation against the former patron of society, Gastón Azcarrraga Andrade, were held in silence for several months, which was accused of fraudulent administration, the Syndical Association of the Aviator Pilots has already faced problems.
Instance, Chaptered by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, comes to submit a criminal application against the National Banking Commission and the Values accused of infringement to justice.
According to him, the Inspection Authority systematically refused to provide information to the General Prosecutor of the Republic on an operation carried out by the entrepreneur to remove the IXE 198 million weight from the Aviation Bank.
The funds would have been used for the purchase of actions from the Professional Administration of Hotels.
As everyone knows, Azcarrraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posdas hotel chain.
They sit the Dragon Mart
Meetings at the end of the week in the Caribbean University, a group of national and foreign ecologists, university teachers, entrepreneurs and civil society members approved the establishment of a wide front of opposition to the cinema Mart Dragon in Cancun.
As you know, we're talking about a colonial sale and distribution centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbeans of products from the large wall, with a housing area for employees of 150 companies.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes "The basketball is my whole life"
Reyes, the slaughter of the "Hetin" ball basket, passed more than 60 years of his life in relation to the field and, thanks to him, traveled in the whole world.
Many people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of the local basket as large as Hector's "Hetten" Reyes.
The reason is that before a cerebral hemorragia condemns it to the routine routine in 2008, Reyes has been subjected to this sport for more than 60 years, that it is as a low-leading player, the national basket team player, the manager and the national team, the BSN, with the Bahamon Vaqueros, or as President of the Basket-ball Federation.
"I've put several caskets in the ballet all over my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was President of the BSN, the Director-General of the National Team and President of the Federation for the 1990s," Reyes recalls at a visit from Primea Hora in Bayamón, where he resided with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
"The basketball is my whole life."
Reyes doesn't exaggerate when he makes this statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated of photos and memorys that remember their quote outside standards, are witnessing.
Bahamon in the heart
All his memories are those who remember his passage as a player within the Vaqueros team in the middle of the 50s to 1982, after having over 15 years as co-manager or manager of the team.
"This was my best years, those I've best benefited because I had the opportunity to participate in eight Vaqueros Championships since 1967, as a manager, co-manager or leader.
This is a lot of years of satisfaction, including the five debated Championships from 1971 to 1975.
I was then retired at the Championship in 1981, the year in which Jerome Mincy was entered into the BSN team.
From there, "Chuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the head of the team," says Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who had been leader here and who was at the Alabama University (Birmingham), said to me, "I have a player costly for you, the measure of two metres.
You want him?"
That's how to start Mincy, one of the best players that Puerto Rico had.
Bartow then recommended me Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and was one of the best shooters.
I remember he said if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to bring a championnat, Gausse would help us try to get another back.
He enjoyed the Vaqueros Championship with Gausse, but only at distance because he was already the great manner of the Federation in 1988.
At that time, he would prefer to benefit from his burdens and charges in the national team.
I remember when we first brought it to the United States during the 1989 pre-olympic tour.
Then, there was the World World of 1990, where we had arrived fourth and where we had had to report the bronze medal if this Canadian judge had not made us rejoice the last match, Reyes said.
Is the World Team of 1990 the best national team you've seen?
It is part of the best, as well as those who fighted the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite is the of the Cuban Panamerian Games in 1991, when we brought the gold and we put a race to the United States team, which was quite similar to those who had returned the bronze at the Worldwide.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculino" (Origin), but also the young people (Javier) "Toñito" Colon and James Carter, Leon's brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend in the world for a problem of genoux.
A team that may not be the best in the terms of individuals, but she gave us a gold medaille and a great joy in the pre-Olympic tournoi of Neuken in Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Paul Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner in replacement of players suspended by the Mare of the Plata, we returned the gold against all the pronostics.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
Uncertainly, this is Piculin Ortiz.
His statistics at the international tournaments are impressive.
Nobody in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as Piculin did.
And this without taking into account his trajector in the different links for which he played.
Who was the best portorican leader?
It's very difficult to say.
We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armageddon Torres.
In young people, I like the work that Leo Arill does.
What is your greatest success within the Federation?
It was part of the most glorious time of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s the NSA was up to 17 teams in a season.
What are you gonna do?
There are things that I would like to establish, such as regionalization of minor categories.
For example, Ponce's boys play only in their area and face teams of the other rounds of the island at national play-offs.
Today, youths travel and play too much while this is not quite necessary.
I have at least seen the advantage of binding certificates and courses for leaders, field staff and arbitration.
This makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
Generally, I listen to music, look at my time clips on YouTube, I benefit my little kids and, at time, I sit at basketball matches.
Of course, I benefit from my wife's companion, Isabel, who has always been on my sides.
Larry Hagman's death
Larry Hagman, born 21 September 1931, was worldwide known by the main role of John Ross Ewing, who was known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas" in which he was incarcerated a man of business without shocks, roots and manipulators.
Larry Hagman, whose role of shockless oil, J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" has become a symbol of snake in the 1980s.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who was returned this year in the role of J.R in a new "Dallas" season, was decreased on Thursday nights of cancer complications, according to a member of the family sent to the associated Press for Warner Bros., production house of "Dallas".
"Larry was returning to his loved national city of Dallas, playing again the iranic role he loved most", said the family.
Larry's family and his close friends were with him in Dallas in this holiday of Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who interpreted the role of her wife in the original series and later, found with Hagman when he died in a hospital of Dallas, declared his press attachment, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all those who knew him.
He was creative, generous, sweet, sweet and talentous, and he'll miss me much.
"This was a person of exception and he lived under life," said Gray in a communication.
The doctors had diagnosed a hepatic surgeon in Larry Hagman in 1992 and recognized that he had been busy for many years.
In 1995, he was detected a heavy tumor in the heavy and he had been shocked.
A few years before "Dallas", Hagman was known to television in the role of a normal type in the "Jinny of my dreams" series distributed by the NBC chain from 1965 to 1970.
In that way, he was the role of Captain Tony Nelson, a astronomy whose life was transformed when he discovered a seducidant genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and he returned to his home.
He also played in two commodities that have remained low at the antena, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among his roles in the cinema, the critical roles are found in "The group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But this was thanks to his magistrate interpretation of the detective J.R. that Larry Hagman had known his greatest success.
The dramatic series of the CBS chain on the Ewing clan and their neighbors were spread from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who killed J.R.?", invented to spend around a full episode of emotions in which Hagman's personality is almost killed, generated speculations in the whole world and millions of dollars played in paris.
Thanks to this, among others, the series reached a hearing record at this time.
When the response was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million televisioners were in the mean front of their screen and made the second world's divertissement program, after the end episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million TVs.
It was J.R., Christin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him above.
J.R. had been pregnant and then threatened to prostitute if it did not leave the city, but others had also reasons for aggression.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and insatible man, but in charismatic smile: a malhonned entrepreneur and an infidel husband who tried to make her alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what's going to be epitaphe for J.R," said Hagman in 1988.
We should write: "It is the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only part he lost.
Victoria Principal, coprotagonist of the original series, recalled this Friday of Hagman as a man "excellent, both on the small and lives".
It is unforgettable, and unreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the heart of each of us, who had the opportunity to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" have been distributed just a few months ago with a great success on the TNT chain.
The record of five episodes is already finished for the second season, and one sixth is being achieved, reported the chain.
For this moment, nor Warner no TNT chain has reported how Hagman's death will be integrated in the series.
Original Fort Wordh in Texas, he is the son of the actor and sing Mary Martin, who knows the celebration with classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a youth when she gave her the day in 1931 while she was married to the lawyer Ben Hagman.
He made his first steps on the theatre scenes of New York at the beginning of the 1950s, then served in the aircraft force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
That's where he met the Sweden's young decorator Maj Axelsson and married him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived many years in the Californian city of Malibu, where we lived in many celebrations.
In 2001, he mentioned his memories "Hello Darlin": Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (France: Hello Darlin: J.R.)
"I haven't written anything in this book that can hurt someone or affect it anyway," he said at the press at that time.
After heavy heavy, he became an active warrior of organs and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist the worried patients.
"I advise them, I reward their trust, and I come with them when they come to operate and afterwards," he says in 1996.
I'm trying to offer them a little comfort, such as "Do not be afraid, that's not easy for a moment, but it's okay."
He was also fighting against smoke and participated in several campaigns.
A course treating the "the end of the world" comes to start
Each week, students explore philosophical topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and climate warming.
This semestre, when the teacher of religion Stuart Charmen decided to give a course at the end of the world, he knew that he was launching an unreasonable hunger: the end of the "great decompt" of the calendar Maya on December 21, which refers to many people as the evidence of the end of the imminent world.
But Professor Charmen had no idea of what was expected in the following months: the catastrophic Ouragan Sandy, a fiscal gouffor who some were called "Armageddon of Debt" and a growing conflict in Israel, the place where Christian theocratics at the end of the time thought that the apocalypse would be disabled.
"I did not realize that this would be the most apocalyptical semestre I never known," said Professor Charme this week at his students of the Rutger-Camden University (New Jersey).
If we analyze what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we were talking about it, it was a very good period.
And it must be remembered that what is bad is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.
And it is not the only teacher to give courses on "the end of the world" this semestre, which will, in the theory, be the last of the history.
In Temple, Adjunct Professor Barry Vacker deals with the course "Medias, cultures and ends of the world".
Each week, students explore philosophical topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and climate warming.
"We analyze this because these ideas proliferate with time," he said, and the way they offer hypothetic scenarios leads to a certain human behavior.
If nuclear weapons fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could be cut off.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared with examples of real life.
"I tried to inform my students about what was possible, likely, believable and impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of the University of State of Pennsylvania, Professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjoint Professor of History of Art and Anthropology, made a team to give a course, simply called "The end of the world".
"We add "2012" to have the opportunity to give the course again, if the world would not disappear", said Professor Restall.
Despite the "imminent disaster", students must study, create projects and pass their final reviews.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final review will be carried out the age of the Apocalypse, which does not leave students from another choice than to work "to the evening of the end of the proposed world", said Restall.
The courses have been quite popular.
"He was complete in two hours," said Restall about his course for high-level students, composed of 35 students.
We received posts by email several weeks before the beginning of the semestre, from people who asked whether there was still a place.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting ones.
"It is fascinated to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves," says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, from the University of Rutger-Camden.
Because the fear of the Apocalypse, that it is secular or religious, is only a question of comfort, or absence of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a student in Psychology and 25-year-old nurse, argued having seen all the pharmaceutical films.
"I never heard about a course that taught this matter," he said.
I appreciate it.
But no students asked, and still less a teacher, said to believe in the end date of the world of 21 December.
"Our first project was the maya prophecy, and in a certain way we have discredited it," says Julie Zegle, student last year in Temple, 21 years old and originating West Chester.
Mayas has never predicted the end of the world, it is only a key date on the calendar, said Restall.
But I agree that there is anxiety related to the apocalypse in Western culture, which makes people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a shore of these speculations.
"In other places of the world, people do not think about this," he says.
This is most of the anglophone world.
Joseph Duugherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Sala, who gives courses to the Philippians this year, quickly responded when he was asked if he knew that we were given a course here on "the end of the world".
"The Philippians do not participate at the end of the world," he answered us, as if it was an exception from a superior authority.
We have a thanks for Dad.
Restall notes that, at the end of the years, many dates were spoken of the last judge, and he stated that if nothing happens on 21 December, "the people will start thinking immediately at the next date" or philosopher about the fact that 21 December marks the beginning of a period of seven years at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date to light.
Many of us said they thought they were going to celebrate the end of the world.
"After I call friends and I'm in rigorn together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student.
