The main part of China's policy violations is under "the abuse of hate".
In each case, TikTok places unacceptable publications in the context adapted under the general rules to ensure that social network action is not expensive.
For example, the prohibition of the socialist system of China is under the general prohibition of "criteria or attacks against policies and social rules of any country, such as constitutional monarchy, parliamentary system, etc. "
The ban to mention the incidents on the area of Tanzania, or the genocide in Cambodia is under the "scanning of China's history or other countries".

Whether in TikTok we can speak about the policy or the Putin, Goddano is firm and says that he saw such publications.
Goddana agrees with the founder of Our Didgital Roman Zarivos: "The basic rules for TikTok users are listed in the user agreement: they cannot educe a shocking context, discriminatory expressions and so further."
However, under these rules, any continent that does not like moderators can be understood notes Zarivus.
