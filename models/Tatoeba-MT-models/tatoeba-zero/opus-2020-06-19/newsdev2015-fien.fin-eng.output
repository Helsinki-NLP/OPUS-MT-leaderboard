In addition to EU aid, the management of national enterprises support is focused on four bodies from September to the starting half of September.
The work of the East Summit responds to the South Savo Ely Centre in Mikkel.
In the beginning of July, the EU's structural funds have no longer to address major enterprises, unless it is a whole new operation.
More than five thousand people, the daughters of the chief are also read as a great honor.
Instead, the conditions for improved investments in stakeholders can also be granted by EU aid.
In the Middle East, the EU and national support unit will be at about 30 persons.
At least, they all continue to work in their current positions.
For example, the Capital Capital Labour Fund of the South Savo Centre is in Joensue.
Researcher: This Russia now works in Ukraine
The Russian works in line, although it wouldn't always seem like it.
The Director of the Agricultural Strategy Office, Chairman of the Forcessor, the Dominant Torst Siren did not surprise the conflicts of the Ukrainian news on Sunday.
This has been the same thing for a long time, Siren says.
On the other hand, Sergei Lavrov, Russian Foreign Minister, requested an interruption and reported that Russia would not attack Ukrainian (read more here).
On the other hand, Ukraine tells his counting teams to fight with the Russian tank office near Luhansk airport, and has been confirmed (read more here).
Lavrov requires that the Minsk negotiations have to be held without conditions.
Russia argues to be together and must immediately take the outcome of the negotiations so that they have a stabilized position in Luhanski and Donetski.
That's my whole thing, Siren says.
This is a great picture: the moment is to consult and to name Russia to take his own adoption to the Christmas and Donetsk regions.
Finnair is out of travel services to the Norwegian company, loans people
Finnair starts to buy travel services under the Norway service company of the OSM Aviation.
The agreement concerns the routes in Finland and Singapore at the next stage, but it is intended to expand later.
The company reported in its report about about 100 personal year reductions in the next stage of breakfast in Finland.
Furthermore, the work of the 80 Asian counterparty ends at the stage when the reits are outside.
Finnair has already told in June that it will take about 20 travel services during the next two years.
The outcome was concluded when the staff did not agree.
The outcomes are intended to start in January next year.
According to the company, negotiations on cooperation are also continued with other partners.
According to the study, unions simplify several risks of nervous growth, or the risks of slow-scale skin.
In the study of the Working Health Institute, the Palomers were monitored for 13 years.
The connection of unilateral disorders is surprising, although many other factors have been taken into account.
The good body force and the durability of the palms that are tested regularly does not seem to be protected by the pain, reports the director of the study, the dose of Sirpa Lusa in the information of the Work Health Agency.
The work of palomics is an unregular dialog where the mountains can ship even for 24 hours.
According to the Working Health Institute, unions are generally in this type of work.
The results are based on the investigation carried out in 1996, 1999 and 2009.
Do you know the new reasons for the water prices?
Remember the destruction to other homes
Water-energy prices are not always to be caused by a yearly shock or a shock, remembering the expert of the Agreement.
We have been connected when the abuse of the aquarium has caused in the household of waterwink that the aquariums are possible to prohibit, reports the reporter of Marina Furuhjelm of the Covenant.
Furuhelm recalls that only pieces and shops are not the general causers of water prices, but also now more new machines like refrigerators have caused water years of households.
Many do not know that machines such as a speed or swimming machine should not be left without control.
The water shall also be closed when the machine is not surrounded, since the pressure on the cut may lead to the year of water.
The population may be considered to be injured if these responsibilities have been disrupted, in which the responsibilities of the injury are inhabited in the population.
Of course, in these cases the coat can be replaced by damage, depending on the conditions and cases of insurance.
If you can demonstrate that a resident has caused unfortunate riches, it is a reimbursement in the population.
If a resident has been cut on the floor floor, it is often possible to prove that water has normally come to another house, and the career has come to a house where a disappeared residence is found.
Furuhelm tells that due to the generalization of the latte-approvisionates, many students have now been installed to two late cocktails.
Water prices have also caused water skins, even though not anymore when they were more recommended.
Even the water shoes of the dog and the cotinicity of the cognition can be real water shoes.
I also know the case in which there were many kitchens that were put into the boards so that there were large damages, Furuhelm tells us.
The principle of the correction is always in the same way if the company does not stipulate otherwise.
The part of the plant material correction and the riches of the household and the riches of other households.
Water flows make it easy to destroy other places, because my beton of the building is really easy to eat water.
The Furuhel reports that the paternal rates of household are specially difficult because the patters are easy to switch to switch-based structures.
Water prices may cause current air temperatures that produce condensous water.
The water should lead to a frozen oil or a swimming water network, and not only to a steel.
In particular, the responsibilities are also to remove water, legs, rests and losses from the parking, the legislative advisory advice.
The Furuhelm guides that, although the rules of the economic company do not require, for example, a fixed removal of the demanded company, it may be a condition that the refund is not obtained for this reason.
It's like to be checked with the conditions of coating.
However, I consider the irreversible water snakes of the pesticides, for example, as a risk that has caused many damages.
I recommend that waste waters will always lead to the marketing chain.
Low and water removed on the ball
On the shooting shooting, spectrum control of machines, on them.
Closing of the waters (containing the skin and the swimming skin)

FC Honka has again lost and swallowed in a series
At the amatola sports park on Sunday's night, the Veikaus Liga shoppointer was two weak teams at this moment.
In June last, the winning celebrated FC Honka's father at the seventh game in the winning shock of Vasas Palloseura.
VPS took its previous victory in July just against Honkaan.
The meeting of Sunday with the spool team became a good sweet, as VPS returned for a long time to win the 2-1 reader.
The principal trainer Olli Hutunnen chose before playing his team's inefficience, but the latter Honka department facilitated VPS's problems.
It's very nervous.
We didn't have received any more long attacks, we were not able to be held by a ball," Hurry appraisaled for each other.
In the first side of Hong Kong, Milos Milovic - Home Manev was really uncertain.
Both elderly lands were born as a result of the playing of the top couples.
The opening of the battle was seen only five minutes after a game, when Steven Morrissey drived Sebastian Strandval's shooting over the shock of Honka, Walter Vitalan.
It's the first half-time.
On the other hand, the team did the same as the game was agreed before the game," Shefki Kuqi commanded.
After the initial shooting, the spoods got their game into the castle and shooted the balls in the head of the attack.
In particular, the central player Carlos Portela and the attaker Roni Porokara were intimidated to work places, but the last solutions were almost repeatedly assaulted.
Nearby, however, it was the centre of Hongkong, Jussi Vasara, who was a 20 - m out of the shuttle.
VPS was effectively attacked by the use of cylinders of its attackers and the secular topparisher of Hong Kong.
In the afternoon, the ancestors made a 2-0-power when Morrissey and Cornelius Stewart came to two of them.
Morrissey offered and Stewart was the last one.
Morrissey was in the open period with a good game head and took the left layout situations again.
Stewart's speed again showed that the whole time of the game was too much at the spool.
"I'm on my side that if we're lost, then we'll lose the honor," Kuqi said.
The buried Honka searched for the other part of a angry shock.
Someone had two times near the part of the third company.
The attacker Jeriai Vilaboa was the last one in the midst of the country's punishment.
After the country of Vilabo, Hungary was half an hour of time to struggle.
The Espoole team has taken more risks throughout the time, which gave VPS the possibility to risk attacks.
And Stewart, and Morrissey, have come to a smooth with Vitala, but the shame of the Honka ships had to fight with the home team in the game.
Finally, Honka was a little hungry, and I didn't get additional pieces in time.
In the afternoon of the murder, Honka was shocked at the last time when the seven battles were left.
Journal: I threatened you to be able to use the power of Kiowa in two weeks
The Russian President Vladimir Putin was a very strong discussion on the European Commission's telephone debate with Jose Manuel Barroso, reports the Italian La Republic.
It expressed its deterioration in the European Union's plan to clarify the compulsory commitments of Russia.
If I want to be able to be able to power in Kyowa two weeks, the Republic will tell Putin to say.
According to the newspaper, Putin's message to Barroso was that: It would not be able to emphasize Russia's new packaging.
The pound gave the Russian television a conversation on a single channel on the Ukrainian crisis on Sunday night.
In the debate, Put told his conflict as an fully internal Ukrainian and urged the Kyova Government to consult directly with the rebellious people.
Then he warned what he said about the burning of civil items in Eastern Ukraine.
Russians "I can't see the neighbors." If people are shooted to the next time, Putin said.
Sco Roine recognises: the spectator's job you destroyed the family.
the strict worker of Concarine and the teater family increased the way the shower destroyed his first marriage agreement.
The shower Esko Roine fulfils the next evening 70 years, but in his view, it seems able to say that the age is only a number.
I don't see any difference compared to the year or two or ten years after the year.
The spirit pubert seems to be continuing, Esco Roine says.
Roine has been born for years, but he's still pressing many men before.
Sometimes it was smiling that this country doesn't make a lot of shows without Esko Roin.
Now Roine has roles in the show of Helsing's commercial integer as a success in business life, Tampere workers in the Middle Teater, as well as in the Quartet of Tampere Commediate.
Roine's also seen in the next Risto Shortcuts on the film.
KUVA: King Hietanen
Roine's shower isn't starting a promiscuity.
I wasn't going to be a shooting boy in the school.
40-50 years later, the teacher told me why I was so bad.
Sco Roine hasn't shooted.
Uran's choice was clear. There was no options.
It felt close and love.
I was so shocked that I left school and went to voluntary army only to try to work as soon as possible to the theatre school.
Roine has made about 200 teaterirole and 300 TV shows a little dependent on how to be calculated.
If the operations are calculated as anglesmans that each part of the TV is their own show, the TV is more than 600.
I was three years old in New Day, which I did three weeks.
In other words, I was killed when I had no time to do.
Securities from 2016
Esco grandfathers Eila, 83, and Liisa, 76, are completely shocked and do the Tampere worker Tetterr Lieve in the demonstration of strict roles as anarchism.
A little brother's shooting on the floor for years.
That looks like that now, but I don't know about this old age.
I'll always have to take a little back that I'll come if I'm in life.
Some of the commitments have been made or promised.
The calendar has stocks for 2016.
The years have left a man as well as his post.
I'm not gonna come alone.
Polvet has been operated, slowly swimming and a level of difficulty, but when you don't give it a lot of troubles, you know, Esco Roine says.
To the TV, Roine came to know what's going on.
From the Merrosvo radio, as well as from another visa in which she with Antti Einiy shared satellites, I'm going to spend hundreds of marchs.
It was Antti Unity who shared the satos.
I tried to smell that they're a sweet and not a skin.
Roine was a shocked Commissioner Rautakallo in the Reinical Search.
He became the favorite of Tampere's police officers when he was slaughtered to be the same awkward Commissioner.
Some cops stopped the car on the street, shipped the window opening and shouted me that "The Rautacall is great!"
Working Group Successfully
The theatre of Roinee's thinking have left a kid.
Helsing's Commerce Ingenieur Manufacturer and Mestaril Class, Tampere Labour Teater's death and the journey of Tampere Tetter.
All of them are that the presentations have been recommended.
It's not my fault, but the working group has succeeded.
We've got the rest of the ships.
The white tree's role in the film is one of the same.
There's another thing.
It's because I'm too easy to agree.
I don't know if I'm going to shoot these roles, but the final result is not myself, nor the viewers.
I'm not able to choose my own job as a strike.
It's just a skilled thing he's told.
On the theatre, Roine has tried to succeed in business life.
In the 80s, he was in Tampere, Wanhat Romeneot, a restaurant.
It was a learning experience.
There was nothing when I tried to be the director of the Tampere Teater, a shower, and then a restaurant assistant.
If I remember it right, in the year I realized that these aren't to be agreed with anything.
It was typical that when the show was finished or interim, and I had to think about whether I'm going to put on the sun, the restaurant was played that there are friends here that hoped to see you after the presentation.
Remembers for the Honour of birthday
On the birthday, Esko Roine appears to be the memories, as a scriber, Annika Grahn and Eija Mäkine.
Somebody's circumcises have received the memorys of the sweet smell.
At my sake, a time, in Zoom, I was called as a sweeter.
I didn't know what they called.
The book has been made for years.
Sometimes, Roine told me that nothing of the news bombs is promised because he didn't have done anything so pretty, or if there's, he doesn't tell me.
I made a book to a little start.
I'll say that if someone waits for scandale discovery or good drinks, it will help to stop reading this.
It's a lot of time to work there, so as a shower as the director of the Teacher.
The costor calls that there is also a turin of unfair theatre schooler.
It was timely a student life, but indeed it became the sight of all the spectacular shoes.
It wasn't the same wreck as the time of Turk.
It was very different.
I don't know how much more I got from there than self-security that when the school is using so knows that it's not at least obtained if it does not improve.
I didn't have to think about how good I would have been if I was going to school.
Roine also reminds the legends of the United Nations Steel.
I was friendly with Pente Simmes, Tarmo Mann, and Hannes Heirris, and I went to work with them.
Yes, there were legends from my first stage, Karlo, from the beginning of the Destiny.
Pia Hatar and I had very close between us.
It's been Palo's already gone, but I've been able to meet him at school time.
The average son, Martti, was with me at the same course.
At the Teater School, Roine met his first wife Marjucca I want.
The painful thing he remembers his marriage.
After a relative struggle, the children were shared.
Not two parts, but because she went to my mother and son.
I wouldn't like it to be a good solution, and I think that the children are at the same time agreed to be adults now.
There's no rare in the teaterpine that the gold will be divided.
In other cases, there was a part of the fact that I had done a lot of work at that time.
I was in the theatre nearly every case.
And then there was a television and a radio on it.
I've done a long day and a family life.
On Thursday, maybe free.
Esko Roine celebrated Tampere in the Teater of the Middle Democracy on September 7th.
The celebration continues to be held on 21 and 28 September.
It's a smuggler. It's just a smuggler.
I had five kids in work and six kids in work.
When this easier spectrum happened, I thought that there are seven hundreds of clusters now, and they will be able to get away.
According to Roine, there are no celebrations on a special birthday.
I remember it's free, but I'm not going to swear.
I could have buried somebody on that day.
Or then it's awesome of the free I'm going to be free, Roine says.
E-mail companies are concerned with the production box
Some of the smallest aircraft manufacturers in Iso-Brittan, in their concern, are concerned that the manufacturing capabilities of the supply chain can be shocked from large aircraft manufacturers’ ambitious plans to add the production of passengers.
The manufacture chain of thousands of aircrafts in the United Kingdom had enjoyed the unexpected large amount of aircraft and motor plans at the same time.
Email and Defense
At the time of some enjoying the opportunities, warnings for the capacity of the production chain and prices were made.
"It is true that the price exists, especially now when the volume of production causes challenges", says Craig Gallagher, Director of the MB Aerospace Manufacturers of Rolls-Royce.
According to the reporting director of the North-West Aerospace Association, about 240 goods represented by the Producer of Creoteis-English aircraft, David Bailey is required to increase the capacity.
"Do you engage in strategies and investment plans for these growth plans?
I'm not really sure of it.
We need first to invest in new production equipment and machines that are needed so that these production quantities can be implemented", says Gallagher.
Some enterprises say that the same implementation of new production projects and the increase in the construction of aircrafts is part of the problem.
According to JJ Chrurchill’s director Andrew Churchil, the company has a "functioning time" behind, where a number of new building plans were initiated at the beginning of the year.
We moved from a very low production shock to a condition where the production condition exceeded.
Many of the opportunities were paid just later, and we had to try to switch forward.
However, it is not useful to try to explain that the problem is caused by new production projects simultaneously,” says Churchill.
JJ Churchill has responded to the challenge by investing 8000,000 to new machines and paying 26 new employees.
Many operators in the field agree that the integration of the central investment and smaller providers will be further needed if Iso-Britannia wants to maintain their position as the second major operator after the United States.
The President of the Ford Aerospace Company and the great Magazine Ingenieur Geoff Ford said that the opportunity to increase confidence should be made by producers and wants to expand and increase production rates because the work is to be sufficient.
"If this doesn't happen, we'll lose the other countries in competition," Ford says.
Some major operators try to solve the problem by purchasing capacity.
The UPECA 75 million roof of the UPECA aircraft, which is part of the FTSE 250 index.
MB Aerospace has purchased the company last year from North America and Poland.
"It is possible to purchase new start-up enterprises, but in fact, the mainest production of planning is the limited number of engineers and engineers", says Gallagher MB Aerospace Company.
The small and large enterprises have mentioned the prices which have moved to them from large aircraft manufacturers and motor manufacturers.
Some believe that the problems of the producers in the production chain are excessive.
The President of the ADS, director of the GKN Aviation Unit, Marcus Bryson, who also operates as a representative of the Ison-Brittan aircraft trade, agrees that the production chain has been treated better than the most recently.
There's the pressures in the work chain, but I wouldn't describe the situation as critical.
"The more important thing is the introduction of the new technology and development process", says Bryson.
And the Airbus and Boeing have taken errors to learn and are now more careful so that the buildings do not add too fast.
When Boeing tried to increase its production in 1997, it became the greatest difficulties when the company has defeated, produced, and the production chain had been fighting to survive.
Tony Wood, director of the Rolls Royce Airports, says that the company has not yet faced problems in the production chain, which provides the most of the 18 000 parts of the manufacturing of the motor vehicle.
"It will certainly be deep, but we believe that we have made more fundamental work in the field of transmission by choosing the best partners of cooperation and maintaining contact with the providers when they are prepared to increase the operation", says Wood.
According to James McNerney, the company’s production chain has been able to increase delivery rates.
We have a good feeling about the strength of the production chain.
We have operated openly with the suppliers, which is very important.
Fabrice Brégier, director of the Aviation Protection Unit, said that the company makes all risks to reduce its plans to increase the production of A350 models in 10 months until 2018.
"There is not possible any of the providers, and our task is to try to prevent this situation and to support the providers and search for options, but we are waiting for great problems," says Brégier.
Bregier says that Airbus does not search for synthetics: "The quality of the production chain is responsible for the principal employer.
So this is me and the Airbus work."

In Peking, Head of the National Congress Committee Li Fei reported to the employees that the defence of the "international demands" is a "small" and would leave some of the Hungarian politicians, which are trying to "smell society and lead it to faults".
"Indeed, non-praktical proposals such as the public appointment have been long-term," said Li, demanding that the legal situation should be created so that it corresponds to the real situation and legislative frameworks of each society.
The general law instrument for the vocational rights can only be adopted if a large majority of two third parts of the Hungary 70 legislative body supports, which means that 27 opposite members of the Government can stop the initiative.

This is the new software guide for workers and employees, and it shares the writer of the Monday Morning Manager page Harvey Schacher.
The company Seth Godin says that the good idea is to recognise comments like "I don't like it" or "I don't understand."

What's "4chan"?
Anonym of the communication site has published as the first year of the publications in low-speed pictures
What is precisely "4chan", and why was it the first option of hacker's pictures stored in his publication?
The "4chan" was established in 2003, and it has been an overwhelming message page, which is called as much as the call.
The page has been distributed to several items, such as reporting tables where users can discuss all possible, video games and travel to porno and searching.
Unlike other networks, users do not create an identical, constant profile, nor maintaining their publications.
At the most recommended tables, comments may be lost in minutes when the publications are released to exclude them at the bottom of the page.
These two factors have created the "4chan" of a quadric, anarchical and surprising air cloud.
Anonyme members of the Community, have created some of the most famous networks (such as "riccroling" and "lolcats", but the lack of the rules of the website has also caused a lot of criminal content on the site.
The recommended page information table is /b/, which is intended to be discussed and regularly shown by NSFW content (Not Safe For Work).
This can be included in the short porno, but also sweet and sweet pictures. The node hashker published the images stored by the publishing publications on the end of the weekend.
American Cyrx is invested in the study and development of cancer medicinal products
The CyRx company aims to improve cancer, or at least heat it.
The company that has produced biological drugs in Los Angeles, which has been a little time ago for the effectiveness of the components, has been specialized for the study and development of cancer drugs.
The promised medicinal product is aldokssorubin, which is more developed in chemotherapy to use doxsorubs.
CydRx performs clinical studies in treatment with aldoxsorubic glucoomy or brain glucose with AIDS.
This is the same as the controlled ring that is directly growing and not to any other body, says the Director of the CytRx Company of Steven Warsman cancer cancer to the aldoxsorubians.
Aldocsorubin contains the so-called combination technologie that operates as a Trojan horse.
It is linked directly to protein, which is also collected to growth in which the medicine is directly flowing into cancer cells.
I tried to cut the medicine only in the environment, or in cancer cells, but not in a healthy feed.
This technology can be given to patients more and more cancer drugs.
"In this way, it's like a shift that is walking directly to growing and not to any other body", says the director of the CytRx Company, Steven Warsman.
As many other biotechnicians focusing on the development of medicinal products, CydRx does not win.
The company sold shares this year and collected 86 million dollars to enhance and investigate the operations.
CydRx is looking for 400 patients from the worldwide to a solution to the 3-face clinical study of alternative treatment in therapy.
The synthesis acid is a cancer that is developed in grains of body, such as blood, meat and skin.
Alternative treatment is used in cancer treatment when the original treatment does not lead to results.
If a clinical study has succeeded, CyRx plans for its applicant medicine to authorize the management of food and medicines in the United States already in 2016, warsman says.
The physician could then be approved in 2017.
Analytics say that CydRx's previous clinical studies reported to the treatment of aldokssorubin to be a promising treatment series in December.
"A long time the question was: "We have not seen clinical information how much it differs from the medication itself", says H.C. Wainwright & Co., analysis of Andrew Fein.
The publication of the results confirmed many of the view that this treatment is different.
However, Phin says that it is difficult to predict the results and timetable of the current clinical study, since it is significantly different from a previous study which has been received good results.
"That's gonna be right," he says.
Phoeni compares the development of medicines to the coal industry.
"The first one will be invested a lot of money to find it in one gold sweet, and the investment continues so long that my gold shoes are found", he says.
The money costs to investigate and to develop so long that the medicine can be managed to commercialize.
Many shareholders have required the CyRx company in the right, since they believe that it has realized the success of a better image.
The company is accused of paying investment relations with the DreamTeam Group, which then claimed that you paid people to write positive comments on the CyRx company and the other biotechnical company for Forbez, Seeking Alpha, Motley Fool and Wall Street Cheat Sheit on the site.
According to the claims, the entities did not find out that the payments were paid to writers.
The new consequences of Seaking Alpha reported the articles that they were removed: "If they were practically opposed".
In addition, other websites have been removed from several articles concerning business.
The warsman refused to comment on the accusations.
The company has paid an external lawyer to respond to the claims.
"I have no time and no energy to focus on this." The warman says.
He said that the real challenge of CyRx is to find gifts of employees who are usually trying to work in the field of biotechnology such as San Diego, San Francisco and Boston.
"This is in many ways thinking of a distance of medical industry," he says.
Analyst newspaper views
The price of the CytRx company increased at $8,08 on 10 January and laid down in April at least three dollars when the claims on the advertising of shareholders were public.
According to the Analyst newspaper, cases and negative publicity have calculated the price of shareholders less than their real value.
"It's unlikely," Phine says, "but I'm not sure that there's nothing easy to do this as long as the concept is in power."
The law named the police camerar was killed among the pictures.
On the basis of the real event, in the name of the Law presented in Finland the descriptor died in the night when he was shooted through a shooting interval.
The cameraman pictured a private police park and a weapon robbery between a ill person when he got a part of the piece.
He died fast in the weaknesses.
The police reported the TMZ page that, in the shooting interval, the suspected person died in addition to the camerar's armed robbery.
The Law's name series for the first True TV programs has been presented in the United States since 1989.
The Finnish series have been presented since the 1990s of MTV.
As regards the external factor, Ulvila has risen to a resolved role in marriage processing today.
The mother of Aueria is accused of the murder of Jukka S. Lahde in 2006.
The right of marriage is to be treated in the second time, since the High Rights returned to the new provision of the certification.
The court's purpose is that the court is still given on the side of this year.
The rule of marriage released Auer in 2011.
Then the law was sufficiently likely to be the possibility of an external factor.
In the Cleans of the Covenant, Kal Kumala reported about the murder of the accused person and the matters that discard the possibility of the external factor.
We believe that the solving question is whether the house has become an external factor who has killed Jukka Lahde Anneli Auer by telling the way and time.
This is about the credibility of Anneli Auer's report," Curmala said.
The Henkirchos reported that a family divorce, during which Auer had reported his home home and his demanding marriage.
At the stage, Lahti was moved to the kitchen where she was taken from the Auer and tried to stop this source.
Some of them took a kitchen shooter, "Culmala described the events of the lunch night.
According to the complainant, there are many evidence that there was no external factor.
For example, the emergency telephone plan does not include the external factor.
The older daughter of Auer told me that he saw a factor when a man was out of the door of the bathroom.
The Court of Liberty of the Court of Justice in 2011 was partly based on the report of her daughter.
According to the complainant, the recognition of the daughter cannot be held in its place
"Tyser didn't see the outdoor factor in the bedroom of parents, although he went there two times to look at it," said Curma.
The new Witness of the guilt is just an external factor.
The sister of S. Lahde has told us about the event after the murdered night in the hospital.
According to her daughter in the hospital, only she saw the body of the Lahde when he was in the bathroom.
The Defence of Auer wishes to submit investigators whose part of the police has not been determined sufficiently.
When Vasa’s marriage was released three years ago from the accused of Auer, the right to find a visitor Dna, a reference from the external factor.
A later show was shown to an investigator Dna working in the Central Radio Police Lab.
And then, as a mass, 700 people were taken from Dna.
Indeed, a significant number of serious suspects and optional investigators were discarded, said Defense Assistant Juha Manner.
Another defence of the new Witnesses relates to the possibility of external factors.
The outbreak told the police about a portal man who was a woman who acknowledged the work.
The police was part of a man in the summer.
The guilt decided that the portal man had nothing to do with the spirit.
The accused woman made a request for investigation, because the accused suspects her lie in his report.
Another defence of the new Witnesses is a nurse who was killed in the Central Hospital of Satan.
The Court of Cyclopedia condemned Auer's life-based prison punishment in December.
According to the Court of Justice, the case of the external factor, such as the reports of Auer's children, refers to the votes of the external factor as well as the time required for the expenditure.
The court was the second-year-old one.
The judiciary remained in the minority wrote that in crime, the offence must be attributed to the benefit of the accused provision.
This is why the report of her daughter must be explained that, despite the conflicts of the report, this has been observed from the door of the outside of the shuttle chamber.
The two older boys of Auer have been called to hear the court.
The first time she heard personally in the law of the Soviet Union last year.
When he heard in the court, he never remembered the events of the murdering night.
My second older child named her mother as murderer at the video school in 2011.
The boy told her to hear the events of the murder of the night's door closed.
He also told that Auer planned to kill a half years.
The child does not have a lawyer's responsibilities in marriage.
The marriage agreement is continued by Anneli Auer's hearing today.
The hearing of the sun continues, if necessary, tomorrow.
Annel Auer is at this time more than seven years of prison for sexual and violence against children.
Should Putin participate in the G20 meeting allow?
In Ukraine, I have made a lot of enemy enemy.
It is intended to participate in the G20 Summit in Brisbane in November, and in Australia it is very pleased to discuss whether his income should be allowed or not.
Puncrock-active group Pussy Riot requires Australia at the end of the week to prohibit the participation of Putin in the higher meeting of more than 40,000 representatives from the world's most powerful states.
"This person thinks we have nothing to do to the G20 Meeting," Mary Alyokhina said to the public at the fully packed Sydney at the festival Festival of Dangerous Ideas.
What has been warned on its "complete war", and Putin calls parts from Ukraine "Novorossia" or "new as Russians." Do we therefore need to be welcomed to him?
Tony Abbott said, "It's got a decision."
According to Mike Callaghan, the director of the G20 Institute of Lowy Institute, Australians cannot decide whose part of the meeting may be taken, even though the meeting is held in the country.
"Australia can decide who will leave it to the country, but this is an international meeting," he says.
Like the meetings of the United Nations of New York, or the meetings of the International Monetary Fund of Washington, "It is not to prohibit any of the calling future," Callaghan says.
Last week, Tony Abbott said, "It's got a deceptive decision" after Russia's deceiting action in Ukraine.
This is a very important question.
Since Putin has come to a very important international meeting, Australia has no right to decide on this matter alone.
"But this is the important thing I'm going to red much, and I believe that the other countries do so as the next ones," he says.
People participate in a warfare meeting in Mariopoli, Eastern Ukraine.
The occurrence will take two days, and it is participating in multi-partial representatives of the world's largest and more rapidly developed economys, with a total of about two third parts of the world, which are 85 per cent of the world's GDP and 75 per cent of international trade.
Member States belong to the Member States of Canada, China, France, Japan, Russia, the United States and the European Union, as well as several of the visits in the G20 countries, such as New Zealand, Singapore and Myanmar.
According to Callaghan, Australia had a task to balance between different attractions under a large public pressure.
He believes the best way to handle the matter is to use the opportunity to press Russia to speak publicly about its recent activities.
"The Minister should say that we will use this opportunity to work on a very open dialogue, and that he must ask President Putin to make a account. "
If Putin comes to the meeting, his responsibilities must be given to the findings of its activities," Callaghan says.
There is clearly the growth of geopolitical places.
I think the world is waiting for them to speak.
The Russians prepare arms in the Donetsk Airport in Eastern Ukraine for the attack against Ukrainian armed aid.
It is still uncertain if Put participates in the meeting, and Callaghan said that this is not necessary before a few days before.
This is certainly the last thing in Putin's mind.
He, however, states that "I have to change my position to Ukraine, because I would like to go unexpectedly in November to Brisbane."
The Opposition Director Bill Shorten is the "excellently remarkable" in the Income of Putin in Australia, but understands that this is a international conference.
The Chief and Foreign Ministers must probably have time to discuss with other countries and G20 countries whether it is appropriate to allow Putin to enter the country in Australia.
This has international, not an Australian conference, I understand it.
After the following tragic events of Malaysian Airlines, as well as in the lack of an ambitious cooperation with the regret, responsibility and aircraft, and now, when thousands of Russian military states are swallowing in the border of Ukraine, I think that most Australians are very worthy to hope Putin to be welcomed to Australia.
Germany's business world is critical of the "treatures" Berlin
Some of Germany's high-speaking leaders warns that Germany has become "reliable" and "reliable" because the government's policy threatens the difficulty of the country's competitiveness.
The criticism planned towards the Government Angela Merkel is at the same time when the largest European economy seems to be the marks of long-term, which causes concern if it can spend the economic growth in the euro area.
The critical risk of enterprises is that the German trade sector is strictly opposed to political decisions, including the introduction of the minimum market, and the decrease of the age of 63 employees for certain long-term service workers.
"I think that the greatest threat is now too much confidence in Germany, which causes an unreasonable feeling of self-relatedness", says the director of the world's largest chemical manufacturer, Kurt Bock.
EU Economy
He agrees: "Thankly, I feel that we work well, we have money to use and unemployment at a relative low level.
I think this is a great danger to hide.
The political policy of the German government shows that we are not concentrating on growth and we are not grateful to the environmental enterprises, but we are focused on it, instead, to share more resources and to meet the expectations of certain wills.
According to Markus Kerber, Director of the BDI Industry Organization, "The situation is right now.
However, in the next ten years, the economics developed must be changed. ...[Germany] reform programme does not have been achieved as much progress as in the past years.
The national trade campaign DIHK has also expressed criticism against recent political development.
Germany’s unemployment has remained at a low level and the budget is almost balanced, even though long-term consumption is still growing.
However, the second fourth BKT has highlighted the deterioration of the exportable German shock of Russia and Ukraine towards the external shocks.
BKT reduced 0,2 % during the three months before June compared to the previous year.
The deteriorated execution of Germany is threatening the ECB's fight against inflation to be more difficult, and it may make a certainly viable probability.
Kerber would hope that the government would "return public consumption to public investment", for example, by focusing on the additional infrastructures and not for such infrastructures.
Kerber believes that the Merkel government will destroy its social democratic leader, Gerhard Schröder, at the beginning of the 2000th century, the fruits that have been shocked at the political level.
According to Stefan Heidbreder, director of the Fundation Family Company based on families, "the situation is still good in comparison with other countries.
It is to thank the efforts and not the policy of the government. . .
The example of the neighbourhood of France has shown that the limitation of the freedom of funds to social aid and undertakings is wrong.
The former German investment bank describes the situation more directly, saying that the recent decisions of the government are "katastrophus".
Germany threatens to lose all that it has done so much work, just to enjoy voters.
This is my main career at this time," the banker says.
According to Bock, new government coalition energy reforms could not resolve fundamental deficiencies that caused industrial competitiveness to deteriorate costs.
Ashton Kutcher's access to the fan for music festivals
The shower Ashton Kutcher participated in the Stagecoach Music Festivals in India, California, where he was told to be shocked with a strict safeguarder.
Ashton Kutcher is told to be a shock with a safeguarder at the office music festivals.
Kutcher's fan tried to approach him at the backsheet at the Stagecoach-Candriculture Festivals in California, after which the situation was shooted on the hand, the TMZ page reports.
Kutcher was in VIP when a young woman approached her to health and handle her.
When the men's star went to welcome the fan, the super-innocent guard went through and caused a sleep.
The observers and safeman thought about the process, and the friends of Kutcher had to go through arresting Kutcher, TMZ tells them.
After the ex-astronomy, Demi Mooreta Kutcher meets Mila Queens, who is with Kutcher's former 70th show star.

Ocean bacteria killed a lomailer
The bacteria set out in the German Tourism from Caribbean has been infected by six people.
One of the hospitals is on the floor.
Vibrio vulnificus bacteria is eaten in parts of the Eastern and other world regions, but mostly it is found from Mexico.
The bacteria will grow more effectively in more than 20 centuries in the murders.
"Batteriery can be found wherever the conditions are right," Dr. Heiko Will reported to the Local Journal.
Bakteer is found at the same side in Denmark, Poland and the German Beach.
The LAGS reported that sickness was in the island of Usedom at the end of July.
She's gone at the beginning of August.
Another elder has been filled for three weeks, and it is possible that his feet should be shooted.
He went to see Ahrenshoopia near his legs.
He was sick in the hospital when he noticed that his feet changed into blue.
The doctors reported the blood injury caused by Vibrio bacteria vulnificus in the feet.
"My husband wouldn't certainly have carried time in the Eastern region if he knew about the danger," said the sick wife Sonja Bruehl to the Ostsee Journal.
Severe disease and blood injury could be avoided if information would be better offered. For example, a vacation could be placed on information on this subject.
LAGS reported to the dpa renewing office that the doctor has been invited to be next infection at the beginning of a long time, but no official information has been given.
Increased temperatures have resulted in the risk of bacterial disease.
"The results of the [Maantain] test showed that V. V. vulnificus bacteria has reduced significantly", says Dr. Will.
A lot of rules have been tested.
Vibrio vulnificus, the family of bacteria caused by bacteria, is specially dangerous if a person has predominantly a chronic paying disease and a deteriorate immune, such as HIV or diabetes patients and older people.
The risk of a man's sickness is greater than women, because strogen has been observed from protecting my pathogen.
If bacteria is sick, it causes blood disease and seed.
The probability of bacteria’s loss of cardiac disease is around 25%.
V. V. vulnificus bacteria can also be ill by eating its contaminated marine animals, but in these cases, Dr. Will has not been able to do this.
The contamination of foodstuffs from the sea is more generally at the Southern Palmschool.
In Germany, the bacteria V.V. vulnificus had caused drought in the past time in 2010, where two people died.
Export China: Rail has been removed because of cancer skin
The explanation of 80 years of single, Vieno China, is shocked and shocked, but it has also been aware of fear for his health.
It is unbelievable that radiant Vieno Church has been filled for 80 years.
In fact, she's surprising how many years of age may be so much.
I didn't really know that I was so old.
80 years, it sounds very much, Vieno Queen's fun.
His birthday, Vieno Church, takes his family.
At the end of August, he was organized a birthday of the people's music and ages in Kartula where he lived in his childhood.
We were the Law of the Church, where my grandfather was born.
I was so shocked from the party, the birthday's birthday tells me the opportunity to spend a swimming snake for three days as a full of happinessers.
A couple of days later, Mohosk was gathered to welcome the Army Head, whose life Vieno Church remembers his followers.
And now we're both of this age!
I don't know what you're doing.
During its long term, there are only rare parts of which Vieno the Church has not been seen publicly.
One thing he has never told publicly: from 2006 he has been removed another part.
In my ring there was a doubtful finding in the point that it was decided to be removed completely.
It wasn't finally a cancer, of course I was happy.
In the surgery there was a new range, so it was particularly important to the question.
The export has not been thinking of losing its own circumstance, because the information of the uncertain foundation would have been a weak point, and that is not possible to leave it without treatment.
I was just so easy when there was nothing serious, Vieno the Church tells and emphasis that the loss of the age is certainly more difficult.
Read Vieno Church's wide personal observation over the whole day of the night of the Sunday.
You're in the newspaper here!
The driving shall be made in cases of the ocean state
The debate on the weak state of the Eastern Ocean and its connection to the Finnish agricultural is deteriorate.
The voice of experts has been shocked in politically aware of the views of the demanders.
In particular, Helsinki and Yle have long received the responsibilities of agricultural emissions to Eastern Sea.
Similarly, a rapid action has been required in order to regulate emissions.
The central sector of agricultural farmers affect a number of environmental researchers and, in this regard, they are in comparison with the overwhelming restaurant providers.
The farmers know that nutritional care can not be farmed if the same amount of food has been frozen as the harvest is corrected.
In Finland, almost all agricultural countries have linked to the environmental programme.
It strictly limits the use of feeding plants and requires a review of monitoring and reporting.
The authorities shall monitor the compliance with the conditions.
Reserved restaurants have also been shocked to water stations, but this has already been a clear reduction in emissions in the years.
The operators want and will continue to work in order to reduce the feed emissions.
However, everyone should understand that the nuclear access is impossible.
"If we want to have the amount of agricultural production that we intend to consume, it is only to accept that it is", Jyrki Aakkula, director of the MIT Environment Studie (MT 29.8.).
The summer went to the Finnish Lake, putting your nerves to the Finnish.
The researchers were particularly unusual to the fact that the length has increased the power of the sea's own fosfore resorts.
The stocked fosfor of the sea is part of the agriculture of the past decades of the raw states, but it does not only explain it.
The cleaning of the cities of the Eastern Coast was at the end of the 1900s.
The problem also resulted in the large-Helsing residues and did not have a problem as regards the contamination of the borders.
The contamination of the rains was expected to be built in the 1980s by building a residue to the open sea.
The quality of the water controlled there has been improved in the course of the years.
At the same time, food that ended in the sea did not be removed, although the agricultural is to stop the whole of Finland.
However, every tragic discussion and accused condemnation are always addressed to the agricultural sector of this day.
The public debate is the guilty of the farmer in the Ocean state.
The cause is unreasonable, but it is more difficult to change when it is used to implement political intoxications.
Greens think of their President, Minister of Environment, with great change in agricultural environmental standards.
The so-called swimming pool has been using a long-term discussion.
The same has been very accused of the interests of the producers of MTK in prison and was more difficult to prevent the water protection system.
Some borders should be on a political reactor.
Most water protection projects are based on the cooperation of MTK, farmers and environmental management.
The typical spectrum of the city green serves more fishing than water protection.
It's a lot of purposes.
The green are prepared to leave the government.
In policy change, the task of MTK is to take care of the results of its members.
The changes for the farmers are difficult to trade unless their costs are found for the replacement.
The only money that Ville has been presented is the operations of other agricultural money.
Decrease of coffee tax is not through: Palmer
The last company of Abbott's government is able to defeat the smooth tax to the roasker because Clive Palmer has declared that his senators reject it without any changes.
The Australian Working Party is also afraid that the Government has incorporated a new initiative to restrict the addition of employees to compulsory pension costs even until 2034.
The Government has used a majority of the amounts in the European Parliament in the midst to press the process through the general detection in the power and the clear empowerment of the unemployment.
It set on the page the original submission instrument before which the senate had made significant changes, and replaced it with the new legislation, which was mainly relating to taxes, pension costs, social security and family support.
In the first place, it was the initiative to decrease the "only achieved" coal tax as well as other decisions such as less income (3.6 billion dollars), the income grant ($1.3 billion) and the bonus paying for school children (4.7 billion).
Mr Clive Palmer, Director of the United Party Party (PUP) did not accept the movement of the government.
"Availablely planned coal tax advisory does not accept in Senate without less income living payments, income aid bonus and income payment for school children," he tweeted.
The Government requires support for independent parties like PUP to ensure that the working partners and green don't start against the senates.
Foreign Minister, Chris Bowen accused that the Government is trying to remove Parliament's power to decide on the compulsory amount of pension payments by giving to the Minister of State Safety to the whole Resolution.
"This is unpredictable," he said to the employees in Canberra.
In this way, the Government could extend additional additions where the 12 per cent target of the workers' pension costs would even be transferred to 2034.
"It isn't an acceptable way, and the working partner will, of course, oppose all the ways," says Bowen.
It is 9,5 per cent now, but the Government wants to allow the Ministers to decide to stop the future additional entities.

According to Mexico's police, one of the explosive explosives in the border

The 3th Atlantic City casino closes in September
Third Atlantic City casino closes its door in this month
Many game in the Showboat casin that must be closed by its door, Atlantic City, N.J., 29.7.2014
It is expected to be difficult for a month to Atlantic City when three casino shares the last cards to the table
The three casinos close their doors in Atlantic City in New Jersey, which means that this metropolis, known from the cluster of money, can no longer be counted on players.
More than 5 000 employees remain without work at the close of showboat and Revel casinos this weekend, the Associated Press Agency reported.
The unemployed ones will be further when Trump Plaza blends their light.
The third casin, one of which had been able to operate only two years, is expected to close the last disaster of the city at the end of the history of the Atlantic Club only eight months ago.
By the end of May, over 25 percent of the city's casino workers, 80,000 people, will be unemployed, New York Times writes.
When the drought was permitted in New Jersey in 1976, the casinos were reported as a choice for a bad economic to Atlantic City, the Agency of the AP.
However, the local threats area has increased competitors when the New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania casinists condemned a large part of the Atlantic City once so much.
Even previously, Massachusetts opposed his own part of the money by hopeing the State to be welcomed to three casinos.
TVO: Area New Time Table difficult to accept
According to the Industry Power (TVO) it is difficult to accept the new evaluation of the institutional operator Areva, which indicates that the Trial Reactor of Olkio will be obtained in the commercial use of the Olkio Creator at the same time in 2018.
According to Jouni Silvennonez, the director of the Force Project, this results in the fact that construction works are already ready and that the number of works between them is available.
The TVO continues to evaluate the data obtained in the Area.
In information, the Silvernourn states that TVO should be welcomed by all initiatives which can be speeded up the project.
Areva presented today a updated timetable to the TVO, which indicates that the construction of the third reactors was prepared in the half of 2016 and the commercial activity could be started in 2018.
According to Areva's information, the recent delays of the project have resulted in the approval of the reactor's automation systems obtained in April.
This has been negotiating with the TVO for four years.
It should be prepared first in 2009, but the time schedule has been delayed once again.
TVO and Areva have been overwhelming for years about whom is responsible for delay.
In the case of Areva’s interim rights, the refund of EUR 2,7 billion is required from the TVO.
Instead of the TVO, Areva's requirements are unreasonable and requires about 1,8 billion euros from the company.
Cooperation of energy and water operators is necessary in the face of global challenges
The international leaders of Tukhol was meeting today in the 24th International Water Framework Framework, which encouraged energy and water operators to cooperate to meet our greatest challenges in order to ensure that sufficient water and energy production is still growing.
The theme of the 2014 water water is Energy and Water.
Water and energy are often dependent on each other.
Energy is needed to pump water, to maintain, transport, and clean, and water is required for almost all energy production.
If one of these is increased or decreased, it will immediately affect the other.
These two stocks are also an integral part of sustainable development, and they must always consider global decisions.
The International Water Institute of Tokholma said to Torgny Holmgren, in the opening of the Water Island, that “the challenges are great”.
In the next two decades, the global water supply is expected to increase 55% in 2000-2050, and the energy education is expected to increase 50% during the next two decades, and it is therefore urgently necessary for close cooperation between energy and water operators to find solutions to the extent of all world peoples.
In this year, Professor John Briscoe described the water of growth as a basis for the possibility of growth, which is needed as a whole society and other sectors. Briscoe said that "in developing countries there are major challenges.
They have to mobilize these resources.
Briscoe added that "[water crisis] does not exist a permanent solution in anywhere."
Instead, there are challenges and solutions that form others.
In the week, the providers discuss the labour and future work and cooperation of energy and water operators during over hundred seminars, workplaces and events.
First of the South African professor John Briscoe receives the Tukholm water barrier of Tukholm his Majesty King of Sweden Kaarle XVI from Kusta, in the town of Tukholma on September 4th.
The International Water Institute (SIWI) of Tukholm is a research centre that produces research information and provides information to decision-makers in order to make reasonable decisions for water and sustainable development.
A flight of dead bodys home in Miami: the costs of the flight of the bodys
In October 2012, 23 Cuban refugee Miami passed down, and 14 people were told to die.
The same has happened to hundreds of years ago, and this has not certainly been the last quality.
Each year, more than 1,000 Mediterranean migrants die in an unlawful attempt to overcome the U.S. border.
Because of the first city, we're ready to die.
However, when it comes to the first city in the country, it is irone that the rare plans to stay there until his last life is.
Many of this city is an interim residence place: whether a safe place, an effort to up or a better time-free place at waiting.
The hard imagine that he dies there, and many plans to return to his home when he approaches the death.
In the favorable cities of the migrants, there is a large number of foreign people who have been born and temporaryly living in the country, and their death and return to their homes continue to work.
The estimation of 20 per cent of the dead bodies in Southern Florida is flighted to other parts, and the amount is more than anything else in the United States.
Most of the human votes (HR, Professionalslange short forms) are flighted home from the international airport of Miami.
Since 1964, Pierson, the largest company, reported by the Director of Foreign Affairs, is about 80 per cent of this transport to the outside of the country, which has been flying the body to several items in Mediterranean and South America and several European countries.
Source: Aer Lingus
What more migrants will turn into favorite cities, so much more they will die there.
Even after the death, there's their costs.
Miami is the headquarters of the American Airlines Company to Latin American flights, and the numbers of the table are described by the aircraft's return to the human systems that are flying home in 2013.
The return of the bodys to the home is not worth: prices can change from five hundred to thousands of dollars.
Moreover, religious, cultural and public health requirements relating to the flight and delivery of human laws vary.
Translated cities are sometimes organizing funding communities in order to help costs, because the return of the body is worthy, the government does not help in the process and the dead are often young who have no insurance.
A number of credit institutions and unofficient disease security programs have recently been born from such communities which were established in New York by Italian, Jewish and Greek – the first groups of migration in the United States.
New generations of transferers of Mexico, China, Philippines and bangladesh are now working in many of their favorite cities.

Death in foreign countries always causes difficulties, as a rare plan to change its plans of transfer of the city’s last relief.
For example, in Dubai, without a complaint for the foreigners of the dead, Sharia is respected by the dead laws.
The whole property of the death shall be refrigerated, after which it shall be shared in accordance with the decision of the Sharia Court.

2013) The wide range reflects the urban and Irish multicultural structure.
A flight company stopped the service, but it was re-established in 2004 by the changes of the country.
The thinking of death is rarely present in the way of human journey through the city of the migrants, or when they live there.
On the other hand, an interim or permanent change in the city of transfer is open to see the life of a translator, not death.
However, the death in the foreign city of migration means to make the decisions of the more poor and more unprecedented population — whether it wants to be a local or global community, a world society or a country, a short or eternal.
The Central and Left Union shall make a difference in the interface issues
Opposite parties in the centre and left-seat are going to do with the government on the low results of the question and the growth of the difference.
Democracy wants to raise discussions on people's employees, which enhance improving economic development and improving unemployment.
The growing diversity is also shown between the different parts of the country and within the large cities, and the parties are noted in their information.
In the next year of the government's operations and tax costs are subject to small results, such as students, unemployed and elderly, family and general work, as well as food, medicines and living.
In reality, almost half million people are already working, and the parties say in their information.
The challenges in the job have also been decreased.
The Chairmans of the Central and Left Association are treated as a tour.
Third opposite partners have already been informed of the lack of interim issues of the police and internal security resources.
You're starting tomorrow in the defense of the Force.
New York City West Indian Day starts soon
The Caribbean culture returns to the light in New York City, where West Indian Day is one of the greatest year's climate events, and the politicians also see each other and will be seen.
Annual paradise is held on Monday in Brooklyn.
It takes place in the celebration of traditional carnavals in the past time, and it is part of the dancers that make complex, often closed places.
President Eric Adams of the Brooklyn region is a feast of this year, but there are also many other politically known faces.
The paradise is an excellent opportunity for the current and candidate politicians to welcome the public week before the frontiers.
Despite celebration, the end of the paradise has also been part of violence in the past years.
The police has said its efforts to keep the event safely through additional measures, such as following the activities of the cycling works in the nearby.
Do you even ask repair questions?
Everyone knows repair questions, right?
That question is not possible to answer.
This language picture, or the question that is not expected to be answered, but which sends a certain answer to the direction, spends both higher speechs and the switch of the archiving day.
The original words of the Catholic endorsement of Cyceron are a long-term retouring question, which first is "When long, oh Catholic, will you use us for our patientity?"
The same concerns my wife's questions, "Why do I like to warm the children five days old?"
Why are you so crying?
The distinction is a better word for the retorning question.
The power of the retorning question is to hide that the question is open, and the public is struggled to accept the question.
Closely, the question of repair shows that no one could agree with it.
In the 1800s, the writer David Williams describes the question of the repair "any words that have been inspired to produce a strong sense of the truth about some subject, and the challenges presented on them are not possible to be different.
Art of assembly
Return questions may be presented afterwards if you want to achieve the most ambitious goals.
A number of return questions that have been planned to express a pain or anxiety are called episode.
For instance, Job uses them in the army of all the powers: "What are you benefiting from the smiling of me?
Do you have the same eyes as we?
Do you see the same thing as the man sees?
Return questions also include comments on my wife: "Why have you caused food injuries to children?
Are you so crazy?
You can't do anything right?
Furthermore, there is also a q. hypophore, which is questioned when questions are asked and are immediately answered.
Isaac Hayes offers this excellent example: "Who is the black skin that is sex nervous to all women?
Put it!
That's all the moods!
Who sacrificed his life for his brother?
Add examples to my wife, "What is the only food that the children have eating and where they could be painful?"
This channel.
Who's the idiot who eat it to them?
You.
Incredibly, the question of repairs is not generally triggered, although the recreational means the ability of the struggle.
If you are trying to talk to someone around instead of trying to preach to those who have already betrayed or whose self - selfishness, you would like to use regularly retorned questions.
They are more useful to agree together with opinions than trying to obtain another to accept their own opinion.
If the public is agreed with the same argument "Don't be pleasant when the sun is so sole?", the retorning question tells that the speaker is certain that he has a claim, which is better compromising the speaker and the public.
However, this is only if the speaker is sure that there are no different opinions.
In view of the unity has been achieved instead of trying to harmonize, the speaker may affect, yes, its own.
In other situations, a recursion question refers to the weakness of the argument.
In the title of the newspaper, the retorning question is often the strongest argument in the case of very weakly: "Do the space pyramids build?
In the lowest case, it is a danger that the question can lead to the response that differs from the dedication.
"Do you think the same thing as we?" was the risk of a campaign explanation of the British Conservation Party in the general wages in 2005.
Put your loss.
Some of these cases have come to an approximation, and Mrs QTWAIN questions (the British Provider John Rentull is known to consider questions To What Answer Is No, Questions who have no answers) are recommended.
A few years ago, a friend of my friend organized a competition that was looking for best examples.
The competitor obtained clearly the chapter "Do You Wanna Be In My Gang?", which sing off the popular Gary Glitter before he discovered the sexual use of children.
The writer has also written the book "You Talkin" to us?"
Researcher: The time of member State compromise may be over
At the beginning of the conflict in many countries, the Union still thought that it could be a compromise in conflict, Sarar says.
The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, previously said in Russian kanadian debate that peace for Eastern Ukraine requires discussions on the state of the region.
This would mean some self-government in Eastern Ukraine.
I told you that it would protect the legal rights of those living in the country.
The change in Ukraine as a Union State is, according to Area, the main priority of Russia's goal in a certain way.
The Ukrainian is certainly suspecting that Russia has tried to influence the Ukrainian internal policy.
If it is not possible to leave the State decision, another option could be of Russia's view to a remaining conflict where Russia would control Luhansk and Donetski, Saar, in practice.
The western and Ukraine have imposed Russia's weapons as well as the sending of soldiers to the western.
Russia has reaffirmed the arguments, for example, though Russian-governants have told themselves that in their own groups they have fighted "residents, voluntary Russian soldiers".
Capital Director: Catastrous responsibilities
The stakeholder recalls that the action is new and still degraded.
He believes that a catalogue in some law or even leads the Commission to work in matters relating to competitiveness and employment.
One of the priorities of the new time programme of the Commission is, of course, EU competitiveness and employment.
In this way, the Commission's power is able, the Tilliakian says.
The public believes that a catalyst background, a balance and a role during the economic crisis give him opportunities to the good position within the Commission.
According to the plans, the task would be unexpected, or the Cataly would not be under its own headquarters.
Instead, this should be the team in the field of competitiveness and employment in which it could be coordinated by the economic committee in addition to other sectors.
The leadership of the team in use could, for example, be designed and guided.
Military mothers: in Ukraine even 150,000 Russian soldiers
According to the Russian army mothers organization, Ukraine has been sent for two months even 150,000 Russian military states, and there are more than 70,000 Russian soldiers in the country.
According to human rights organizations, at least 200 Russian soldiers have died.
According to the rule, the hospital of Rostov, near the Ukrainian border, is slowly shocked in the Ukrainian war.
The mothers of the soldiers collect their information from the own of the soldiers.
The Nato Military Association has estimated that there are more than thousands of Russian soldiers in Ukraine.

The inconvenience of enterprises appeals shareholders but does not increase growth
Did Australia’s leaders today only encourage a large number by encouraging the hopes of the shareholder's assets and rebuilding their shares?
Does the resolution move from governments to shareholders whose government is serving?
The inconsistent team is important, the last week of the reporting period was reported.
The prices of the shareholders who have paid investors in the form of the resettlement programmes and shared more profits have clearly increased.
And there's nothing bad.
However, the third-party is that the consumption of the capital is lower than the analysts have predicted, and this is the fact that many of them can ask whether the recommendation of too long-term is being recommended and whether sufficiently closed and long-term growth is focused.
Some enterprises are re-employing money to shareholders and funding business in other ways.
The financing will be made more, for example, from the defence of the sharehold market.
This is a reasonable point of view of the company, since the law is at this time, when it is not the capital.
However, although the funds obtained from the market would not be taken into account, it is clear that openness to shareholders is funded primarily because the company uses less money to invest.
The net outcome of these purchasing programmes (and the foundation of investment plans) is the reduction of capital in the Australian market.
Credit Suisse calls for this report on the time of the capital, during which the companies have tried to keep all the powers of the shares smaller.
The same plan for enterprises is still less capital.
At the end of the reporting period, the value of the resettlement programmes was $3.7 billion and the value of the purchase programmes expected, unexpected, of 1.5 billion.
Credit Suisse has been so long that it considers the consumption of the capital as a sweet word in a report in its heading.
Although we have now figures that confirm that such trend exists, there have already been some months of unofficient evidence.
The director of the Australian Central Bank, Glenn Stevens, had been sufficiently noted for a few weeks ago that enterprises need a little more "consistence" in order to increase investment.
Stevens is not concerned about the future of individual enterprises, but the overall effect of the economy, since the consumption of the long capital is usually leading to negative consequences in the benefit of economic growth and employment.
Credits from Switzerland stated that "the own estimates of the reported enterprises on the consumption of their capital have been estimated by a average of four per cent during the past two years.
The estimates of the level of free cassure have been increased by a average of two percent.
Improvement of the cash virus may be increased in the consumption of the capital.
This slowly influences the view of the shareholders and the market shareholders, but it is also a evidence of obedience to enterprises.
If I get a column every time the director has said that the price of the part's short time is not important, I would be... well, the end of the statement is easy to consider.
Of course, this claim does not like its place.
The Directors of Auditors are fully careful of the prices of the shareholders and are very concerned about price communications.
The short and long-term bonus packages shall be defined in accordance with the value of the shares, and the position of the leaders depends on it.
The Executive Directors want to say that some decisions (e.g. business trade, increased investment or non-profit) are not always immediately recommended, but are useful for a medium-term strategy.
The company leaders themselves often choose the fact that the investment markets are in a very short way of view.
Thus, the wood of conservativeness today feels that the short-term objectives are accepted.
However, the end of the reporting period was too clear that the weight of the future capital consumption was to be reduced and the most regulatory enterprises were struggled.
Great coal companies, such as BHP and Rio Tinto, had a single share in the reduction of the capital, but also many other companies operate as well as – part of the escape and part of the fact that they feared the reaction of shareholders.
Why then investors stress the efforts to share the win?
According to Hasan Tevfik, credit strategist, it is clear that the shareholders want more income, since the profits of other traditional investment products have been reduced when the central banks have worldwide calculated higher prices to import more money to the market.
In this way, investors have been obliged to search for profits in the capital market, and they are stressed to share more profits.
The shareholder has also been very clearly made to the companies that they do not want to invest in high-risk companies who are insecure.
Investorers would like to want the same way to live in the approach of the investor.
The statistics of the previous reporting period clearly show that the inconvenience has affected many enterprises' consumptions and the growth of business change.
Refrigerators of low-scale photos appear to be distorted from information or e-mail styles
Jennifer Lawrence pictures and some sources say that videos on the Internet were acquainted by an unknown hacker wondering information security and Apple.
Although a chatroom has published lists of women's public persons and said that he had more pictures of women, the part of the described has stated that their images were wrong when others said that it had been removed pictures long ago.
The picture is much and has been known to the group of mm. Jennifer Lawrence, Jenny McCarthy, Rihanna, Kate Upton and American shower Mary E Winstead.
After hakeroin, the biggest question is what the attack was done.
What about pictures, videos, and what were they loaded?
The most important sources of the pictures in the news – unfortunate and fundamental attack on Apple iCloud service – are unlikely an option.
Great companies like Apple have set up the teams working within the house, which are to try to be regularly engaged in the company's own systems.
"Increased hackering Apple iCloud service is inevitable.
The original publisher also not claims that it should be in charge,” said Rik Ferguson, Chairman of the Information Security Agency of Trend Micro.
The simpler and most likely explanation of the hackers relating to these public persons (and the less than one person in question) is the e-mail address and a password, whether by saving or fishing information, or by engage in information on the site of the aid, which then uses these information against them.
Apple continues to investigate the claimed attack to the iCloud service used in the iPhone phones to store the settings and, above all, to a copy of pictures when they are transferred to the cloud server.
The user accounts can be logged in the iCloud service by giving this email address and password, after which their image and other information can be downloaded from the account.
This may be prevented only if the owner has taken two stages of recognition (two factor authentication, 2FA), or an additional protection, where the owner is sent to the mobile owner code before it is possible to be registered.
However, it is rare to use 2FA properties, or because it is not known or because it is considered difficult.
Apple continued to investigate whether all the information would be left from its iCloud service, and if it was so how widely the user accounts were taken.
The company has not given its opinion in the original version of this text.
Ferguson considers the possibility that the hacker has been using the Apple iCloud service link by compiling first the email addresses of the public persons, for example, from the address book of the second request code.
It is also possible that publications have been used the same password in several services where passwords were discarded through them.
The publisher of the Lawrence pictures claims that pictures are real, but don't tell them when they are taken.
Winstead said to the Tweet that it could be a long-term hacking company.
These pictures have been removed for a long time, so I can only imagine how long this requires a delicate difficulty.
I know the appeal of all the other haquerodines towards the masters,” he wrote in the twitter.
However, the first reporter Graham Cluley notes that Winstead had thought that his photos were removed from his mobile cell, but the removal of the image from the current smartphone does not always mean whether there are copies of the image.
Today’s smartphones regularly store images to the pillar service, since they often have no place for the large number of images of the user.
Apple's Stabilities Regulation is to store pictures in iCloud; Google Android uses Google+ Service and Microsoft Windows phones that store images for OneDrive service.
Ancient service providers, such as Dropbox, offer automatic images and data saving services.
"The people take and remove pictures, but they don't understand that pictures are loaded from the account," Cluley says to The Guardian.
Ferguson is the same agreement: "Disappeared doesn't always mean to be removed," he says.
Photos and videos can be stored for years.
If someone can handle the email address and password of the user, he can reload all pictures and videos sent by email.
Photos from Apple service can be downloaded for Mac machine, Windows PC or any Apple device.
Hakerian published a display which was claimed to be presented by the Windows PC, again unpublished videos and pictures.
The two-face recognition is protected from such hackers because it requires all those who try to copy the existing account to another device to give the original user to the device, usually the code sent to the mobile cell.
Without the code, the access to the license shall be stopped.
And Apple, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo offers two-state recognition for the type, but not yet know whether they used this public person service, or how many of them used it.
Some have said that the pictures in which they are claimed are not real.
The representative of Ariana Grande has said that the images in which the Grand is claimed are "fully wrong."
Victoria Justice wrote in Twitter: "I think the pictures that are undertaken are VALINETY, you don't understand.
Let me smell the smells right now.
Cluley's got another option.
Since hakeroin had been public persons, their accounts have been able to abolish someone who has handled their social media accounts or regularly handled their emails.
"I would like to know whether the shower's agents or some of the representatives are part of it," he thought.
However, these public persons do not use the same publisher or agency.
Another option is that a person who installed the victim of the victim of a security attack or helped one or more system in its configuration, and changed the system in a secret so that all information can be returned.
This was the case of the "Hollywood hacker" Flower Christopher Chaney, where he has published pictures from the Scarlett Johanson and Mila Kingis e-mail account in 2011, and he was sent for ten years in prison in December 2012. He was also intended to pay more than $66,000 injuries.
Chaney was accused of receiving more than 50 personal email accounts from November 2010 and October 2011. In some case, he requested Aguiler in the name of this stylist pictures of a smaller star, and then published images on the internet.
Chaney later asked for forgiveness, saying, "It was certainly one of the worst injuries of privacy that can be imagined."
Chaney was also claimed to two persons at the internet over ten years.
According to Cluley, "the stars in case of Chaney were destroyed to e-mail accounts, and they were changed so that someone sent their information in advance also after change of a secret."
Cluley says that the compulsory action of applicants to these accounts is "remembering the sleeves of the sleeves".
They just want to collect such information.
It is possible that a person has discovered the information and registration of these accounts on the list of services such as Dropbox.
Hakers have also been able to try to feel for a long time
or they managed some e-mail account information, such as the address book, and then fished the information of other persons.
I don't believe that this would be a simple iCloud security support.
Australia has provided its information services to help the United Nations to follow 44 peace security security that terrorists related to Al-Qaeda were slaughtered in Syria.
The terrorist group Jabhat al-Nusran is believed that 44 Fidhian Peace Safety Priests were captured. This terrorist group held Golan's overseas on the last week and forced the United Nations troops to settle.
Peace safeguards have been lost since mid-week, and there is no information on their home.
At the same time, the Ministers of Foreign Ministers of the United Nations, Julie Bishop, are very concerned about the event.
Bishop discussed the situation with the Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-Moon at the High Meeting, and he has provided Australia's assistance to save losses.
"I'm convinced that Australia helped the United Nations in all ways where it can provide information services,," he said to the AAP renewing services in Samo on Monday.
We are very grateful to contact all the cooperation and friends of the Information Network - to ensure that we can place them and that they are safe.
Bishop has already assured the Prime Minister of Fidō to Frank Bainimarma and Foreign Ministers Ratu Inoke Kubuabol that Australia uses its position in the United Nations Security Council to check the situation.
At the same time, the Philippinesian Peace Safety Group held in their armed armies reported in different parts of the same coastal region.
Since the fire of 1974, the United Nations has controlled Golan’s clouds from Syria and Israel.
Hurriers try to store your money through the coal instrument, warn ACCC by the Australian Competitive Authority
In order to store money, the ACCC will be warned.
The Competitive Authority SCAMwatch Unit has warned consumers and enterprises to confidence in the offers of the Government's government to the extent that thousands of dollars are offered.
The riders may use the numbers displayed in the media to prove to the consumer how much it can regulate after the purchase of the coal taxes and provide even $7,000 to this, in the warning.
The riders may be very convinced because they have found the victim's personal information that they use to try to obtain bank information or try to get the victim to pay.
They're talking about the temporary subjects to smile the victim.
The urgencys use other than the coal-based insurances, and their history is more developed, and they use timely things to build a shock around them.
Also, MH370's missing machine in Malaysia Airlines flight, and Robin Williams' death has been intrigued by the machines.
The ACCC guides to take contact of the company by means of the self-detected connections, instead of the data given to the player, if the personality of the player represents a smaller suspicion.
If you have an unexpected phone or e-mail that claims to represent the Office or company of the Government, such as the energy company, and that you have been right to repay because of the decrease of carbon tax, you are safeguarded.
If you believe that you have been disrupted and your personal information or transferring money to the slaughter, please contact your bank immediately.
If the offer is too good to be true — for example, the explicit money that the government shares — is probably it.
Budget names: Lippone measures the EU's Russian packaging
The former Prime Minister Pavo Lippone apprecies the commitments made to the Russians in the discussion of Taloussanomia.
Russia's priority in the policy is to go forward.
This is not necessaryly effective," Lippone says in the debate.
It has initiated work as a deployment of business activities in the EC archaetic regions.
It is concerned that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development of EBRD and the European Investment Bank suspended its project financing as part of the EU's economic scope.
"It means, for example, that the projects of the northern dimension, which have clearly visible visions, will go into the hills", says Lippone in the debate.
Financing refrigerators now face cooperation that can be rebuilding in Lippos if there is no confidence.
However, he believes that the interest in Finnish enterprises in the cooperation projects in the Middle East continues as large as ever.
It makes it best for the EC to discover about the artistic policy and the possibilities of businesses in the north.
It was not affected by the Ukrainian situation or the Russian situation.
In the clearing, it is looked forward for a long time, talking about ten years," he says.

According to the Court of Justice of South Australia, the murdered pizzarian namer Robert Vallelong was acting aggressive and violently outside the nightbird
Murdered by Southern Australian pizzeriano Robert Vallelonga.
The Court has found that the Pizzarian namer Robert Vallelong was agressively conducted as well as a partner and a safe person only for minutes before he was killed outside the night.
The lawyers in charge of Vallelong requested at the lowest court of the Adela in the Court of Justice to be released against the powers of their customer, as it was "speakly" from the self-defence.
Marie Shaw, QC, said that the case is not sufficiently serious to keep her customer whose personality has not been published until the court has been in charge.
"That the witnesses said the dead was so aggressive that he had had to remove the night chair," he said.
Then he began to smile, which resulted in the 40-year-old man who was smiling -- the loss of the guard.
It is important to observe that the accused has caused a slaughter of death, which clearly refers to self-defence or to another defence.
25-year-old man is sentenced to another murder.
Vallelonga, 44, was found unconscious from the Rundle St and Sinagogue Place's sight about 2.25 p.m. He had serious precautions.
He died in his wounds in the king hospital of Adelas on the next day, and friends and pizzars left to make One Tree Hill a "local legend".
According to the complainants, the death was not the subject, and after the case, he had said to the taxi carrier "swear someone sleeped for a few days."
But now the video of the security camera shows something else, Shaw says.
"It confirms that the dead was agressive - his partner tried to calm him and obtain himself from a strong and violent behavior," he said.
Our customer has a position of innocentness and evidence that he defended himself, which will be mentioned in the court.
The complainants opposed the freedom of man, because the three safeguards were only one of the safeguards for the use of Vallelong.
They said that other guards did not keep him threatening because “there wasn't a short,” and he used a young man's vocabulary, because he wanted to avoid physical combination.
They said that the case also clearly saw a tax carrier would prove that Vallelong was shocked "weakerly", and he had no possibility to defend himself.
Judge Elizabeth Sheppard decided to arrest a man until the next week he declared his decision.
The defence of the delphinics began in Japan - based on a tradition - Outdoor news - night-Sanotes
The rules of tomorrow were expected in a slow world by the beginning of a deterioration of the forest.
In the Japanese city of Taij again began a year - lunch of the forest of the delphine.
It's expected until the end of February.

Some of the uncertainties from the Member States of the Natonia on the involvement of new forces in Eastern Europe
The National Union shares views of whether Eastern Europe and Baltics should create support points as a response to the Ukrainian crisis, reports the Financial Times.
Poland and Viro have requested the military alliance to bring the permanent troops to their countries, but the German Alliance officials Angela Merkel had been against the plan.
"Ukraina has given a new view to Russia's policy, and it threatens European security", reported the London Royal Services Institute director Michael Clarke Financial Times.
The country's members are in the first week, and the Military Union must publish their new preparation plan.
The main question of the plan is whether Nato can break the TAE agreement on normal weapons signed in 1990.
That is the Nato and Varsova Union, how they invest arms in the region between Atlantic and Ural Guards.
According to the Financial Times, the agreement will prevent new military aid in Eastern Europe and Baltic.
Russia residing its participation in the agreement in 2007, but the country was not mainly said of the agreement.
Because of the situation of the Ukrainian church, Nato considers whether the terms of the Agreement are still needed.
"Naton power resources must be in all countries that need power resources", said Mr Malcolm Rifkind Financial Times, President of the Security Committee of the British Parliament.

The guests made a treaty with their parents soon that he helps to take more time to guide us.
I agreed to share my father's whole car instead of having got my own car.
I'm going to fly the flights at the board.
By 17 years of age, Goodhmler received an aircraft book, and two years later, he switched a single Beechcraft machine to solve the world.
The young man studied in the MIT school was treated by the aircraft and made fuel shoes.
several hours in the above, he also mean that he needed additional care,
In practice, a lot of coffee and Oreos kitchens.
Boohmers say their eating several kitchens are complete during a long flight.
The flights were wonderful and horrible.
In other countries, a flight drivers did not have an adjustment for which they could have helped him to navigate around the aircraft.
I had no idea that the pillars were above the airport just a little higher than 45,000 roads higher and cut into the aircraft.
The Goodmother's airport was not pressed and there was no hair reserve, so he couldn't fly on the top of the pillars.
The number of fuel fuel machines should not be higher.
On the day of the conversation, the second young pilot, the 17-year-old Day Sulema died by his ships between Sama and Hawaii, a flight called Goodhmler for the most difficult part of his journey.
The goodamers fly from the same airport as Suleman, and it is thinking that the growth phase must be technically shocked for 16 hours’ flights.
In spite of risks and even high places, however, Goodhmler has been able to struggle and collect money from the ATK education through the Code.org website.
He's the co-coder, and he founded his own company for 12 years.
The goals of the good-modern will be shocked in the sky.
Well, it would be nice to make the next Apple, but let's see how it happens.
Good-moneys want to shoot up every case.
Get up to heaven and you can get something great.
The finding of a legal Francchise company is more difficult than you think
Lori Cœdès was inspired by his fans by Heather and Lori in Canada after the Canadian W-TV channel began to show the Cupcake Girls TV program in 2009.
It continued to be inspired until it was clear that one Franchise company was not appropriate.
"My Franchise company sit in his car and called me that hundreds of potential customers were ready to buy a coffee room outside the salesman, and he didn't make a situation," he says.
This happening opened my eyes, because it was a great shocked opportunity for us.
After the event, he decided to change the selection process of Francchise partners, starting to emphasize the leadership of the company instead of leverages.
"Another one can admire the conversation -- they know what I want to hear," he said, "more he had to have a hundred discussions on each 11-Francis move.
We start six weeks with sustainable education, but employees are fully different in their own employment environment, so the whole process is very difficult, and this is why education is important to us, firstly, to the property of the business culture.
The finding of the true Franchise company is essential to any small company's development.
The strong and honest leader can edit and grow an organization, while the director-in-law may re-examinately cause a hazardous threat to the undertakings.
"I thought that the Francchise company's search is like you had a traffee, but it doesn't like it anywhere, during the conversation you've got to make a lot to meet the other before marrying."
Instead, in the case of the Francchise partner, the contract is signed, the safety is obtained and the new sales will be built.
Attracting to a partnership before seeing how a person works is a huge step and a significant confidence.
The symbiotic relationship of the Franchise partners reminds the strong marriage, since they have common objectives, explains Lorraine McLachlan, President and Chairman of the Canadian Franchise Association (CFA).
This is why McLachlan also believed that the Francchise company should be careful in its choice of the future Francchise provider before it becomes so long-term partner.
"It's the same thinking as human relations: if my partner is already struggled with the treasure, imagine what he is in the marriage?" he says.
Both parties must also choose to care and assess the future contract partner and take attention to the smaller alarm marks on both sides.
McLachlan adds that the Francchise guests like Liechtenstein can learn about successes and errors, but first of all, those working as Francchise should be more careful in their choice of the first, most important partners.
The new Francchise partners shall, unfortunately, conclude the success of the master company, which challenges they had to face and what kind of arts the new Francchise company needs when addressing the same difficulties.
For the first time, firms working as Francchise may also request Francchise relief to create a profile based on the use of the sector.
McLachlan also recalls that the first time the employees as franchise and entrepreneurs have a lot of help on the CFA website lookforafranchise.ca.
However, the process is more easy than later, since Francchise advisers learn to assess the possible attempters better, but also because the first Francchise companies can provide advice and help in evaluation.
"The workshop of the first French partner helped Britain (Scudamore, 1-800-GOT-JUNK) to provide a significant role in this creation for business and Francis system", says Erik Church, O2E Brands, operative director of the company. O2E Brands belongs to mms of enterprises 1-800-GOT-JUNK?, You move Me and ROC 1 Day Painting.
Franchise companies helped Britain to create something he couldn't have created alone, so the first Francchise companies must choose this idea in mind.
Under Church there is 216 franchise enterprises that represent all three O2E bridges, and it is also a partner of the Toronton Francchise Company.
Chruch's method to find the right Francchise partner is simple.
"Only we use confidence is to ask, "Do I know this person with me the weekend of the grill party?" he says.
"If the answer to this question is 'n', you probably don't want to take a large part of your working day by searching for solutions with them to the largest business problems."
Furthermore, the Church notes that the O2E Brands company is a major part of the gratitude of its Francchise structure.
In the company organization, the leaders often see their own position as a shorter and less official in relation to the management, once again Francchise enterprises have a partnership with long-term objectives and are more compromising towards the success of the company.
"The Franchise partner has much more good sides compared to the traditional business building, but the partnership is also much more intensive," he says.
This has partnership, not the relationship with the Director and the local operational director.
This partnership is more difficult, but well handed it makes better results.
Railways are counting prices in the Northern United States
The transferred shipping has led to a significant rate of rail prices in the middle of the United States, weeks prior to the large system of transport under the new pressure.
Trade seals in North Dakota are offering farmers only $2.7 from bus - about $1.00 less than the costs of control - mostly because of the ability to ensure the use of bilateral transport instruments, trade and agricultural organizations that are receiving.
IN Raaka substances
The problems are the most current of Warren Buffet Berkshire Hathaway company in BNSF and Canadian Pacific Rating Company.
The controllers of the Railways of the Member State are organizing hearing about the problems of service.
The Northern Zone is intended to ensure the transport of agricultural products as far as they are far from the rail networks.
The slowest increased when a huge shock from 2013 followed a very cold wine that caused the slowness and decline of June.
Some farmers believe that the transport of raw oil was increased in North Dakotan Bakken's oil fluctuation system has been excluded from the transport of vessels, which does not consider its place in accordance with the rail companies.
According to the director of a international trade in grain, the costs of the sales and transferable sales of the goods have increased from zero to $2,000 to $3,000 per year.
Someone's got to pay the costs.
"This costs shall be paid to a farmer or a customer", says the director of the shipping company.
The Agricultural Agricultural Agency of the United States evaluates the growth of the North Dakota sodium powder in over the third and 16 percent of the skin skin.
Mr Randy Gordon, President of the National Grain and Feed Association (National Grain and Feed Association) said that "we are trying to start a new saddle clean table, or the sadour has been switched sufficient safeguarding and swimmingness is sold and moved.
But now we are starting late in June because of the recent service problems.
Railway company BNSF has assured its customers and supervisors that it treats the transports of this year in a fair manner.
John Miller, Chairman of the BNSF Agricultural Products, said that the company has decreased long-term transports (Customer Statuss, which have been delivering more than four days) from the beginning of April 16 500 to about two thousand.
"We've moved nearly from all the old hundreds that we intended to move," says Miller, "and I'm referring to the last hundred to the shoes.
However, the latest speed reported by the BNSF company was nine percent lower than in the last fourth year, which is marked on refrigeration.
Miller acknowledges that development is "not-powered" but noted that the company is the best to invest $5 billion in this year in order to improve all the transporting products, such as the ability to handle the coal capital.
Secondly, the speed of June of the Canadian Pacific Railway company suffered from problems is 11% less than last year, but clearly higher than the lowest speed of the initial year.
The Canadian Pacific Railway Corporation has stated to the Railway Monitor (Surface Transportation Board) that the changes made in the system of its shipping wages should be improved by processing transportation by 15 to 20 per cent in the future savings period.
"The enlargement plan of the Canadian Pacific Railway Corporation focuses on the continuing improvement of June speed and the effective use of June so that we can provide more fees every week," said the representative of the Railway Company.
Ukrainian crisis can solve NATO 'identificate crisis'
The leaders, diplomates and experts of the major countries have often been concerned about the future of NATO and whether the end of the NATO Afghan mission will also be finalized to the importance of NATO.
However, this concern is very premature, as appears in Wales' Cardiff at the NATO High Meeting on this week, which is part of 60 leaders, including President Barack Obama of the United States.
The list of political and diplomates does not have a challenge towards the world's crisis, even though the elimination of the Afghanian teams, which had previously been priority, is no longer the most important matter.
Instead, 28 of the State Union is necessary when Russia renewed in Ukraine, and this is a reasonable reminder that the threat of European self-defence is not necessarily part of the past.
The World Directors are looking for new ways of punishing Russia, but they will also be moved to the troops, promised more money to defence costs and re-interference to the defence cooperation.
If I think NATO is thanks to Vladimir Putin.
"The (NATO) looks for some of its purposes -- and because it was going to be a very important identity crisis", says Heather Conley, director of the European Programme for Strategic and International Studies.
The NATO has not only found a new purpose but has also been strengthened.
Obama has also added a new task to the list.
The President of the United States has promised to try to create a joint strategy for rapidly recommending the Islamic Government's militants in Iraq and Syria.
Official views say that the President will face significant challenges by trying to encourage the war against the military response of its partners, especially those who would exceed the border of Iraq from Syria.
However, President Obama has the pressures to demonstrate that he leads to the world to find a strategy that can be obtained by extreme Islamics, first to say directly that "we have no strategy."
Western experts have made careful expectations for the high-speaking gathering of the Ukrainian or Islamic Government at the centre of transits.
Additional stakeholders are designed to be the principal instrument of the event called the Ukrainian attack.
The European Union officials discussed this as a weekend, but cut the decision on the new commitments.
The United States noted that the states of Obama hoped that the main partners in the island of Islam are not necessarily members of the NATO.
It was not possible to prevail problems two years ago when the previous NATO Summit was held in Chicago, when the debate was ruled over the armies from Afghan.
Any years ago, Director Robert M. Gates used his last speaking position to say that the organization has reached a point of “common military impairment”.
The United States officials continued to choose that other States did not reach their financial objectives.
The NATO members agree to use two per cent of their gross population production in defence costs but only four Member States — Viro, Greece, Iso-Brittan and the United States — have achieved this goal last year.
But now the officers of the White House say that they have changed.
The NATO members are expected to sign an agreement in Cardiff which allows them to add their funding to the Defence Cooperation.
Detailed details have been discussed last week, but the White House has found that the company has real desires at this time in the notice of the Member States possible threats in their real way.
The Russian agreement "Defence exemptions are more important and more important than once after the end of the cold war", says Charles Kupchan, Director of the United States National Security Council.
We are so hopeful that we can achieve harmonity between 28 Member States.
Obama uses a large part of his way to strengthen its commitment to the defence community for the benefit of Russian neighbouring countries.
The President starts his third-day journey on a visit to Tallinna, Viro, where he meets Viron, Latvia and Lithuania leaders.
The NATO has turned its troops in Viro after Russia joined the Ukrainian Criminal Crime to be appointed this year, and the NATO's troops will be regularly rounded in Viro when the new preparation plan is introduced this week.
The plan is intended to reduce the time necessary for NATO to react to attacks in the border regions.
The plan consists of increasing air surveillance and other visible defence cooperation marks.
The small risk of NATO has been hidden in the case of NATO, which was to bear the basis of permanent supports for Eastern and Middle Europe as an explanation of friendship to Russia.
According to the officials, the new plan is not primarily a criminal agreement, but it may also be only a semantic difference, says a Western diplomate who did not want to be called publicly before official information.
The presence of NATO is likely to be described as long-term, not remaining, a diplomate said.
A powerful "tavisa" in the bridge. Does he use it to Ukraine?
The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, has one in his way with Ukrainian.
The Western and Ukraine have repeatedly remitted Putinia on the Forest-Ukrainian continental arms and on the shipment of Russian troops to the Ukrainian land.
That's why you're western, you've set the committees to Russia.
When the Ukrainian situation is broken, the Western countries are planned to make the stronger force against Russia.
However, Russia has a state card: the winter is coming and the Ukrainian capital energy source is Russia.
According to the American Authority, the primary energy sources of Ukraine are a gas (40 per cent) and carbon (28 per cent), Geyzar Gurbanov, which is in the Harvard university, are written according to the Business Inside.
When the winter comes to Ukraine in the next four months after the next month, and the hydrocarbons are located in the east of the conflict, the Ukrainians will remain in their homes when the gas supply from Russia is broken.
For this reason, if the rebellious ones fail to achieve their objective, Gazprom, Russian energy waste, it helps Putinia to win the war finally, Gurbanov writes.
Last year, half of the cattle used in Ukraine became from Russia.
Russia defeated the gas operations in Ukraine on 16 July because of the unpauted figures.
In the past month, Gazprom reported that the payment of the Ukrainian shipment was already awarded until 1 August 5,3 billion dollars (approximately 4 billion euros).
According to The New York Times, Putin commented the next winter:
I think that nobody thinks of it, except Russia, has said Putin.
It's always a way to facilitate the solution.
First of all, interrupting the interruption of hostilities and restructuring the necessary infrastructure.
In order to re-complete the resources, the necessary correction must be made to dwell for a long time.
Under business Inside, the Putin's comment can be concluded as a threat.
If the Ukrainian army does not go before the separations, Moscow can use a landgase weapons.
Aligned Newman Japan's holding company, Nomur noted in the last month that Russia’s talks on the lack of humanitarian matters and the possible planning of a new gas crisis in Ukraine would be possible in a few months if Russia can maintain separations until it was possible.
Moscow has already been reported that Ukraine must pay for future gas operations, unless any sector pays for the single bonds.
The EU is trying to consult the agreement which permits the continuation of fish imports temporaryly.
Last week, the Ukrainian Prime Minister, Arseni Jatsenjuk, said that Russia plans to stop the gas operations in the EU winter.
Afterwards, Aleksandr Novak, Russian Energy Minister, reported that the talks are unexpected.
According to him, Russia does everything to ensure that the gas is granted to the European countries.
Free Saudi blogri received 10 years of prison and thousands of rapanism
The Saudi Arab Court had to be enforced by a Liberal Free Saudi Liberals movement to Raif Badaw, a ten-year prison sentence in May.
The Court constitutes an additional punishment of thousands of raffinages and a million rear (approximately 2000,000 euros).
The court was found that he had established a website that would like to be established by Islam.
Judgment reported to AFP as a second founder of the AFP, Suad al-Shamari.
Badawi himself has been imprisoned since 2012.
Badawi was already sentenced in July 2013 to the seven years of prison and 600 ramps, but the sentence was chosen and was recovered again.
The court was also elected in May, noting its injustice also Amnesty International.
Madventures Riku Rantala Summit of Child in Afghanistan: "It was one of the other human attacks."
Madventures published a new book of Worldwide Exposure on all things today.
We asked Riku Rantal about the explanation of the future of the world and the differs of the Indian and Finnish culture.
The crime also tells us about the most significant human attack of his life.
The writer, supplier, Madventure's second part of the Riku Rantala is an urgent man.
Today, a new book has been published, a lephapicic last night with the United Nations, and a half-week begins in General Docventure's second production.
Together, she's drinking from the place to the other.
From the machine's morning TV to take the child to the daily house, and there's a week-end ball.
The aligned discussion is to be transferred to telephone discussions.
I don't know.
All the presses within him and Madventures in the other area, Tunna Milonoff had time to stop and write World Book, which is in the document of the copy of all.
What's it?
Oh, a lot of time promised.
The book addresses several themes, such as what is our future, why the other culture is worse than the other, why we are here and who we are really.
We've been in the discussions that we've done over the course of years.
There are experts as teachers as well as fighters in the book.
We actively worked a book about a year, Riku tells the phone to the IS.
You've found the book back to the time.
What's the main message of the work?
The need to know more about the world and the questions of the fathers is to support, since then we're going to be the best part of the world in this world.
On the other hand, the idea of the book is to be a good journey, but it is also the purpose of getting people to discuss and share thoughts.
The debate may lead even to its activities, Riku says.
KUVA: Pete Aarre-Ahti
One of your books is the future of the world.
How does that look?
We finally decided to conclude that human species are optimistic.
Despite the warming of the air and the earth on this moment, it must be believed that in some stage we make solutions to improve our situation.
The planet is an alcoholist.
First of all, it should be admitted that we have a problem, and then can happen a change, Riku philosophus.
Riku reports that some studies have been achieved by the western humanity in the 1970s towards the highest point of happiness.
Then we have not increased our happiness.
This can conclude that when money is sufficient and our basic needs are satisfied, we are happy.
The money doesn't make more happiness.
We want to raise people to discuss what is sufficient.
The use of our credit resources does not have enough expenditure, Riku says.
In your book, you'll also consider the differences in cultures.
How does the Indian man differ from the Finnish?
People are not just different from each other.
True posts of education, health care, and hygiene are different.
The main difference in culture is that the importance of the Community is much better in India as in bad.
When western countries have grown, people live more alone.
Remember, and it may lead to solitude and distress.
When we find an appropriate balance between society and solemnity, we would be able to be closer to time, Riku tells us.
The Rik has cut many different people around the world.
What is the pressure of human beings to be more painful than his mind?
It's involved my childhood, where I was with my family in the first grandfather on the outside.
We lived in India and Pakistan in the United Nations works of my father.
I was seven and two more little sisters were together.
My brother was just a baby, Riku.
I was home in Finland, and a lot of changes in the car.
We were driving the war in Afghanistan when there was a great number of refugees in the road.
That's where my age girl walked, putting my little sister in the shirt.
I was sit on a shock on the sea. I was in the hand of the cocktail.
We looked at this, Riku's described.
Yes, that age child will understand the situation.
It was one of the pregnant humans that I'll always remember.

Riku and Tuna in 2013.
Then the Riku "I'm in the face", that others must respect, although they were significantly poor or have no same conditions of life as we.
The crime already understood that money couldn't be a measure of human value.
You know, you're going to be able to remember you're in New Guinea.
I couldn't stop wondering how traditionally people live there.
They use natural materials to use all things, not just money or metal instruments.
They're living in a very delicate environment.
It's really bad to find out.
It's going to think about it.
And to think about him, he wants to get his new book also.
The idea is that our book would inspire people to read, look and listen more.
That is why people may act with a warm loneliness to the conversation or even if they have been cutting up, Riku shrinks.
It's reporting about the Kauhajoki newspaper.
The events went to move when the couple arrived on the line car, and they've got a taxi.
When the taxi went to move, a man on the shooting was shocked the taxi down some of the objects.
The driver rises out of the car, the same man as a passenger.
In the object, a man stripped a man’s walker in the head of a man, as well as his hands, and left out of the place.
The powder is a measuring wheel, a lythicsman of 170-175.
According to the newspaper, there was a young, swimming woman near the world.
We hope he's taking contact with the police.
The police also requests referendums from all those who may have made awareness of the event or the case.
In the mid-week, the pollution sat at 27.8 a.m. at 19.50 hours.
"My!" said the brain eternity - the first "Telepatic" message around the world through the net
The PLOS ONE Journal has published a article that has been able to first disclose the message directly in mind.
The first messages that were sent through the system were "hola" and "ayo", namely Spanish and Italian "me".
In the test arrangement, the electrical brain of the shipment of the shipping person is checked.
The employee was trained by the program to send requests by thinking about the hands or way of traffic.
The image of the path move was covered to zero, and the flow of the hands into the one.
This was sent to the receipt person through the net.
The respondent was caused by a magnificent stimulation of each one of the bits generated to the light source.
The respondent was taught to clarify the population as a message.
Scientists admit that there is still a study in the child, but believe that telepathical communication is a routine in the nearby humanity.
Packages - Points - Futureness of the Land
The EU is preparing new commitments against Russia.
The United States are also shutting their own sanctifications.
The committees have a political need.
It would be impossible that the EU and the United States would not react when Russia wared in Ukraine and developed Crime.
The international policy action follows the reaction, action to respond.
The test shows that all packages are played in a long time.
Iran has been encouraging to negotiate its nuclear programme in the past few years.
The South African Rotation Government sat for decades in the field, although the trade was prohibited by UN decisions.
Also, the Russians have been packed.
During the war, the Soviet Union could not take high electricity or military technology.
The Russian itself has set obstacles to the world's trade page.
The last time it was refrigerated in the trees.
It's clear that Russia's fleet doesn't get the shooting.
Russians have come to bad times and not to lose Violence's trade in panics.
When the EU intends to prohibit the import of vodka from Russia, it is nearly the matter.
The Russians turn their vodka's favorite.
The EU packs are also selective.
The Frenchs will be able to take Russian aircraft, but Finland cannot take milk.
The powder from Russia to Germany continues.
The largest coal for Russia does not have the end of import or vodka export.
The main problem is to be the limits of the financial sector.
They're just in the future.
The Russian State cannot operate on the international market.
It's supposed to cut the old legs, but it's hard to get a new.
Even though Russia has powerful reserves, they will not endure everlasting.
The confidence of Russian enterprises is slow and the money is slow.
My banks are not able to finance all of them.
The money must be more pressed or enterprises shall make payment duties.
Concursions are competitive in Russia, Russia is a capitalist country.
If the crisis continues for years, Russia's modernization stops, such as Russian advisor Rene Nyberg wrote in Helsinki's words.
It wouldn't be the first time.
In the meantime, Russia would return to Russia once again and shoot into the back.
A exceptional freepain event was organized in North Korea
About 100,000 North Koreans, as well as a group of diplomates followed internationally organized internationally on Sunday in Pjongang.
From the lawyer, the Japanese Antonio Inoki, who has moved freely to organize a event, has taken part of the pressures from Japan, the United States, China, France, Brazil and Mexico.
In addition to free-care negotiations, local sports were also observed.
In other words, the event was the goal of approaching rigid states and promoting world peace through sport.
The politicians hoped that the improvement between North Korea and Japan will be improved.
Japan was deleted in summer the committees which had been imposed to North Korea in the 1970s and 1980s as a result of Japan's exemptions.
Instead, North Korea has promised to reopen the investigation of these cases.
In the past, international free pressures were seen in North Korea in 1995.
The SOK reduces about 110 people from the organization of the use of goods.
The negotiations began in June, at least 130 levels were evaluated.
The company believes that its organization has now been covered by key activities and responsibilities areas.
The SOK is clearly informed about the improved cost efficiency and synergie between different areas.
In addition to the cost of the economy and the cost of the consumption, the structure change of the trade has, in particular, been raised in the market for use.
The outcome of the S-group's use-going market has already been lost in a while.

Turum statements: Get some of self-medication products behind the tissue
According to the newspaper, there are additional medicinal products that are not receipt, but only after the advice of the employee, between receptors and disadvantaged products.
According to the Finnish Farmasial Unit, for example, antibiotic antibiotics could be in the area of the advice.
After the pharmaceutical or the prosecutor’s discussion and the pre-determined criteria, the medicine should also be granted in the course of the opinion of the President Kirsi Kvarnström Turu.
Finnish has already been available without any receptor, but it is necessary for advisory medicine.
One such is a subsequent preparation.
Corruption for more accurate reasons
Finnish takes more attention to the fight against corruption.
This is recommended as OECD and the European Council, as the lowestness of donations and imports in Finland is surprising in the world.
The Working Group of the Ministry of Justice was discussed until the end of the year, whether the laws of crime would need to deal with the trafficking of the power and wrongdoing.
For example, the differences in the legislation increased in the judicial processing of the Slovenian hair in Hameenline a year ago.
In Slovenia, the commercialisation of the effects power took two years to the former Prime Minister of prison, but the Finnish law does not feel the relevant name of criminality.
The co-operation network against corruption has intensified its cooperation as required by the Government.
The card stated that the gift is not just investigated in Finland.
The Ministry of Justice has now been at the University of Vasa and a copy of the Police High School for Corruption in different areas.

Wanderers trainer Tony Popovic believes that he receives a strike in Asia Champions League in Korea
Tony Popovic misses three key players in Korea.
Multi Western Sydney Wanderers' team players are in the first battle in the game, and not trainer Tony Popovic tried to throw other players Asia Champions League in the FC Seoul fight.
The Wanderers are in Duba on 10th day practice, which also includes two friendship negotiations in Abu Dhab, so that the team may be prepared for the first semi-final debate on September 17th.
As a result of the excessive cards of Tomi Juric, Brendan Santalab and Shannon Cole, the trainer Popovic believes in their wives.
"That's certainly this is a loss – they've been three very important players in the ACL," Popovic says.
Tomi Juric came to China's game language from this one.
It's the back, one of the players should not be removed, but we had no Mattya (Spirenvic) in the first game, and since this time Daniel Mulle has been hurted.
Everyone's going to the place, he's sure he's done a lot of work, and I'm fully trusting in the whole team.
I'm not afraid to play anyone against the semi-final.
The Wanderers must also be without Spirranvice, which continues to be covered.
The Soceroo's defender has been assaulted before the beginning of the years, but has continued to walk, and it is possible that he plays backwards in Pirtek stadium on 1 October.
"He's back in the shooting, and he's gonna be fine," Popovic says.
He follows his own practice program and goes with us to Duba, which is a wonderful news to him, because it means, at least, return to the field.
He's already done a few times out there, that's good.
It's gonna take some time before she's completely okay, but she's gonna get fine.
Dubaissa the Wanderers team has been using the world’s higher representations in Al Sheba Sports Complex.
Popovic believes that the trip to Duba is also a good opportunity to meet each other better after the end of the last few years.
"We know that this helps players certainly create websites," Popovic says.
We have a lot of new players, and this is an excellent opportunity to meet each other even better in the field and outside.
So we use the park for many purposes.

Ormiston House: Stormontin Council hopes for sale
The Stormont Council is hopeless that it has found a buyer to the House of Ormiston, a building located in Belfast, which has estimated about 30,000 pounds per week to the taxpayers.
The Council purchased a building from the 1800s in the east 13 years ago, as a result of nine million pounds.
The Council has not yet been able to sell the building, where the safety and care of the building came to pay to the Council about 400 pounds a day.
The structure was sold by 1.250 million rods.
The structure will apparently be used as a private housing building.
The Council purchased its historical value in the 9 million red building, as it needed more office status.
However, later it was said that the construction was not applicable to this use.
After ten years of purchase of the building, it was resetted to the price of 2,5 million tonnes this time.
The structure couldn't be sold and the price was calculated.
Last year, Mike Nesbitt, the Ulster Unionist Party, proposed that Ormiston House may agree to the new international trauma.
However, now the Council has confirmed that it will be negotiations on the sale of the building.
The supplier says that the construction is transferred to the new owner when the papers are made a decision.
The Council and the counterparty remain quiet about the personality and sales of the buyer.
The weekly security and correction costs of the Ormistom House are about 3,000 pounds.
The Council purchased a building from the police fleet, which was before the Policing Board of Northern Ireland.
The safety costs of Ormiston House since the beginning of this year were totally 885 641 pounds and carriages 371.379 pounds.
The price of professional services related to the correction and care was 250 015 puncs, and the professional payments of development and planning were 212.466 pounds.
The structure was previously owned by Sir Edward Harland, who lived in the building until 1887, where he purchased the Harland’s business partner William Pirrie. Pirry later became the President of the Harland & Wolf Company.
Soon after Lord Pirries died, 1924 from Harland & Wolf Company became a owner of the building.
"Equity grows": Helsinki intends to reduce school students
I'm not going to get up to the age, and I say JHL.
In Helsinki, the number of school assistants is prepared for radical reduction.
The deficiency is not a child's personal helper.
The Helsinki School ended with a smooth exhibition of about 2,7 million cards of school assistants.
There's some 600 school assistants in Helsinki.
If the restraints are achieved, they will be in force immediately from the beginning of the year.
According to JHL, a decision increases the difference.
In fact, more children are able to support learning.
However, the assistant has to be chosen to reduce the resettlement because the number of aid granted to learn has not been clearly defined in the laws.
The situation is not due to the birth, but the work of the learning person is increasing.
The expenditure of schools causes a higher risk of slowing learning goals and expansion of teachers, highlighting the JHL's official director Upive Niemi-Lain.
The plans of the city Helsinki are different from schools, since in future resources small schools and supporting students no longer receive helpers.
The target of the city of Helsinki is to prevent the exclusion.
A pre-award work is just a school assistant.
However, the Agency's approximation measures have been planned in greater terms to this group.
All the parties are suffering in this way.
The Final Resources make Helsinki's government, which I hope to see and be wise to see the long future and act in accordance with its objectives, states Niemi-Laine.
Israel will rule the land in the Western
The Israelite women walk in the Jewish village of Ettio near Bethlehem.
Israel reigned Sunday about 400 hectares of the Jewish area near Bethlehem, which may be a sign of the future building of Israel in the future, and threatening the request of the Palestinians to build increased residences and threatening the general opinion of the world.
The Israeli "Peace Now" group, which opposed the expansion of the peoples of Western America, was the view that the events of Sunday could be the largest individual control of the country in the Western Arab region for decades and could "new dramatically the situation of the region".
The goal of Palestinians is to establish their own states in which Israel ruled in 1967.
According to the Israeli authorities, a political chimney to evaluate the situation of land areas became after three Israeli young people were disappointed and killed in June in their lifth area.
In July, the Israeli authorities arrested a Palestinian who was sentenced to be the principal of the struggles and murder.
The ruling of the land will understand that it was intended to be a good habitation for the population and the punishment of the Palestinians.
In the midst of the Jewish Gevaot residence in the region of South Jerusalem, the land is now officially proclaimed as the country of the State, when it was before the Palestinian private context. This was the necessary step to Israel, when he wanted, to start planning buildings in the region.
However, Ahmad Lafi, embassy in the Middle East of Palestinian city, said that the land belongs to the Palestinian families.
He told the Palestinian official news office WAFA that the Israeli army and its staff were published on Sunday in which Israel reported its powerful Surife and neighbor Al-Jaba and Wadi Fukin’s olive and other lands that were farmed in the trees of the trees.
The possible answers should be presented within 45 days.
The young enemy of the Israelite army was to execute the west-west Gaza’s dominant Islamic group against Hamiah, whose Israel had spoken behind the slaughter.
The following shocks on the border of Israel and Gaza slaughtered the war over 50 days, which ended last week in Egypt to shoot.
The governance of the country has quickly focused on the Israeli government in Western and revealed the conflicting objectives of the Israeli government that have affected the increased development of the peace process of Israel and Palestinian.
Child crisis is usually multi-only
The larger part of the Lap is in the problem, it appears in the study of the Lapin University and the Lap Lap High School of Auditors.
There are no rapid solutions to crisis problems.
According to the professor, the reduction in the tasks of the competitors in billions of euros is not sufficient.
The common dimensions of crisis are, otherwise, weak nationality, bad employment and changes.
According to Asko Suikosen, the social professor of the University of Children has come from the western border and the East Lap.
In the study question, the populations evaluate their potential situation, especially realisticly.
In the study, the populations of the very well-believing people had even seen pessimism.
Slow expectations affect the consumption.
People hope that the present arch and welfare will remain, perhaps even a little better.
At this time, it is not difficult to think about more timely investment, such as buying a housing, says Skicken.
The investigator's team surprised the great differences between the committees.
For example, the expenditure of the income income varies from a percentage of more than a hundred euros.
The tax income from the residence item changes from two thousand euros from Ranua to 4400 euros.
I'm saying that the Lap's gratitudes are different.
How much the money is used, how much state claims and what is the time of debt, is to differ, even though in the same situations, he says.

Bob Carr welcomes the Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor immediately released from libyala prison
Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor is expected to be free from a libanese prison today.
The member government welcomed the news that the Libyan authorities are expected to be freed by Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor today.
The representative of the Foreign Minister, Bob Carr, said that "all is good" and the lawyers of the International Criminal Court are released to the Australian authorities tomorrow, and afterwards he slows to a flight in Europe until the middle night.
"We are happy of the news that it may probably be released today," commented the representative of the AAP News Office from New York.
We thank the Libyan authorities for cooperation.
Australia also thanks for the international aid and support, said the representative.
Taylor probably fly to Rome before he continues to his home to Haag.
Taylor and his three lawyers of the Criminal Court of Justice were arrested in the Libyan city of Zinta, on 7 June, when they were representative of Seif al-Islam, the former dictator of Libya, Muammar Gaddaph.
According to the Libyan authorities, Taylor took the papers to Seif, which they think were threatening national security.
Senator Carr has seen a lot of challenges to release Taylor, and he traveled in Libya's capital in the last month to start this matter.
Taylor couldn't talk to her husband or little daughter last week.
According to Senator Carrin, Taylor was allowed to call a short call home to Haag soon after the Australian largest visit.
Carr also spoke with John and Jane’s parents who lived in Brisbane, who were easy to hear that Taylor was finally given to use the phone.
Taylor’s parents had brought Libya’s daughter free before this small child’s third birthday in July.
Third other arrested Criminal Court lawyers are from Libanon, Russia and Spain.
Carr told a week ago that the discussion between a lawyer and the Libyan authorities had been conducted in Hague as a result of the debate “the lawyer of the Court of Justice was regretted and asked for forgiveness.”
The International Criminal Court has not spoken of errors, but has been able to investigate its team's actions basically when the members returned to their home.
"Audience concluded by the International Criminal Court shall ensure that all those who have been wrong acts will be judged in question", reported the Court in the last month.
The International Criminal Court requires a court for 39 years of age Seif al-Islam against humanity during his father's government period, which has been surprised last year.
According to Tripoli, his court should be local and made an initiation on 1 May in which it stated that the lawyer of the Criminal Court did not hold the court in Hague.

Blue blue to the head of the Villarreal garage in Sergio Asenjo, until 82 minutes finally successful.
Instead of winning, a 19-year-old man, his first attacker in La Liga, Sandro Ramirez came to the field only 12 minutes ago.

The recruitments to the Ferguson police were secretly completed after the expansion of $433,000.
Administrators closed two online collection sites without explaining this weekend of the sites collected for more than $4000,000 to the police who shot the 18-year-old age in Ferguson, Missouri State.
The large public opened on the GoFundMe-Hyperity website, two individual pages that canceled similar names – "Support Officer Darren Wilson" and "Support Officer Wilson" – have collected $235,750 and $197,620 for the Fergusonian police, who shot Michael Brown.
The same site, which was managed by the lawyer of the Brown family, was $314.0099 after Sunday.
For many weeks, the slaughter followed the disappointment and the impatience of the shooting of the blacks against the nearly white police forces, and it imposed Wilson's hidden while in local and alliance studies, it tried to decide whether he shot Brown without reason.
The assembly campaigns of the network have generated a defence of Wilson, especially after some visitors had written racist comments on the part of the comments that have therefore been removed.
The two pages apparently declined to take the great degree of gifts at the same time on Sunday, and the managers of the sites did not give this reason.
When trying to give a gift on the page, he sees a message that is said "Don't take anymore!
The organizer has cut off the assembly of gifts.
The representative of the GoFundMe website gave the Los Angeles Times Sunday information that has not been prevented of giving gifts.
"All organizer of the GoFundMe campaign decides whenever you want to stop receiving gifts," the representative of the GoFundMe website Kelsea Little said when he was informed.
Orders may also continue receiving donations later.
The "Support Officer Wilson" page of which the product was $197,620, managing St. Louis's police-composed integrity group Shelf of Hope, who is the recipient of the donations approved by the GoFundMe page.
The official representatives of the State of Hope, Joseph Eagan, Timothy Zoll and Jeffrey Roorda, have not responded immediately to electrical posts requesting additional information on the collection campaign.
Zoll is the official reporter of the Furguson police office, Eagan is a member of the City Delegation of Florant and the member of the Roorda Missour's representative room.
The Times magazine also did not have immediately contact with the "Support Officer Darren Wilson" page, which is using the name "Stand Up" and has collected $235.750.
However, the representative of the GoFundMe website convinced the Times magazine that there was a good name.
Only few information from the unnome good operator of the assembly has been given to the donors, other than the owners of the other web page of Wilson or the Brown shipping website.
Unnamed Wilson’s good website wrote to visitors a message two weeks ago, which indicates that the page makes cooperation with the Shelf of Hope Group to be officially accepted as a recipient of donations.
The approval has not yet been accepted.
The welcomer gave additional information to the Gmail email address that would like visitors, but did not immediately respond to the request on Sunday.
The representative of the GoFundMe page said to the Times magazine that the collection site has been removed from the results of the access page and adds that "the Chinese campaign does not fill the requirements reported by the GoFundMe page, which should be used to have an active Facebook account."
GoFundMe Information Security Practices are encouraged by users to "stop only GoFundMe users that they personally know and to whom they trust".
Unfortunately, there is no satisfaction that the content of the collection page published at the GoFundMe page is worthy and honest.
The Chairman Little said, however, "GoFundMe has been linked to the organizer of the campaign, and there is no reason for doubting his honestity.
GoFundMe is also able to arrest all collected funds if there is a need to start research.
Nevertheless, GoFundMe has not considered the subject to arrest the funds collected by that campaign.
The recommended Facebook page "Support Officer Wilson", which has organized Wilson's supporting campaigns, told the following weekends that lawyers tried to find a "require", why the donors of the GoFundMe website have been presented to give a gift, but the page did not give any further information.
The Facebook page also has an unnamed manager, and the independent source has not been able to confirm these comments.
